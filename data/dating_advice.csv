1343883373.0,279,self.dating_advice,xjr4k,"After reading some of the same stuff over and over, here's my 10 rules for girls that want to date and find ""The One.""",329,50,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xjr4k/after_reading_some_of_the_same_stuff_over_and/,"Okay, so I'm a fairly reasonable guy who's been on a few dates or, at least, enough dates to have formed some opinions about just what it is that women are doing wrong out there.   I currently have a wife (who I think is hot) who has plenty of single friends (who most guys think are hot) and most of those friends just want Mr. Right.  So, why don't they have them?  Here are my Top 10 things that girls, in general, need to get their shit together on if they want that special someone.  The other option is that, maybe, you already have that special someone and want to keep the magic going.  Here's some tough love for you:

*10.  Forget about what you don't have, own what you have*

Every woman has something absolutely fucking spectacular about themselves, yet they bitch and moan about how their ass is too flat or their boobs are too small or their nose just isn't right.  Even if you get plastic surgery, you're not going to have everything perfect on you.  Even Megan Fox has that thumb thing going on.  Maybe you got some rockin' legs, great boobs, gorgeous eyes, or luscious, full lips.  You've probably been complemented on *something* about yourself.  Run with it.  Show it off.  Own it.  If you own what you do have, it'll become even sexier to me.  You can't change what you don't have, so stop whining about and work with what you have.  No one likes a whiner.  

*9. Stop telling me what you don't have*

This is especially true if you're already in a relationship.  Hey, I'm talking to you and I think you're cute for some reason, why the fuck would you keep telling me about how big you think your thighs are?  I wasn't even considering your thighs because I'm so in to how you kiss and turn a phrase but if you keep talking about your damned thighs, I'll start thinking about them, too.  Why the hell would you want that?  If you absolutely must think about what's wrong with you, keep it to yourself because I think you're perfect.

*8. Stop making me look like an asshole and take a compliment*

If I give you a compliment on your dress and your response is ""Ugh, I look so fat in it"" then you've done two things:  1) You've taken a perfectly good compliment and trashed it and 2) You've made me look like I don't know what I'm talking about and I clearly must be stupid to think that you look good in that dress.  If a guy compliments you, the correct answer is, ""Thank you!  That means a lot!""  If all you can eke out is ""Thanks,"" then that's fine, too.  

*7. Stop asking for the truth so damn much*

Hey, we're going to tell you the truth on the important stuff.  If there's a bill that needs to be paid and we're running short on money, we'll let you know.  Let me ask you this, though, what the hell is so great about the truth?  We all have our ugly moments, we don't need to shine a spotlight on them.  Let's go back to the dress analogy.  If you ask me if a dress you have still looks good on you, I'm going to say, ""Hell yes.""  You already *know* if I'm lying or not, so at least you know I care enough to lie to you.  

*6. Date some jerks, then stop dating jerks*

Dating morons is the key component of your late teens and 20's.  It's an important part of dating because it helps you figure out what you want, what you can tolerate, and what you can't tolerate.  If you're older than that and you're still dating jerks, then just admit that you like jerks.  There are lots of nice guys out there waiting for a girl who wants to date them.  Yeah, they don't have the bite that dating a jerk has, but you're not 14 anymore.  Grow up.  

*5.  Girls who fake orgasms deserve to have to fake orgasms*

If you're dating nice guys (you are now, right?  Rule #6 says so) then you need to understand how important it is that we want to please you.  Let us know what you want and you're damned skippy that we'll do it.  Expecting us to just *know* is a recipe for failure.  You have to communicate it to us and we'll get it done.  Oh, by the way, we know when you're faking an orgasm.  I know you think you're such a great actress but, we get it.  We're not going to point it out if you fake it.  You obviously want to be done with the whole thing and we're not going to drag it out.   Sure, every once in a while, you just want to be done, but if this is a regular thing, you need to figure out what the problem is and let us know.

*4.  Hollywood has screwed you, let it go*

You've been told that you could be a hooker and a millionaire will come along and fall in love with you and you both will spend the rest of your lives having happy moments on the grass in the park.  You don't want someone to sweep you off your feet, anyway.  You want someone who's going to walk alongside you and make amusing comments about the whole thing.  Have realistic expectations and realistic, wonderful things will happen.  

*3.  Watch actions, not words*

Words are awesome.  I can use them to talk the panties off a girl faster than a Redditor gets corrected for the proper usage of ""your.""  It's true, I'm no angel.  However, if you find a guy who is using all the right words, then it might be that words are the only thing that he  cares to give you.  Words won't make you honey tea at 4 in the morning because you can't sleep.  Watch what he does and make your decision on his actions.  Not only do they speak louder than words, actions will make you happier than any words ever said.  

*2.  Are you Ms. Right?*

You say no one wants to commit to you but have you ever thought about what you're asking us to commit to?  No one wants to buy a lemon.  If your sole hobby is the ability to post on Reddit and spruce up your Facebook timeline, then you might want to figure some shit out.  Hey, if we find an intelligent, attractive, fun woman, we're going to commit to her.  Don't be mad at us if we're occupying ourselves with some distractions until she comes along.  

*1. Give us a break*

It seems that our entire society has devolved in to pointing the finger.  Republicans are at fault for this.  Democrats for something else.  Men are evil.  Women are bitches.  You already know that no one wins at the blame game, so why are you playing it?  We're both of the same species, even though some women I know think men evolved from some type of mold, so maybe you can relax a bit and not point out every faux pas you come across.  We all have cracks in our armor and don't need someone banging on them with a hammer.  Wouldn't you rather have someone to love than to blame?

Is this list perfect?  Nope.  There are exceptions, additions, and subtractions but, if you follow these, you'll be a lot farther ahead than most people who have to figure it out later in life (and some of those who never figure it out).

If this gets enough upvotes, I'll do 10 rules for guys.  They got some shit to work on, too.  ",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_xjr4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xjr4k/after_reading_some_of_the_same_stuff_over_and/,

1333483307.0,173,self.dating_advice,rrnv7,Some advice to all nice guys out there.,196,23,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rrnv7/some_advice_to_all_nice_guys_out_there/,"As a fellow nice guy, 24, I'd like to say something..

The true meaning of friendzone has been bastardized severely here on Reddit. Being friendzoned is when a girl uses you to cover her insecurities. She'll use you for emotional, and sometime financial support. She'll use the idea of you two dating to keep you around so she can leech what she needs off of you but not committing to you just in case Mr. Right comes a long. 

When you pursue a girl and she doesn't reciprocate, you weren't friendzoned. She just wasn't interested. Simple as that. 

Imagine a scenario for me. What if a girl (or even a guy) came on to you, but you weren't interested in them. she seems nice, but you know what you want and she isn't it. You wouldn't want to lead her on because you're a nice guy and that wouldn't be right. It's the same way for women. 

You can't really help what you're attracted to, and probably won't change if the girl kept pursuing you. Unfortunately with guys, if they aren't flat out rejected, guys tend to get optimistic and try to progress things. It's just less painful for both parties to cut off contact. 

You can't approach women thinking, ""How can I make her like me?"" Which is exactly what you're saying when you are trying not to be friendzoned. You have to look at it as, ""Is she right for me?"" 

Yes, there are plenty of attractive women out there, but do you look at every single one and know that they are right for you? I doubt it. You can't try to make them like you; you'll drive yourself crazy. You just have to put yourself out there and see if you can't find someone who likes you. 

It's hard, I know. I've been going through the same thing. But I'm assuming you are looking for a long term relationship and you don't want to force anything otherwise you'll both end up unhappy. 

I tried dating a girl in one of my classes about two years ago (a little while before I started dating my most recent ex), we had great chemistry and everything, hung out all the time flirted a lot, but when it came down to it, she just couldn't. I wasn't her type. She's was attracted to tall husky guys (I'm short and skinny) and it's what she liked. Did I hold it against her? Maybe for a week, but almost two years later, we're still great friends today.

She helped me realize that it's not about making it work with the next girl you meet. It's just about seeing if you two are right for each other.

I've been in 3 LTRs in the past 6 years all of which were longer than a year. So as a nice guy, you can date worthwhile women. You just have to work harder than the predatory guy. 

Yeah, predatory guys get more action, but I hate advocating predatory behaviors to pick up women. There are girls out there who like nice guys. If you go over to [/r/seduction](/r/seduction), what are they constantly talking about? Most of them are just writing field reports about their humps and dumps. There are a few guys that are looking for more over there, and there is some helpful advice, but the women they are seeking usually don't go for nice guys. I know I look for a relationship as opposed to just sex when I approach a girl.

Unfortunately, you do have put yourself out there and face ""rejection"". Yes, it sucks and it's a huge blow to the ego, but if you look at it as ""we just weren't right for each other"" you'll be much better off. A relationship is between two people. You wouldn't want to be with someone you weren't happy with, and you shouldn't blame women for doing the same. 

Dating can be a terrifying concept. You just have to accept that you're not going to succeed most of the time. I know I can't brag about a phenomenal success rate, but the past three relationships I had were good. Yes, they had their ups and downs, and break ups are never fun, but you can't let that stop you either.  

All you can really work on is just being more confident (I know, it's not easy) and being who you are when you approach a girl. Don't force things, even if you feel you're in love with the girl. Respect her as you would have people respect you. You can't get too worked up over one girl either. Again, you're just seeing if she's right for you, not if you can't force things to work.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_rrnv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rrnv7/some_advice_to_all_nice_guys_out_there/,
1344893819.0,145,self.dating_advice,y5zw6,"To all the ""nice guys"" who can't figure out why girls aren't attracted to them...",182,37,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/y5zw6/to_all_the_nice_guys_who_cant_figure_out_why/,"Ok, I'm going to talk about personal experience and from learned techniques. Now just because this has worked for me (and it isn't fool-proof), doesn't mean it will work for every woman, every woman is different. Firstly, I consider the term ""nice guy"" kind of loose ended. I consider myself a nice guy and a lot of people think you have to be a dick to get the girl. You don't. You just have to learn how to attract them. Women can't just make themselves attracted to you by sheer will power they have to FEEL it, (I wish it was the other way around it'd be a lot easier yeah?), unlike most of us males, we are immediately attracted to a woman's looks and that's where our attraction comes from. Now most guys would be up for sleeping with their female friends, but most females wouldn't be up for sleeping with their male friends. 

Women are attracted to personality and character and who you are as a person, and sure looks are important but it isn't the MOST important thing to a woman (ever notice how some average looking guys have breathtaking girlfriends?). 

Now, here's where most ""nice guys"" go wrong (and keep in mind this used to be me) they try to MAKE the girl they're interested in, like them. They'll buy this girl gifts, buy her drinks, give her compliments non stop etc... It is totally fine to give your woman compliments, but there comes a point when too much is too much and it just doesn't have meaning anymore. When a woman asks what they'd like to do most guys respond, ""Whatever you want to do."" They're always available for this woman, they'll bend over backwards for her and then they wonder why she doesn't like them. A woman needs a MAN not a BOY.

When you're talking to a woman instead of saying, ""Hey what are you up to do you wanna come swim?"", say ""Hey we should go swimming what time works best for you?"", it comes off as confident. Now obviously your woman has ideas or plans of what she wants to do for the night. ALWAYS listen to your lady and what she wants also, don't be the one making plans all the time. When you're getting a woman's number most guys (including myself I've done this) would say ""Hey can I have your number?"" This is great if you're trying to make a friend, not if you're trying to date this woman, it'll come off as needy. You say, ""I've had a great time with you I have got to get your number so we can set up a date sometime this week."" Most guys think it'd be weird to talk about the date part, it isn't it's exactly what you want isn't it? And if she isn't interested then you save yourself a whole lot of time and anguish by knowing right away you don't have waste your time on her.

 This will be the last thing, when you text a woman, don't text her, ""Hey"", or ""Hey what are you up to?"" Again this is good for friends but it's obvious you were thinking about her before you texted her and you're just trying to build rapport, there isn't any chase in that, you've given her total control over the conversation. Be short and concise in your messages and don't text her just to text, text with a meaning. Text her if you want to meet up with her or even in some cases plan a date, if you just wanna talk with her just call her. It'll come off as more confident. 

There will be more to come if you all liked this, or you can just message me (if you're allowed to do that on reddit?) if you want some personal advice or tips.

1320424206.0,137,self.dating_advice,m0fg5,The Cheeseburger Theory,154,17,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/m0fg5/the_cheeseburger_theory/,"I responded to a post the other day about this and decided to share it with a wider audience.  This theory has helped me more than any advice I have ever gotten when it comes to dealing with females.  First off, I am not the one who came up with the Cheeseburger Theory.  I really wish I could remember who it was as he also had a Banana/Gorilla Theory which was also really good.  I may go into that at some point over at /r/relationships but I digress.  Let me see if I can form this into a coherent post.

Some notes: A girl is a girl and a boy is a boy.  I'm writing this, and I'm a man, so I'm going to be using the word 'girl'.  Not sure if this works for girls too, but that's outside of the scope of this post.  Also girls are girls until they prove they are women, and boys are boys until they prove they are men.  Got it?  Ok, let's begin.
---------------

She's a girl.  You like her.  You want to talk to her.  You've already fucked up.  

What?  Yes, you're already obsessing about talking to her.  You've made shit into a BIG DEAL.  This means you're done.  You can still try, and you may succeed, but this is unlikely.  

Why do douchebags always seem to have girls, but you don't?  Because they don't give two shits and talk to as many girls as it takes.  To them, it's not a BIG DEAL.

If you called one of your buddies and asked if he wanted to hang out on Sunday but he said he was going to Bed Bath and Beyond to pick out curtains with his woman, would you be posting how upset you were about it to Reddit?  No, because it's not a BIG DEAL.

You like girls.  You also like cheeseburgers. You want them both. There are billions of both out there.  Like girls, cheeseburgers come in many shapes, sizes, on different plates, with different toppings.  The majority of either are going to be satisfying, though some may leave you feeling like you are missing something... so if it were a cheeseburger, you'd try something else, right?

Another scenario.  There is a large platter of cheeseburgers laid out before you and 100 other dudes, and you picked out the one you wanted... but some other dude got there first, you wouldn't cry about it or try to fight him for it, you'd just look around and grab another cheeseburger. You'd likely enjoy that second cheeseburger you grabbed. The next day you wouldn't even remember the first cheeseburger.

So... why cheeseburgers?  Cheeseburgers aren't a BIG DEAL.  They are plentiful.  Girls should also not be a BIG DEAL.  They are plentiful.

All this being said, there comes a point to where you shouldn't treat a girl like a cheeseburger anymore... when your relationship becomes a BIG DEAL.  This is ok as if your relationship isn't a BIG DEAL then it is worthless.  This is when your girl becomes your woman.

A few thoughts on WHY this works.  First off, if you treat a girl like a BIG DEAL you're going to be nervous.  Nervousness shows that you are not confident.  Confidence is the NUMBER ONE thing that is attractive to either sex.  Secondly, your goal when approaching a girl is to find her inner beauty.  Who is she as a person?  Is she crazy?  Would you actually like to spend time with her?  She's not the only one doing evaluation here.  You shouldn't be asking yourself if she would reject you, you should approach it as ""I'm going to find out if she is worth my time.""

TLDR: Disregard females, acquire cheeseburgers.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_m0fg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/m0fg5/the_cheeseburger_theory/,
1324060561.0,115,self.dating_advice,nff8p,I had a dating revelation. I can't believe it took me so long.,133,18,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/nff8p/i_had_a_dating_revelation_i_cant_believe_it_took/,"I've sort of had a revelation, though for most people this may just be common sense. However, if there are others out there who may be like me, then this may be something worth sharing.

My dating experience has been a disaster. When I have liked a guy in the past I would suddenly lose all of my self-confidence. I let the guy drive the relationship because I didn't want to seem needy. So he set the dates, he made the moves, and I would sit around anxiously always waiting for that next call. Sometimes it would come and sometimes it wouldn't. The waiting around and wanting to not seem needy was driving me crazy. I'm sure I probably reeked of desperation, though I was trying desperately to hide it.

And then one day I just said screw it. If showing interest in someone comes off as needy, well then that just isn't the right guy for me. I WANT to be enthusiastic when I like a guy. Why should I try to suppress that when that's authentically who I am? 

So I decided to call a guy when I wanted to talk to him rather than sitting around waiting for him to call me. Suddenly I was no longer chained to the phone, looking, hoping and waiting. 

If I wanted to see a guy, I'd ask him out. No more dropping plans at the last minute because a guy I liked wanted to get together. Suddenly my time was my time and I felt like I had control over what happened and when.

This did scare off some guys, but when that happened it didn't sting as much because I knew those guys weren't the right fit for me. I know that I want to find someone who matches my enthusiasm. I want someone that wants to talk to me every day, that wants to see me and that isn't scared by a girl that can be aggressive.

And it turns out I found the RIGHT guy by doing this. And I think I found him because I was suddenly comfortable to just be myself.

So ladies (and gentlemen) it's ok to be yourself! Stop sitting around waiting for things to happen in your life. Make things happen! Life is too short for that shit.

after 4 months of dealing with her and this guy who she was not serious about... we started dating.  it was all good, but deep down, i never forgave myself or her for that time before we were dating.  add in the fact that i simply didn't trust her, and we were heading for a rocky path.  but we were best friends first, and became passionate lovers, so i thought it wouldn't be hard to work through anything.

it was great for a long while.  i grew close to her family and she kinda to mine... (i am pretty distant).  because of how good things were, we rushed into moving in together.  never a good idea.  the thing is, i had all the signs that the relationship was going down, but kept pushing further.  

by the end of the year lease, we were barely talking.  she told people she worked with that we had broken up, and when a coworker of hers asked me about this, she exploded at the girl, telling her to ""stay away from her boyfriend.""  

finally, after several fights post moving out of our place, i wrote her a letter recommending her to break up with me because i couldn't.  of course after really breaking up, we tried being friends with benefits, but that never works.  we stopped really talking until last new years.  i was with my friends at a local club, when she shows up.  i drunkenly tried to kiss her, only to have her run away.  thinking she ditched me, i dance with another girl, only to receive a bunch of texts in a row of her cursing me out.  i approached her, but she just yelled more.  i was really upset so i walked home from the club, only to be jumped by 3 guys trying to rob me.  i defended myself, but looked at my phone to see her text me that she hooked up with a friend of mine, and that she was flirting with my friends back at the club.  

the next day, she apologized and told me that she didn't really hook up with my friend, she was just trying to get me pissed.  but the damage was done.  we stopped talking for months, only to exchange left over things.  this past weekend, i saw her and her new bf.  no words were exchanged, but a few glances, a smile, and a laugh.  the thing is, i no longer approach women since we broke up.  if i do, it's not to try to pick them up, but just to compliment them.  i keep everyone of them at a distance, even if they approach me.  i play the role of the ""sexually oblivious rhino"" either on purpose or not.  

i texted her today saying ""you look happy and i'm happy for you.  take care""
she responded thanks and then sent a second text asking me not to text that number again.

i never will.  but i don't get why i refuse to move on to other girls.  i tell myself i am just waiting for one to stand out, but i don't know anymore.  i don't want her back either.  i genuinely am happy for her.  i just want love and she was the closest thing i had to it.  what should i do?

2. Always decide on a time and place if it's the first date, you're a man you have to lead, this is not to say you can't be flexible though. Let the woman pick what days she's free

3. Don't stress out, be comfortable and relaxed. Your mood will rub off on your date. If you're confident and focused on having fun, the date will go over well.

4. MAKE SURE YOU INITIATE SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL CONTACT!!! It's not supposed to be creepy, but a light tap on the shoulder, a hug, or, if your date goes well, a kiss. If you're too afraid to lightly touch the woman you're interested in, how can you expect it will lead to a kiss?

5. Don't stress out about what to say. Chances are, she's almost as nervous as you. Ask her good questions that aren't cliche (what are you looking forward to, why are you studying this, if there was one thing you could do, money aside, what would you do, what was it like growing up in _____, etc...).

6. Make sure you maintain good posture. Head up (NEVER LOOK AT THE GROUND), shoulders lowered and back, walk slowly, chest out just a little bit.

7. When you're talking to her, or vice versa, ALWAYS maintain eye contact. You look timid and nervous if your eyes are darting around everywhere.

8. Send her a text message when it's over. Usually I say something like ""Hey, I had a great time hope you got home safe we definitely need to do this again."" Then I'll also put a little inside joke at the end.

Do guys like it when girls ask them to hang out? How do I even ask?

First date was casual outdoorsy-stuff with light conversation.
Second date was more traditional dinner/movie stuff and there was more interesting conversation. I kiss on the second date (no tongue, just a peck on the lips). 

I do the normal post-date 'thanks!' text to communicate subtly that I would accept another date.

This morning, the guy sends an email about his ex-gf. She's coming to visit for a few days and they are still kind of more than friends, but apparently communicate about the possibility of having to 'back off' if they meet someone else. He apparently told her about me so she's aware of it. He wanted me to know in case he doesn't communicate as much for the next few days while she visits. He invited me over to make dinner and watch a movie.

So here's what I did:
-Thanked him for his honesty
-Explained that this was a lot of unnecessary information after two dates
-Turned down the invite

Lesson: If you're dating someone who is still involved with an ex in any capacity *beyond very casual friends (edit), MOVE ON. It doesn't matter if they would 'distance' themselves from the ex to date you. They were never REALLY single. Be picky! You don't want to be somebody's monkey branch.

A lot of these misconceptions are subconscious and assumed, some are conscious. 

As someone who used to be terrible with women, but then turned it around and now do really well, I had some of these misconceptions as well. I feel like clearing them up would help a lot of people, especially younger ones. For reference, I'm 25, average looking, and live in the U.S.

Here are some off the top of my head (some of these you may already know, some not so much):

**1. If I impress a girl, she will be wowed and like me, so therefore I should think of ways to impress her.**

I always see some permutation of the question ""I like this girl. How should I impress her?"" from time to time, with the underlying assumption being that if you impress a girl, she will be wowed and like you, so therefore you should think of ways to impress her. 

The reality of this mindset is that by trying to impress her, you're creating an underlying context where the girl feels like the reason you need to impress her is that you think you aren't good enough for her. You end up putting her on a pedestal this way.

You don't need to try and impress women to win them over. Just being a guy who is comfortable with himself is enough. When you're talking with a girl, talk about things you like and that you're passionate about, without worrying what she might think about it. This creates the context that you're comfortable around women, aren't intimidated by them, and don't put them on a pedestal. Ironically, she'll be impressed by this.


**2. If I ask her lots of questions, and agree with everything she says, then she'll see we have so much in common and, therefore, like me. **

I feel like guys pick up this misconception from women who say ""Oh I really like [random guy], we have so much in common!!"" The guys then think ""Oh! We have to have commonalities! That's it! I'm a genius!"" What these guys fail to realize is that the same girl has just as much, if not more, in common with the 10+ guys she's friendzoned. 

There's nothing wrong with having things in common. But it's not what makes women attracted to you. If you agree with everything she says, and act like you have so much in common, she'll see that you're trying too hard and that you can't be natural around women. There's nothing wrong with you stating your honest opinion about something and it being different from hers. In most cases, she'll see that you're very true to yourself and that she doesn't have an effect on your opinion just because she's a girl.

Asking lots of questions without talking about yourself will make you seem boring, as well. Women are constantly screening you. If all you do is as her questions, she won't get to see your personality and thus, label you as really really boring.

**3. If I'm a gentleman, and do nice favors for her, she'll see how great I can be in a relationship and, therefore, start to like me.**

There's nothing wrong with being nice or doing favors. I'm not saying ""be an asshole,"" or anything like that. However, none of that will make a girl attracted to you, or make her like you. If that is your goal, and she isn't already attracted to you, it will make you seem boring, because you're placing her on a pedestal just like every other guy. The closest you'll get is her friendzoning you and using you for your favors, basically taking advantage of you.

The term commonly known as ""nice guy"" (as in ""nice guys finish last"") should really be ""doormat."" There's nothing wrong with being an actual nice guy, but when you do it thinking it'll make a girl like you, think again. A good rule of thumb is to honestly ask yourself ""Would I be doing this if this was a girl I wasn't attracted to?"" 

Also, one thing to note: If you're in a relationship, there's NOTHING wrong with doing overly nice favors for each other. That's a benefit of being in a relationship. Not sure if I had to clarify that, but you never know...

**4. If I become her best friend first, she'll see all of my amazing qualities and suddenly realize she likes me.**

Simply put: If you're her best friend, then unless you've had chemistry from the beginning, you're probably the least eligible guy she knows. 


**5. If a girl sleeps with me shortly after meeting me, then she must be a ""slut."" If she makes me wait, then she must be ""hard to get"" and has never been promiscuous before in her life. Only the best relationships happen when you wait a while to have sex, so therefore I shouldn't go for it, even though I'm attracted to her. I don't want her to think I just want sex.**

My two best, most healthy relationships of my life were with girls who I ended up having sex with very shortly after meeting them. The first was on the first date, and second was several hours after going up and talking to her.

Generally speaking, the amount of time between meeting a girl and having sex with her isn't a be all end all indicator of the quality of woman, or relationship. Don't think you need to wait [X] number of dates, before you can have sex.

At the same time, don't be fucking obsessed with sex, or having sex with the girl. View sex as a natural outcome of two people who are attracted to each other, because that's all it is. Focus on enjoying yourself, the girl, and the time you're having, and DON'T focus on ""When are we going to have sex?"" 

Also, if you're fooling around with a girl and make a move, and the girl isn't ready for it, don't think she isn't interested. If you had a great time and you know she likes you, it'll happen, it's a natural thing.


That's it for now. If I think of any more, I'll add them. If you want clarifications, feel free to ask. If anyone has anything else to add, I welcome it! Hope this helps!

I dont care about their personality I dont care about their looks (to an extent) I don't care about what they do I don't care about their interests

I just want a girl so badly that none of that stuff matters, and since none of that matters I find that I'm not really falling in love with these girls I'm falling in love with the fact that there is a body infront of me who isn't so repulsed by me that she would give me the slimmest chance to date her

I basically fall head over heels in love with any woman who can spend more then 10 minutes around me without becoming physically ill

Just the tinest bit of kindness for a girl and I'm ready to do anything and everything i can to be with her

I dont like this, it cheapens it, it makes me feel like if I ever trick a girl into dating me (i use the word trick because if a girl ever dates me that means I must have done something either purposfully or accidnetally to mislead her into thinking i'm a normal person) I'm not going to be able to truly love her because I dont need anything from her then the fact that she exists,

The ""new guy"" she has dated for 4 years has screwed up and its over. Now heres the problem. He and i have become close, very close. In an effort to be around her, I have had to make friends with him.

Guys saying, ""I'd do anything for her, I'd be there for her all the time. I'd buy them gifts, take them out all the time, bend over backward for them."" 

Guys, stop that right there. That is your main problem right there. Buying your woman things and being there for her all the time doesn't mean anything if it isn't mutual. Is the woman you're interested in buying you small gifts, does she ever offer to pick up the bill (even if she doesn't mean it), is she always there for you 24/7 willing to drop everything just to hang out with you? If she's not doing those things then why should you?

Women want a guy who goes after what he wants. Not somebody who is too scared to tell them they're interested in them more than a friend and blindly throws gifts, money, and moral support at them.

When you meet a woman you're interested in, right away, LET HER KNOW! Do not beat around the bush, it gets you nowhere. Here's an example, I spot a girl I'd be interested in getting to know and possibly dating. So I'll walk up to her and say ""Hi, listen I think you're really pretty and I'd be kicking myself all day if I didn't come up to you and say something. My name's Alex."" Then shake her hand. Then make sure you at least attempt to get her number somewhere during the conversation.

A guy who just wants to be friends with a girl probably wouldn't say something about how he finds her pretty and he probably wouldn't walk up to her and talk to her out of the blue at all.

So let's assume things go well with this woman, and you want to ask her out. DON'T WAIT, the longer you wait, the longer you're going to question yourself and then she's going to think ""Hmm I guess he isn't interested in me anymore."" 

As soon as you think you want to take her out let her know. This part is really important guys, MAKE SURE YOUR WOMAN KNOWS IT'S A DATE!!!!!! So many guys just ask a woman ""Hey what are you doing this weekend? Oh nothing? Let's hang out then."" Then they'll go to the park and sit there and talk about boring, friendly stuff and get pissed when the girl friend-zones them. 

When you ask a girl out tell her it is a date.

""Hey, Adriana what are your plans for the weekend?""

""I'm busy Friday but free the rest of the weekend, why?""

""Well then, I wanted to ask you out on a date. I know this awesome cafe downtown where we can get some coffee and ice cream.""

""Ok, yeah sounds fun!""

""Great, what time works best for you Saturday?""

Just like that guys, you're being very clear you're interested in her more than a friend. So next time you're interested in a woman, don't wait and don't chicken out, just ask her out already!

For the record I am no dating expert or pickup artist but I am going off of some things I have learned over the years. 

In high school I was your typical nice guy, got along with everyone, had a bunch of friends but I was so shy when it came to women. I could have a conversation with a girl who I thought was pretty but in the end that conversation wound up me being very neutral / agreeable and even if I didn't agree with them I never expressed my opinion for the fear of them being put off or offended. When a girl i liked said something like ""Oh I forgot to get a fork when I got lunch"", I would be the first person to be like ""Oh ill go grab you one"" or if she forgot her home work ""Oh you can copy off mine"". Basically I did things to help her and even though it wasn't a conscious decision, I was pretty much at her becking call. I thought these were actions that would make her like me. Unfortunately 98% of the time I never got the girl, she would always wind up dating a guy who wasn't 1/2 as nice as I was to her. 




It took a lot of lost girls to figure out what I was doing wrong in this aspect. I finally realized what was going on. It wasn't that most girls aren't interested in nice guys. It was girls aren't interested in a guy who is a pushover / weenie. My actions of always being there for whatever she needed, always complementing her and offering to do whatever I thought would make her happy are things that friends do. When you do these typed of things over and over again you're taking the challenge of her winning your affection away. You are giving her what she should have to earn. What's the point of competing in a competition when you already know you're going to win? Women want to be desired but it's not worth anything to them if you just give it to them. 


What you see when a woman goes for a guy being a dick is a woman who wants to a challenge. She wants the satisfaction of earning a man's attention. Most women don't want everything handed to them, would you? I am sure a lot of you have had a girl who was into you but you wanted nothing to do with. If you have then you know what it feels like for a women who has a guy do everything and anything for her. It's like that dog who keeps licking your face, ya its cute but could you live with that dog 24/7? The thing is though, you don't need to turn into a complete asshole to get a girl you wan't. 


You need to start to be your own person. You need to have your own opinions and don't be afraid to express them. When you talk to a girl you like or a girl you think is pretty you need to pretend (even if you don't) you have other options than her and it doesn't matter if she likes you or not. You need to put your world and priorities a head of her. So lets say you are supposed to go out with your friends and some girls asks you to come out with her and her friends. Don't change your plans to hang out with her and her friends. You got your own stuff to do. Don't give women compliments all the time. If it looks like she put some extra time in to getting ready, sure you can say she looks good but that should be the end of it. Don't be afraid to poke fun and tease her about stuff just don't harp on it. She makes a stupid mistake then call her retard or something but drop it after that. If you get a girls number then don't use it for a continuous conversation. You should be using the number to setup dates and times to hang out. Don't use it as a tool to getting to know them or them knowing you, save that for the time you spend together. If she starts texting you don't be a little puppy dog waiting by the phone for her texts. Even if you are make it seem like you're busy and space out time time between texts. When you decided to schedule a time and place to hangout you need to be decisive. None of this ""well ill do what ever you want to do"". You make the decision at every point you can. It shows you are dominant and can take control. I am running on at this point but the main point of this is be you're own person. The more you make them earn your affection the better it will turn out for you. Don't make your life revolve around them. That's something that comes much later into a relationship when you decide to be exclusive.

Got dumped?,70,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/n22q7/men_of_rdating_advice_not_sure_if_shes_into_you/,"Hello! I've been doing this whole dating thing for quite a while and I personally love browsing sub-reddits like this one.

I see a *lot* of similar posts made here by frustrated and confused guys, and they can nearly all be answered the same way.

**I'm not sure if she's into me, how can I tell?**

Here's how: you man up and ask her out. No grand gestures. No sappy wording. Keep it simple. ""Hey, Becky, listen. I think you're really cute and I want to take you out sometime. How does that sound?"" Accept the possibility of rejection and understand the sweet feeling of reciprocation.

Understand that you might strike out. Babe Ruth struck out over 1,300 times. But, the dude dug in and took his cuts, and that's why he hit 714 home runs.

Addendum: if you've had a crush on a girl for a while and have not made your intentions clear, be prepared to be friend zoned, and even have the woman possibly resent you. Most women dislike 'nice guys' because they (the woman in question) are under the impression the man is spending time with her because he enjoys her company--not because he wants to have sex with her. 

So, when a self-proclaimed nice guy finally confesses his feelings for the girl, she is taken aback, surprised, and realizes that all he ever wanted was to fuck me. Not cool.

**She dumped me and it hurts. What do I do?**

Step one: realize this--everyone gets broken up with.

Step two: accept this, and accept the fact that you will never be in a romantic relationship with this person ever again.

Delete said person from your phone *without* memorizing their number. Delete them from your Facebook (or, better yet, delete Facebook completely). Trash everything in your possession that reminds you of them. Find what you're passionate about, and focus on it. I don't care if it's something completely lame, like building model boats in bottles or some shit. Just do it.

Reconnect with old friends, and don't put yourself in situations where your mutual friends will be meeting up with your ex. Go places. Try something new. Do something wild. Don't try and erase the bad memories of the relationship, cherish the good, and look at the relationship from a realistic standpoint.

I apologise in advance because this is kind of loaded and will get lengthy, I tend to be self-reflective so I try to analyze everything...


**Bit of Context**


I live in a small/medium city (~500,000 people), grew up here and have been here all my life. I'm 24 years old. In all this time I have never NEVER gone on a date, been asked out, kissed someone etc. I grew up quite religious (atheist now), and coupled with my asian parents, was always discouraged from dating since I should focus on school etc. I've never had many male friends, and honestly at this point in my life I unfortunately have to say I don't have many close female friends either (I have a lot of FRIENDS, but no one not a single one I could rely on).

I haven't really been interested in getting into a relationship until the last 1-2 years (I've never felt a strong attraction to anyone - to the point of thinking I was asexual in my teenage years). I'm getting older, all my friends are married or in long term relationships, and my loneliness is magnified as I don't even have female friends I would consider close. So I'm coming to reddit just to lay out my thoughts and see if someone could offer advice.


**About Myself**

I'm well-educated (almost done a Masters in a health-related field), an avid gamer (to the point where I frequently pull the typical virgin-in-parent's-basement stereotype..), love trying new activities, love to travel (have backpacked and worked in an asian country for a couple of months).
But this may be part of the problem: but I'm really not a girly-girl at all. I don't wear make-up, I don't spend time any time on my hair (I keep it short so I don't have to do anything to it), my 'fashion' consists of geeky t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans. I keep excellent personal hygiene, I just don't like to dress up like the typical female, it's not me.

Partly due to genetics and partly because of my eating habits (I'm a very picky eater, coupled with irritable bowels I just don't eat a lot) I am very skinny. Not anywhere near anorexic levels, but under the recommended BMI. I've tried before to put on weight, but I can't - because of this I don't have a curvy bod or... y'know any assets. At all. Girls always like to comment on how skinny I am and I don't think people realize how self-conscious this makes me. Coupled with my dress style and asian ethnicity, I'm usually mistaken for someone quite young (15-20). I've found this leads to pretty self-defeating thoughts, ie. ""Why would anyone want to date me, I'm too small - people want a nice female figure."" and ""Anyone who wants to date me must be a pervert cause I look like I'm a 15-year-old asian schoolgirl."" Stupid, right?

And lastly, lastly. I'm hyper-aware of what I say and tend to be critical of myself. I'm never the person leading the conversation, I'm always listening and responding. I hardly bring up new topics, I'm worried I'll say the wrong/boring thing. I feel like I have walls up, never really exposing the real me (... I don't even know what the real me is). Having never been in a relationship, I'm afraid of opening up to someone - honestly I don't even know how to. I've tried to see if I could lower my walls a bit with alcohol, but I just get even quieter. I tend to deflect a lot with humour.

A lot of advice I see on reddit in regard to relationships is to work on yourself before trying to find someone. Like don't date someone if you're depressed, if you have low self-esteem, etc. Work on that first. It's something that I agree with on principle, but I've been melancholy for years (but people think I'm the most cheerful person in the room!!1!! so it goes.), and my self-esteem isn't run to the ground but it isn't amazing either. Tending towards a lot of self-criticism, if I wait for these issues to completely resolve themselves before I start dating I'd be in my grave.


**The current situation**

I don't know how to meet guys. I don't know how to talk with guys. I don't know what I'm looking for in a guy. I don't know what to watch out for, what to avoid. And I don't fucking know if I'm attracted to a guy. I haven't told people this as I feel like it's an alien concept to every other person on this planet. Girls are always talking about how hot this or that guy is etc. It's not that I don't see it - yeah sure that guy looks good - but I never 'feel' anything, it's always a very logical assessment. It's gotten to the point before where I DID question my sexuality (my mom is afraid I might be gay since I've never had a boyfriend), but I'm not attracted to girls either (I just tend to make friends with them easier). I don't know if it's an issue of having a low sex drive, or if it's because I've never been in a relationship so I don't know what to long for.

I hate parties, I hate clubs. I've been to martial arts classes, I've done a lot of volunteering, I've traveled, I've been in university for seven years now (commuting from home the entire time). It seems like I should be meeting a lot of potential mates, but I never do, there's never any interest. I think this is also the reason I have a lot of transient friends, but not a lot of close ones. I'm excellent at meeting new people, but I have trouble taking any kind of relationship further.

I've considered online dating, but I don't think it's a step I'm ready to try yet.

Leaving my religion a couple of years ago was emotionally taxing, and there is still lingering guilt and apprehension from that in relation to sex. It is something that I think I can get over when the right guy comes along, but I know it will take me a really long time before I reach that stage - and with my limited knowledge of guys, I feel the whole ""virgin who won't put out for months/years"" will either repel most of the male population, or will attract the wrong types. Self-defeating thoughts again.. Like how the hell do I even bring the subject up? Won't most guys be taken completely aback when I reveal to them that I'm in my mid-twenties and haven't even been on a coffee date?

**And soooo**

I was trying to figure out more to add but typing this up was exhausting. It's so long and random, I don't expect anyone to read it even. But thank you if you do, I will read and appreciate your advice even though this is an alt.

**TL;DR**

I just want to love, and be loved in return.

**Edit2**: Holy crap thank you everyone for your thoughtful replies (and surprising lack of creepy pms! I've jinxed it now..). I do really appreciate you offering encouragement and advice. I forgot to mention that something that someone on the original thread said had really struck a chord with me - she mentioned that I may be demisexual, that I don't feel attraction until I've formed a close emotional bond with someone. Since I haven't formed a close emotional bond with someone, I don't know if this is true but it feels 'right', like that's who I am. I hope I don't come off sounding holier-than-thou, but I seriously *very rarely* feel attracted to anyone based on their appearance - I've never had crushes in school growing up, I never lust over movie actors (not even Joseph Gordon Levitt, yeshelooksnice logically but I don't *feel* anything), when I'm hanging out with friends and they get completely distracted cause a 'cute' guy walks by - and then they try to point him out (""look at that cute guy!"") I never know which one they mean though everyone else seems to. I was curious about porn and tried watching it, but it did absolutely nothing for me - I have no idea what the big deal is with it.

So basically what this boils down to is what you've all been saying - work first on making friends. I get that. I make friends easily. But it's taking that initial friendship deeper that I have trouble with (even with same-sex friends).

So went to play pool with the girl mentioned in the post. She had never played before so I got to teach her. I even brought my own pool cue because I am legit. I had a lot of fun teaching her. It gave me the opportunity to make lots of physical contact with her. I put my hands on her hands, shoulders, waist, and hips throughout the evening. I never would have had the courage to do that were in not in that situation.   
  
I taught her standard billiards and nine-ball billiards. We played for about 2.5 hours. We had a lot of great conversation. I let her win 2 games of nine-ball in a row. Then she said that if she beat me a third time I owed her ice cream. We played a standard game and I won. Then we played another nine-ball game and I let her win again. I said that since she won three nine-ball games in a row I still owed her ice cream. She said she would see when she was off work next week and that we would go get ice cream. I paid for the time we were there and walked out with my arm around her shoulders.  
  
Then I said that since I still spanked her so bad at pool she owed me something. She said she couldn't buy me anything (she is pretty broke). Then I put my hands on her hips and told her to kiss me. She hesitated and leaned away slightly but then she came in kissed me on the lips, *feelsgoodman*. Then as I am walking away she said;  
  
""Hey that was only a friend kiss"" (I don't buy it, girls don't kiss their guy friends on the lips).  
  
Then she said; ""What!?, am I going have to keep giving you kisses now?"" Then I said that that would be nice.  
  
She then thanked me for the good time and left. She may still end up rejecting me but I am proud of myself.    
  
So we will see how the ice cream date goes next week.

Why is this so difficult?,67,14,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xf1or/i_dont_want_to_date_a_woman_who_im_not_friends/,"Originally posted this to R/relationships, got told by a mod to post it here instead.

I'm not attracted to strangers. There's not really any other way to put it. I've never gotten a crush on some new girl who I haven't talked to yet. If I see a beautiful woman who I don't know at a party or bar, I'm not interested in her in any romantic or sexual way. I have gone out and flirted with random new girls before when my friends advised it, and this is definitely a surefire way to get dates but none of the times I have done this have I been satisfied with the relationship and I've always ended it. The longest I've ever been involved with somebody is three weeks. I'm 22.

I don't want to date somebody unless I know them. I need to have a decent understanding of what kind of person they are, know their interests and values, and be sure it's a person who I respect and get along with before I really get a crush on them.

Every single time I have asked out a woman after developing a regular friendship with her, I usually get a no with some ""don't want to ruin the friendship"" excuse. Once, a woman assumed that I was playing some manipulative ""nice guy"" game from the start and got upset at me.

Most of my friends (both male and female) tell me I have to make my intentions clear from the start before she starts thinking of me as a platonic friend - but that's my problem, I don't HAVE any intentions to make clear at the start. I'm not looking for a fuck buddy I barely have anything in common with that I met at some random bar. I'm looking for a relationship, and I want to screen based on personality and interests.

You are not going to swoop them off their feet and take them home and fuck them the first night. So you have to show u are interested in them. Also you get to know them, find out if you actually do like them and what you like about them. Maybe some of those thing they do, may be things you already do or are things you may like to do and could be new hobbies. Once you get to know them and have done good conversation fun and laughs, ask for their phone number and let them know you'd like to see them again. That's when the real dates get to happen and you can plan for that shit separately.

But for now u want to get to know them. A good approach may be to make sure the word ""you"" is in every sentence... ""You look like you are having fun"" ""what's your name"" ""what do you do"" ""would you like a drink"" ""you look like you can dance"" 


A lot of these tips like conversation and finding out if you are even interested in this person are important in the workplace to help build those relationships and network.

30 y/o American-Asian male raised/living in American deep-south, not Christian or religious. Eagle Scout. Health conscious and outdoors enthusiast. Socially extroverted. 2 Masters and a doctorate in different scientific/technical/business disciplines from well-known universities. Employed as business management in a major pharmaceutical company with claim to multiple technical patents. Counsel member for several large local volunteer organization.

This is a throwaway account because this is very embarrassing for me. I've listed a general background for myself to better paint a portrait that I'm not a bad person. In spite of this, I have never been in a relationship at all. This is not for lack of trying either. All my life I have put myself into situations where women were, and I have asked women of all shapes, sizes, race, or creed to join me for coffee or a date of some kind. I don't have a woman type -- I just want a companion. I've never had anyone say yes. I get a range of responses but never yes. I don't want sex and actually have never had sex -- I don't advertise this (thank god for the throwaway) and only did so here to get responses since, ultimately, sex/conflict sells.

I have a neurological disorder known as Tourettes that prevents me from appearing normal, but aside from that I am a very normal looking person. I work out excessively and maintain a high level of fitness through various physical competitions and sports. I have had many surgeries due to my disorder that do not affect my appearance, but it has caused a loss of some of my motor functions. I have learned to compensate and conceal these issues as best I can to appear normal. 

I am very honest due to my upbringing, and I don't like to lie when asked; so I will fully disclose my disability if it is noticed. I have found people distance themselves from me because of the embarrassment my condition causes. I know it makes people uncomfortable. Because I understand certain people don't want to be seen with someone like that, I disclose this in all my online dating profiles because I want to be fully transparent about myself and err on the side of disappointment rather than lead them on. 

Is there anyone out there who can give me advice as to how they found their companion in spite of their disability? None of my friends have single friends, and I am getting too old for my area since very few people my age are single. The last woman who agreed to meet me lived 3 hours away, and when I drove to meet her after 2 months of texting she didn't show up and stopped replying to me. I am really tired of being alone. Should I just get some cats?

TL;DR I'm old. I don't fit the mold of desirability for my area in spite of my effort to fit in. I have a ""major"" social disability. Should I just give up hope of ever finding someone? Will it make me feel better if I stop trying?

1338247056.0,48,self.dating_advice,u9f3u,Basic hygiene and appearance issues that stop guys I know getting dates,56,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/u9f3u/basic_hygiene_and_appearance_issues_that_stop/,"Maybe this is all really obvious, but based on observing people I know who are perpetually single, they could vastly improve their chances by making a few simple changes with almost instant effect. I just felt like writing it all down:

**Body odor and smelly clothes**

I know people who are kind, smart, funny, well-dressed, and they have such strong BO that you would feel ill if you were in an elevator with them.

It's easy not to smell: Shower at least once a day, wear unscented or lightly scented antiperspirant deodorant and apply this when you have dried off after your shower. If you want to smell nice apply a *small* amount of [cologne/eau de toilette](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/o6fzj/rmalefashionadvices_thoughts_on_best/), but bear in mind that it should only be noticeable if someone is *very* close to you.

**Much of the smell is carried by your clothing**. It's surprising how many people are unaware of this. Change your t-shirts every day, like you would socks or boxer shorts and put a pile of them through a light wash at the end of the week. Wear thin v-neck undershirts if you are wearing a button-up shirt.

**Poorly fitting clothes**

Baggy, billowing shirts. Jeans that drag over your trainers and get shredded at the bottom. [T-shirts that are two sizes too big](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/d08wh/random_advice_3_a_picture_lesson_in_basic_tshirt/). All these things make you look like a child. There are many [guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ehrtv/shujins_comprehensive_fit_guide/) on the internet on how clothes should fit. It's also very easy to get your clothes tailored/adjusted.

**Wearing the same pair of trainers every day**

Girls really do notice this. At the very least have in rotation two nice pairs of sneakers and a smarter pair of shoes. See the sidebar on /r/malefashionadvice for ideas.

**Ill-advised experiments in facial hair**

I feel very strongly about this one. Very few people look better with a beard, especially if they have [wispy, patchy facial hair](http://epicbeard.net/beards/resized/194.jpg), but this doesn't stop countless men destroying their chances with nice girls (or guys) by deluding themselves that their attempt at a neck-beard, goatee, soul patche, ironic moustache or mutton-chop sideburns looks good.

If in doubt shave it off, seriously. Here are some /r/amiugly threads featuring beard vs no-beard

**Bad dental hygiene**

Get an appointment with a dental hygienist (your dentist should have one at the clinic) and get your teeth cleaned up real good (i.e. a proper ultrasonic clean/scale-and-polish). They don't need to be perfectly straight or pearly white, but obvious stains and signs of neglect are a huge turn-off.

I wasted half of college playing computer games and generally not being sociable enough, and I regret it almost every day.  You're not going to find a higher concentration of girls (or boys) of your age and similar interests ever again.  You cycle classes every ~10-15 weeks and meet dozens of new men/women every week.

Think your dating life sucks now?  It's going to suck more when you're working 9-5 and all your friends are starting to get married.  It's going to suck when finding someone that's your age is a treat rather than the norm, and having that person still be single is even rarer.

I'm 25 now and am at the lowest point ever in terms of dating.  It's so easy for things to progress naturally in college and there's so many girls that you can't lose.  I think people living in more urban areas have it better, but even in a fairly large sururb/city, it's still rough.

1334838780.0,44,self.dating_advice,shpoi,Some good advice,49,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/shpoi/some_good_advice/,"In my experiences,  you can never be too up front with someone. 

Honesty is key.

I am 26[M], and I appreciate every sentence of honesty from the girl that just ended things with me gave me. 

We went on 5 dates over a month and a half, and I could tell she was pulling away; she wouldn't text me first, and even started to not respond to my texts because she didn't want to hurt me; but not hearing from her was what hurt most of all. 

I finally had to be firm with her, which I prefer to avoid, and she luckily decided to respond and apologized for her actions. We then proceeded to have a lengthier, completely mature conversation about why she was ending things, and we are both still cool with each other. 

If she never responded, I would have had no respect for her, all she would have gained is one person in the world that doesn't like her (hate would be too strong of a word), and I would have had to wonder why she ended things and probably would have had a blow to my confidence. Being honest with me was the best option for both her and me. 

The moral of the story: There is never a good reason to not be up front and honest. You may not want to say the words that hurt someone's feelings, but not saying them is much more hurtful. If you are honest and mature, you should get honesty and maturity back, and even ""not positive"" things like breaking up with someone can turn out less unpleasant as you fear it will be.

He is so nice and such a gentleman.  We wound up meeting for a drink then heading to his friends photography exhibit thing .  It was really funny because he had a ton of friends there so I met a bunch of them and they were all really nice and then we decided to grab another drink afterwards (I think we both just wanted to hang out some more).  What was cute was that he realized I was cold and had started to shiver so he had me put his jacket over mine to keep me warm. 


We wound up hanging out at until about midnight and then he took me home (he opened the car door and everything).  It was really cute because the whole night we were talking about how we have to do this and that together and I think we are going to probably start dating (it's a little preemptive to say but I think we are both really into each other).  When he dropped me off he walked me to the door and we made out a little bit and made plans to get together saturday!

I don't know how to answer basic texts, I feel like if I ask too many questions I'll be seen as too needy, which has happened more than once in the past. I tend to be very cuddly. I so do not want the potential relationship to fail that I tend to make it fail anyway.

I'm pretty unhappy about that, I mean, I know I am a good guy, I always do the right thing etc. I'm getting a little unhappy as of late of all the ""casual"" relationships; I want something real and lasting.
So I met this Australian woman (31) (I'm French), and we've gone on two dates so far that went really well. We kissed the second date (well, more like French kissed...), and she had to go back to Australia today for four weeks (paperwork). She suggested we keep in touch, which I am of course very happy about. I just don't want this to turn into the crash and burn scenarii I've known in the past, she seems like a really great person.

",53,14,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vcbok/some_non_forever_alone_advice/,"Ok, clear the way here folks. I'm going to drop some non-forever-alone knowledge up in this bitch. 

This kind of stuff is so fucking easy that I can't understand how anyone gets it wrong. Compliments DO work, IF USED CORRECTLY.

Walking up to a random girl and saying 'Damn baby I'd tear that shit up!' rarely works (sadly, everything works at some point, but those aren't the girls you want to physically touch anyways). 

But telling a girl something like 'Wow, you look beautiful today.' can work wonders if used in the right situation. The trick with shit like this is to not make it awkward, and to always give them a way out. 

Cornering a girl and locking her between you and a wall, for instance, doesn't always work out too well. Neither does staring them down both before AND after saying something like that, while just smiling like you're about to drool. O_O

You have to make it natural and almost passive in a sense. 

Turn your attention to her, drop the compliment genuinely, smile a little bit and then change your focus to something else. You want to convey that you meant the compliment, that you enjoy whatever it is you are complimenting (the smile), and also that you aren't saying it to get something in return (changing focus; turn and say hi to someone or something like that).

I hate texting, but I use it, and I use it fucking well. I hate it because doing shit in person, or even over the phone, is more 'real', and has a better effect. That being said, using SMS as a tool between real life contact and whatnot can be useful. 

Example: New girl you are talking to. You are at that stage where you can tell you both kind of have a thing for eachother, but no solid moves have been made yet. You know with a decent amount of certainty that you WILL be able to see her again soon, and things are good. But, it's the middle of the week, and you have to keep her interested until you can see her over the weekend and take things a bit further. 

So, instead of doing the whole ""I'm going to ruin all possible talking points by hounding the girl with text messages all week so that when the weekend comes, we have nothing new to talk about and thus she starts losing interest"" thing that SO many people love to do, you try this awesome move instead. 

You give her some space, and act like you are busy, yet convey that she is still on your mind. How? Simple.

Send her this text: ""Hey -girlsname-. I can't really talk right now, I've got a lot of shit going on, but I just wanted to say good morning and I hope you have an awesome day! I'm looking forward to this weekend!  Txt you later :)""

It says that you are busy focusing on your life, but she is in the back of your mind. It conveys that you have your own shit going on, but still care about hers. It conveys that you can be cute/sweet without being over-bearing. It almost leaves her on the hook, in a good way. 

Talking to girls is much easier than you think. The only reason so many douchebags get way more girls than normal guys is because normal guys don't bother even trying. You have to try, but you don't have to try hard. 

A simple 'Your hair looks really cute like that' can go a long fucking way.

The last two years i've had a slew of surgeries and now have a nice pair of reconstructed breasts. 
I've also been with the same guy for about a year and a half. He was there before I had my breasts removed so I havent had to do any explaining to anyone when it comes to intimacy and sex. 

We recently broke up and as I'm entering the dating world, I've got this new dilemma. I'm naturally pretty confident, attractive and put in work for my nice figure, so i've rarely felt unconfident or unsure of myself in that respect. 

Right now I'm struggling to identify an appropriate time to let a guy that I've been dating for about a month know that, I in fact do not have nipples.. and my boobs, are like, pretty rock hard.(I got implants, any they're not nearly as squishy and motorboatable as natural boobs).
I do intend to at some point get nipple tattoo's like these: http://vinniemyers.com/artwork/2058324_Spring_2011.html.NSFW But for right this moment thats not a huge priority of mine, and my boobs are totally fine how they are. 


I do think though that it's something that needs to be brought up before things get down and dirty.. right? like I would be weirded out if I got down there and dude didn't have balls.. like it wouldn't bother me if he told me ahead of time, but i'd be pretty freaked if I just wandered down there and found out on my own. 


So my questions are, when is it appropriate to tell him? 
Do I need to?
Should I casually mention it like its nbd, or have a sit down?
If you were this guy, would appreciate a heads up??

He came to visit me again and we ended up just having a relaxing afternoon/evening at my place playing video games, watching movies, etc. Anyways, we were cuddling and watching a movie as usual, and when the movie ends neither of us really wants to move so we end up chatting for a few minutes. Having challenged myself to kiss him this time, I kept trying to wait for the right moment, but he almost always kept his head turned away from me while we were talking (I'm guessing that was just more comfortable for him). Alas, no such opportunity appeared and I was getting nervous. Finally there was a lull in the conversation and I just flat out asked him in the most playful/flirty manner I could muster ""so are you ever going to kiss me or what?"" And he did. Fuck yes. Nothing fancy, just a good peck on the lips, but very enjoyable.



He is still very shy, but it's pretty apparent now that he's becoming more and more comfortable each time we hang out. I'm feeling less nervous too, which I'm sure he's picked up on as well. 



Funny side note: We've actually been on another date since he kissed me and it was a very fun day. We went out in the afternoon, had a good dinner, and ended the evening at my place with a movie. When he was leaving he turned to give me a hug and I (thanks to all of the lovely people on r/dating_advice) decided to go in for a little kiss when the hug was over. Apparently he did too, but we ended up kind of missing half of each others mouths. I of course thought this was hilarious and laughed. He giggled too, but clearly felt awkward about it. He was turning to leave so, wanting to end the date on a better note, I grabbed his shirt to pull him towards me and giggled saying ""sorry, my aim was a little off.

I have engaged in various activities such as volunteering, going to support groups, going to the gym, and going to church. I have asked friends to fix me up.

So far, no man has been interested in giving me a chance in terms of dating/a relationship. Even before this bad streak, no man I was ever interested in was interested in me. All my exes are guys I had no interest in that I talked myself in to because they were my only options. Thus, I have extremely low standards, so that isn't the issue.

At my age, I am not interested in waiting any longer to live the life that I want, which is a life WITH someone.  I am also far too old to be wondering, ""What does it feel like to have someone love you?""

I'm asking this because of ""texting"" and ""hanging out"". It seems like a game-changer that's just making dating harder.

I grew up being taught from my parents, adult siblings, and movies, that dating is something that happens about once a week, maybe twice a month. The first date would consist of an intimate dinner, which the man would pay for.

Nowadays, my friends are all telling me that you just ""text"" the woman whenever you want, and ask her to ""hang out"", as if you were just interested in being platonic friends.

This doesn't sit right with me.

The whole point of asking a woman to dinner, is to convey your interest in a relationship without directly saying it. I don't ask my friends out to dinner, unless it's an occasion.

And why are these women always saying they ""would have paid for themselves"" like it was some sort of problem that I did it for them? Is the ""texting and hanging out"" thing so expected that what I'm doing is coming across as ""just being friendly""?

And I've heard a thing or two about ""hanging out"". From what I've heard, it's pretty much code for sex. I've heard that in this crude version of dating, the guy pretty much immediately goes in for sex without getting to really know or understand the girl on any respectable level.

From what I've experienced with texting, it seems like a shitty, inferior mode of communication. Messages are usually extremely ambiguous, and people will always assume the most negative meaning that your message could possibly have, and the inescapable intrusiveness of texts seems so clingy. And we're supposed to carry full conversations with this? This all seems horribly detrimental to the progress of a relationship.

Yet these are the expectations that our generation is consecrating. I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy when it comes to this sort of thing, and I'm not going to follow a norm that will become just another forgotten error in the ongoing trial-and-error we call life.

**TL;DR** Is there any hope for guys like me? **Are there women out there who expect a gentleman and won't try to stifle his natural tendency to behave like one?**

""Is that what you're studying?"" Nothing at this point but genuine intentions.

2.Generate their attraction. Friendliness can only go so far, and your attention can only last so long. I don't know about you, but I have this habit of getting lost in my head mid conversation. With anyone. Use this to your advantage -- it's cuz we're smart. Women desire men who are into their own thing; who are passionate about whatever work they do. Mid conversation with the girl, I want you to lose focus. I want you to hold on to whatever thought is lingering in your head, and accept its presence. This is the essence of cool. You're not concerned with her anymore, and now she has to work to earn your attention.

3.Generate your own attraction. This is probably the hardest, and most foreign part to us. Ironically. You've done everything right, she's now asking you question, and trying to get you to come back to noticing her. You're established as smart, respectable, and cool. Yay. But the finisher is what makes or breaks you. I want you now to find something about her that you really like. Maybe its her wavy hair, or those lips you want to suck on. Whatever it is, focus on it, get turned on. Soon the silence will sound different; it will become sexual tension between you two. I mean, you're talking to her because you want her, right?

Respectfully inquire. Than accept the situation, think about your own thing. Finally, end the circular talking and begin to feel each other out. If you're feeling it, and she's got those glossy eyes, get her number. And ready for this: hanging out with her is the same exact process. Just when you get to step three, make a move.

The people on here are pretty cool, and a lot of them are dedicated to their nerdiness. Be absolutely honest with him / her about who you are. She'll trust you if you show her your real side. Frankly, her personal preferences towards people won't matter if she knows who you are.

2. Be true to yourself. When you run away from talking to her, calling her, etc. it's because you're afraid of the emotion going through you. She wants a man that can think ""man, I'm afraid of being rejected, and I want her enough that I'll feel this emotion in order to get her."" And if you freak out, pee your pants, don't know what to say, great. You'll go through the emotion and be better for it. I'm rejected by most girls, and the ones that accept me, are perfect for me.

Right now, I'm feeling afraid of being criticized for posting this. My thoughts are, I'm afraid, and I'm also wanting to help people on Reddit.

3. Relax. Most people are in their heads when they're with someone. Attraction starts in your heart. Feel your emotions, be present to your body when you're with her. Feel your skin, the heaviness of your breath, notice the area around her. Not only will you be more lively around her, she'll feel safe around you. Women feel safe around a man who is present.

If you're true to yourself, you let her trust you, and you relax, you'll know whether or not you and her have a connection. You can then decide to act on it.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_tmh10,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tmh10/3_ways_a_redditor_can_get_women/,

After reading all your advice, I decided that I had to just do it. No notes, no cards.. just ask him straight out. So I waited until the store was quiet, grabbed a few things and went to pay. We chatted for a bit and right as he handed me my receipt, I asked if he wanted to go for a coffee sometime. He said yes without hesitation. I gave him my number, he texted me and we've already gone out once, with plans for a second date.

I didn't know if I should post an update since getting a date isn't really big news, but after seeing some similar posts, I wanted to share my story. If you want to ask out a store clerk, just do it! It could turn out really well :).

Though it took me ~30 minutes of turning my phone off and on before finally finding the courage to call her, 2011 is officially the last year I go dateless! I just got back from the date and it went well. I was slightly intimidated at first because she was much cuter in person than her pictures. Obviously, I didn't mention this was my first date and if you met me you would never guess I'm this neurotic, I don't think. I internalize/reddit that stuff!

We talked for a bit and [at least for me] it wasn't nearly as awkward as I thought it was going to be. She seemed to laugh and smile a lot and me as well. The conversation flowed naturally. 

It's pretty amazing, actually. For that short time, I forgot myself. I wasn't the over-analyzing nervous shy guy that I've been for 20+ years. I was just a normal guy talking to a normal girl. No second guessing. No overwhelming sense of dread. No crippling anxiety. I can do this!

I don't know if this is good or bad but it felt very casual. It was like I was catching up with a buddy or meeting a new work acquaintance but not romantic [we only hugged] or anything. I can't really understand why a girl would be interested in me and I assume otherwise, but we all have our demons, I suppose.  I don't know if this date will lead to anything or if there's even anyone out there for me. I guess the best I can do is just keep trying and putting myself out there. And, well, that's not much but it's something and it's all I have to give.

Thanks for the advice and motivation.

[15M]",44,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1b9tou/some_general_advice_for_the_nervous_insecure/,"**TL;DR: It's said a lot, but your looks don't matter. Just perfect what you can control, and let your personality show. Also, don't stress if a crush isn't always thinking about you or not updating you about their situation, it's not worth it.**


Hello! So I know I'm young, but I've felt all of these feelings before and I think this advice can help those who feel this too. I still feel a lot of these insecurities, but I hope that whoever reads this can maybe feel a bit more confident in themselves and might just find someone that is right for them. 

First off, looks have always been something I've been insecure about. I never felt like girls will ever be interested in me because of the way I looked. Listen. You can't change the fundamental aspects of your appearance. By perfecting what you can control (working on weight, acne, fashion, etc.) and being confident in your own skin, it's attractive to the opposite sex. The fact that I know deep down that I am doing all that I can to look better is important. I can't stress this enough: in the end looks won't determine your success with men/women. It's difficult for me to say as I'm in high school so people tend to focus on looks, but I am confident that if I show my crush my true personality, that will sway her more than my appearance.

On the topic of crushes, another problem I tend to have is constantly stressing over my crush. I usually tend to get nervous every time she hangs out with friends, takes a picture with a guy (even if he's already taken) or answers a question about guys on her ask.fm account. I cringe and get sad when we don't interact for a long period of time. I've gotten over this emotional burden by imagining being in my crushes position. Everything I do through all hours of the day isn't to impress someone. When I like a post on instagram, I'm not consciously thinking of girls as I do it. Therefore I shouldn't be so focused on what my crush is doing all the time. Let your crush live their life. If they go on vacation, don't bother them, just let them have fun. This is something I'm still working on but thinking of it in this way helps.

Sorry if this was long, but I think it is helpful to those who have felt this way, because it's a real crappy feeling. If you ever need someone to talk to, just send me a PM (:

I don't know how to approach random women :/ It feels/seems *really* awkward to just go up to a random girl and say, ""Hey, that's an awesome shirt, or, wow, you're really pretty"", and then follow up with, ""I'm Yafrovon, what's your name?"". 

In the end, I'm trying to get their number. I don't want to make a girl uncomfortable or have her give me her number because she doesn't have the heart to say no in the heat of moment. 

How do I do it? I'd like to ask one to three women a day for their number for the next month, because I need to get over my fear of rejection. I frequent the used book store, Barnes N Nobles, Starbucks, the movies...the rink, I'm all over.

The worst thing about rejection is how you take it. They can laugh, call you names, label you a creep, or whatever. If you let it change who you are...then that's the worst thing that can happen.

I asked out a lot of women during my high school years and was rejected in a lot of bad ways. Yet, I still got a lot of dates, too, because I didn't let it get to me. The fact is that some people just aren't attracted to other people...deal with it. You know damn well that there's plenty of people you would reject...and for shallow reasons.

A lot of times people get rejected badly because the person you asked out is completely shocked and not ready for the question. They say what they say simply because they don't know how else to deal with it at the time. I had a woman laugh in my face...but come to me a day later to apologize for doing so. She was really embarrassed...but still didn't want to go out. So make sure you prepare them a little...and don't ask them out in front of their friends or in a place that may be awkward.

Be ready for rejection. Have a line or a plan in place to help the other person let you down. You put them in the position to reject you...so you should at least carry some of the burden relieving the awkwardness. Stay cool...breathe...smile...and thank them for listening. Don't linger too long or try to make further conversation. Most times the worst things are said after the initial ""no"" simply because there's awkward silence and the other person is desperately trying find reasons to make it less awkward. Do it for them. Don't ask for reasons...you don't want to hear them. Just say something like ""Well just so you know, I think you're really cool...if you change your mind let me know."" and then walk.

Anyway...if you get rejected...fuck it. Keep moving on and be proud of the fact that you had the balls to approach and ask. Most people are too afraid to do it.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_t5k05,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/t5k05/advice_on_handling_rejection/,

Oh well. At least I tried. To be honest I kind of do think that it was just a line and that I might have had her interest but lost it...

She was sitting across the way from me and at first I thought she was maybe trying to get my attention, constantly playing with her hair and she was kinda facing me as she sit sideways in her chair (one of the nice leather chairs in the place). If I had her interest, my biggest failure is that I took literally forever to try and even say something to her... like... 2 hours... I have some pretty large anxiety around people in general so I was just kind of freaking out that there was a hot girl sitting beside me that I should try to ask out. I honestly felt obliged to do it and that if I didn't do it, that she would think there's something wrong with.

After a while, after she went to use the washroom, I struck up a conversation and we chatted a bit. Wasn't incredibly one sided or anything, she asking questions about me back. Seemed like she might have been interested, or maybe was just polite and friendly. Anyway, the conversation had a couple lulls, and I decided to leave but ask for her number as I left... and she said she was ""good"", which I thought a pretty funny response.

Anyway, not going to dwell on it too much and in one sense feel pretty satisfied for trying instead of not and being angry at myself later on.

Just curious though... anyone think that at one point I had a chance? Or was she actually just polite and friendly and had a boyfriend?

Umair Haque is London-based consultant, author, and economist. He is also a contributor at the Harvard Business Review [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umair_Haque).



Gathered from his twitter page:

1. If you like someone, ask them out. Don't suffer in silence.

2. If you ""like"" people purely because of their looks, you're probably insecure and you're going to have a miserable love life.


3. If you're not being yourself on dates, you're not going to have a miserable love life. You're not going to have a love life.


4. ""Rejection"" is a dumb word for a dumb idea. Don't take it personally when you don't click with someone.


5. Don't idealize people. We all have crushes, but the truth is you'll never have fun if you're a clingy needy pedestal-pusher.


6. If you can't seem to meet people, it's probably because you're boring. Go to some classes, talks, shows. Be interesting.


7. If someone doesn't like you back, move on immediately. Don't cling, don't pine. Life's short, and people are many.

8. Don't ever (ever) try to convince someone that doesn't like you ""why"" they should. You'll feel worse. Find someone who does.


9. ""Attractiveness"" is a stupid myth. People are drawn to people who bring out the best in them. So be one.


10. You're going to get your heart broken. If you're lucky. So stop protecting, start accepting.

11. Finally, not always being happy isn't a reason to end things. But if you're constantly, really, unhappy, break up immediately.



Some other side tweets written by him:

* There's a difference between how a person makes you feel, and how you think a person should make you feel. Don't confuse the two.

* Go to the gym. Get a sense of style. Not because society expects it, but because you'll look and feel better.

* Don't ever compare yourself to generic ideals of ""attractiveness"". We are all hot when we have the confidence to see ourselves as so.


* So you have to open yourself to the surprising possibility of people--not just what you ""want"" from them--if you're after love.


* So just find people you really think are cool and interesting and let them know. The more you idealize people, the unhappier you'll be.

I don't know how to put this. BUT, Sunday I (28 M) had sex with a woman(29 F). 

Now at 28 years old that shouldn't be anything special but here's my thing...I don't sleep around and I've only had sex with two other people. 

The first was my Senior Year of high school girlfriend and we only had sex twice. The other was my now ex-wife. My ex-w was 99% of my sexual experience and it's kind of weird knowing that I did it with someone else. I kind of feel like I cheated, although I didn't. 

The woman I did it with is someone I've been dating for about 2 months now. She doesn't sleep around either and I was the first person she's slept with in over a year and a half.  So I guess I'm technically not sleeping around but it's still weird. 

I'm not even sure how to proceed. The day after we were both busy and didn't talk much and I'm kind of wondering if I got used, but I'd hope not because we've been hanging out for a few months and I'd think if she did that with me after being on a streak like that, it had to mean something but frankly I'm new to this world and it's going to require adjustment. 

Also neither of us climaxed. My ex-wife had an IUD, so I never used condoms. Not even sure how to get used to sex with them or explain this to the new girl without her feeling like there's something wrong with her. 

**TL;DR:** Slept with a girl I've been dating for 2 months. I was her first partner in over a year and a half. She was my 3rd partner ever, 1 being a 1 time deal and the other being an ex-wife.

So, I thought I'd share the only method I know to consistently deliver from [a conversation about this on /r/love](http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ovduq/how_does_one_get_out_of_the_friendzone/). **The most direct way to escape the friend zone is to reset the relationship hard enough to jolt it out of that state of affairs, which is also hard enough to effectively lose the relationship.** 

Make a clear, strong, but non-threatening move in the direction you want to take things, and if resisted put a lot of distance between yourself and the object of your affections. You are basically sending the message, ""As much as I want to be your friend because I value our relationship, I care about you too much in this other way to remain like this, and I chose to validate and honor those feelings even if they are unrequited."" The great thing about this is that it is precisely **not** what a friend-zone prone person does. The classic mistake there boils down to a sort of emotional manipulation, attempting to approach the person on the level of a friend to avoid freaking them out while possessing an ulterior motive.

What I'm suggesting might seem like a high risk approach. It is. But it is also the only approach I've actually seen work. If put in a friend zone by someone with respect to whom you most definitely do not want to remain ""just friends,"" obliterate the state of affairs by maintaining fidelity to your intentions and feelings that militate against that zone. Refuse to be an emasculated or a manipulative friend. Declare all this openly, directly, firmly, confidently, and calmly. Most importantly, stay the course even if it puts you clear out of relational orbit with the person in the event that s/he does not reciprocate your more-than-just-a-friend desires and decision.

Bonus: If this seems tragic, just imagine yourself walking away from an explosion of awesomeness [like these guys](http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/coolguysdontlookatexplosionsp1.gif) right at this [point in the Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja0_m-4NAec#t=07m45s) Perspective does count for something...

Men (and even women) of Reddit, bring me your experiences with the mysterious opposite gender and I will do my best to interpret the situation and let you know if you are in her sights or stuck in her blind spot.

I do not believe my opinion or interpretation to be the be-all-end-all of your relationship, but I have been reading r/dating_advice for a while and have been noticing that female motivations are of some confusion to the men of this subreddit. I only wish to do my best to clear up that confusion and offer the soundest advice I can in your situation.

Not shy at all anymore and still regretting missing that opportunity, only way to contact him is through facebook and wondering if I should do that or just forget it.

UPDATE: So I ended up messaging him a little over a week ago over facebook and just straight up told him that I had a huge crush on him last semester. He replied Saturday (he hasn't been on) with a long message telling me that he thinks that I'm ""so damn cute"" and that I was the highlight of his day every day in class but he's ""not good at that kind of stuff"" and he really wished that he would have said something. He then gave me his number and we texted all throughout saturday night, he kept reiterating how adorable he thought I was and how it made him so happy in class when I would smile at him and how he got all excited when he read the message on facebook that I sent him. I told him that I would be home for the summer from college in about a month and he really can't wait to try and see where things go from there.

Essentially, I'm a fairly balanced dude, charming, solid job, sunny disposition, not really socially awkward in most situations. While putting myself through college these past 5 years, I also experienced the hardest, most traumatic 5 years of my life. I've finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel, but I haven't had intimate human contact since I was 19. I'm now 24.
Fortunately all that's over, but I'm sort left with a bit of mental wreckage. I now live in a new city, have a sweet job, etc. I've also made about 4 or 5 different friends (male).
So, the issue that comes is with dating. I didn't really date in high school or college (obviously) and I feel pretty ill-prepared. Conversely, it's been so long since I've had any intimate human contact (read: not just sex, I'm talking at the most basic level. Hugs, holding hands, putting an arm around a shoulder). The affect that has sort of had on me is that my calm, charming self just goes freaking out the window during date scenarios, and I get wracked with anxiety. Even alcohol doesn't help. I'm pretty sure that this is just a symptom of having had so little physical touch for so long, and being so close to getting it. Anyways, long story short, I come across as kind of a shut-in without much dating experience (which I guess is pretty much completely accurate, I've barely had any dating experience) when going out with girls. And at this age, I feel like without that experience I get written off pretty quickly (despite the fact that I am an awesome all-around dude.)

**Elements of a Healthy Relationship**

**Clear communication**

* They ask for something when they need it. They don't keep it bottled up inside then explode when their needs are not met.
* They don't expect their partner to have ESP and read their mind.

**Proper Disagreements**

* They can calmly talk about things they disagree about without calling names, bringing up weaknesses, falling back on past transgressions, or making personal insults.
* They stop discussion if one or more parties is too upset to talk, but resume when they have calmed down.
* Try not to go to bed angry. Resolve the issue before going to bed.

**They admit they are wrong**

* They admit when they are wrong, and apologize for it. They do not try to pass blame on to someone else.

**Acceptance**

* They accept their partner for who they are and do not try to change them.
* It is unrealistic thinking one person can change their partner. The partner has to do the changing.

**Supportive**

* The person is supportive of the partner in good times and bad.
* The person understands and tries to meet the partner's needs, emotionally, spiritually, physically, and otherwise.

I'm in a small fraternity at my college and my brothers always joke about how I'm weird and awkward (the price I need to pay for having cool friends instead of hanging out with the autism mafia) and no girl has ever shown any real interest in me.  I think I'm an ugly guy but my friends laugh at me when I say I'm ugly (the same laugh they give me when I say something stupid or embarrassing, like they think it's stupid that I think I'm that ugly) and I've posted on /r/amiugly and people said I look fine (which I take with a grain of salt) so I'm not sure what to think.  People told me to try anyways and I've never shown any interest in a girl without scaring them away.  Every time a girl turns me down or just ignores me in the first place I look in the mirror and see an ugly awkward guy and feel like a fucking retard for thinking that an interesting attractive girl would want an awkward guy with autism. 

Dating advice for people with Asperger's always talks about ""social cues"" and ""reading signals"" and never acknowledges the fact that people with Asperger's are usually really unattractive to begin with.  They always have weird voices and say weird shit and look kind of funny and I'd be arrogant to say I'm any different.  Everybody's advice is just ""be confident"" but I honestly think that if I had anything worth being confident about I would have met somebody by now or at least met a girl who would give me a chance for a first date or whatever.  People also tell me I'm too negative but I don't say negative shit around people when I first meet them at all and they'd probably think shitty about themselves too if girls treated them the way they treat me.  Sometimes they end up with guys who are just plain more handsome and more funny and just cooler in general than I am and I feel like I'm a retard who forgot his place on the social ladder.

Usually they ignore me right off the bat and if they show some sort of superficial interest (add me on Facebook, give me their number when I ask for it) I let it get to my head but as soon as I feel like I have a chance and maybe they don't think I'm a repulsive freak but as soon as I try to show any real interest they make an excuse or get uncomfortable and I feel stupid for thinking I had a chance, like I was totally out of line to think anything good out of myself.  I think I'm being totally rational: if I were not unattractive and uninteresting at least one girl would have shown some real attraction or interest in me at some point in my life.  Be honest, am I doing something wrong or am I just a shitty guy and its not worth trying to find a girl?

EDIT:  For the record, I'm probably going to be pretty negative and bitter in my responses.  I'm sorry for being dismissive of people who are genuinely trying to help me and I'm sorry if I come off as an offensive prick in general but I've heard just about all kinds of advice and none of it has worked for me so I feel like I'm at the point where any rational thinker would think negatively of himself.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,1357450381.0,,,True,t3_161mkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/161mkv/20_m_college_student_with_aspergers_used_to_think/,

And then like 2 days after she got home, I sent her a text asking her if she made it back ok, to which she replied.


And then after a week we met again. She recently moved (actually lives like 200 meters from me now) so we went on a date once she was settled in to her new place.


Had an awesome date, with dinner and then a walk by the water where we sat down and listened to some music, we kissed and just sat there for about 3 hours.


Then I texted her the next day just to tell her about this childrens program she had talked about the day before, she said she watched it when she was a kid, but no one never seem to have heard about it (including me, even though we are roughly the same age, me 26 she 28). Anyways I told her that I found the program online and that I downloaded all the episodes for her, so the following day she came over and we watched a couple of episodes and she spent the night.


The rest is history I guess, she was here for 18 straight hours on friday/saturday, and we go for walks like every other day or so.

I've posted here awhile ago, asking for advice, and got some good tips.  However, I am still running into the same problem.  


I am trying really hard not to seem desperate when interacting with women, however, in truth, I really am.  I started trying to date over two years ago with no success.  Through friends, hanging out at local social spots.  Online dating didn't work at all.  Before that, I spent all of college just working hard, having friends, enjoying my hobbies.  But even then, no relationships happened.  I seemingly fall in love with any girl who shows me attention, and it has ruined friendships in the past.

Now, I am just really lonely, and I really want to try to find someone before too long.  I already know the best way to become attractive to women, and eventually enter a relationship, is just to enjoy life, be confident, meet people incidentally.  However, I had 4 years of that in college, and high school if you count it, with nothing.  And now, I've spent almost two years putting an effort into dating... also nothing.  I know I'm young still... but 26 with no relationship experience is abnormal.

I don't know if I can manage more years of just ""acting cool"" and ""not worrying about finding someone"" in such a way that something happens on its own.  It could be years.  According to my track record, it could be never.  I am trying not to be miserable, get depressed when someone blows me off, or when they choose someone else over me for the N-th time.  Its just such an overwhelming feeling now every single time.

1335753693.0,28,self.dating_advice,sz4dq,Common-sense Online Dating Assumptions (x-post from r/okcupid),29,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sz4dq/commonsense_online_dating_assumptions_xpost_from/,"A few of the posts on reddit lately have got me thinking that a big issue with dating is that you don't know what the expectations are.  Now, to some degree, everyone's expectations are different--but after having been on 30+ dates or so that originated online, I feel pretty confident in trying to outline *expectations for mid 20-30something secular people who live in coastal/major metropolitan areas*.  Feedback would be welcome, especially from the female side; obviously I only have experience as a man.  ***I'm envisioning this as the start of a conversation, not the final word.***

1) **If I messaged you, it's overwhelmingly likely that I'm interested in you**.  Maybe 1 time have I found someone whose profile was so hilarious that I had to give them a shout-out even though we had nothing in common.  Corollary: Since I messaged you because I'm interested in you, you should only respond back if there's some mutual interest.  Personally, I'm not looking for okcupid pen pals, and I don't think many guys are--if they keep messaging you without trying to escalate things, they're probably just shy.

2) **I do not have extraordinary expectations for the first date**.  My assumption on the first date is that since we are strangers and have just met, you are not going to be perfectly comfortable with me yet.  We're maybe going to find some common interests and laugh about a few things.  Occasionally I do meet a girl that I have wonderful chemistry with (in which case I have no problem extending the date, going somewhere else, kissing you), but I do not expect intense romantic attraction on the first date, although I expect that we should like each other.  Because we have never really met before, we will likely split the bill.  Personally, I will always offer to pay, but because we haven't met before I will feel a little weird if the girl doesn't at least offer to split (granted, this is almost always a bar tab so it isn't a huge deal either way).

3) **My expectations for romantic attraction are higher for the second date.** We already know each other and the jitters are gone.  Now, for me personally (I don't think this necessarily applies for everyone) if there's no chemistry on this date, I won't bother to continue.  Since I asked you out and we already know each other, I will pay.

4) **If I ask you out for a next date, and you turn me down without proposing an alternative or a time to follow up or if there's no follow-up: I'll just assume you're not interested**, and it's an inartful brush-off.  It's ok, we're all just trying to figure this stuff out on our own, and it's complicated.  Examples of ""bad"" but interpretable behavior are not answering my calls/blocking my emails/etc.  I'd prefer if you didn't do that, though, so that I can get the message right away instead of leaving a couple voicemails like an idiot.

5) **Sometime within the first couple dates, I will try to kiss you if I'm interested.  If that's successful, I will definitely try to escalate things to sex by the third or fourth date** if things are going well.  Personally, I won't try to go for sex immediately after kissing you, but depending on how it goes, some guys may.  If I'm unsuccessful in escalating things, I will assume that you're not interested, unless you state some specific reason why you're holding off.  Most guys I know will try to propose sex within the first five dates, with the 3rd being a ""reasonable"" assumption.

6) Regardless of how many dates we go on, **until we have a conversation addressing exclusivity, I'm going to assume that you're seeing other people**.  Now, personally--if this doesn't happen within a couple months...that's a little odd, and if things don't seem to be going somewhere by two months, I'm going to break it off.  

7) **At any rate, until we have a discussion about ""being in a relationship""--we're not.**  I may be disappointed, but won't be especially torn up if you decide you're not feeling it within this time.  Conversely, if we've had a discussion about it--I expect that you will show me common courtesy and break up with me (at least via phone call, but preferably in person).


Now, of course, I tried to frame this into the broadest possible terms, distinguishing my personal expectations from what I imagine to be general expectations of guys my age.  I don't make any judgments on whether these are right or wrong, just that they're common assumptions.

What do I do?,32,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1frikp/super_low_selfesteem_got_rejected_by_my_good/,"TL;DR: super low self-esteem; had a thing with a guy that I hoped would turn into a relationship; put myself out there and got rejected; then learn that the guy and his friend kind of laughed about it while also feeling sorry for me. Am I just the loser that no one has the heart to tell to get lost?

This is really long, I'm sorry. I just am really struggling and could use some advice.

Background: 23f, in grad school, very limited dating experience because of LTR throughout high school and college

So, I am in my first year of grad school. When I started, I had a long-term boyfriend, but we broke up pretty early in the year. I'm not very social, but after the break up I made a concerted effort to go to events with my classmates from time to time to ward off loneliness and make friends. There was a guy in my class (""Joe"") who I would talk to from time to time at these events, and he was aware of some of my self-esteem issues and would never let me sit for too long by myself at the parties. It was sweet.

Over Christmas break, the two of us kept up a pretty constant communication, and it got progressively slightly more flirtatious. Once we got back to school, I wasn't sure what would happen. After the first week of classes, I ended up hanging out with just him and his friend (another classmate, ""Sam""); after Sam went to sleep, Joe and I ended up kissing and making out for a bit. He was quite drunk. The next day he brought it up and we talked a bit about it; he said it shouldn't happen again because he didn't think it was a good idea to date. I was disappointed because it was fun, but whatever. Then, though, it kept happening. Literally every weekend, we would end up back at my apartment. After a couple months, this led to sex. 

We didn't have another discussion about what was going on, we just kept being friends during the week and hooking up on the weekends. We were both discreet about it. I was afraid of what he would say, so I never brought our relationship status up, but kept hoping it would escalate at some point to a relationship. As the end of the semester neared, I realized that probably, if he were going to ask me out, it would have happened. But exams ended and he stuck around a few days, and we spent most of that time together. Things felt right and happy, and yet we still didn't talk about ""us."" Then he left, and the next day I got up the courage to ask him (after hours of agonizing over it), and he turned me down. It was the sweetest rejection, and he apologized for being too much of a wuss to talk to me about it because he liked hanging out, and he was sorry for hurting my feelings. I said that I suspected that was the case, but that I was admittedly pretty upset about it. 

I cried over it for about 15 minutes shortly after the rejection, and felt pretty awful, but he said he hoped we would still be friends and that I wouldn't turn into a stranger. By the end of the night I was texting him again, and have continued talking to him multiple times a day. He knows how depressed I am, and what low self-esteem I have, and I haven't really been hiding that from him too much, although I've been trying not to overload on it, because I do think he felt bad about hurting my feelings; but at the same time, he is a good friend and I am not the type of person to hide what I'm feeling very well.

So I have been dealing with the rejection and trying to move forward, and doing a decent job I think. That is, until I made a major mistake last night, and now I m doubting everything that happened with Joe, my whole place among my circle of friends, and basically my general worth as a person.

Essentially, I was hanging out with Sam, and while he was in the bathroom he got a text, and asked me to read it to him. I did so, and it was from Joe (not about anything substantial). I was curious, though, and scrolled up in the conversation a bit, and saw where they were talking about me. Essentially, Joe told Sam that I had asked him where our relationship was going, and that he felt bad having to start off his summer crushing someone who already has zero self-esteem. Then he asked ""who could've seen this train wreck coming,"" and Sam laughed about it. It ended with them agreeing not to talk to other people about it. 

I know I shouldn't have looked at the conversation, and obviously I am now suffering the consequences of my curiosity and nosiness. I am feeling super crushed, because now I wonder if the whole semester (when I thought at the very least we had a fun FWB thing going on), Joe just kind of felt sorry for me, but also didn't want to turn down the reliable hook up and drunken place to stay. I thought Sam genuinely liked me too, and thought of me as a friend. Were they just kind of shaking their heads the whole time, feeling sorry for me? All of my friends that I hang out with, I got in with by going out with Joe and Sam. I thought all of those people really liked me as well. Now I feel like the whole group just kind of felt sorry for me because they saw me as the loser that I am, and no one had the heart to tell me that I really didn't fit in. I wonder if looking back, did I just push myself onto these people and force them to hang out with me? I feel ashamed and self-conscious, and I want to hide in a hole and never see these people again, but I also miss my friends.

Today, I didn't text Joe or Sam at all, or any of my friends for that matter. I am too self-conscious. If I don't get any texts from them for a couple days, then I guess I will know that it really was just me forcing these ""friendships"" with people who were too nice to tell the loser to back off. I guess I was just too naive and hopeful, and I learned a hard lesson. What should I do about my friends? How do I keep my head up and hang out with Sam this summer, when I know he knows about my rejection and that he laughed about it? How do I recover from this?

We get along great, sex life amazing, and I've never clicked with anyone so well, ever.  We are both smart and seem to learn, act &amp; respond (most of the time) after fights and are able to work past it and resolve issues every single time.

So where's the problem?  He knows everything!  According to him at least.... but yes he knows a lot.  He's also had some training in debate which seems to match his logical analytical brain.  While I did the whole speech and debate thing in school, it's not my hobby. Neither is researching random things or living on google.  He's also studied relationships and communication in-depth.  

When we get into arguments he has this ability to turn off his emotion and ends up coming across like someone without a soul, ripping me apart.  I know better of course, but can't seem to ignore that and get past it to actually talk to him.  Between choice of words (usually very direct) and tone of voice (condescending), he leaves me ""feeling"" like I'm stupid and a terrible person that did everything wrong, caused the fight and shouldn't be dating him.  (I would like to add that when I tell him this he says that it is NOT at all his intention, so that last sentence was to explain how I feel not what he is meaning to do.) 

I love him the way he is.  Him knowing random facts about everything, and even how he loves to debate with people is fun!  It keeps me on my toes and thinking/researching before I speak.  

Question is: HOW THE HELL do I talk to him during an argument???  I feel like I should turn OFF some emotion, and he should try and turn some ON, just enough so he can tell when he's actually hurt me and when he's just being brutally honest, which I do need sometimes.

I have no one to act as a moderator, so when every argument starts with us discussing something or me bring up a concern ends with me sobbing and apologizing, and him giving me what feels like ""homework,"" that I have to work on to change my way of acting/thinking etc. I'm not sure if this is a communication issue or a serious relationship problem.  I repeat, he is not meaning for any of this to hurt me the way it does.  If we take a break for 10mins and revisit he is usually nicer and seems like he cares.  Is that the solution?  

People of reddit!  If you have his frame of mind PLEASE HELP ME.  How do I communicate to him on his level without 10 years of research like he has done on communication, psychology, debate etc???  He literally has said that he knows everything he can know on his part about communication and that I need to come up to his level.

The only idea Ive had Is maybe joining a book club. I did that way back when I was younger and had bad memories (mainly everyone in it was weird..like weird weird.)

My problem isn't just meeting women, but people in general and I don't know where to start.

High school was awkward, and during College I was very... academic, I guess.  Once grad school hit, and I finished my first year, I decided to work on dating.  I got in shape.  Learned a few useful hobbies.  Learned to cook.  Bought decent clothes.  Overall, invested in myself.  That was over a year now... and it's really not paying off.

'Cause I could be your queen :)

But no, seriously, it has become ridiculous how many close, guy friends I have that are by all standards hot, yet none of them has ever made a move of any sort. I've never had a lot of luck with men relationship-wise, and I had some serious issues in my teens (I'm 23 now), but when I got to college I became really interested in who people were beyond gender and their thoughts and ideas and I've built some rock-solid friendships since, some of which with amazing guys that I cherish beyond anything. But, it's just kinda weird for a hot, single male friend who lives on your block to call you late on a work night to watch a film over at his house, and you end up actually watching the film and discussing it in depth, until it's 4a.m. and you've spent a night fully clothed with an endlessly doable dude. This is just an example, there are constantly variations of this kind of non-booty calls. Not that I'm hot for any of my friends specifically, but even with guys I've started out being totally into, our social interactions have inevitably veered into beers with the gang instead of dates. It's like I have all of these surrogate-relationships, where I'd prefer to have an actual, sexual one. It's bitter-sweet in a way, to have all of these awesome people confide in me and stuff, but I can't help but wonder if we're so good together as buddies, what would happen if we dated? 

Like one of these friends said to me a while back, ""why can't more girls be like you?"" I couldn't help but reading that as ""if only you were hotter."" I told him there were more girls like me in the world, but he wasn't going to find them in all those seedy bars he's been frequenting, and we laughed it off. But it stuck with me, and since many people in my circle of friends have dated each other, and I never have, it got me thinking. I mean, I know I'm kinda plain-looking, but I feel like I've invested so much of my time in these friendships that I could have used to find someone to be with, someone more attainable, I guess. I have to stress that I would never make a move on one of my friends, that ship has sailed and I wouldn't risk it, they're just too important to me, and I'd lose them if I did.

Anyone in a similar situation? Any advice?",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_leip4,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/leip4/any_other_girls_out_there_with_a_permanent/,
1315494637.0,27,self.dating_advice,k8voj,Let me give you some tips on how to approach attractive girls,36,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/k8voj/let_me_give_you_some_tips_on_how_to_approach/,"I wrote this last year for 4chan, I think it's still relevant and could help a lot of you guys. 

&gt;I've spent the last weekend with a girl who some of us would call a perfect 9. (if you are shallow enough to rate girls). She's 18, blonde, blue-eyed, tanned, but not at all the californian Barbie Playboy type, she's a natural beauty with a gorgeous, jaw-dropping natural body, and a cute/childish face.
&gt;
&gt;I've learned a lot this weekend. I learned how you see the world when you're an attractive 18-ish girl (I'm a 24 male), how people react, how you would like to be approached etc., and I'll try to share most of my experience with you.
&gt;
&gt;My ex-girlfriend (who was a 7 at best) used to tell me how many guys tried to flirt with her, stared at her everyday and how *annoying* it was. I thought she was bragging and living in her little fantasy world (and laughed at her). Well, it's completely true.
&gt;
&gt;Even a mildly attractive girl, who dresses provocantly enough, will get a LOT of attention.
&gt;
&gt;Typical reactions from the guys:
&gt;
&gt;* staring at her from a distance (mostly face)
&gt;* staring at her breasts
&gt;* turning back to look at her ass
&gt;* saying shit like ""wow"" or ""damn""
&gt;* saying random words without really talking to her just to get her attention
&gt;* starting to walk beside her and to engage in a semi-conversation (creepy)
&gt;* if she's sitting, sitting with her and exchanging names, starting a conversation that goes nowhere
&gt;
&gt;She gets approached at the very least twice an hour.
&gt;Don't think guys are smart enough to have any class when they try to get her attention. Most of the guys are just completely rude.
&gt;
&gt;When she's approched:
&gt;
&gt;* if she's walking, most of the time she'll just ignore it, but it IS annoying, think at when you're walking close to a hobo and he tells you ""please, sir!"". Imagine a whole day with thousand of hobos trying to get your attention. You get the picture.
&gt;
&gt;* if she reacts negatively (even a ""no thanks""), she'll be called a whore or things like that. (well, she had to explain it to me, because whenever there's a guy around her, their balls seem to shrink a lot). So she just ignores them.
&gt;
&gt;* now this is interesting, quite a surprise to me: if she's sitting, and you come off as a nice guy, not as a danger (not arrogant, not clingy), even if she doesn't like you, she won't put you off in the first minutes. Just be friendly and smooth, if you don't know where to start, ask her what she's doing right now, even if it's really obvious, you'll get something to start with. If you're attractive and funny enough, you're good to go. Remember that she's already talked with zillions of guys before you, so try to connect with her and be interesting. 
&gt;
&gt;Now if she rejects you right away (almost never happens) it just means that she's busy doing something else or not in the mood (she's not necessarily a bitch, don't call her that). Worst case, you'll get to talk to her for a few minutes, enjoy it and don't be disappointed if you don't get anything else. Don't start with a goal in mind, just do it for the sake of the conversation.
&gt;
&gt;The bottom line is that the nerdy guy who doesn't have the gut to speak to her will never, ever have any chance with her. And you know what? She has a geek side. She made several references to Star Wars, we talked about old vidya games, and things like that. We also talked about litterature, painting (she's studying arts), and more serious stuff, she's a lot deeper than you would think.
&gt;
&gt;And it makes her sad because, guess what kind of guys hit on her all day long? 
&gt;Yup, the abusive, near-zero IQ muscular guy. Why don't they pay attention to you instead of them?
&gt;Because, they are as shy as we are, and they get millions of opportunities to get laid with good-looking guys all day long. So if you don't make the first step, they won't go through the trouble of talking to you.

As I see it, the ""friend zone"" occurs when guys start spending time with a woman who would have rejected them flat-out if they asked her out, but who is willing to spend time with them on a friends-only basis. It is the same thing as when you dudes have a good female friend you find totally unattractive, but a cool person to hang with. You are not disinterested in dating her because you've ""friend-zoned"" her, you are disinterested in dating her because you don't find her attractive.

I asked her on a date out of a combination of liquid courage and familiarity. I've known her for 3+ years, and we've been spending a lot of time together the last few months; we hang out together 4+ days a week, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends. She came over last night for a movie and some drinks. 

She [27F] accepted, then today she asked me [25M] about my motivation behind asking and mentioned her surprise at my move. Her statement was that since I am generally shy she was surprised I took the leap to ask her out. She said it's a side of me she's never seen, and it's not a bad thing. We chatted some more and I get the feeling she is accepting the date more to boost my confidence and less because she has any attraction to me. Truth be told she has never given any indication that we would ever be more than friends. 

So, any thoughts? Am I reading too far into it? How should I make it a night that stands out since we know each other so well? I can provide more info if there is anything I missed.

These girls I have been dating are pretty to kinda pretty all graduated from college like myself (just setting the background). 

For the past few dates, I went to either a restaurant or for a drink. When sitting down to order and talking for a bit when I ask them what they think they might get. They will usually say ""O idk do you know whats good here?"" or if its pizza ""Well why don't you pick out what you want"" or ""Hey its your call"". The same thing happened after this 1 date that was going well we went from a restaurant to a group of bars around where she lived (I didnt know of any good spots). When I asked her whats a good bar she replied ""Hey any place I guess""... 

I'm not sure if its a confidence thing with them? It does turn me off when I have to make decisions for them :/ . Reddit can you guys help explain this phenomenon please?

UPDATE:
I didn't think this thread would spark as much light controversy as it has, but in a good way. Before I thought of it as going someplace to meet someone and chat it out like a Q&amp;A session and hopefully we would click. I never thought of it from the girls perspective about how they do spend so much time in preparation for the date then the second side of how culture kinda turns some but not all women to act as mentioned. 
For the past few weeks I have been baffled by this thinking they were just not interested, just didn't know what to do or were as nervous as I was. That threw me off which hindered my confidence due to the unknown of it all. But since reading this you guys have helped me open up my views. Also to clear some stuff up I never was openly expressed that I was turned off or acted like an ass. I just figured we weren't going to click and was just polite until the end.

So I was wondering how you feel about the first dating stages. Would you ask a guy out, or is it 100% his responsability? First date, of a few after? When do you feel it's right to kiss, or when would you go for the kill and kiss him first?
Just for info, I see men and women as equals, except, we have other private bits, and a bit different culture about what we find important, which is obviously typical for genders (working at a construction site is typical for men, etc).
I'm dating this girl, I like her very much and I get the idea she likes me very much aswell. We don't rush things, and everything feels natural. Simply amazing, and I feel we are on 50/50 of initiation on things. She's classy, fun, and she was the first to ask me out. It was with an excuse ofcourse, but the second time she asked me directly (after which she said she didn't know how to ask me and was worried). I reassured her, after saying very clearly yes and had an awesome date! Afterwards I asked her out etc, but before I didn't really have the guts to do it, because I sometimes felt it mostly came from me, which suggested to me it's not mutual interest. It can be anything, even just initiating a conversation or whatever, it's the effort that counts. The things of ""hey, i think of you"" and the 50/50 effort as in ""We're in this together"".

(I have rebound brain so I might be all over the place). 

**TL;DR** *In the age of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and mopey male protagonist, is finding a real, nurturing adult relationship out of the question?*

So I'm generally a consistent relationship optimist- no breakup can get me down, I always dust myself off, hop back on the Cupid, start going out with friends etc.

But my latest breakup has me noticing some patterns and leaves me incredibly disheartened by them: I, without fail am always dumped with the ""you're better than me at most things, and you're happier than me, and I am intimidated by this."" Followed by an explanation of how he's ""trying to figure himself out"" and ""how I deserve someone better."" And that I am ""too nice"" to them. (These are all in scenarios where the exclusivity was initiated by the dude, so it's not like I was ""trapping"" them. It is also important to note that these dudes had prior relationships where their partner was borderline emotionally manipulative, but they stayed with them for years.) Same thing, every time, without fail, backstory inclusive. It's like they're coming off of an assembly line. 

Is it that our current generational ideal for modern masculinity is the self-involved neo-emo hipster, that finds self-hatred heroic? Are we as a generation of daters supposed to accept mix cds in place of actual fucking emotion? I'm beginning to think these displays of ""humility"" and ""self-awareness"" are really narcissism in disguise.

The thing is I *want* someone who challenges me. Everyone has something to share, so why can't these mope sacks just grow up and share them with me? Or am I bad at picking people who match up? (I've never dated someone who was in the same place in their career as me/OR at the least had the same level of ambition). 

Do dudes punish chicks for accomplishments/prefer chicks who string them along with drama? Should I just feign stupidity and be bitchy from here on out?? OR is this all in my head, and the things I listed are just things people just tell folks when they want to let them down easy?

**EDIT:** I am 26, hence the frustration- should someone just a few years shy of 30 have the same hang-ups as a college kid? Also, not sure if it matters- I'm a writer and comedy is my chosen path, with my actual-gigs-I-get-paid-for being pretty fun and flashy media marketing/pr type stuff.

A few weeks ago, a few people saw me around here asking for how to figure out if this girl likes me or not. This is the story up to now.

After looking around, and comments died off, I decided to use advice and kept on going as usual. I eventually felt asking her out was a good idea, but only got a ""I just want to be a better friend"" response.

Oh. Grand... Rejection number oh-I-forget-the-amount-of-times-I-have-been-rejected... an exaggeration, but it felt like that.

So weeks passed, I had practically given up until I noticed a classmate in gym who I talked to kept talking about how they haven't had anyone ask them out, how they want a relationship, blah blah blah.

I merely disregard it. After all, I wasn't the topic of the conversation.

Another week passes and I keep talking to her. She's a friend from sophomore year, we share homeroom together because our last names are so similar. We did stuff after school, and went out and did something together. (I suppose you could call it a date.)

About 3-4 days ago (Depends on if you count today.) I make a bold move to ask her out. Via text. Normally my brain would stop me, but I didn't. I wanted something more with her. We'd done things after school together, so there's no reason in not trying.

She merely replied in a text ""(: yes"" and I merely stopped.

My brain at first almost didn't accept the information. Had she been playing a cruel joke? No. She apparently wasn't.

My coworker [19m] had been flirting with me at work. I've allowed this, but didn't really indulge him. Yesterday at work he asked to hang out after and asked for my number. He texted; I suggested a movie. He agreed. I wore jeans and a new blouse. No cleavage, nothing suggestive.  

He showed up 10 minutes late from the discussed time. I let it slide. We get in the theater and he talked through the entire movie. He talked about all the things he could do for me like cooking and taking me out again, but never asked me any personal questions. I asked him personal questions to just try to get to know him if he's going to talk through the entire movie. Half way through the movie he starting holding my hand. In my mind it's quick considering I have hardly talked to him before this, but whatever I indulge him and hold it back. A while later he started putting his hand on my thigh. I let it slide. Then he puts his arm around me holding me close to him. Whatever he's just a little touchy. He then goes in for a kiss. I pulled away saying ""I don't know you."" He said, ""What else is there to know? I think you know the basics, but I understand."" I asked him more personal questions and I'm questioning to myself if this is normally how first dates work. The movie ends. 

He asked if I wanted to do anything after. I thought he realized that I wasn't looking for something physical and thought he might've just wanted to talk more so I said sure. We went to a gas station to get some sodas and in the station he's rubbing up against me and then he leaned in to kiss me again. This time I kissed back for a split second and then told him that it was inappropriate to do in a gas station so we left. I was going to drop him back off at his car to maybe talk before he left. 

As soon as I parked he learned in to kiss me again. I tried to back away, but he wouldn't let me. I finally was able to break away and I told him again that I didn't know him and it was best if he left then. He said no wait and started making out with me again. I again tried to back away, but he pushed himself on me. He grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch; I moved it away and then he tried to put me in his lap. I pushed him away and told him to leave. He finally got out of my car.

I don't understand if this is protocol on first dates now a days? I don't understand if I said something to make it seem like I was dtf? I did flirt with him and joke about sexual things, but obviously not very seriously and not about him. He had said some suggestive things to me, but I didn't say anything about it. Is this my fault for letting this go on too long? Does it seem like I could've done anything differently?

tl;dr: Went on first date with guy that I hardly knew. Let him hold hands and hold me, but later pushed himself on me. I had been flirty, but discussed earlier that I had hardly known him.

I could use some help.",31,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gm0h1/i_26m_have_never_kissed_a_girl_tried_to_start/,"I am a 26 year old guy, who has never really been in a successful relationship.  Throughout high school and college, I was more focused on friends and academics.  At the beginning of grad school, I was just way too busy.  Finally, I moved to a new place, have a great job, but I can't connect with anyone.  I am somewhat normal, in shape, nothing extremely wrong with me.  I have lots of interests and hobbies.  On paper, I have a great life.  But a lot of the time, I just end up really lonely.  As I see my friends and family getting married, having kids, I decided I want that too someday.  However, for the past year, I haven't really been able to make any progress on that front.

I have close friends, both male and female, although most of them live far away.  I've even had close calls in starting relationships with female friends, but there's always been something preventing it.  In my new location, I haven't really gotten too close to anyone, except work friends that I sometimes go out to dinner with in the evenings.  More recently, I've put a little effort into my look, bought nicer clothes, kept up my general appearances.  About a year ago, I started working out a lot, and I have a routine at home that I do several times a week, can run 5 miles, do 10 pullups, etc.  

I even tried hanging out in more social places.  I go to local concerts, hang out at a nearby coffee shop and park, try to get out more.  I just can't really seem to meet women in a dating sense.  I am not confident at all, and I'm extremely uncomfortable acting that way.  I can't really get myself to go up to women cold, and start a conversation.  I tried once going to a bar alone, and just forced myself to talk to people.  It was one of the most awkward experiences of my life, and I haven't really recovered enough to try again since. 

I tried online dating, OKCupid and Match.com.  I vetted my profile with /r/okcupid, and sent out maybe 70 or 80 messages using common, sensible advice for how to do so.  I get very few replies though, and none of them have led to dates.  I think I get filtered out a lot of searches or replies, since I am short (5'5"") and somewhat losing my hair.  I feel completely demoralized by this approach, and I don't think I have it in me to try another year of the online sites, and be disappointed week after week.

I just don't really know what to do now.  I'm started to get really lonely and depressed on the weekends.  I know I could force myself to keep trying.  In the beginning I was so sure that things would work out, since I had never really actually tried to meet anyone before, and I was a successful, well-adjusted, nice guy.  And then the failures kept piling on, month after month.  It's gotten to the point where I've begun to spend my evenings alone at home, feeling sorry for myself.

I just really want to find someone, but it just seems so far away from where I am at now.

1365789831.0,24,self.dating_advice,1c7xj8,My vegetarianism really seems to impact my dating life [22F]. Why is it such a major turn off for guys and how can I get people to see past it?,34,10,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1c7xj8/my_vegetarianism_really_seems_to_impact_my_dating/,"Background:
I'm a 22 y/o female who's been a vegetarian since childhood (about 17 years now). I eat dairy products and eggs, but not fish, chicken, exc. Most of my family and all of my friends are not vegetarian, so I'm not preachy about my lifestyle choice nor do I care if other people eat meat, I am not bothered by it in any way.
I'm not a picky eater aside from the vegetarian thing. I will taste and try anything and I tend to have a very spicy and flavorful pallet. I love going out and trying new restaurants.

Problem:
I'm finding that the vegetarianism is a major turn off for guys. We'll go out to dinner or lunch at a restaurant or something and we'll order food, I'm not picky in terms of taste so I can always find options at restaurants, or modifications exc that suite my needs. Never been to a restaurant I couldn't eat at yet. Through some ""what do you decide to get"" conversation, the vegetarian thing will come up.

The mention of me being a vegetarian is usually followed by something along the line of ""oh I'm sorry, is my meal going to offend you?"" or something along those lines. I explain that other people eating meat does not bother me. My friends and family do as well. Its a personal lifestyle choice but I think everyone should be able to eat what they like.

Typically I wish the conversation would end at this but guys tend to latch on to the veggie thing. I get questions of ""why are you a vegetarian?"", ""how do you get enough __insert random nutrient here__"" and comments along the lines of ""you must have a really hard time finding things to eat!"".

I always answer all the questions to the best of my ability and neutrally, even if they feel like they have to defend their food choices. I explain that I'm not a picky eater and enjoy a wide variety of foods and restaurants.

We can have a great date, but soooo many times I get a message the next day along the lines of ""Sorry, I don't think its gonna work out. I don't think I can handle the vegetarian thing."" How can I get people to realize this is just a food preference and to move past it?

tl;dr: my vegetarian lifestyle is turning off the guys I'm dating. Looking for some advice. 


Edit:

Thanks for all the insightful inputs. Many were actually very thoughtful and helpful. Some people made good points about the two separate meals. I guess this never really occurred to me because my family has just been doing this for so long its just kind of automatic. Spaghetti night: one pot with meat, one without exc. Or on nights like chicken, potatoes, veggies, I'll have the same veggies and potatoes and fry up some tofu instead. Its not really like two separate meals, just kind of like a substitution. But I can see if you hadn't grown up like that how this would seem like a lot of work. I typically avoid eating at friends' houses, with the exception of my very best friend who has known me for years, for that reason.

I wouldn't want to limit myself to just dating vegetarians. I've actually had a couple good relationships with non-vegetarians that ended for different reasons. I was just looking more for a first thought opinion, which I got. Thanks :)

As for the reason I am a vegetarian, I have one that I am sure of and confident in that I explain in full when I'm asked about it in person by someone who is legitimately interested. I have no problems discussing it, but its turned into a bigger deal than I thought it was in the past because I find myself defending myself from ""defensive omnivore behavior"" and guys (and girls for that matter) who feel like they have to defend their choices (I really don't care what you eat, I promise you don't have to defend your omnivore diet, so why care about what I eat?) . If someone wants to discuss it and is interested, I'm totally cool. Its when I get comments like ""well plants are technically living too you know.."", ""We are higher on the food chain and meant to eat them"", ""we have canine teeth so we're meant to eat meat"", ""why are animals more important to you than the overall well being of humans "" ex that I get frustrated (and yes I have heard each and every one of those).

We never slept together but were taking it slow and had good chemistry, although he admitted to having some ED problems. 


Only days after he met my friends and we had a good time hanging out, he grew distant, got kind of weird/rude, and then dropped off the face of the earth.

My friends and I have a few theories, the most likely of which is he is a sociopathic serial online dater. But I don't know. Dudes out there, if you've ever dropped off the face of the earth while dating someone, why did you do it? Would love anyone's insight. As an FYI I am 31 (f), and frankly feel a little too old for this type of immature ish.

I (M) asked out a co-worker of mine (F), a couple of weeks ago, we got to know each other at work, and have coffee together in the morning, a cigarette after, just small talk. Both of us are in our mid-twenties. (She's on reddit and may know my username, so throwaway!)


Conversation was:
""Hey, do you want to have a couple of drinks together tomorrow night?""
""Cool! Yes, that's fine! Maybe also RandomFriend1 and RandomFriend2 can join...""
""Well, actually I would like it to be just you and me, it's a date...""
""Well, uhm, err"" she then proceeded to give me a half-assed yes, most probably just out of courtesy.

I texted her the next day, just because we sort-of-agreed for a date for that night. I said something very random, like: ""Hey whatsup?"" and she didn't reply until the morning after. She excused herself and said that she was playing cards with friends and completely forgot about her phone. She didn't mention our ""planned"" ""date"".

So this girl does not want to date me, that's clear, I can move on... Right? I tried to be as polite as possibile with her, but of course I was thinking about slowly and gradually cutting off contact. We are co-workers, so we still see each other on a daily basis, I was thinking about a hello, two minutes small talk, and maybe a coffee once in a while.

Actually 3-4 days after that weekend she changed her behaviour a lot... She's definitely clingier, she looks for me very often, always asks me if I want to take coffee together. And she texts me for random reasons: ""I was at this concert, it was awesome, goodnight my dear!"", or ""I am listening to this song, listen to it, you will like it"", just random texts.

Last night we texted for an hour. I said to her that I'm taking a day off and going to the beach and she said that she would be glad to join me, she also feels tired and was thinking about getting a day off.

Of course we texted, we had coffee, we chatted BEFORE I asked her out, but now she seems generally more interested, and she is always initiating. Also, she is interested in everything I do, before asking her out it wasn't like that.

My question is: this girl said no (indirectly) when I asked her out. Just after this fact she changed and seems very eager to speak with me or to hang out with me. Is this normal? What does it means? Should I ask her out again at the risk of sounding silly? Or now the ball is in her field, and she needs to make her intentions clear, should she have changed her mind?

tl;dr: I asked out a girl. She said no. 3-4 days later her behavior changes she texts me for no reason, she is interested in everything I do, wants to join me for random activities. Should I ask her out again? Is it up to her to eventually say that she changed her mind?

She is never the one to initiate the sex.. never has been.  I asked her about that as well and she says she just isn't horny.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I ALWAYS make sure to get her off during sex.  Even when she's on her period I manage to get her off with rubbing her.

You can open your heart to someone but only if they are a good match. In order to know this it takes time to know them. 

Make 2 lists. These are the deal breakers.

1. Things your partner MUST have, 
2. Things your partner MUST NOT have (like an addiction). 

Your partner should meet everything in list 1, and nothing in list 2. If not, be realistic, move on. There should be no more than 3-4 things on each list. If there are more, you might be too picky or unrealistic. 

Talk about the MUST HAVE items on your first date, or earlier. Get the deal-breakers out of the way early. Does your partner have to join you in naked skateboarding? If so, ask them before the first date if it's that important to you.

Talk about moving in together when you want. But don't do it before dating for a year. 

NEVER put both people on a lease unless you are married. If things go bad and one has to leave, the other needs legal support to kick the leaver out. 

The most common topics couples fight about. Have a serious talk about these within the first 3 dates!

1. Kids. Do you want them? How many? How soon? 
2. Money. Are you a saver or spender? What about your partner? Will you have combined accounts or not? 
3. House. Buy new or used? Spend how much? Buy it how soon? This topic sort of falls under ""money"" and how to spend it.
4. Sex. How often do you need sex? What will you compromise on? What kinks do you and your partner have? 
5. Marriage. Do both of you want to get married or just be committed? 

**Communication is important.**

If a person cannot communicate what they want, they won't get it and they will be unhappy, and make the other person miserable. Also if both people cannot communicate and solve problems that come up (and they will come up) the relationship will not last.

A person with poor communication skills may not know what they want, or they may be hiding something. In either case, they might be suitable for short-term dating, but not for anything long-term.


**Problems**

Some problems in a relationship can impact many facets of the relationship. A relationship involves 2 people, so issues from both people comes into play here. These types of issues are very similar but I've tried to separate them and explain them.


**Insecurities**

Some people tend to be insecure by nature or by events they experience while growing up. The symptoms might include: frequent fights about small issues, getting jealous of members of potential rivals (girls might get jealous about other girls), nit picking, someone wanting to micromanage another person's life, etc.


**Maturity**

Older people tend to be more mature and better at communication, more calm, more able to talk about tricky subjects. Younger people tend to be less mature. But maturity is not strictly a function of age. Older people, those who have not learned from their mistakes, can be very immature. 


**Emotional baggage**

""Emotional Baggage"" is a term I use for issues that a person is very sensitive about. Maybe a person is not ready to say ""I love you"". Maybe they are not mature enough to understand or accept it. Maybe something bad happened when they were a kid and they abhor confrontation. They view talking about any delicate issue as a confrontation. Maybe they were sexually abused, so they are unable to have sex, or have sex with a lot of anxiety. These people often could benefit from professional counseling to help them change their way of thinking about these issues. 


**Mental illness**

Mental illness, untreated, can play havoc with emotions, and therefore, relationships. The trick is to recognize mental illness from just plain bad behavior. Because mental illness can cause bad behavior, bad thinking, and bad choices. Medications often help as do psychotherapy. But one cannot for a legal adult into either. The choice is theirs to fix themselves or not. 

This can be a painful issue if the person believes there is nothing wrong with them or refuses treatment, or even an attempted diagnosis. These things rarely get better without treatment. 

**Compatibility**

A relationship works better if the two people have compatibility on which to form a relationship. They should have things in common such as: 

* Politics
* Religion
* How they spend free time
* Views on life. 

**Attraction**

Of course attraction is part of the deal. There is mental attraction, and physical attraction. There may be more. But it helps if you are attracted to the person for some reason. What if you are physically attracted to them, but one of their bad habits really annoys you? You have to determine if this is a deal breaker, or if you can live with it. 


**Love**

As you get to know someone, emotions may develop. This is normal. But you have to keep in mind these items: 

* Your love will not change the person's bad habits. They have to want to change and want to do the work. 
* Your love will not change the incompatibility between you two. That is a fundamental thing that is mostly unchangeable.

Ok, so here's the story. I'm a performer in a local city. I do a lot of public shows and events on top of trying to hold down a day job. This makes dating pretty hard so I tried the online scene and wound up on OKCupid. I met a few people on there but most I just wasn't interested in and some I had a date or two with but no love connection. 

One girl I went out with a few weeks before valentines day.. I'll call her Lisa (36F). Lisa and I had been flirting on and off for several months prior, but had never met. Her status however had changed from single to seeing someone and back, deleted and new accounts several times. We were kind of like online friends. She had asked to go out a few times but it just never happened. Finally, I agreed to having a dinner and we met at a restaurant halfway between both our places. She was very attractive but the conversation was off but interesting. She seemed harmless enough and asked if she could go back to my place. She followed me to my pad and we watched a movie for a bit before the flirting began and we wound up making out. Things got a little heavy but we did not have sex. I just wanted to make that point. I said we should cool down, we finished the movie and the evening ended on a friendly note. 

within a couple of days, I got a few messages from her friends on facebook about what she expected me to buy her for valentines. What restaurant I should make reservations at, what flowers she did and did not like, etc. I thought it a bit presumptuous so I told her I wasn't making any plans for valentines. Well, she got upset and we argued. I wound up deleting her and her friends from my facebook. A couple weeks passed and she contacted me to apologize so we talked a bit and I agreed to be friends. I re-added her on FB and she went out to a few of my shows.

At the shows, she would come up and say hi, maybe flirt a little (yes, I asked her not to but she seemed harmless) and then after a few minutes would go away until she came to say bye at the end of the show. I didn't think it was a big deal. We never saw each other for a date, never did anything after the events and never talked on the phone. Just FB texts and her saying Hi/Bye at shows.

So, 2 months ago I met someone at Friday night show,I'll call her Cindy. We really hit it off, she was gorgeous, smart, funny and literally swept me off my feet. One thing led to another and before I knew it we had spent the whole weekend together. Word got out to Lisa that I had spent the weekend with Cindy and Lisa totally flipped out. She messaged everyone of my friends she could get a hold of and started posting on my wall about how I was a player and an ass. She accused me of dating multiple women (keep in mind, I only knew Cindy for 3 days), using and abusing women and hinting that I was spreading STDs. Pretty much anything she could come up with. She blocked me but not before messaging every woman she could find on my FB page. 

Of course, some people took the bait and others laughed her off. Some people we knew in common told me this continues to this day with Poems/notes/posts about what an ass I am. When some of them called her out on it, she made a new anonymous account and sent out another round. Everyone knows it's her because of her speech mannerisms and, well, as far as I know she's the only one who dislikes me.

The kicker is she sent a couple of threats to Cindy and even though I explained the situation, it was enough to rock our very new relationship and it fell apart. She had dealt with crazy exes before and didn't want to go through it again. I don't blame her.

 I logged into my OKC account and noticed she's been visiting it. 
 She's shown up to a couple of our events and just stands there watching me.

So, even though Lisa and I have never dated, she's managed to ruin my new relationship and shows the potential to ruin future ones as well. She's become the crazy ex that never was. Because I don't know her, I don't know how to deal with her.

How do I handle this? It's completely stressing me out and wrecked what I felt could have been the start to a great relationship.  I have no direct proof that these new anonymous emails are hers. She's not threatening me at these shows so I can't have security kick her out. She hasn't threatened me directly, just those around me. I consider myself a fairly quiet and nice guy and have no idea what to do. Do I confront her (making me the bad guy)? do I wait for things to blow over? am I just fucked?

We arranged our day off at the beach together, half an hour later she said that a friend of hers would be tagging along.

I leave the house around 7am usually and I don't come home until 8-10pm, so I'm not a shut-in. I'm either in class, in the library studying/reading, at work, or training.

I've approached many girls in the library, but only a couple have been remotely interested, and I got their numbers, but I can tell when I call that they're not very excited to hear from me, and it never leads to anything.

I was really into this one girl at work. Saw her sitting in the dining hall alone a couple weeks ago, so I asked to sit, and talked to her for a while. Asked her out at the end, but she has a boyfriend.

The gym is my main source of friends and where I do most of my social interacting, but even then, it's like everyone is already in their little on-campus cliques and I'm just sorta there once in a while. My sport(powerlifting) isn't one that attracts much female attention, so there's no help there.

I'm not nervous at all about approaching anyone. My confidence is at an all-time high. I'm a weird combination of a quiet, nice computer nerd and revved-up meathead, and I think it's a good thing. I like me, no one else seems to.

I guess I'm supposed to be going to parties/concerts or bars or something. I don't find the whole college party atmosphere very appealing. I do really enjoy sitting at a bar and talking to people, but I'd rather not drink as it negatively impacts my training. 

I would like to try volunteering or something just to meet people, but I don't have the time. Is there something I haven't mentioned that people do that I don't know about?  How many girls does a normal dude have to talk to to get just ONE date?

4 dates with the guy (33/m) in question. I had to break it off. His 1 bedroom apartment was a disaster (he lived alone). I am a professionally creative person, so I understand how creative spaces can be. I am also not overly neat or agitated by disorder or clutter. But honestly, this was beyond reasonable. Dust, a LOT of dust everywhere, tons of books, the counters were filthy, the bathroom was just gross (how does the bottom of a bathtub get to be black?), I couldn't even concentrate on a conversation with him while standing in his apartment. 

I gave him the benefit of the doubt regarding his space (while dating), but I just couldn't handle it. Had to stop seeing him. I felt bad, because I did like him, but I didn't feel comfortable (read: not unsafe) just not 'at ease' while there.

Have you dealt with this? Initially my decision felt petty, but I just couldn't handle dealing with his space.

The alternative suggestions are to just not meet/visit his place, but logistically, his apartment was more central to our dates (as opposed to mine), so inevitably, we'd end up hanging out there. And since we were only a few dates in, it didn't seem like my place to say anything about it. He is clearly comfortable living in his space, and while it's not for me to judge, I just couldn't deal with it any longer.

We have spoken about the topic of sex and have had numerous counts of phone sex but have not yet done the physical deed. We had planned to make it a memorable first time together during a date.

Things have been getting strong between us to the point where we both like and trust each other immensely, and want our relationship to work.
Earlier today she sent me a text saying she has something deeply personal and important to tell me before I went to bed tonight. So, like a good boy I waited for her phone call before going to bed for the night. She calls me up in tears explaining that a couple of months ago she was slipped a spiked drink and taken advantage of, where she contracted Herpes.

She felt that it was unfair for her to have contracted such a STI unwillingly and felt it only fair that I know before we did anything serious. She knows that I take pride in being clean and I told her that I respected the fact that she showed me great care, trust and respect to come out and admit such a horrible thing.

She told me that she wanted me to know before we did the nasty because she cared for me enough to want me to have the logical choice as to whether I want to continue things or not.

She has, in her words, given me a decision with an 'out'.

She has let me go for a few days so I can mull it over and get back to her.

I am, as of now, stuck between two minds. My emotions and logical thought, My emotions tell me that I really like this girl and would like a future with said girl as she has been and is just fantastic to me. My logical mind tells me that even if I use a condom with this girl I still stand a chance of catching herpes, which I don't like because I have experienced condoms that break mid cloitus and I have a pride in being clean. And even if I did chose to stay with her and use condoms, things may get serious in the long run and the talk of procreation may arise, meaning I would need to bite the dust and get Herpes. But that is just a possibly crazy long term thought, but still a thought nonetheless.

So, Reddit, I need your help and advice. I deeply care for and respect this girl as much as she does me but with recent news I now find myself thinking as she has given me a 'out' should I chose to take it.
Please feel free to ask me any questions about this as long as they are not overly personal and can be used to identify us.

TL;DR - New relationship with a girl, we both like each other very much, have not yet had sex. She has opted to tell me that she has Herpes and has the respect for me to tell me and to provide me with an out should I want to take it. I am stuck between two minds, emotional and logical and need help and advice.

My daily commute consists of biking or walking through/past a campus (I don't really feel like saying what university) to get to and from work.  Over the past few weeks, this one guy has caught my eye.  I'm pretty sure he is an engineering grad student (um, I awkwardly eavesdropped on a conversation once...), and he is ADORABLE.

I have no idea if he is single or not, but I want to ask him out to coffee or something!  Is it possible for me to do this without seeming like some crazy girl?  (...Am I crazy for wanting to do this, since I don't even really know him??)  Right now, all I can think of is ""smile and say hello"", but I am not sure how to turn that into a full-on conversation.

If my life was a movie, tomorrow I would carry around a huge stack of books in my bicycle basket, and he would walk out of a building just as my book tower would tip over.  And then he would help me pick all of them up, and then he would compliment me on my choice of reading material, which would turn into some nerdy literary discussion, and then I would ask him out.  Or: it would be raining, and I would offer him space under my umbrella so that he wouldn't get drenched, we would talk on the way to his next destination, and then I would ask him out.  Aaaaahhhh, why can't it be as easy as that?!  

Do you have any advice?

Most of all, I wish some of the women of reddit would stop antagonizing men who complain about getting friendzoned.  Sure, there are some guys who treat dating like a transaction that should result in sex (they're called 'douchebags' where I come from), but these sweeping generalizations I've been reading are caustic.

Men, believe it or not, are fully capable of love.  That means we can care about a woman and want to be with her, and be disappointed if we get rejected.  I don't think most friendzoned guys walk away saying the girl they've been trying to get with is a bitch.  There is more to a romantic interest than sexual desire, and it disgusts me to see my sex regarded as a purely aggressive, selfish, carnally-driven gender.  We can be caring, chivalrous, and patient.  But sometimes that doesn't make the difference we hope, because relationships are not transactions.

Please, people: be supportive, encourage the friendzoned guys to move forward, but show some compassion.  Don't make assumptions about people's intentions when we hear about the friendzone.

I'm apologizing in advance for the length of this post.

A couple days ago it was unseasonably warm out during the evening, so I decided to walk down to the grocery store to pick up a few snacks. On my walk down, I bumped into a friend-of-friend's, a girl who I'll refer to as Sarah. I hadn't seen Sarah in a few weeks and always got along well with her, she and I had even worked together on the artwork for a small publication I was writing (I won't get into that). So, I asked her to get a drink with me and, quite frankly, to my surprise she said yes.

We went on to have a really good night. We went back and forth hardly able to believe we were into some of the same things (we're both interested in the histories of serial killers and actually share the same favorite, stuff like that). She mentioned *several times* that she didn't work the following day and that we should watch Dexter, too. Needless to say, things were going well!  However, one drink turned into several and she invited me back to her apartment. 

Obviously I agreed to go back with her, because I'm a human being, but I have to admit I was a little torn over it at the time. I think, or thought as the case may be, really highly of Sarah and I was legitimately interested in perusing something with her, so I was a little hesitant to rush things. I digress; We went back to her apartment, wherein we laid down on her bed, made out for a few minutes and then she passed out.

**perfectly understandable** it was like, four in the morning, we were both drunk and I'm not the type of person that tries to obligate someone into sex. So we spooned and fell asleep. At about seven the following morning she woke up and shook me awake, as well. She then continued to stare at me for a few moments in total silence, which prompted me to ask if she was all right?

From there she told me that she was really hung over and didn't want to hang out right then and I offhandedly mentioned that nothing happened during the night. Confused, I began getting my things together. Once I was about to leave I mentioned hanging out again in the future. Her response was to lie down with her head in her pillow. I called her later in the day, she ignored it. I also sent her a text the day after, which was also ignored. Now I'm just keeping my mouth shut, I figure any more attempts to get in touch would just annoy her.

This makes the third time this basic situation has happened to me. I've run through that night/morning one hundred times in my head. I really liked this girl, **things were going so well** and I can not figure out just what the fuck happened.

To boil down my question(s); Is this something that... just happens sometimes? Is Sarah completely insane or am I completely oblivious, or is it something in between? I would really appreciate any insight on this.

**TL;DR Met a girl I've known for a while for drinks and things went incredibly well, until she invited me to her place (no sex, just kissing) only to give me the serious cold shoulder in the morning.**

**EDIT** Well, I've been up all night mulling over the fine advice I've been given. I'm feeling (as I may have mentioned in my comments earlier) a lot better about the whole situation and I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for their feedback. So thanks, everybody! I am, however, still open to suggestions or commentary, so please feel free to weigh in.

**FINAL UPDATE** To anyone interested in seeing the resolution of what can be fairly called a full scale debacle , here you go. It would seem that my hand has been forced by a third party. It came to my attention last night that the mutual friends Sarah and I share had taken it upon themselves to **call Sarah and berate her** for, in their words, ""how she treated me"". It goes without saying that this signifies the end of this ordeal, Sarah has a fervent hatred of me now (as she assumes I provoked our friends into yelling at her and won't hear my side of the story). I want to make it a point to say just how **UTTERLY EMBARRASSED** I am of how this situation played out, though I am somewhat touched that my friends are so zealously willing to come to my apparent defense (regardless of whether or not their involvement was actually requested...). In short, game over, I'm moving on. Thanks again to everyone, I appreciated the advice and I feel as though this was all rather cathartic. Hip-hip-hooray for reddit.

We met online and things were absolutely amazing. We had this ridiculous emotional and physical connection, and ended up with some pretty powerful feelings for one another. I wanted to date her exclusively and start a relationship, but she wasn't ready to commit. She wanted to keep dating other guys and get physical with them as well.

She hooked up with a guy one night and I just couldn't take it. I told her I can't see her anymore because I have feelings for her and it's just too much. She told me she would be exclusive with me because she didn't want to lose me from her life. I accepted, but shortly after I noticed she was hesitant and giving me mixed messages. She ultimately admitted she can't give up the promiscuity and isn't ready to commit to me.

I just couldn't handle dating her while knowing she was with other guys, especially when I had such strong feelings for her. My options were either to continue dating her, in constant emotional pain because she won't commit to me, or I end things and break all contact with her. I chose the later option, because I just couldn't go on feeling like shit all the time. I told her last night that we can't speak or date anymore. I don't know if this was the right or wrong choice, but I just know I wouldn't be able to handle the alternative, no matter how strongly I felt about her. Well *especially* because of how strongly I felt about her...

I haven't had a lot of experience with casual dating. I've been in loads of relationships, but I would always meet a person, we would date exclusively and either commit or decide to break things off. I don't think I will ever knowingly enter a situation like this again, but I also want to keep dating and meeting people.


My questions are:

1. Has anybody been in a similar situation? If so, how did you react? Do you think my choice was justified or am I being a complete baby?

2. How do you handle casual dating? CAN you handle it? How do you stay emotionally distant from people you really like?


Casual dating is supposed to be fun, but the whole experience made me feel horrible. I felt guilty for doing that to her, and I felt like my jealousy and feelings about her choice weren't normal. I would really appreciate some input from anyone that has been in a similar situation.

I'm always down to take in new perspectives.

So, Friday I'm at the bar, beautiful girl is getting a lot of attention from males. She keeps looking at me. Walks by, I say Hi, do I know you? She's like yeah you look so familiar. Turns out we can't figure out how we know each other but there was instant intense attraction, lots of touching, she was actually holding my hand while we talked and the other guys she had been getting attention from were staring us down. 

We talked about how we should hang out some time but never got her number because I found out she's good friends with a close friend of mine and she said she'd get us to all hang out soon. I told her about a show going on the next day she should come to. She shows up and it's instantly the same thing, lots of touching and talking, lots of flirting, very obvious that we're interested in each other. 2 days later I get a call from my friend that he's hanging out with her and I should come by. I come over and everything is just going so perfectly. I'm on it. She's very receptive. We figure out so many things we have in common. She's like glowing. Then my friend goes to sleep and she tells me she can't stop thinking about me, jumps me, we end up making out and rolling around in the grass for a while, take her back to my place, tell her I don't want to have sex with her because I don't want things to move to quick but I'd love to cuddle. We go back and cuddle and kiss for hours, looking into each others eyes, touching each other all over. I pass out with her on me, wake up 4ish hours later and kiss and snuggle for another few hours. Drop her off the next morning and went to work really late with about 4 hours sleep.

I purposefully didn't get her number so that she'd have to make the next move of calling our mutual friend and getting him to call me. Also, it prevents me from the urge to text / overthink situations involving texts, which is something I'm not great with.

I think I did pretty damn well. She said that I'm the best kisser she's ever been with, she's super attracted to me, she was like completely crazy about me in all the best ways. She told me that me telling her that ""I don't want to have sex for yet, only when the moment seems really perfect, because I don't want to mess anything up, we need to be mature about this and sex can make things complicated."" was one of the coolest things a guy has ever said to her. I haven't talked to her since I dropped her off Tuesday morning, where she clumsily stumbled out of my car in some sort of love-stricken daze because she was looking back at me. Can't wait to see her again. Can't believe I've handled it so well so far, gotta keep at it though. I guess it's important for me to use this down time between interacting with her to really ask myself the question do I want to get into something really serious right now? Because that's the path we seem to be on.

**tl;dr** I think I might have stumbled upon something really special. Everything about it has been really easy and amazing so far. Feel very natural / myself around her, she really digs me.

I have known her for a long time, but as life sometimes goes, we went in our different directions after school and didn't see much of each other at all for a few years. 

But it just so happened that we ended up living in the same town recently, and have been catching up. I have always held this girl in very high esteem in my mind, and have always liked her a little more then friends normally would. But we were always dating other people back in the day, and I just never really saw an opportunity with her. When we started hangout out again, I noticed I still thought the same way about her. I had plans on telling her how I felt, but something came up that knocked me flat on my ass, testicular cancer. 

At some point before my nut was removed, she could tell I was distraught(she reads me like a book), and I told her about it. She was nothing but amazing, being very supportive, and even taking care of me after my surgery because I was more or less bed ridden for a few days. Now, due to the fact that my blood test show high levels of tumor markers(scans show no masses, thankfully), I need to go through one to two rounds of Chemo. 

Now this whole cancer thing has been a giant monkey on my back from my perspective. I want to let her know how I feel, but something in my mind tells me to wait until I am in remission(I have excellent odds). This ordeal has affected my self-confidence quite a bit too, which really adds fuel to this indecisive fire, for I have never really been a worry wort when dealing with the opposite sex, but I feel like my current state of mind is clouding my judgement.

So I took the advice of a few redditors and finally took her out to a REAL date. Saturday night, wore a polo and khakis, Olive Garden dinner, the ""shabang"". We texted throughout the week, mainly about logistics, but some about what was ""up"" or how things were going. 

Saturday night I pick her up and the car ride over is mainly talk of the easiest way to get where we were going. Not too bad though. We're seated as soon as we get there (reservations ftw) and when we sit down, it happens again. We start talking and it eventually dies when she only offers me one word responses. A few times she asked me something and I answered as fully as I could, but I would ask her the same thing, or some follow-up, and she'd give me the minimum. Dinner lasted less than 35 minutes thanks to how fast Olive Garden serves you and what little conversation we had. 

After the date, I ask her if she'd like to go on the riverwalk and she accepts. We walked for about 40 minutes, again, barely scratching the surface of any real conversation. I eventually get the courage to hold her hand. I don't know if this is typical but I'm used to hand-holding closer to the body. My hand in hers is right next to my hip and she extended her elbow so there were still a few good inches between us. This, along with zero conversation, makes me feel like the date is going south. We get in the car and I ask if she'd like to do anything else (I honestly thought those two things would take a couple of hours on a good date) and she says that she should probably go home. 

I take her back to her place and this is the final test: the goodnight kiss. My prospects were low but I had to try. We both say we had fine, we both smile, I lean in, and she stops me. She says she's unsure of it but that she is flattered I would want to kiss her. Well damn. We say goodnight and our date is over after less than 2 hours. 

Afterwards I went to a friend's St. Patrick's Day party to occupy the rest of my night and around 10 she texts me saying, ""Thanks for tonight! I had fun."" Now I'm very confused.

I've talked to my friend's about this and they think if I feel like it's going nowhere I shouldn't feel so bad but I'm still unsure. Should I keep trying or throw in the towel?

[Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18uvwp/update_im_24f_never_been_on_a_date_never_been/)

I should have asked you guys for red flags, because now I feel like I've put myself into a position where I'm about to be the ultimate bad guy.

I don't even know how to explain what happened. Here's a rough timeline:

- we find each other online, exchange messages
- messages get pretty long - ok he likes to talk a lot, I reply with long ones at first but it begins to get waaay too much and I start to shorten my replies
- we seem to have a lot in common so we go on a date. Prior to date #1 he's already making plans for future dates
- date went well, I felt friendship but no 'chemistry'. I chalk this up to a) being new to this whole thing, and anxious and b) not being attracted to people upon first meeting them (possibly demisexual, see original post for more details). He's a nice funny guy, lots of similar interests though, so I schedule date #2
- between date #1 and date #2, numerous LOOOONG messages (mostly from him, I would wait a couple of hours to respond and wouldn't write nearly as much - he would respond the second he saw them). He's super into me. Super, super into me. I'm amazing, I'm awesome, I'm fantastic, we get along so well, he can't wait to hang out again etc. I've never, ever had someone tell me this. So I'm flattered, but also weary and suspicious. He mentions possible ideas for dates #3+ since we get along *so well*
- date #2 happens. we talk more about shared interests again, get to know each other more, nothing too spectacular. And then I drop the bomb - I haven't been in a relationship before. He doesn't make a big deal out of it, says he's totally fine with going slow. Wow, what a good guy.
- And then after a bit more chitchat he's suddenly talking about marriage and kids (half-hypothetically, half using our last names..). Future plans. I tell him where I'm planning to travel two years down the road. He says he'll pack up and follow me. I'm going to a place four hours away for work in a couple of months. He'll drive down every weekend to see me. Every time he mentions this long-term stuff I get very awkward, but I'm not sure how to respond, so I just laugh.
- he says he'll disable his dating profile now that he's met me. I said I would too..
- We take a taxi home and he cuddles a bit. Okay first time I've experienced that, it's kinda nice. But no butterflies, no sparks, no chemistry. I'm leaning on his shoulder, but getting more and more uneasy. I chalk it up to nerves again, and my own inexperience.
- Get home, see a message saying what a good time he had, when are you free for date #3? I respond thanking him as well and telling him what a good time I had, and that I'm looking forward to date #3.
- And then the fucking doozy: he replies back saying that the good times won't end! That this is how it will be from now on, that sure we may have disagreements over stuff in the future but we'll get through it! All because I'm the best. ALSO, here's the plan for date #3 and date #4

**WHAT. THE. FUCK.**

And suddenly all my doubts and anxiety that I chalked up to be inexperienced become validated. He's a nice guy, he's a good guy, he's a cute guy, but he's so desperate. I'm stifled, he's invested too much too early. I'm spooked. And the worst thing is, THE WORST THING IS, I have given him NO INDICATION of my doubts, not a single time over 20+ messages and two dates. I didn't know how, I didn't know how to criticize people, the only thing I do when I'm uncomfortable or disagree with someone is stay silent or laugh a bit to dispell my own tension. The only thing semi-direct thing I've done was try to de-escalate his enthusiasm: 'Oh it's really early, let's see how it goes before planning more dates etc.'

So now what fucking happens? He's out for drinks with his best friend now, celebrating that he found me. And at this point right now, I feel like I'm going to message him tomorrow and break it off. After I had already agreed to another date. It'll come out of the blue, it'll be a punch in the gut, it'll fucking break him, he'll think he completely fucked up from the most recent message when in fact it had been a culmination of things I was too naive to see. WHY did he get so invested so early WHY. I hate being mean to nice people. I hate it. I fucking hate it.

Am I doing the right thing? How the hell do I do this?

Hi,

So there's this question that keeps popping in my mind. I keep wondering if it is okay to have sex before marriage. Now I have been raised in a pretty conservative family, where we are taught to not have sex before marriage. But it seems that 95% of people do not follow that, and maybe I am just being delusional into thinking that I will find my beautiful princess some day. I am really confused on what my opinion on this matter is. I mean here's the thing. If someday I meet a girl who I have a really great chemistry with, but she is not a virgin. I will be really disappointed, and saving myself would have all been for waste. In this day and age, it is not practical to be a virgin until marriage. What do you guys think?

I recieved some great advice from people in this subreddit and askreddit, and I would like to thank you for that. You guys are wonderful.

I was advised to do many things: talk to my parents, lie to her, go out with her regardless, tell her the truth. I like this girl and I definitely didn't want to lie her; she was probably in the same position as me given that she had never been on a date before either. So I decided to email her. 

I told her that I was almost 17 and I was interning at the college for the summer. I told her that I was pretty luck to meet her on the bus and I knew that I would regret it if I didn't ask out a girl as cute and interesting as herself. I also told her that this was the first time I had ever asked a girl out. I mentioned that I was a bit surprised to find that a cute girl like her has never been on a date before. I then told her that I am comfortable with the age difference if she is and that I really meant it when I asked her out. I said that she shouldn't have to skip work to go on a date, and that we can organize it out. I told her that I think that we would really have fun going out and that I hope that she is still interested.

She emailed me back later today. She told me her name and that she was 20 years old. She was a bit lighthearted in her email because she included a haha. I'm probably just over analyzing. Anyways, she said that she really appreciated my sweet words. However, she said that although she agreed on the bus, she doesn't think that it will work and that the age difference will be too much. She apologized.

I sent her a reply. I told her that I thought she was a great person and that I was sorry that it couldn't work out. I told her that I completely understand and that I hope that there are no hard or awkward feelings. I apologized for misleading her and anything else. I told her that this was the first time I had asked a girl out and that I got caught up in the moment. I told her that I might see her around campus this summer and I wished her the best.

I personally think that I came on a bit strong in the first email, but I am glad that I told her the truth. I think that this was a great experience for me because it taught me that it is okay to sometimes be outgoing. I had always heard that women appreciate confidence in men, and now I know this to be true. I think that this experience has changed me for the better. I just hope that she does not feel bad about being mislead. If I ever see her again and if it isn't awkward, I'll apologize in person.

TL;DR: I told her the truth in the email and asked if she was still interested. She was 20 years old. She politely declined and apologized for changing her decision. I told her that I completely understood and apologized too. I told that I hope that there are no hard feelings and wished her the best of luck.

I don't like loud places like bars, clubs, etc. because it gets on my nerves and makes me feel stressed and tired very quickly.
I don't like drinking alcohol and I find it pathetic to have to resort to that in order to approach and bound with a girl (this applies to most posts on this subreddit btw). I handle alcohol alright, but I just don't like the idea nor the consequences, so I'd rather avoid it altogether.

How do I ask a girl out considering that? How do I even get to meet girls? It seems most young people these days only go to loud places, get drunk (for lack of things to talk about?) and waste precious time to actually socialize?
If I know that a girl I'm attracted to is used to go to clubs at night, what sort of activity could I suggest when asking her out?

  Here are some things I notice:



  Looking for dates on reddit. On average, for every 24 M4F posts, there are 3 F4M posts. The F4M posts have 30-40 comments. The M4F posts have 0-3, and most of the time they are simply comments from other men. 



  Looking for dates on OKCupid. Women don't appear to ever actively search for other profiles. I have had my profile up for about a year, I never have my profile visited, or messaged by a woman. Unless I messaged them first. Now on the other hand, a female friend of mine made a profile, and got 22 messages within the first week. Women seem to get so many messages, that 95% of the time they will not reply to them. 



  Looking for dates in real life, it seems to be built into society that the man is supposed to ask the woman out. There seem to be twice as many single men as women. 




  So im wondering... Why? are women simply more contempt with being alone? or is it that men are infact emotionaly different from women, and feel the need to find a companion in life?

I've never had a girlfriend, never been intimate with a girl - nothing!. One of the things that's kept me from pursuing anything with a woman is my horrible anxiety. When i got the mail from her about if i wanted to meet her this friday i suddenly started to shake being so nervous, a hundred thoughts racing through my head. I literally shake for minutes it's so bad and if i'm getting the shakes just knowing im going on a date how the fuck am i going to be able to actually do anything when i get there, let alone get physical with her if it comes to that. 

I dont know if this is the subreddit for these things but has anyone here had some experiences with this?. I seem to be so nervous i get physicly ill / naceous(?) and start to shake.

For most of my adult life I'd had sex only inside of long-term committed stable relationships.  Now that I'm dating again, I'm *not* closed to love but wouldn't mind getting into some naughty trouble on the way.  

Lately I've been going on a ton of dates via an online dating service.  Emotionally, my dates have been near-hits.  I saw one woman four times and her *favorite* topic was sex.  She had a great deal of confidence in this area and said she regularly had NSA sex.  But for some reason, she saw me as a love interest.  (I'm assuming it's because I explored the topic when it came up rather than escalate the sexual tension) So I kept in touch with her and a week later, she breaks it off.  (4 dates, 3 weeks in)

She had said some things while we were dating that really made me think ""This girl is super cool, but we'd never succeed in a relationship, she's super sexy and I wish we could just fool around.""  And at a few points, I'm pretty sure she thought the same thing.

But of course, like most sane guys I *hate* coming off as a scumbag and I have *no* clue how to put off an air of ""I'm not a douchebag, I'm not shallow, but I'd really like to screw tonight.""  I seem to have a small record where I go down a romantic road with (3rd,4th or 5th sexless dates) people who I'm interested in having sex with when I know it won't work romantically because I don't know how to send the right signals.  I feel like it wastes a ton of time, it's dishonest, and it's hurtful.

I am in college and at my school girls SIGNIFICANTLY outnumber boys, so it should be possible right? you would think it's because i never went out or partied and holed myself up in my room on the weekends, but that is NOT the case at all - i've drank and done more drugs than i care to admit. i'm very shy and naturally introverted, but i appear normal on the outside and have gotten a lot better interacting with people since high school, but i still seem to be a loser. i feel people laughing behind my back...

and i know there have been girls interested in me, but trying to talk to them just went nowhere. i don't understand why. i'm not a pompous douchebag or cocky bastard, i'm one of those ""nice guys"", i like to listen, but whenever i try to talk to a girl (even if we're really hitting it off) nothing happens! the one exception was when i was 19 i got to make out with a girl one time, but she ditched me for an ex boyfriend when we started to get close (she wouldn't have sex with me so soon)...and i really liked the girl too. 

that's as far as i've gone. i just get so fucking nervous and have panic attacks at the thought of screwing up and embarrassing myself. i had to be put on prozac, clonazepam, and ambien because it all started to affect my schoolwork.

i've given up on trying to just bang random girls (as much as i am dying to, this college god dammit) because at this point, emotionally, i really would like a girlfriend. since my last year in high school i developed severe depression and began to use opiates to cope with being such a failure and a loser (I almost OD'd in my room on my prom night because i was the only one who didn't have a date and didn't go). as i got into college and watched everyone i knew succeed with girls, i started doing more and more pills until slowly i became an addict. 

I still am 3 years later, and i take oxycodone and morphine like fucking skittles. i'm not proud of it but its the only way i can sleep at night when i run out of ambien and cope with the sadness, shame, and loneliness.

some of you are probably saying ""oh fuck off, stop bitching and do something about it you crybaby"". well i'm trying to figure exactly what i can do. i've kept this shit to myself for so long and now that brought me here. i'm desperate to hear something positive for once. i can't discuss in person with anyone i know, so i was hoping someone here could give me some advice on what to do here....i just want to be normal dammit, could i be THAT undesirable???

This week, she's doing a cleanse/diet before her upcoming birthday (so dinner or drinks won't work), then will be out with her friends the rest of the weekend.

When she tells me she's busy, I play it off and respond with ""Maybe next week,"" and she always seems responsive and up for it. The problem has come when I actually invite her to do something that next week.

Just as background, she is very unresponsive to texts or Facebook messages. So unless I am standing in front of her asking her how things are going or if she wants to go out, I usually will hear nothing from her.

After 2 weeks of getting the cold shoulder, I'm wondering if I should let it be and wait for her to make a move, or if I should ask her where we stand. I don't want to keep pushing for another date if she's not interested because I feel like it's a waste of both our time.

I also don't want to scare her away by putting pressure on a ""where do we stand"" conversation. I'm not looking for her to be my girlfriend right now. I just want to know if it's worth it to keep pursuing her or not. What do you think?

I'm currently attending college and met a cute guy (queue all the additional typical things) in one of my classes.

She isnt a shy or nerdy girl either. A soriority girl that is very outgoing.  So, we went out 5 times. Date 2 i got the cheek. Then date 3.... and date 4 i got the cheek.  and I asked her what was up. she said we barely know each other.

However, being prude isnt a deal breaker to me. not being genuine is.

So, we go out on a 5th date.  I find out she lives with her ex bf.  And then when i walk her to the car, she has a coughing attack says she isnt feeling well and doesnt want to kiss me because she doesnt want to get me sick.

But wants to hang out sunday to go hiking.

To me, that just seems so shady.  Ive waited 5 dates to kiss a girl before and it turned out she was seriously dating another guy for the past 8 months when we had met.  So maybe im being paranoid, but i feel the same thing is going on here with her living with her ex boyfriend.

Ive already brought it up to her on date 4 that it seemed slow to not want to kiss yet, but I was fine waiting if i knew she was legitimately interested.

and then this coughing attack at the end tonight?  she told me this past weekend she was sick all weekend. so it could of been true. but just seems like she did that to get out of trying to get kissed.  which is shady as hell.

I've had trouble attracting girls for most of my life. Currently, I'm 24 years old, and I haven't been with anyone in over two years. Don't get me wrong, I maintained a long relationship during college, and every once in a while I end up on a date even if I didn't know how exactly I got there. But dates are few and far between, and for the most part I usually feel clueless when it comes to the opposite sex.
I've always felt that I have a hard time being noticed. I'm a short guy, (5'4"") I can be kind of quiet in social settings and I'm not naturally attractive. I keep myself well groomed and I try to dress well at least (about half of my wardrobe is from h&amp;m lol).

I can be witty sometimes but my sense of humor is kind of dry. I'm a really sweet guy, incredibly nice and I'm a good conversationalist but I'm a terrible flirt. I've always felt like most girls must wonder if I'm gay. Most of the time if I'm attracted to a girl I have a hard time figuring out how to let her know. Usually by the time I've decided to make some sort of move, that window had already been closed a long time ago. If it was even open in the first place.

In the past I used to want to just be someone different. I hated my personality, and I envied that for some of my friends getting a date was as easy as flashing a smile and showing a little confidence. That works for them because they're good looking, but I've never had that advantage. I used to just try to act the same way my friends did to attract girls, it never worked for me. I'm just too friendly, and not attractive enough I guess.

But I don't want to change myself anymore. I've grown into my personality, and I don't want to be anyone different. I like who I am. I just want to make my personality work for me.

I've been seeing this guy (alias: George) for about 3 weeks. We've known each other for over a year and he's liked me for almost as long but I had a boyfriend at the time so nothing happened and we remained friends. Then I broke up with the boyfriend and started dating George (not a causal situation). 

I went over his place yesterday, we ordered food and were just planning on hanging out. As soon as we ordered delivery one of his friends called him, asking whether his (the friend's) girlfriend was cheating on him, because the girlfriend happens to be George's best friend. He answered in the negative, but within 2 minutes George's best friend called him and admitted that she was in love with someone other than her current boyfriend. 

Visibly upset, George immediately invited her over his place and to stay the night, saying things like ""anything you need,"" ""you know I'm here for you,"" ""do you need me to pick you up,"" etc. He explained to me that they have a brother/sister relationship and that his friends are everything to him. As soon as he got off the phone, I left to give him/them space or whatever (also I have never met the girl before so it would have been awkward of me to be hovering about), and I didn't want to appear not cool about the situation. 

It bugged me for the rest of the night, and it still bugs me a little. I am normally not bothered by guys I'm involved with having female friends; in fact, I'm a proponent of it because I have been in instances where I was the female friend, and I always felt it unfair that I or my guy friends had to be given an ultimatum between a romantic relationship and a much, much longer friendship. But I have never been in a situation where a guy had such an intimate platonic relationship with a woman, so much so that I was constructively kicked out of a date because of it.

Am I being weird? Is this normal? I have no idea. I have no desire to give George such an ultimatum (me or her!) but I would like a little perspective on this. 

TL;DR - guy I'm dating has a crazy intimate relationship with his female best friend and I am weirded out by it. 

**Edit** - to answer some questions and my own comments: 

None of what he has done or said, to the best of my knowledge, was inappropriate of him, as most of you have pointed out. As I've said, I have been the female friend to guys before (and currently so) so I know what it's about and I don't resent him for having a best friend who is female. Even more so because it's only been 3 weeks and we're still feeling each other out. 

I was just a little taken aback at an unfamiliar relationship scheme but it honestly at this point is not a huge deal. I guess I needed to vent a little but I get over things quickly. Thanks everyone for their perspectives (as requested), kindly given without too much judgment (for the most part).  

We'll see where it goes and if it's something I ultimately will be unable to deal with (assuming things like this happen often or starts crossing over into grayer areas), that's my problem.

Just a quick update - thank you reddit, I can't believe I wrote that only ten days ago O__o

Basically after receiving all of your thoughtful replies and encouragement, I started feeling more at ease with my situation and honestly happier (in that I wasn't abnormal, that my situation wasn't unique, etc.). This gave me the push to try something that I have been very VERY apprehensive of stepping foot in - online dating.

Well I made a profile a couple of days ago, and shortly after that started to receive some messages. Long story short, I found a dude who I seemed to click with and we started messaging back and forth. We really hit it off online and I met up with him for coffee(!!). Felt like vomiting the entire hour before we were supposed to meet, I was more nervous for this than I've ever been for any job interview. But after we got settled down the conversation just flowed, he seems like a really great guy, and we seemed to have a lot in common!

We messaged each other after and we both felt the same way - that we got along and enjoyed each other's company, so we're in the process of setting up a second if all goes well. :) I'm still quite nervous about the whole thing, and feeling like I should tell him by the end of the second or at least the third that I *don't* have much experience and would really like to take things slow, if he could be patient (if anyone has ANY advice as to how to broach this or if it's too early to say this etc. let me know). We didn't have any physical contact on the first date except for a hug goodbye (which I initiated). I just don't want it to suddenly escalate into areas that I'm not used to/comfortable with just yet, or alternatively I don't want him to think that if I seem cold/not physically affectionate that I don't like him.

I have noticed a couple of 'odd' things that suggests to me that he might be quite inexperienced at this as well, or maybe just nervous. I might just be trying to see things that aren't there though.

But maybe I'm overthinking it (as usual), it's just the first date I've ever had and I know perfectly well that it could end up fizzling out etc. and if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out. Either way, at least I've taken the first step and it was because of your encouragement, so thank you again! If you have tips or anything else I should keep in mind at this point, I'm all ears :)

I'm just worried because he is much much more attractive (and funny, confident etc) than anyone else I've ever gone out with. I know that guys often put less importance on who they sleep with, and will go for someone ugly to end a dry spell or because they're easy.
I don't want to be that girl, and I make it clear that I'm not looking for one night stands etc, but I'm still concerned.

Am I right to be cautious?  What can I do to protect myself?  Or have I just skewed my perception of men by reading seddit?

EDIT: Thanks very much.  Your advice is very comforting if nothing else.   I don't think I will ask him because it's not very attractive to say ""Why the fuck is someone like you with me?"", but I'll probably go out with him until a) he seems sick of me or b) I get fed up of feeling inferior.

I want to have a girlfriend but I can't talk to people without making things awkward and I'm pretty sure I make people uncomfortable or even repulsed, especially girls.

I joined a small fraternity last semester and it's the first real group of friends I've ever had. They've all acknowledged that I'm weird and awkward but they seem to be okay with it. However, I'd like to have someone who I can be more than just friends with but I can't see that happening.  I have only one  friend who's a girl and I've never met a girl who seems even vaguely interested in me.

Every time I try to talk to a girl I feel balls-out retarded. I met a girl in band in college in the same section as me and she's really cute and likes all the same shitty music that I do but the first time I tried to talk to her, when we were walking back from rehearsal together, she went on the first bus that came by which I felt was her way of showing me she wants to get away from me as soon as she can. I talked to her a few more times but she seemed like she was talking to me just to be nice. I told my therapist about it and he said I'm over-analyzing things and I should keep talking to her but last time I tried to talk to her she just hopped on the bus again, which she has only done when I'm talking to her. I don't think a girl like her would ever want to date a guy like me but she doesn't even want to make small talk. She's cool and attractive and I'm awkward and ugly so I can't really blame her.

I tried to talk to a girl the other day when I was at a party with my friends after we made awkward eye contact and said hi to each other but I felt totally awkward as soon as I started talking to her. I couldn't think of any interesting questions to ask her and I kept stumbling over my words and saying shit in a weird way. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong but it still all sounds awkward to me and probably to her too. I felt really uncomfortable and she looked uncomfortable too so I just backed off. My friend went up to her and talked to her for an hour straight and got her number, I have no idea how to do that. I end up reminding myself of the disabled kids in high school who end up clinging to the first pretty girl to give them attention even though she just wants to be nice and doesn't want anything to do with them. I tried to talk to another girl at the party who I had met at another event but she just said ""m-hm"" and walked away.

People used to tell me I have problems with ""confidence"" and ""self-esteem"" and I really liked the idea that I'm an alright, slightly awkward guy who just has problems with himself. Nowadays I feel like that's total bullshit and maybe I'm just a socially retarded guy who people don't want around them. I don't think I'm saying anything overtly weird but my mannerisms and the way I talk and act are just really off-putting. I can't put my finger on what I do wrong and neither can anyone else I've asked so I don't think it's something I can single out and change.

My parents and my therapist tell me I get ""nervous"" and that makes me awkward but in situations like my first example I don't even feel bad until they start acting like they're repulsed by me. My friends don't give me much advice other than ""BE CONFIDENT BRO"" but they make jokes about how weird that would if I got with a girl all the time so I don't think they have high hopes for me. Out of the 10-20 people I know with Asperger's only two of them don't come off as weird and awkward. At this point I'm just starting to think it was arrogant of me to think a girl would want a guy like me, someone with a disability that prevents me from connecting with people, let alone actually being alluring and attractive, when they can have someone else. How do I fix this? Is it even possible?

Did I miss anything?,23,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/10t1a0/this_is_the_advice_i_just_gave_to_a_socially/,"Okay, _______. Below is what I want you to do.

But first, a little about me: I'm six one, be-speckled, and pretty much as ""average"" as you can get. I'm a bit attractive but also pretty damned geeky—think someone like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory but with glasses (and not Einstein), perhaps. Totally not The Situation or some ripped-abs sort of monster. The only real thing I have going for me is that I'm pretty smart and am kind of tall. Other than that, like I said, super average: I like video games and movies, enjoy books, am pretty happy how I make money, only met one celebrity (well, maybe two), used to play MAGIC, am not really into sports (soccer is okay, and maybe hockey), can play the guitar just a bit, can write well (in complete sentences without using ""u"" or ""ur""), and I can sort of juggle. I've also dated some super great-looking girls, been in several long-term relationships, and am currently in a very long-term one that I hope will someday become something more.

I tell you all that because here's my advice, and it's worked for me very well (or else I wouldn't have done it):

1. Go buy yourself some nice slacks and some nice dress shirts, both preferably modest (no hawaiian prints). Keep the dress shirt untucked. Get some nice shoes too. No need for ties. Dating is like 1/4 job interview, 3/4 having fun until you find someone that clicks. Get deodorant (or antiperspirant if you sweat a lot) that smells good. YOU HAVE TO SMELL GOOD—but don't overdo it, you don't want to kill small animals when you enter a room.

2. I've never ""picked up"" a girl. I tried once or twice and failed miserably every time. Don't try that. Don't go to bars or clubs to pick up girls—they're full of astounding-looking people and your self-confidence will get shot. So don't try to ""pick up"" anyone. You're not going to be a pickup artist.

3. The best place to start that's pretty safe is probably online dating, unless you find yourself in a good situation to ask someone out while in person (you do this by having an interesting conversation with someone and then, before you ""get off the stage,"" you say, ""Hey, want to grab a coffee sometime?"" Also, a good place to find ways to have conversations is the book ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie). I digress. Anyway, go to OKCupid or some other dating site (OKCupid is free—no, I don't work for them—and seems to have a decent user base). Fill out your profile, answer as many of their ""personal"" questions as you feel comfortable with (honestly, I'd stay away from the super creepy questions, just pass on those) and then set your ""match"" preferences for dates (location, age, etc.).

4. Now comes the part where your testicles drop and you feel some adrenaline kick in. I want you to say ""hi"" to 50 females that are high on your matches for both location and age (probably, say, within 50 miles and within about 5 years up and down of your age) on your dating site of choice. You're going to write no more than a paragraph (so maybe three or four sentences) just saying ""hello,"" a bit about you, and something nice that you noticed in their profile. 50. Seriously. FIFTY. And you will strike out here. You will get ignored. You're putting yourself on the line and it's going to be frightening and even sometimes frustrating. Every time I would start dating someone, either that I met in person or online, it was always both a thrill and extraordinarily terrifying. (Again, I'm pretty normal-looking—I assume people who look like Brad Pitt don't have that problem.)

5. You're going to start getting some people interested in either chatting some more or hanging out in person. The ultimate goal is the in-person hangout, but chatting is nice too. I've made the mistake, though, of chatting too long and losing a potential fun time out with someone (they found someone else), so try to time it so you can take a jump from just chatting to meeting. Also, never seem too eager. ""Absolutely, I would love to spend time with someone as beautiful as you"" is much worse than ""yeah, it'd be great to hang out."" You want be charming, but it's really easy to overdo it.

6. You've got dates. Awesome! Do NOT go to a movie, a bar, or a loud rock concert, not yet. I want you to find the absolutely most fun place you can find. Roller rinks. Local street fairs. Maybe a mellow-ish concert in a park. Look at websites for your city. Find something fun. That's the key here: fun. You are not looking for a girlfriend; hell, you're not even looking for a long-term friend. You're looking to have an awesome night that's really fun with someone that will, one hopes, be really cool to talk to (refer back to ""How to Win Friends"" for advice on how to talk to someone). Tonight you're going to buy sno-cones and eat them on the lip of the fountain in the middle of the little plaza downtown. You're going to win a bunch of tickets and get a little teddy bear from the skee-ball machine at the local arcade (and try a round of simultaneous Dance-Dance Revolution with your date—you both will look like such dorks, it'll be great!). Although they're often poorly lit (which is kind of a first-date no-no), swinging on swingsets is always fun. You're out to have fun tonight. Oh, also, you're wearing those new clothes (the khaki slacks and untucked dress shirt I mentioned earlier).

From here on out, you kind of have to take it yourself, but you might want to repeat the ""fun date night"" process at least once or twice more to get more comfirtable with the girl you're seeing. If you get really serious with someone, you'll find yourself in a position to have a first kiss. I know the first kiss sounds like junior high school stuff, but often it can be nerve-wracking even for adults, and you seriously have to get some steel balls and just do it. Even if you get rejected, you will have at least tried. Dating is all about practice, rejection, and retrying.

Some additional notes:

- At least once on your first date, open and close the door of your car for her while she gets in (that is if you take the same car somewhere, which, depending on whether your date is comfortable with it or not, may or may not happen). At the very least, hold open doors—in this day and age, women find it unnecessary but appreciated, so it doesn't hurt. But don't be so charming that it gets annoying. Use your judgement.

- You are allowed to be the tinniest bit of a dick, just a tiny bit of an asshole. You have to be VERY careful not to overdo this, but just being the tiniest bit of a prick is okay. Perhaps some call it ""swagger.""

- Usually your date will be just as nervous as you are. Try to have fun. Find fun things to do. This gets rid of nervousness.

- Finally, this is cheesy as hell but it really works. After you've gone on a few dates and you want to make it a clear-cut line between ""friends who date and go out sometimes"" to ""girlfriend,"" find a good moment, take her hands in yours and say, ""I really like you, and it would mean a lot to me if I could call myself your boyfriend.""",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_10t1a0,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/10t1a0/this_is_the_advice_i_just_gave_to_a_socially/,

It's the same story over and over again. I'm the male equivalent of a girl who dates a douche-bags.

The girl I typically go for is usually extremely socially active, so that it becomes a major accomplishment if she devotes time to me. They often have issues in some way, that they self-medicate with excessive partying and male attention. 

Well, as I'm getting older, THIS too is getting old. Now I'm three years single, because the girl I go after is hard to keep, so you can have a few dates but it never progress in to a relationship. And whatever motivated this before, ""The thrill of the hunt"" or whatever, is not satisfying anymore. 

So now I want to move away from this, and find a girl who is more like me already. Not some wild animal I want to tame to become like me down the line. Problem is that I have no idea how to go about this. 

Like, how do you meet a girl who prefers to stay in and read a fantasy novel instead of doing body shots of tequila in a bar? I think one major reason I have gone after ""bad girls"" is because they are available, I see them, I hear them, they don't take commitment so serious so they can fool around without it ever meaning anything to them. 

The one thing I can think of is to go to some comic book store, but I feel uneasy about trying to pick someone up ""in the daylight"" (I have never done that before, and I don't know if my attempts will be appreciated). 

Basically, I want do do a full 180 since what I have been doing so far is not working out for me. But I don't know how, so what advice can you give me to reach my desired outcome?

Alright, so I've been seeing this guy for about a month now. For the first time in 8 years I **finally** have those tingles you get when you're with somebody that you really like. All my past relationships I've been trying to force feelings of love, but surprise, it doesn't work out. With this guy, It all comes naturally, and I notice myself falling for this guy immensely. I've got social anxiety much like the rest of reddit and for the first time ever I actually met somebody where I'm not constantly on edge and stressing over if I'm talking enough. My conversations come naturally with him. For the first time in over a year I'm actually happy for once and I've been walking around with a huge smile that I can't even try to wipe off.

It's not even a lustful relationship. We didn't do anything sexual until just last week, and that night he showed me that there really is a difference between making love and having sex/fucking. The things he has told me are things that no one has ever told me before. Saying things like i'm beautiful, awesome, have an amazing and lovable personality, funny, smart, etc.

The problem is, I found out tonight that he's been dating a girl for the past year in order to hide his true sexuality from his friends and family. However, he's become more secure with his sexuality and is planning to come out to at least his family within the next week. It's just so hard for me now because it goes against my morals to be the homewrecker by aiding a guy in cheating on his girlfriend even though there is no love between them and it's nothing more then a disguise. Another thing that upsets me is the fact that if he's cheating right now then he might cheat on me in the future. Then I just tell myself that he's only cheating because he's actually gay and so he won't cheat on me because he'll actually be with somebody that he actually loves.

Last week, I went out on a first date with a woman, who we'll call A. We hit it off fine, things were maybe a bit stilted as we were both shy, but by the end of the date we'd made plans to get together again. Early this week, I went on a first date with another woman, B. I've got to admit, she was a lot more fun. We had really good rapport, she's really vibrant (which makes me nervous, as I'm a bit dry-witted and mellow, but that's a whole other set of worms), and I walked away from the date excited by this person. Last night, I went on my second date with A. It was pleasant, again a bit shy. I walked her home and kissed her goodnight. 

I know it's not uncommon for people to date multiple people at once before committing to a relationship with one. I guess I just don't know how best to navigate it. What obligation do I have to tell these women I'm dating other people? How many dates should I be going on/what stage of the relationship do I decide I need to commit/let go? I'm really excited about B, but A is a very nice, pretty lady who I'd be perfectly happy to date. I'm a somewhat sensitive guy, so women I date tend to get pretty attached/vulnerable pretty quickly. A seemed really excited to get that goodnight kiss, and I don't want to hurt her feelings. I also don't want to string her along as a ""backup plan"" for too long.

Because of that i had to take many medications my whole youth. 2 sideeffects of those medications where that i rapidly gained weight and developed a skin condition.

So i was basicly the fat ugly kid in my teenage years. Because of that and the fact that i never had many friends i was really shy and never had the courage to ask a girl out or anything like that. This of course got worse over the years. I remember myself thinking ""Oh man, i'm 16 now and never kissed a girl i'm such a looser"" or ""Oh man, i'm 20 now and never had sex i should probably kill myself""

Today I am 26 years old, never had sex, never kissed a woman and i am still quite fat. Rheumatism sadly doesn't allow me to do any kind of sports for more than 10 minutes and even though i am trying to loose weight and eat healthy it just doesnt seem to work out.

However i do have a job, a nice appartement and cutting my non-existent lovelife out i am actually quite happy with my life even though i am socially a bit awkward maybe because i just don't fell comfortable around people because of my bodyweight.

So, this was an introduction to my life. i wasn't sure if it was necessary but i guess it helps you understand where i'm coming from.

A few months ago i decided to go on an online dating platform. I was completely honest about myself, the stuff i like, i dislike and soone. I know its bad if you pretend to be someone else, but of course i didn't advertise myself as a 26 year old virgin. If someone would have asked me so far how many girls i had in the past or something like that i wouldn't have a problem telling them the truth, but as long as noone asks i don't lie by not telling...

So i met this girl who is 27 now and we send each other messages over the last few months. I really enjoy talking, or in that case writing to her and she seems funny, interesting and quiete nice. It took a while but i finally got her to give me her number so we can discuss when and where we are meeting. She lives a few miles away from me but nothing a 2 hour drive wouldn't fix.

So now i don't really know what to do. I figured we could meet at a bar or something like that or maybe go for a walk later but i just don't know how i should behave. Thats were you guys come into play.

What is expected of me besides being myself? What kind of questions can i ask her without looking like i'm interrogating her. How should i behave around her? I don't wanna look like a creep or anything. And yeah... any general advise in that area is much appreciated.

For those girls who feel reluctant to ask a guy out or make a move, I should just mention that her asking me to dinner was *incredibly* attractive and really solidified my interest in her. 

Dinner is coming up soon and I'm eagerly looking forward to it. I've never actually been on a first date before (I asked my high school gf out prior to any dates, so we were already in a relationship when we did go on dates), but I feel confident, particularly since all signs she's been sending seem to indicate that she's quite interested as well. Although I don't want to get ahead of myself or overthink things, I could definitely see myself in a relationship with her if all goes well and that's what she's looking for. 

My question is this: how is the transition from dating to a relationship usually done?

I realize that it happens slightly (or very much) differently for everybody, but I'm pretty unfamiliar with how it goes. Assuming dinner goes well, should I just keep asking her on dates for the time being? Should I, after a date or two, just ask whether she's looking for a relationship?

My problem is that I'm a virgin. I've sort of resigned myself to a life without sex, but I think about it all the time, and I daydream about attractive men I see. Basically, I'm a horny 21 year old. 

I have a little bit of a past, and now find myself afraid of most men, or at least intimidated. For instance, I can't help dropping my eyes after I say hello, which is frustrating, not to mention off putting. 

I *want* to date, but for me to be comfortable (with physical nearness) I would have to go by extremely slow degrees. I feel like that's not fair, and that I wouldn't be able to find any guy who would put up with that, so I just...haven't ever done that. 

How would I make it clear that I'm nervous about touching? Would most men see this as too much of a hassle? 

I don't want to get drunk and have sex just to get it over with. I wouldn't be comfortable, I would regret it, and I'd like to have an emotional connection with whomever it was with. I just wish I could go from where I am now to an established relationship.

There are chapters in dating books on how to repel me; there is an entire art of getting me distracted while you score with my hot friend.

I'm 21, female, straight, tall, 120 pounds, size 2. But I'm an A-cup, I have disgusting fluffy/frizzy (not curly, not wavy) hair, and I'm just kind of face-ugly.

But not disastrously face-ugly! If you rate me on the 10-point scale, I'm a 5, decidedly average. It's just, I've always hung out with 6s, 7s and 8s who also have tits. 

So I'm completely 0% in the game. I have never had a drink bought for me, never had sex, never had a boyfriend, never been kissed, never had a date, never been asked to dance at a prom or a party or anything. 

This is not of my own volition, or through lack of effort. I want to date and get out there, because my supple years are passin' fast..

I'm not sure why I'm so defective, because it doesn't seem to be hurting me anywhere else: I have a ton of friends, an otherwise very active social calendar, a fantastic job, killer negotiation skills, and at school I'm a campus leader and have a stellar GPA, so I'm not a moron. And I'm often told I'm the best storyteller anybody knows, so it can't be that I'm boring.

Men just completely ignore me when I go out. All attempts at conversation are met with brush-offs or completely ignored. My friends just don't seem to notice this fact, because they're constantly showered with attention.

So what's wrong with me? Do I give up? Am I too ugly to date after all? Should I buy multiple cats? Do I dress sluttier? Do I get uglier friends?

Want to change this, where to start?",21,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tsfa5/30_years_old_and_never_learned_to_approach_women/,"Ok here's my situation. I'm almost 31 and I always felt years behind in the dating and relationship arena. I grew up extremely shy, extremely risk-averse and self-conscious, and could not handle rejection or failure. So I had a few ugly rejections early on and after that I just stayed away. In my late 20s I dealt with a lot of my personal shit and hangups but I still feel really behind.

Before I go on I should say that I'm a good looking guy, six feet tall, intelligent, well-spoken, well-employed, well-traveled, artistically talented... I feel like I have all the ingredients, and I do like myself, I just ended up at 30 with very little experience approaching women. They occasionally approach me, but I'm tired of counting on that.

I grew up with a sense of embarrassment around sex and romance. My parents taught me about reproduction really early, but never ever mentioned dating or relationships. I never felt like it was okay to admit that I liked girls and wanted to do things with them. So as a teenager I was kind of prudish. Whenever guys around me talked about sex I always thought it was really crude and I didn't feel comfortable talking about it.
I first made out with a woman at age 19, first had intercourse at 24(!) and have only had sex with four women (one ONS, two short-term girlfriends and one LTR.) Most of my life I've been single and hook-ups have been few and far between. This is embarrassing to me to even mention anonymously to reddit.

Still, I'm willing to own all that and start from where I am, and I've developed a lot in the general confidence department.

Right now I'm in a LDR with an awesome woman, who has an idea of my relationship/dating inexperience but doesn't yet know how severe it is. Neither of us is relocating any time soon, and we both have rather open-minded ideas about relationships, so we're talking about opening up our relationship a few months down the road.

I know this is what I want to do, but I'm nervous that she's going to have a much easier time finding partners than I will, because I've always just taken what's come along. I feel like it's finally time to have my ""sexual twenties"" even though I'm 30. So I want to finally learn how to go out and get laid, explore my kinks and become sex-positive and have an active sex life for once.

I'm aware of the seduction community, and to be honest I find a lot of it really obnoxious and I just don't want to do it that way. So what I'm asking, men and women of /r/dating_advice, is how do normal guys actually go out and meet women? Where do you go? What do you say? Guys, how do you approach women, and women, how do you wish guys would approach you? Any great websites or resources that aren't slanted to the seduction-community kind of vibe?

Just to sum up: I [F/23] had great chemistry and a great date with a guy [23] who later told me he didn't want to get serious. After that, I got no contact on his part after a week (only talking when he runs into me).

Update: I decided to call things off. What I mean by this is that I made it clear that since he was emotionally unavailable, I was unavailable for dates. I'm a girlfriend kind of girl, not a casual thing. 

I'm glad that he wasn't intimidated by a woman asking him out, but I'm even more glad that I stood up for my standards and refused to be used to ""waste time"" until he found ""the perfect girl"" to settle down with (because it wasn't going to be me, the ""just for fun"" girl). 

So ladies, if you know you're built to be a girlfriend, don't settle for guys who ""don't want to be in a relationship right now"". Even if they want a relationship ""some day"", they won't want it with the girl who stuck around, as twisted as that is. You are more than a ""good time"". Act like it.

I recently had organ failure and got a transplant. As a result, I had to leave some classes unfinished. I went back to my college today to see if my professors would uphold the promises they made me that once I was better I could return and just pick up where I left off without having to retake and repay for the class.

Anyway, I go to his office and he's on the phone. I sit in a chair in the hall outside for a few minutes when I hear some talking from around the corner near the entrance to the department. This excruciatingly cute girl comes around the corner speaking french with her former professor. She recounts how she's graduated and is just here to wait for her internship adviser. She goes passed me and down the hall and site on the floor by a door.

My douchebag brain starts telling me the I'm sitting awkwardly, I'm breathing awkwardly, I'm making weird expressions, etc. This goes on for a few minutes (felt like eons) and suddenly she gets up, walks over, sits in the chair next to me, and starts talking to me. She asks who I'm waiting for, how long I've been waiting, I ask her where she's interning, etc, etc. It turns into a conversation.

The professor comes out and settles both of our questions and leaves for a meeting. So now, I'm walking along with this cute girl and talking to her. My brain feels like a knot but somehow I managed to hold my own. We talked for maybe 10-15 minutes at the end of which I learned her name and her phone number.

Did I mention she didn't run for the hills when I explained to her how I recently had a transplant and that because of it I don't have a degree yet? (I'm 24 and she is 26).

Basically, any advice would do. I'm really hoping to not screw this up.

Works for girls asking guys out too. I know its long, but if you feel like reading it over and asking about or constructively criticizing my advice please feel free to. I've posted this in a lot of threads and I wanted it all in a place where I could reference it.****

****Disclaimer: Most of this article is examples of stuff I have done, it doesn't need to be a step by step guide, I just provided actual examples I have done so that people can get the general idea of what I am talking about.""

Ok so there is this girl (or guy) you like, and you want to ask them out on a date, but you aren't sure how to go about this, or you aren't sure if they are interested... 

edit: Thanks to dashingprince for pointing out something I was missing, this advice assumes you have been talking to this person enough that you think it prudent to ask them out. This is not a method good for trying to break the ice with a stranger and get them to go out with you. That is a whole different thread I need to write up. 

My best advice for this is to pick something that you enjoy doing, that she will also enjoy, and tell her that you are going to be doing this thing and it would be awesome if she tagged along. Make it something that doesn't scream date (like going to dinner and a movie) instead something you could do alone but would be better as a date. For me its always checking out this band down at the jazz club. Its a great place to go, sit, have some appetizers etc. You are able to talk to each other over the music, or just listen to this awesome guy play the sax. There are also pool tables for a distraction activity, and tons of shit all around that make for great conversation starters. The key here is to show her you do fun, not cliche, things and want to bring her along, but its not all about her, its about you doing fun things and shes lucky to be invited. This shows her you have both confidence and self worth.

The best part about this is if she turns you down, you can just shrug it off because you were going, and going to have fun anyways. So you save face.

If she says yes, then say ""Great its a date"" or something along those lines. Make it clear it is a date, and that these kinds of dates are things you do all the time. Confidence is everything, make it seem like you go on dates all the time and that its not a huge deal, and this will show that you are fun, laid back, and most importantly other girls want to go on dates with you. This will make you much more desirable. 

While on the date, do date like things, smile at her, plan things to talk about just in case the conversation is lacking, but also pick an activity that you can be ""distracted"" by, so it isn't awkward if you can't keep up a full time conversation. The best thing about conversation is plan some stories to tell her. Stories about you and your friends doing cool and fun things show you are adventurous. Stories about your family/pets give her the chance to chime in and tell stories about her family/pets and thus you learn a lot about her without having to directly ask, so the conversation is a conversation, not a two way interview. 

Plan a few ridiculous questions to which the answers don't really matter, and are very joking. For instance on a first date if the conversation is lacking I'll say ""I have a really important question for you..."" She'll get interested, what could be really important that you want to know about her, then I ask ""When you make mac and cheese, do you make it more dry and clumpy, or more soupy?"" Normally girls won't even answer the question but look confused as to why you are asking this. To which I say in a very joking half laughing manner ""hey you can tell a lot about a person by how they make their mac and cheese."" Stuff like this is quirky and unique and will show you have a sense of humor and are comfortable being silly. It also helps to remind her of you whenever she see's mac and cheese she will think of you and the silly date question. 

Have some but not an excessive amount of physical contact, little things like holding her hand to help her stand up, or brushing her hair away from her face/tucking a lock behind her ear. Touch is hugely important, see [Skitrel's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/f2xfq/friends_or_more_than_just_friends/c1cvxyc) for info on touch and using it to gage/garner interest.

If the chemistry is going well, and you think you can get a kiss, don't wait till the end of the date where you have that awkward ""Do I go for the goodbye hug or kiss"" thing. If you think you've got it, go in for the kiss halfway through the date, that way at the end of the date you know where you stand. I'm can type out the paragraph on how to go in for the kiss without it being awkward if you really want me to.

****edit: Got a lot of messages asking for the paragraph on the first kiss so I'm going to add it in. Turns out that makes this post too long, so find the paragraph in the comments.****


At some point in the date giver her something, a memento, so she can remember the date. For me I always fold my dates small paper cranes, that way at the end of the night when she empties out her pockets she will find the crane and think of you, and the fun date. The way into a girls heart is if she is thinking about you fondly when you aren't there. When she sees the crane she'll get a rush of endorphins from the positive memory of the date and she'll attribute that subtle happiness to you.

The reason I picked the crane (or any simple origami) is because it can be used later, if the relationship blossoms, to be one of those little cute things you can do to show a girl you care. Whenever I have to leave early for work I write out a little note fold it up into a crane and leave it on the bedside table for her to find when she wakes up. Girls love things like this. 

Another trick is tagging instead of the momento, I use $2 mood rings for this. Get a cheap mood ring that fits one of your smaller fingers (assuming her fingers are smaller than yours) and wear it out when you go out with her. If she asks about it tell her its a mood ring and right now it says you are having a good time. Then take it off and put it on on of her fingers and say ""lets see if you are too"" in a joking sort of way. If it changes color on her finger play it off by saying something like ""ahh the ring says you are having GREAT time!"" Then when she offers to give it back say ""no no keep it for now, that way I'll know I'm doing a good job"" and at the end of the night if she tries to return it, tell her to hang on to it till next time she sees you. This will double as both a memento for later, and give her a reason to see you again, thus making her come to you. If you never get it back, whatever it was $2. Don't do this and the paper crane on the same date, then it looks like you are showering her with gifts on the first date. 

As for the whole paying thing, you should pick an activity that you can afford to pay for both you and her, and do so. If she offers to pay, or objects, or anything like that say ""I asked you out on this date, so I've got this, and when you ask me out to do something you can pay for that."" This starts the relationship on equal footing so you are even partners, but also keeps chivalry alive. It also implies that she should initiate the second date, and its always good to have her come to you instead of you always chasing her.

I personally never try to make a move beyond kissing on the first date. I take her home and make it seem like I have something important I have to do, and that I'm practically being dragged away. This shows that your time is valuable and people need/want you to be around so this girl has to put in some effort for your time/affection. I usually go for the quick kiss goodbye, and make it seem like the kiss was good enough that I am seriously contemplating forgetting my other arrangement in favor of spending more time with her, but finally I pull away. It is important to end the date on a good note so that when she goes inside she is still thinking about you positively. 

About 45 min after I leave I text her saying I had a great time and was sorry I had to leave. Nearly always this will set up the second date because she will reply back with something like ""I had a great time too I hope we can do it again sometime."" Then you reply ""Well I am going to be doing (some new activity similar to the first date that can be done alone) and would love for you to join me."" This is a bold strategy, the key is to have her consider going on a second date with you while she is still reeling from the positivity of the first date. However it can't look like you are smothering her, or too into her so pick something that is at least 4 or 5 days later, but no more than 8 or 9 days. Keep in contact with her between the first and second date, but only casually, and sporadically. Don't text and call her too much, and if she is constantly initiating conversations always reply, but every so often leave a gap in your replies as if it seems like you are doing something important, but still want to talk with her. 

The whole key here is to seem like a fun loving laid back cool guy who is both desired by others, and fun to be around, and who shows a preference for this girl, but doesn't let that preference dictate his life.

This is a long story, so please bare with me. 


My boyfriend, James (18M), has bad anger issues (which I just learned about 3 weeks ago and we have been together for 2 months). When James and I met 9 months ago, he had a girlfriend. He always told me how he would break up with her for me, and he loved me a lot. I was an idiot and believed him. However, he never did break up with her. For the next 6 months, they stayed together, and I was so heartbroken. Every night James and I would talk on the phone, and he would tell me how he loved me, and wanted to be with me, but he was too attached to his girlfriend to break up with her. He broke my heart. 


About 2 months ago, his girlfriend broke up with him because she wanted to be single. He was so hurt, and felt betrayed. But instantly got over her and came running to me. I was blinded by ""love"" and gladly became his girlfriend. We became very physical within a few weeks. We have done everything except sex, because I am not yet ready to do that. He (of course) tries to push me to have sex every time we are alone. Sometimes I feel like his toy...


Anyways, my best friend Max knows all of this. He knows how badly James hurt me, he knows how I am James' toy. He knows everything. And about a month ago, Max told me he has feelings for me, and he is really worried about me. He told me he knew James had a bad side, that I didn't know about. The thing is, I started having feelings for James to get over Max. About 2 years ago, I met Max. Him and I became good friends. I started secretly crushing on him. For a year and a half, I tried getting close to him, but he never responded to my texts or answered my calls, so I took it as a sign that he didn't like me (it turns out I just had the wrong number). When I met James I thought I was finally over Max, and started falling in ""love"" with James. I think it was only to get over Max.


Well now my feelings for Max are back, and I don't want to continue my relationship with James. James disgusts me in many ways, I cannot explain. I don't want anything to do with him, I just want Max. I feel safe, loved, calm, and perfect with Max. He feels the same for me. Max also wants to take things really slow, and doesn't want to rush at all. That makes me so happy. 


I just don't know how to talk to James. He has BAD anger issues. About 3 weeks ago, I told James I didn't know where things were going between him and I, and he threatened to kill himself and Max. He told me we were going to be together, and that's how it will be forever. I'm really really scared. What do I say to James? I would like to break up with him before we go back to school, so he can have time to calm down so he doesn't go crazy when he sees me on a daily basis. But I just don't know what to say? Help?

TL;DR - My boyfriend of one month has hurt me in the past, but I still agreed to date him. Now, I discovered my feelings for my best friend are back, and I want nothing to do with my boyfriend anymore, but I don't know how to tell him. On top of that, he has bad anger issues and threatened to kill himself and my best friend when I told my boyfriend a month ago that I didn't think things were working out.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_1gtnhl,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gtnhl/i_17f_am_absolutely_terrified_to_break_up_with_my/,

Someone help me?,22,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fs22i/i_have_trouble_showing_my_attraction_in_a/,"Me (20) and the girl (20) have known each other for well over a year and the majority of that time there's been a level of attraction. We've had this (probably childish) back and forth for a long while but things never happened between us for various reasons. Now the time is right and we're still interested in each other and I've sked her out. She said yes to going out but we haven't set up solid plans yet because of our schedules, but we have time periods for when our schedules free up.

Know here's the problem, we see each other at least once a week regardless (in a non-romance appropriate environment) and often we get periods alone, but I can't seem to get myself to act on my attraction for her. We flirt, and have for a good while, but it's small stuff that has kind of become stale. But I can't get myself to playful tease her, or touch her, or do those more direct flirtatious things that I feel I should be doing with someone I know is interested in me (and knows I'm interested in her). We'll be sitting directly next to each other and talking, but I can't get myself to do anything direct and non-platonic.

She can do those things. She can touch me when we talk, tease me and just generally flirt appropriately. The best I can do is the eye contact, and we like to do the whole looking at each other thing, but what grade school kid with a crush can't pull that off?

I'm just not sure what's wrong with me. I know I want to do these things, especially when I'm with her, I just can't. I'm pretty sure I'm just waiting for the ""right moment"" and thinking to much about it. I'm also pretty sure it's because I've never done this before, and I know she has; which I guess is the main intimidation factor.

We are both successful and well-rounded.  When our friendship started she told me multiple times ""I don't want a relationship with anybody. Period.""  We began having regular dinners at each others' houses and we became very close.  We have awesome conversations and agree on many topics.  Things progressed to the point that we were going to a distant city to see plays and have nice dinners, sharing a hotel bed, but nothing physical.  Things progress further to where we travel to distant continents on vacation together, share a bed, but nothing physical. She admits to me that she has never been as close to any man as she is with me, but continues to sprinkle the ""I don't want a relationship"" into conversations.

Then I go on random date with a girl in another city on a random night and who is in the bar?  Yep.

Then bam!  Nothing.....  She is cold as ice. No contact. No anything. She owns a local restaurant/bar so I go in and it's as though I'm not even there. I lay low because, hey, who wants to go where you aren't wanted?  After months of no contact and brooding over whether she was jealous or hurt I contact her and ask if I did something wrong.  Her response was: ""You didn't do anything wrong, sometimes people just have to move on.""

I spend another month or-so contemplating this mystery and send her an email explaining that I value her friendship and am struggling.  I admit that I have contemplated the possibility of something less platonic with her but am reluctant because of her statements about not wanting a relationship.  No response, but I know where she hikes so I go there and ""run into"" her.  I ask if she received the email she responds that she did.  I ask her thoughts and she said ""I guess I'm not surprised,"" then drops it.

We remain friendly and still get together (very) occasionally.  One night while we are having a drink at her bar, I make some offhand comment about our ""relationship.""  She looks at me and says ""I made myself perfectly clear on that.""  Huh?  I didn't pursue it because other friends were around.

This brings us to now.  I ran into her and she suggested that if I want to get together, let her know.  I pursued it and she's coming over this evening to drink fine wine and eat fine chocolate.

I'm very tempted to just find out once and for all where she stands, except I'm mortified of being rejected and losing her friendship.

**TL;DR:** He came out to both his employees and his girlfriend in the same day. Both times with me there. Went out with his ""ex-gf"", they're planning on staying friend which I'm fine with because her and I clicked well.


Alright, so it all just happened today......strangest day of my life.

I was beginning to think he wasn't going to do it, but then today while I was at work he texted me saying he was going to pick me up once I got off. Keep in mind I told him that we couldn't see each other until he actually went through with it, so I assumed he was either lying that he did it or that he actually did. Then I was wondering how in the hell he could prove to me that he did. I missed him so so so much though I really didn't care at that point.

So I get off work, hop in his car and we go to his restaurant. I knew something big happened when he actually walked into his restaurant holding my hand, and even though I was trying to pull away so his employees wouldn't see, he kept grabbing for my hand. We go in, and he has me sit at one of the tables right in front of the counter and goes to make me some food. He came to me with our food, holds my hands and tells me not to worry. I can see all of his employees looking at us, smiling. I had a strange mixture of anxiety, embarrassment, excitement and happiness. Then he whispered to me, ""they know"" and kissed me. That was probably the biggest wave of happiness i've ever felt in my life.

It was slow and his crew came over to us and were telling us that they were happy about what we have and some joked a bit about how they could tell there was something between us. Anyway, we're eating and he tells me there are a few more surprises. That ordeal was nerve wracking as it is, so the thought of more terrified me, but I had no clue what to expect.

We leave his restaurant and he takes me to his apartment. As soon as he opened the door, my heart dropped. I went into full panic mode and wanted to turn around and run.....there she was. A beautiful blonde girl sitting on the couch in tears. I felt sooooo fucking bad and guilty that I couldn't even try to stop myself from crying. I kind of stood in the doorway bawling my eyes out when she actually came over to me and hugged me. The strange thing is, she was smiling. I don't want this to turn into a novel, so here's a brief synopsis.

She told me exactly how he told her, she said she could tell there was something strange about their relationship right from the start, but ignored it. She said how she found gay porn on his computer a few times, but just pushed it off as some sort of curiosity or bisexuality but never questioned him about it. At this point i'm still crying, hardly able to form coherent sentences besides constantly repeating ""I'm so sorry"". She told me that she is upset about how everything ended and how she was just a cover up, but said that the happiness for me and him outweighed how upset she was. Saying that she's happier knowing that he's finally comfortable with himself and no longer has to lie about who he truly is and that he found somebody that he truly loves.

All of her reassurance was calming me down and we sat around for a couple of hours just talking and actually getting to know one another. Then once my puffy, red eyes went away, he told us to hop in the car. I thought maybe he was going to take me back to my car because at this point it was 11 p.m. and I have work tomorrow, but instead we pull up to a bar. So for two hours we sat in the bar, drinking, talking, laughing and dancing.....I can't drink because of the legal situation I'm in right now, so that was the most uncomfortable two hours of my life.

She's actually a really nice girl and ignoring my awkwardness, me and her were actually clicking fairly well. He realized the time and decided to take me back to my car. We were going to drop her back off at her place first, and on the way there she was saying that through the time that they were together, she developed a strong friendship with him and said she would hate to have that end because of this. I didn't want to be selfish, so I told her that it was fine and anyway I actually like her and she seems like a good person to be around and get to know better.

When he dropped me off at my car, he kissed me goodnight and said that tomorrow he has ANOTHER surprise, but I asked him if it could hold off  a few days because even now, 30 minutes since he dropped me off, I'm still shaken up about everything that happened today and I told him I don't know if I can handle anymore while still keeping my sanity, but he insisted that he's never felt anymore ready than he does now.

Some super basic questions [27m],20,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1dutvt/first_date_in_8_years_some_super_basic_questions/,"I went on my first date in 8 years following breaking up with my 7-year girlfriend about 18 months ago. We ""met"" on POF (like Okcupid but more popular here in England) and texted each other for the week beforehand. 

I was nervous as hell but it kinda went well - we met at 11 at a pub, had a few drinks, a lunch, and then went for a short walk and sat on the grass in the sun. I walked her back to her car at 5, so the date lasted a pretty whopping six hours. Hence I guess it went well and she must have liked me (maybe?). However I still have some questions considering all this is very new to me:

1. No kiss at the car. She was putting stuff in her car, changing her shoes, and faffing around getting sunglasses and stuff. I didn't see much of an opportunity to kiss (or even hug) her goodbye. Should I have been more assertive in this given that the date seemingly went quite well?

2. Flirting. I just can't do it - I'm not good at picking up on signals, and I'm even worse at knowing what to do when I do notice them. She was showing me some pictures on her phone at one point, which meant I had to get close to her. Once we finished looking at the pictures, should I have stayed close? Also at a couple of points she moved closer so our legs were touching. A couple of friends say this could have been a little something, and that I didn't reciprocate at all might have put her off. What should I have done there? And the most obvious one of all was when she leaned forward a little and squished her boobs together, giving a bit of a doe-eyed look. She did this twice and I just had no idea what to do - give her a compliment, lean in, move closer, go for a kiss, what? After this she covered herself up and wrapped her wrap thingy around her entirely - again my friends suggest that she was trying to flirt but my lack of reciprocation put her off. How the hell do I reciprocate? 

3. The second date. We didn't make a specific second date, but I did suggest she came along to a pub quiz with some friends of mine, or a weekend walk. She said she'd be up for either of those. But I invited her out to the pub quiz and she ignored the question. What gives? Also, I found her fairly attractive and we obviously had enough in common to talk for 6 hours, but there were a few things about her that I wasn't so keen on (political differences and some attitudes towards things) - is it fair to want a second date to try and work out if I do like this girl or not? There wasn't a ""spark"" so is it worth trying for a second date, or would it just be wasting both our time?

I was recently hospitalized and met an age appropriate resident whom I believe was interested in me.  Even my brother mentioned he thought she was interested in me and I should have chased her down and asked her out (I was not in any condition to be chasing anyone).

Basically, she gave me her full name and mentioned not knowing many people here and being 'bored'. I miraculously remembered her name even though I was in a lot of pain and wasted on morphine most of the time.  She came in to check on me almost daily either first thing in the morning or late in the evening mentioning she was just on her way home and wanted to check up on me before she left.  We even watched part of a sunrise together before duty called.

I am wondering, will I come off as a creeper if I send her a message on FB and ask her out?  Is this totally offside/weird/creepy?  Should I just let it go?  She's the first girl I've met since my last relationship I've genuinely been interested in.. I would certainly keep the message short and to the point, and mention I would not be offended if the answer is 'no stay the shit away from me'..

She lives in the co-op that I do, so our views work together pretty well, she's totally sexually alluring, and she's totally into me too.  Things are moving pretty well - we were cuddling yesterday and she told me that even though she's a year older than me she hasn't messed around at all sexually.  Like nothing.  Like never getting fingered by a guy, and the only person who's been down there is herself.  This works out pretty well for me too, because I'm a virgin as well, although I've done sexual things with other women before.  But the other indication to me is that things are moving really fast for us, and I would completely be fine with this - I recently suggested we play a game of sex dice so that we could explore our sexualities together, and she was completely for it.  The fact that we're both virgins but she so readily agreed to my suggestion was both entirely nerve wracking and exciting.

The only issue is, and I don't know how I didn't notice this before, is that she smells.  A lot.  Mostly in the armpit areas, but she legitimately will smell like my gym's locker room to me.  Other than that, she's really attractive and really well dressed. It's just one of those things that she doesn't do is shower regularly, either because she's ethnically Indian or because she's environmentally concerned or because the co-op that we live in has a pretty strong culture of new vogue feminism. I on the other hand shower everyday. She was giving me a massage the other day, and I hadn't put on any body wash, just used generic soft-scented soap, and afterwards she texted me ""I smell like your body wash now! =D"".  

Any suggestions?  I'm trying to drop hints, like before I meet up with her, saying ""One sec, let me just shower first"" to see if she catches the hint, but this has been to no avail.  I would love to love this girl, but I'm not going to let myself fall for her if my nose is always the sense that recognizes her first. And ""I need you to shower more"" is a terrible thing to tell somebody when you're this new into a relationship.

We're still really friendly when we see each other.  I don't know what to do.



**The situation:**

* He is a desk attendant at the resident hall I live in on campus.  He works at the front desk scanning people in to the building, and handling answering phone calls and other clerical things while on duty.  

* Over the past few weeks I'd been noticing that I was being really friendly towards him, and he was doing the same to me.  When I would come in to the building during his shift we would exchange greetings, and smiles and then hold eye contact throughout the entire time I was at the front desk.

* I finally acknowledged I was smitten when I would find myself coming in to and leaving the building for asinine reasons, or finding excuses to go through the lobby when he was working, just so I could see him.
* I finally worked up the courage to talk to him.  I knew that he was in a band, and I really like music so that was the topic I chose I would use to talk to him since I had no other ideas.
    * I initiated the conversation on Monday
 *  He told me that I should 'definitely, definitely come' that it would be really cool, and that he'd let me know when their next show was.
 * This was followed by more banter and laughter, and then I felt bad because he was supposed to be working, so I left to get food.  
 *  I then realized that we hadn't exchanged numbers so I wrote a note with my number on it on an index card.
 *  When I scanned in to the building I handed him my i.d., as per usual, then when he was handing it back I gave him the 'note'
 *  He chuckled and asked 'what's this?' before accepting it.

I'm really smitten by him, but I'm not sure what to do now, if I should do anything.  He texted me the night that all happened, Monday, four times in a row without a response, and it was very ramble-y and flustered sounding like he was nervous.  We talked about the band and music mainly and conversation was short.  When he saw me yesterday at the desk there was another person working with him and we still exchanged smiles and hellos.

**Questions:**

* Do you think he knows I like him?
* What should I do now?
* Do you think a relationship would be inappropriate since he works for the university technically?

She lives an hour away, but now she is 10 minutes away (she's rural, I live in the city near the hospital). 

We've been texting and she really wants a hug. I let her know that I felt right now was a very emotional time for her family and I understood they were going to be very close. I didn't feel it would be respectful of me to visit her so early while things are still so uncertain. I said I would be available to her anytime in any other way - talk/text. 

I don't have much experience with this type of a situation. Was I insensitive? She does have a close, life-long family friend with her. If she didn't have her immediate family or close friend or was all alone I think it would be alright to go but I am having a hard time finding any reason to visit her while she is with her family right now. Is there anything else I can do to be respectful while supportive?

**Edit: Wow I am glad I didn't listen to any you. I asked her to let me know when was good to come see her and through the conversation she clarified that she wanted a hug from her brother but did not mean to imply for me to show up at the hospital like that.

I'm really young for my age (M28), a real late bloomer. I'm a great guy, some people say I'm good looking. But i always end up in the damn freindzone.

So recently I've taken a more direct approach...

So i meet a great girl (F22) we spend the whole evening flirting. Kind of cuddling and just chatting all night. We where drunk so i left it at just a bit of fun that evening. We swapped numbers and in the week i called her up and asked her out for drinks. 

So she said yes, seemed pretty keen. Come the day of date, she's texts me to tell me shes ill. Which is fine, i just tell her we will arrange it for another day and asked her to let me know whens she's free.

At this point i wasn't sure whether this was an indirect ""no thanks"", so i leave it to her to contact me. 

A few days later she asks me out to lunch. At this point i just yes, even though i felt this was a one ticket to freindzone.

It was that way, kind of short and sweet. Nice, we have a lot in common. But she was chatting about her ex a lot and listened to her family woes. I talked a bit too much crap, but nothing too bad. To cap off the date, she paid for the bill when i had to take a call. 

So i just feel totally useless, i did all the right things. Seems like she was looking for the politest way of letting me down.

She just seems to have been put off by something... I played it cool, said the right things. I just think the problem is she was part of my circle of Friends and she's quite young.

I just wanna be that fun guy, not the freind guy. I keep acting not like myself getting really down about it.

I'm 24 years old, I'm fun, I am young, and I need to start dating.  I am reasonably pretty - I lost 40 lbs in the past year and I still feel like a behemoth next to my willowy friends, but I've got awesome hair and nice eyes and such.  I am smart, I can keep up in a conversation, I am very good at making people laugh.

I live in a midwestern college town, and it is summer - the kids are gone, which is good. I'd rather not date a college student.  The problem is, I don't know where to go to meet guys, how to strike up a conversation (I'm working on being more outgoing, but it doesn't come naturally), or how to flirt successfully.  

I've been going out with friends, and what I've found is:

* going dancing is awful.  My friends enjoy it, but it is too hot, too crowded, and too awkward for me.  It really isn't a good way to meet people, and the ratio of girls to guys is not terribly advantageous.

* going to bars is iffy - I go with friends and we get a table and tend to talk amongst ourselves.  The people are often smarmy, bro-ish, or hanging out in their own circles.  Better than dancing, yeah, but not much.

* approaching people is hard!  I'd rather not do the approaching, but I have begrudgingly accepted that I need to be proactive.  How do I do this without being too forward?

I've got no Friday night plans, reddit.  What should I do to increase my chances of meeting someone when I'm not your standard svelte blonde?

It seems like no guy wants anything more than a hook-up with me. I have tried flirting with a variety of guys from frat stars, to the nerdiest kid in my engineering class and everyone in between to no avail. I don't have a problem making friends who are guys or finding a guy who wants to sleep with me, but it appears that is all anyone I meet ever wants. I've been sick of the whole random hook-up thing for a while now and stepped back because I thought maybe I was giving off the ""one night stand"" type of vibe. Since trying to regroup, I still haven't had any luck with finding a guy who wants anything more than a quickie or to be my best friend. 


My guy friends have told me that guys don't date me because I'm too motivated and men don't like that. I know I am more motivated than most, but I never thought that was something to be seen as a negative. The general consensus from my friends seems to be that I'm a great person to know, but they wouldn't want to date a girl who does more than them. 


I guess I'm wondering is this just an immature, college boy thing? Or men, do you not want to date a woman who is smart, hard working, or very accomplished? Is this seen as a negative instead of a positive? 


**Edit** : To clarify, this is not something that I'm constantly preoccupied with. I'm very content with the fact that I haven't had a serious relationship in the past 4 years, and with my undergrad coming to an end in a few weeks, I'm not looking to start anything now. The comment was made to me about the beginning of the semester and I didn't think much of it. A similar comment was also made to my by my classmate, but about a different female in our class in which he said: ""I would hook up with her because she's attractive, but I couldn't ever date her. She does too much and makes me feel lazy."" I'm very similar in terms of intelligence, level of physical attractiveness, and motivation to the girl that my classmate made a comment about. 


I know I'm young and I don't think that I will be forever alone because I'm motivated, nor would I change this aspect of myself just so I could meet a man. I'm constantly trying to better myself and I don't see taking on less challenging coursework and projects as helping me do that. I do think that maybe I just go about meeting men wrong and am willing to hear advice about how to project that while I spend a lot of time with my studies, it's not all that I do. 


I'm aware that there must be men out there who do prefer motivated women, but the general consensus seems to be that at the college level perhaps they are few and far between. Maybe I'll have better luck at grad school next year.

So the other night, I went out with a guy that my friend recommend I hang out with. Here was the plan. We were to grab a tea/coffee and go for a walk in the park to chat once I got off work. He was telling me prior to our meeting that he found me intriguing and was looking forward to getting to know me better. 

Fast forward to when I got off work. I went home to freshen up a little, touch up my make-up and put on something a little nicer than what I had been wearing at work. Then I went to meet him outside of my building. He showed up wearing a baggy, stained sweater that was clearly too big for him, really loose jeans and a pair of beat-up athletic running shoes(not street shoes). I immediately wanted to turn around and call the whole thing off, but I figured, what the hell, I'm here anyways, might as well give it a shot.

We went straight to the park and talked for an hour or so. Conversation was flowing well and I was enjoying myself, but in the way that someone would just enjoy the company of another without any romantic interest. It was late and cold, and the shops were closed, so we went back to my place for a cup of tea. (I made it clear to him that we were only going for tea)

Towards the end of the evening, he told me he liked me and found me very interesting and asked me what I honestly thought of him. I told him I enjoyed talking with him and enjoyed his company, but the way he had dressed had completely changed my mindset as to how the evening would go. He asked me elaborate, so I told him upfront that he looked sloppy. In the past, I have dated men who weren't necessarily the fashion kings that you'd find in GQ, but who would dress crisp and sharp, and didn't look like they were in high school. He was 21, but looked like he was 16. 

Then things got interesting. He said that since we were just going to the park, he didn't feel the need to really dress up. If you're interested in someone(which he made quite clear), shouldn't you want to make yourself look nice no matter what the situation is? He asked me why should the way he dressed matter if we were having a good conversation and there was a connection. He thought that his ""natural good looks""(he really was not that good looking) were enough to get him by and he claimed that if he was able to get girls in the past with how he currently looks, why should he have to change? He is from a smaller city where I guess there isn't as much of fashion scene (we live in a major metropolitan city), but I don't think this should matter! You should know how to present yourself. I want to date a young man, not a boy. I also present myself a certain way, and I expect others to reciprocate.

Anyways, the evening ended pretty awkwardly and now he's causing a bit of a scene. He's asking all his friends from back home if how he dresses is bad and sending me their responses. One girl wrote that I ""clearly have issues"" and that my expectations are unreasonable and unrealistic. He also put something along the lines of ""just got fashion-raped by a gorgeous French girl"" as his facebook status. 

So what do you think Reddit? Should it really matter how you dress if you get along with someone? Do you think I was harsh or unreasonable? He seemed really rattled by the fact that the way dressed was the deal-breaker, and I feel bad knowing that I've upset someone. 

TL;DR Went out with someone who dressed sloppy(he wasn't aware that he dressed bad). He asked me my opinion, so I told him why I didn't want to see him again and he got very defensive and felt hurt.

My social skills are acceptable, but not great, but unfortunately I'm not a very interesting person.

I know that what I have to do when I'm done exams is find something other than the aforementioned video games and reddit to fill my time... only working 45-50 hrs/week will represent a huge increase in my free time per week compared to the last 5 years.

2 days ago she told me, with confidence, that she suffers from bipolar disorder and that she is on meds for it. She also admitted to still getting the occasional mood swing, which I'm used to with women, no offense lol.

Yesterday was definitely one of those days. She just wasn't being herself. She wasn't flirty with me at all, she wasn't as talkative.

We had great conversations and I built up courage to ask her if she wanted to see Man of Steel. She said yes and seemed very positive.

The date just ended. We ate dinner, we talked a lot, laughed a lot and had a great time. During the movie we didn't talk much, but we whispered a bit. I wanted to hold her hand, so I slowly put my hand closer and closer, but she didn't grab it. After the film we took a walk and talked a lot about everything. At last we split up, it ended with a quick goodbye hug.

I feel like I fucked up. It was more like a friendly date rather than a romantic. We didn't have much physical contact and we didn't really do much flirty stuff.

We still both had a great time, but how should I continue this? I really like this girl, and I'm pretty sure she likes me (otherwise she wouldn't have accepted the invitation).
Is there still hope for us? I really need some guidance! I'm sad and confused.

UPDATE: About 2 weeks has gone by since the date. We have met quite a few times during this time to shoot footage for the movie and etc. I just try to be myself, but we still just interact like friends.

I pulled myself together, called her and asked her out again, this time for coffee at a café. She said she couldn´t because she was going to spend the night before at some friends, and that it would take time from the next day.

At first I just thought that was an exuse, but then I remembered that she actually mentioned this a few days before.
The sad thing is that we won´t be able to meet for the next 3 weeks since she´s going on vacation.

[20M/21F]",20,3,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gr3wo/i_tried_kissing_a_female_friend_of_mine_did_she/,"A friend of mine from high school (we're both in college now) was in my town and asked if we could get lunch. She's going off to Europe for a long period of time, so this would probably be our last confrontation for a while (we've met up randomly here and there across the past few years, having interesting conversations). We are both healthy attractive young people, and I know her to find me handsome (and I find her gorgeous). I happily agreed to meet up, and we had lunch the next day. As time went on she got progressively more jittery and kept laughing at my jokes (even bad ones) and had genuine reactions to uninteresting stories of mine. She was constantly smiling and laughing and she would not stop flinging her ponytail around as we kept the conversation going. Honestly a very deep and interesting conversation overall, across a wide variety of topics, and the most I've connected with someone in a very long time. It's also worth noting that she has spoken to me pretty openly about sex, and I know her to be fairly promiscuous.

She seemed to be having a good time, so I went ahead and asked ""so would you like to come back to my place, smoke some weed, and listen to music in my room"", to which she replied ""that sounds wonderful"". Ok, nice. So we go back to my place, smoke a few bowls, and get into my room. She's sitting on my futon, and I notice her grab a pillow off of my bed and she starts holding onto it while looking at me. We listen to a couple of songs and discuss what we're hearing, and then I go and sit on the futon right next to her. High, next to a beautiful woman in my room with soothing music playing, I go in for a kiss. She seems surprised and just says my name out loud...I can't remember the specifics of what happened at this exact moment, but I think I said something like ""so that's not happening then..."" and I apologized for if I made her uncomfortable. Sat there a minute or two until the song ended, and then we went into my living room and watched a few episodes of Adventure Time before she left. We were laughing at the show and still having a good time, but I knew she was still thinking about what had happened.


So I walk her to her car and say goodbye, and then a few minutes later she texts me ""why did you think I wanted you to kiss me? I'm not upset, I just want to know"". And I explained to her how she seemed to be having a really good time and agreed to come chill in my room, so I thought she might be down. Also that she was headed away for a long time, so it was either now or never. Her response to this was ""Well I respect you for doing your thing. I think it's flattering. I'm really a fan of our talks."" and then a bit about how there is a guy she is talking seriously with and wants to show him she is faithful. She thanked me again for meeting up and having lunch.
So was I wrong to try and cross the sexual boundary with her? The set up all seemed to be there, but she was surprised by my advancements. She really is a good friend so I don't want this to mess that up, but I feel it's something that will be hard for her to forget. I suppose it is asshole-ish of me to think she would want to hook up after a simple hang out, but I've known of her to do it with much less attractive and interesting men so I thought there was a chance. I'm probably thinking into this too much, but I want to learn from this mistake the best that I possibly can.

I am posting this as a throwaway because this is really embarrassing/ex boyfriend still uses reddit, etc. And even asking my  friends for advice on this is a problem for me since their first impression would be ruined before they met him!

So, Myself and M/29 met on OKCupid at the beginning of April. He is a great match to me in every way. Cute, smart, Professional, educated, we have similar interests, he is caring, considerate, funny - basically everything I am looking for in a partner.Things were going really well, until the first night he slept over.

The next morning, after he left..I had a horrific discovery - there were skidmarks (ie. shit stains) ALL OVER my duvet/sheets. They needed to be bleached - twice- to get all the stains out. We hadn't even had sex yet. :(

This is really embarrassing for anyone to talk about- including me. I decided it was a fluke thing and to ignore it, and give him a free pass sort of thing but- I got a uti when we did consummate our relationship (I only get uti's from sex) so I began to suspect his hygiene wasn't ahem...perfect. I brought it up and told him that he stained my sheets the other week and he took it really well. He was apologetic and embarrased and I said for my health, as well as his, to please be more ""Careful"" and try to be cleaner from now on. He seemed legitimately okay with this and I thought it would be the end of it. No such luck.

Also, I should mention, his personal hygiene overall seems fine, ie. he smells good, is generally clean - but there was another warning sign early on with his toenails. They were way too long (like TALONS long) and I told him to cut them because it was a BIG turnoff- he did - and was sorry, he explained his nails grow really fast (not really an excuse in my opinion). But after reminding him a couple times, they seem acceptably short and have since stopped being an issue. Also, when I stay over at his place, his sheets seem clean enough (no visible shit stains) because I would refuse to sleep in his bed if it seemed dirty, and it doesn't. Also, he also wears pyjama pants to bed. No problems there.

Well, things were okay until the next time he came over. Same thing. Not as many, but definately a couple of skid marks on my sheets. I was too humiliated to tell him again, so I just cleaned them again. I also insisted he wear underwear to bed from now on. (Which I hoped would prevent but also be a hint).

Well, a few nights ago I noticed another stain. When I was looking the other way,  I noticed that he also noticed it and tried to clean it subtly. When I was cleaning up, I decided to confront him and point it out. His first response was ""That wasn't me"". I said ""Umm, yes it is, it is on your side, and it certainly wasn't me."" The sheer gall -that even after being caught doing it before- he would claim it was not him ASTOUNDED ME.

He insited it wasn't him, and left the room. When he came back- I decided enough was enough. I told him ""Listen, I'm going to be direct. This can't keep happening if you're going to date me"" He then came clean and said maybe he needs to see a doctor or something since this has never happened to him and he doesn't understand why it is happening. I said ""If that is what you need to do, great. But we shouldn't even have to have a conversation about this, I don't understand why this is an issue"" etc.

We hugged and then he left in a hurry. This was Sunday morning. I haven't spoken to him since and he hasn't messaged me either.

Dear reddit, I am really torn here. He is a great guy and I really do like him a lot but I am so disgusted and turned off by this. Could I do something better? Am I not communicating well enough? Or am I wasting my time here?

Also, the fact that he lied at first when confronted, and wouldn't take accountability bothers me. Is this an early warning sign????

Part of me thinks I'm throwing away a great relationship over something that is fixable, another part of me thinks I am wasting my time with someone who obviously has gross habits I am not willing to live with and is now showing some kind of hesitation to change (since the problem has continued).

To make matters worse, its his birthday tomorrow and I'd feel terrible dumping him over this this week.. What should I do?

I've been dating so many jerks since January and this was the first person I really felt could become something special.

Thanks for reading and any advice.

TL:DR : Guy I've been dating who I like a lot and find great in every other way has questionable hygiene and has left skid marks in my bed on more than one occaision. He also had gross long toenails that he did fix once I mentioned it was a turnoff.

We've been on three dates and started having sex on the 2nd date. I've already ruled him out as relationship-materal mainly due to the following:

1) He's very noncommittal about setting up dates, which is why we've only been on three dates in two months. He said he would call to schedule/confirm a date, but twice he left me hanging.

2) I can't adjust to his hot and cold attitude. When I'm with him, he is everything that I could ask for: attentive, affectionate, funny, and fun to be around with. When I'm not with him, I get the feeling that his interest level is minimal due to his lack of communication between dates. Sometimes, he would not even respond back to my texts. I also get the feeling that I'm his back-up plan for when he has no one else to hit up.

Based on the above, I know I should move on, but the sex is INCREDIBLE. I've only had one sexual partner before him and he and I didn't do much, so I'm still kind of inexperienced. I want to keep seeing him casually just to gain some sexual experience. I feel like I can learn a lot from him and have fun at the same time. However, a part of me feels like I'm setting myself up for a whole lot of pain because I'm not sure if I'm the type of woman who can do casual sex. I'm conflicted. Some days, I feel like I'm okay with it. Other days, I feel like I should wait until I'm in a relationship again.

Any advice from those who have been in this situation before? Any tips or things to look out for should I choose to pursue this casual sex relationship? Thanks!

I'm in my late 20s, recently graduated, lives at home with his mother, and am unemployed--I know what a catch. My confidence is my biggest issue right now, with what I feel is good reason (previously mentioned), and I had some basic questions on etiquette or what is acceptable on a first date. My feelings are that some of these have changed and aren't necessarily the standard anymore and was curious about how women feel about them.

1) When you first meet a women in person and the only interaction you have had with her has been online, should you A) shake her hand B) giver her a hug C) kiss her on the cheek D) other, please explain

2) What would the answer be if you hadn't met her online and this was your first date?

3) During the date, should you open doors for her?

4) Should you open the car door for her not only to get in your car, but also out?

5) In regards to 3 and 4, does anyone else view chivalry as doing kind things for both men and women (e.g. opening doors, picking up things people dropped, letting someone go ahead of you) and feel as though the standard of chivalry as opening a door for a woman as outdated and really more or less about a guy just trying to impress a woman to get into her pants rather than possessing true chivalry?

6) When on the date either getting a drink or a meal, should a man pay or should it be split? Would it make a difference if you're on a first date from meeting online or in person?

My thoughts: Once in a relationship I wouldn't have any problem treating my girlfriend to a meal or any date, but I certainly don't expect to pay for everything. Obviously, my situation isn't ideal money wise, but was curious what is expected and if this is a potential deal breaker.

I'm out of a shitty relationship so I'm kind of hesitant from the start with him, but it seemed to be going well. We met once, went out once and then he invited me over to his apartment just to watch TV and eat pizza which I thought seemed fun.

Well, his apartment was foul, disgusting, dirty, gross and discomforting immediately upon walking in. Like, I mean, dirty stained walls, dirty carpet, random carpet remnants lying around, random clothing and other crap all over the floor, a random dark dirty pillow shoved in the corner of his living room for some reason... His bathroom was dirty and rusty, the bedroom (I got a tour) was thrown all over the place with a dirty unmade mattress on the floor. When we went to watch TV, I discovered that it didn't even work right, so it was just a red blur... And his car was just as filthy inside.

I don't have an apartment, I'm too broke, but I know if I lived in something like that, I wouldn't let people in without at least tidying up. He said he spent hours cleaning, but that funky, musty smell was nauseating. Best part was it had to be... maybe 30F in there, it was freezing and he wouldn't turn on the heat. 

I don't have a lot of dating experience, but was it wrong of me to have  turned him down for another date after this? Like, I'm not the most organized person, but I can't deal with filth. And I'm so sad because he was so sweet and kind, but I was so uncomfortable. I just told him I wasn't ready to date yet, I didn't tell him it was because of his dirty ass apartment.

I didn't turn him down because of money or looks or education, it was his living environment. I'm feeling really bad because I wonder if that was wrong or shallow of me, but it was so gross. 

I'm just wondering if the general opinion is that I should've turned him down by telling him the truth? Or was that a shallow thing to do because we've only met like, 3 times so far?

I went on a first date with a guy this past Friday.  We had a great time, and he initiated a hot makeout session when he walked me to my car.  
We also decided to hang out Saturday night.  We went to a movie, then grabbed a drink, and then watched the stars while we talked, and again made out.  
He wanted to hang out again, so last night (Sunday) I invited him over to watch a movie.  We actually did watch the movie, and of course made out again.  This time it was extremely hardcore (as far as making out can go) w/o having any form of sex.  I told him upfront before he came over that I didn't want any shenanigans.  Well, in the midst of our makeout session, he asked to spend the night.  I (stupidly) said yes.  No sex, but...yeah.  Help.

Did I ruin the mystery by saying he could spend the night?  I want this to evolve into a real relationship, but I'm afraid that it will turn casual if we keep the hot makeout sessions up.  I may give in because the sexual chemistry is obviously there.  

When is it a good time to have sex without losing his interest?  I'm new to real relationships, and I'm not sure how this works.

Combine that with the fact I’ve only slept with one woman (countless amounts of times, but one woman), and I’ve known two girls I saw for no more than 2 dates each during that span of time.  I’ve been concentrating on getting a more fulfilling job, attacking my debt, and just trying to find what makes me happy.  Ultimately, I didn’t get a better job, I ended up with roughly the same amount of debt now as I had, and I found happiness in friends, beer, and my alone-time with hobbies, like trying to make beats on my computer or listening to podcasts.

But I really want to understand the dating world.  I feel like I had a shot once, but I felt like I needed to take care of my personal finances and issues first before dragging a woman through the fire with me.

I don’t socialize much with others, but when I do, I make friendly quips and that’s about it.  I went out to nightclubs for years, but always danced alone in my own style.  I tried to progress into deeper relationships with friends but to no avail.  I feel that asking out total strangers for two hours+ has to be the most absurd request that one receives out of the blue, and I cannot logically wrap my mind around it.

I just started an OKCupid account, but I don’t know what angle to play up.  I asked some of my Facebook girl-friends to review it, and the few that replied back with suggestions kept telling me to play the family-card because relationship-oriented women our age are looking more for family-oriented guys, not so much casual sex.  I have no clue.

So what say you, kind Redditors?  Doomed or not doomed (cuz I’m feelin’ pretty doomed)?

Im tired of being a virgin but dont particularly desire a relationship right now(or perhaps im just so used to never being in one).

Occasionally i do get infatuated and i have wanted/tried awkwardly to start relationships(as more than just sexual) or indicate an interest in these persons, which results in a few days/weeks of them and me not talking much until we reach a point both of us can forget/pretend it happened and have normal conversations.



If i go out with friends ( both male and female, obviously i can converse calmly with friends that i know well when the topic is nonsexual) I simply cannot approach or talk to if the context switches to indicating a romantic or sexual interest, without a lot of alcohol and even then i feel an awkward fear(obviously nothing like a fear of death).

On some very rare occassions girls have seemingly approached me i get the same fear and end up rationalizing that im not interested in her or that im reading into it too much(when its blatantly obvious),i  make a bit of small talk until i can get away.

To add while out with friends i tend to nearly just cling to my friends which im certain gets a bit annoying for them at times, to add to that i may not be talking much at all so i just look like some creep standing around listening to other people talk.

And lately a lot of my friends are just constantly talking about sex and how much of it they're having. Its driving me nuts for multiple reasons:

 I feel like im missing out on something everyone else is enjoying, i guess i didn't miss it as much when i thought no one was doing it.

 I feel like im not an adult because of it.
 and when these conversations come up i feel like i have to remain silent while everyone else talks because my experiences with my hand aren't going to be particularly interesting contributions to the conversation.

 I haven't been on date in years and im starting to worry that either im not capable of having those kind of adult relationships or that im allowing a gap between my experience sexual/emotional and that of my peers to just expand. and the longer i allow it to grow the harder its going to be to cross.

The main reason its probably really starting to annoy me now is because them talking about it is just making it more obvious to me that i haven't been dealing with relationships at all, i always tell myself:

""i'll approach a girl next week"" or ""i'll wait until the next term of college"" or more recently ""i'll wait until i have a job"" these are all just excuses for my own inaction.

This girl and I are FWB, and after about 5 months of seeing each other I asked her if she wanted to be mutually exclusive to which she said she wasn't yet ready. I thought that was the end of that since now things are going to get super awkward, but she became MORE affectionate than before. This really messed with my mind and *in Ron Burgundy voice* I DON'T LIKE IT. 

Since then we've been hanging out every weekend as if we're a couple. We've both made it apparant that though we're not exclusive, we also aren't hooking up with other people. Here's the situation: I ask her to do a lot of stuff (hiking, trying new restaurants, theme parks, museums, concerts, small vacations, etc.). She's pretty much met all of my friends multiple times, and even my sister whom I'm very close with. As far as picking up the tab, I generally split it 70/30 since I feel that it's my duty to pay the lion's share. I feel like I'm always the one putting in effort to hang out because she's really shy and introverted whereas I'm the exact opposite. It's not that she doesn't ask to hang out, but when she does she just says, ""I'm bored. What do you wanna do?"" Don't get me wrong, when we hang out we have a fantastic time. I make her laugh, she makes me laugh, and the pockets of silence are more peaceful than awkward.

Recently, I haven't been contacting her as much because it just makes me feel silly to almost always be the one initiating (I hope some of you know what I'm talking about). I completely understand that we're technically just FWB, but if she wanted it that way, then why all this affection? It's confusing and I don't really want to bring it up because like I said she's super introverted and that would make things really awkward really fast. I like to get things done and set boundaries. If things are broken, let's fix it. If you want to be something, let's work towards that. If you want to stay FWB, let's maintain that. What's with this lack of communication?? I've already told her that I never want to make her uncomfortable, and if she has anythig she wants to talk about I'm always open to conversation. To be frank, this confusion is really turning me off, and I don't really feel like contacting/responding to her anymore.

I've really enjoyed getting to know you over the past few weeks and I'd like to get to know you a bit better.  Would you like to grab a cup of coffee, play a game of cribbage or something sometime?  I think I've failed at my attempts to flirt with you so far so I wanted to try and be a bit more forward (i'm kind of oblivious and shy when it comes to this sort of thing).

Well, after discussing it, we (my friend and I) decided that it would be cool to bring my date with me to a bookstore. I originally planned on going there this coming Tuesday to complete my collection of Schoenberg music. As she also has a great interest in classical music (she's a musician too :D), I figured that this would work well as it can lead to some awesome conversation on music, funny books, classics, etc.. 

Keep in mind that this is a huge used bookstore, with multiple floors. It also sits on the corner of the downtown square which is home to several other venues that are interesting and within walking distance.

But I've read some opinions that this date could be extremely boring, which would be obviously bad. However if a woman is bored at a bookstore, do I really want to be with her?

I'm a 28M, she's a 24F. We worked at a large company together, met through a mutual friend there, and became pretty good friends. We spent a lot of time chatting, etc., at work, and eventually started hanging out alone outside of work (I initiated that of course).


After a month of casual hanging out/dating, I told her I wanted to move beyond friendship, and she told me she felt the same as well. We moved to ""exclusive dating,"" and that's where we've been for a little over a month now. It's been about 3 months total since we've started to really get to know each other and develop a relationship.


Now, the difficult part is, not only is she an indecisive person (i have to pick places to eat, things to do, etc., all the time, which i don't have a problem with at all), but we also agreed to move the relationship at her pace, since she hasn't had a boyfriend since she was 17 (not a 'real' relationship), and has not been kissed, etc. (yes, v-card is still there). I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place after agreeing to let a generally indecisive person dictate the pace of the relationship, but at the same time, this person happens to be very shy so i'd have to take the lead anyways...


I like this girl very, very much, and i'm willing to be as patient as needed but can't help but wonder if there's anything I can or should do to escalate the physical aspect a little more? Just to give an example, it took almost 8 weeks for us to start hugging it out after meeting up/leaving each other. I've had plenty of moments alone with her where she's brought us to her house or the park together, but i've personally just have not wanted to make things awkward by possibly moving too fast, but also am stuck because i know she will never initiate anything unless I do.


So; should I just go for it? Or does she need more time? Any advice on how to get just a little more touchy with a woman who's never been kissed and generally just has had no dating experience since she was in high school? Any help would be appreciated!!!

Hello fellow redditors!

I've been itching to end my life as a single guy for the longest time, and I had placed a few conditions for myself before attempting to do so, like losing weight(lost 75 pounds and 14% BF in a year), picking up hobbies, try to do more things so I have more to talk about, you know how it goes.

While I'm not quite where I want to be, I think I'm starting to draw some attention from the female crowd, and, well, I'm not used to that. I don't recall having anyone really flirt with me, or like-like me in the longest time, and I'm the sort of guy that can only see black or white; either I believe everyone and their mother are into me for trivial reasons, or I'll just shut myself down to these signs because I can't conceive they are directed at me, in that sort of way.

I used to be the prior, but after numerous false positives, I adopted the latter, and have been this way for years. I can never seem to tell, and I'm probably the worst single guy in the history of time in that department, I don't think I even have the ability to flirt at all.

I had seen him plenty of times almost every other day. Like i said it's only been about 3-4 weeks since we've known each other. I admit that one day i freaked out cause i was upset and only wanted to see him but he wasn't home. Now he's not replying back to my messages or answering my calls, as if i did something really terrible when i was just looking for some comfort. Since then i'm trying to forget him and move on to other people but i'm finding it really hard to. 

Can anyone give me some friendly advice on how to forget this guy? its sounds stupid i know,since we haven't known each other that long. i just felt a connection with him. I felt like i scared him off just cause i had a bad day and wanted to see him. I don't understand what's going on.

Like i said, i want to move on because i don't want to be with a guy who doesn't consider my feelings. I'd really like some advice, if anyone can help me with moving on because it seems really hard to.

I recently turned 30, and am happy with my life, with one big exception: women. Due to severe social anxieties , I wasn't able to talk to girls until I was 25, and after that, the job (which was and is going very well) ate up most of my time. Plus, at this point, most of my friends were in long-term relationships already, so I got nobody to go out with.

I have been on several dates. Sometimes, the girls were attracted to me, but I was not to them. Sometimes, it was the other way round. And it also happened that there was nothing. What I wonder is if I somehow failed to ""lit the spark"", by not ""being sexual"". And, perhaps this was caused by ... well, I masturbate a lot. I have been thinking about stopping it for a few days, and then try to go out on a date. Do you agree?

My second question is about the age. At 30, most men have had serious relationships, and collected TONS of sexual experience. I then read [this comment from TheGreatKite](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/198kdf/im_nearly_30_yr_old_male_and_havent_had_sex_or/c8luhkn) , and it fuels my fears. She says: ""especially considering a man's twenties should be the height of his sexual life. At 30, it's almost a deal-breaker if the guy hasn't had least a 3+ year relationship.""
Also, [in this other comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/198kdf/im_nearly_30_yr_old_male_and_havent_had_sex_or/c8mhit6), retseh says: ""I've had girls stop talking to me after the 3rd date because they asked about my longest relationship.""

We went on 6 dates, the last being her finally inviting me over her apartment for a night of board games, wine and good times.  

In the midst of conversation she reviews her dating history and states that over the last year and a half she's seen a range of guys but never made anything official because they all at some point ""smothered her"". She saw a lot of these guys within a range of 3-5 months.  

In that same conversation she stated that she hadn't met any guys that she liked enough to make time for over and around her friends. As she said this she laughed and stated that I was an obvious exception. (She travels for work and is around only on the weekends and since we've met I've gotten at least 1 or 2 of those days.) She and I get along really well and her friends have all expressed that she really likes me. However, I'm admittedly a little concerned over letting my personal feelings grow over time, so I, like those before me, don't come across as ""smothering"". I'd hate to scare her away just because I started liking her more than I already do. 

So I find myself with a difficult task of trying to show this girl that I like her without coming across as clingy or smothering.  As it stands, we're not a couple but we're definitely dating (considering we've already made plans to get together for at least the next two weeks). Usually when we're both out, we text at the end of the night to meetup. I'm careful not to always initiate this because of the smothering potential. I let it be her idea so she can't say I'm getting clingy...but honestly I'd like to initiate sometimes so she doesn't think I'm just along for the ride. 

**TL;DR:** I want it to be known that I really like this girl who travels for work and makes time with me every weekend she's here that I've been on 6 dates with. However I want to do so without coming across as smothering, like her last few exes (The smothering is what caused her to dump them).

I was not confident in myself for a long time, so I never really tried to form a ""relationship"" with anybody or ask someone out (not out of fear of rejection or anything, I was just under the mindset that no one would go for me). Now that I am much more comfortable with myself, I don't really know how to make myself a sexual object rather than a simple friend candidate. I have many friends that are girls, but I have never had a ""girlfriend."" I know I can just ask someone out, but I feel that there needs to be some precedent set of myself in that context. For this reason, I feel that I can't ask out a stranger and I can't ask out a friend (I used the phrase ""I feel"" several times purposefully - I am well aware that these things might be completely untrue). Because of this, I feel sexually and emotionally frustrated.

Two notes: I have been asked innumerable times if I am gay (I'm not), and the first girl I asked out said yes and then reneged a few hours later stating that she ""didn't want to lose me as a friend."" I just feel that these things are very relevant.

Okay, I guess I should give a bit of a background on why I am asking this. My ex and I were together for 8 years, we are both 23 now, and we split up in September. We have tried to remain friends since our split, because it was a mutual decision (well mostly at least). He has recently told me that he may be considering dating someone, but that it would only be dating because he knows that he is not ready for a relationship right now. 


I don't know how to take this, and I don't really know what he means in a way. Because I thought the point of dating someone was to see if you could have a relationship with them, so I don't know how he could be trying to date someone if that is not what he wants. He keeps telling me that he is extremely lonely and that he would like to have someone there as company, and that he is not looking for something like a deep connection or relationship like what we shared when we were together.

When I text a girl and she takes a long time to respond.  I take that as low interest and just eliminate her. Because, I'd rather be doing something else than going out with a girl who isnt that interested.

For example,

I text a girl Ive been talking to for the past month. last Saturday asking her out.  She replied 9 hours later that she couldnt.  I texted her again yesterday asking her out.  She took 6 hours and said she would love to.  She just dicks around on facebook all day at work, so i know she wasnt busy as i saw her comment on tons of stuff.  

I ended up saying something came up. As she lives an 1.5 hours away, and i didnt really feel like driving to see a girl who wasnt all that interested.

Another example,

Like 4 months ago, I was dating and actively having sex with a girl.   Everytime I would ask her out, she would either a) if it was on the phone, say probably but would let me know the day of or b) if it was over text, text me like a full day later saying yes.

At this point, we haven't discussed a boyfriend/girlfriend arrangement yet (which is good, because it is way to soon for that IMO) but I definitely get the sense about some emotional roots starting to form up on her side.

At the same time, I've been closing in on another woman who I've known for a while longer - she's the busy type, and I'm just now going to have the opportunity to transition from ""hanging out"" to possibly something more intimate - so things will probably escalate this week. 

So on the surface, this is a classic case of ""who do I choose?"" But neither of these relationships (I use the term loosely here, since there's no stated commitments yet) are really to the level of seriousness that I think make a choice necessary yet. My impression has always been that the imperative of having to choose comes up when you're presented with the need to do so (typically, someone wants to become ""official"" or otherwise start seeing each other exclusively).

The question I have is how to proceed. Not in the sense of logistics, but in the sense of knowing where to start drawing boundaries to minimize hurt feelings. Am I a cad if I end up sleeping with both of them? My instinct is to say no, seeing as I'm respectful, use protection, etc., and nobody involved has made any real statements of feeling/commitment yet. But that also sounds a little self-serving, so I don't know if it's a valid rationale.

The flip side, of course, is that if I don't follow through with the full possibilities available with both of these women, I may end up with nothing, which I REALLY don't want considering a 6 month dry spell. I don't imagine a conversation along the lines of ""I can't sleep with you…there's this other woman, and I want to keep my options open"" ending well.

I try to imagine how I would feel if the roles were reversed, and I believe that I would be OK with someone I'm dating ""play the field"" while we were still casual as long as she wasn't making promises she wouldn't keep, lying to me, or otherwise be exposing me to risks. But even these things come down to perspective.

Incidentally, I'm not trying to sound like a player or boast or anything…I'm actually kind of new to this whole ""several women want me at once"" concept, since I've usually only had one prospect at a time.

She has picked fights every time we talk, criticized me and even has told me leave because she knows we are about to fight, she even got mad at me because I did not show enough emotion during her story. It seems like she literally hates me when she on her period.  

She sent a few texts last night apologizing for her actions, I responded with a causal good night and now the hours are going by, and I am kind of keeping her waiting for a basic human response.

I'm starting to psyche myself up so much that I fear I will simply stop talking to him, rather than face actually having to go through the awkwardness of explaining I've never so much as kissed a guy outside of alcohol-induced situations, let alone slept with anyone.

So I met this girl online and we've been chatting. She's pretty cute, but a virgin and never really been in a relationship before. (Moving around, military life, etc)

I honestly think she's interesting as a person, but I also really badly want to have sex with her. The great part is, she really wants to have sex too. We've exchanged some pretty spicy messages back and fourth, so naturally I have butterflies about the whole thing. It's been a couple of months for me so I'm dying to get laid again. 

The thing is, she keeps telling me that I'm the most awesome person she's ever met and while it's flattering, it's also a little uncomfortable. I'm only going to be in the area for a few more months, and she knows that. She's also stated that true love isn't up there on her priorities at the moment, but sex is.

I'm worried about 3 things:

1. The age difference. I'm afraid her mother will flip out. I'm a decent and polite guy and I don't look sketch, but I'm still worried she'll wonder why a 24yo is hanging out with an 18yo. But here's what makes it a little complicated. I have baggage about this. At one point just about every girl I knew in college was dating a guy 7-10 years older than her. My long term gf even left me for a guy that was 17 years older than her. I really resent this and so I'm kinda excited for ""my turn.""

2. Pregnancy. She's not on birth control and she doesn't feel abortion is an option for her personally. I can't get her pregnant. It would destroy both our lives. I'm so close to taking off and fulfilling my dreams that a pregnancy would shatter everything. I use protection all the time, and I have the morning after pill on hand, but nonetheless it scares me.

3. I don't want to hurt this girl. I *really* want to have sex with her, but I don't want to hurt her. I've told her that I plan on leaving in a few months, but she still seems to really want to lose her virginity to me.

Thoughts?

**EDIT** Ok, let's get some things straight here since I feel like you're all blowing this waaaay out of proportion.

A) She is **NOT** under age.

B) I perhaps gave you the wrong idea of just how head over heels she is about me. She merely said I was the coolest person she had met. She only said it like twice in 30+ messages. She does not keep going on and on about that. She does not text me at all hours of the night wonder what I'm doing. I'm sorry if that made her sound like a cat5 clinger. She's not.

C) Of course I'd use protection. I'd insist on it. I also have the morning after pill on hand.

My predicament: I'm a 24-year-old kissless virgin (and a dude), geeky, and fairly socially awkward. I'm meeting her for dinner tonight, and I plan on talking and getting to know her better for an hour or so, and then I was going to take her to see a movie afterwards if she was interested (with me insisting on paying for everything, of course). Then maybe dessert or something after the movie so we can talk some more.

So, Reddit, I ask you: can you give me some advice so I don't fuck this up and get a second date out of this? I'm fairly clueless on what I should do and NOT do, so if any guys (and especially girls) can help me out with this, I'd really appreciate it. I already talked to two friends who gave me advice, but I feel like any advice is good advice.

Some questions:

- How can I tell she's interested in me making a move, like holding her hand/kissing her?

- Do I absolutely HAVE to kiss her on the first date? I mean, I'm going to hug her obviously when I see her/say goodbye. Would it mean no second date if I didn't kiss her? lol

- Are there things I should talk about/ask her? Are there things I should definitely not talk about?

- Also, she seems to be just as geeky (and apparently really open and nice according to friends) as me. Should I tell her or not that I don't have much experience with dating and relationships? Or is that a definite no-no? Thanks!

**UPDATE**: The date went great, guys! We had a lot to talk about, and it was fun - a lot of laughs were shared. I proposed a second date before we said goodbye, and she said she's definitely up for it. Thanks for the great advice! :)

A little while after I had gotten home, he texted me saying that he had a great time, was glad he met me in person, and that we should do it again sometime.

Since that afternoon, though, I've begun to feel as though this is too good to be true. In the past, I always end up being more interested in a guy than he is in me, which has consistently led me down a very sad and frustrating path.

Since our coffee date, though, I've been wanting to see him again more strongly, and it's perplexing me. Before we met and the very moment after our date ended, I was convinced that I didn't care if it was only one date and nothing more.

Is this something that is even permitted by schools in general?

There's a girl in my gym that I'm interested in asking out and I want to hear from your input on how you personally would prefer a guy to ask you out. I've chit chatted with her before around the gym and I think there's enough going on there to ask her out.

I have the usual concerns of her already having a boyfriend, not being interested, batting for the other team, etc. I guess my concerns are not wanting to put her (or me) on the spot in front of other people. I also want to ask in a way to give us both a face saving exit in case nothing is happening between us but I also want to get a definitive enough answer so I know if she's interested or not. I used to always avoid dating girls in my dorm or at my work because I always feared the awkwardness of it not working out but I need to not let that get in the way of allowing things to work.

Thanks!

As silly as it may be, we hit it off at a party of a mutual friend and instantly jumped to relationship status.  It was admittedly very quick and unexpected, but we've found each other great company and have very similar outlooks and goals in life and our futures.  Unfortunately, our chances to see each other have been tight due to early summer vacations and obligations.  Now we're both back home, but she's a little hesitant.

She was clearly having some hesitant thoughts and I tried to be as supportive as I could over goddamn text messages (I hate doing anything serious over texts), but she told me that she decided she would like an open relationship between us.  She defined an open relationship slightly more conservatively than I usually see defined, specifically saying it would be a lot like a real relationship but that we would be okay with ""stuff accidentally happening with other people,"" but I'm still very wary.

We're both 18 and both leaving for college in two months.  We're relatively close to each other, about 2 hours between our colleges, but she said she still thinks it mattered to how our relationship would play out.

I'm wary of an ""open"" relationship due to the overall nature of them and with my previous experiences with relationships in general, though they were closed.  In particular I'm frightened by the way my ex-girlfriend used to be very talkative to me, but gradually started talking with her best friend and later her eventual new partner more than she would me.  I am not on good terms with her anymore.
I subscribe a little bit of a romantic view when it comes to relationships, like we'll work things out and talk it over, but the research I've done on open relationships so far makes it sound somewhat restrictive and structured heavily around following rules and communicating properly.  For me, that would be intensely stressful and feel too much like a hierarchy or dominating, almost like a parent-child relationship of ""tell me where you are, when you are, with who you are.""  I don't want her to go through that and I sure as hell don't want it to cause her to drift away from me.  I'm worried I'll either be too controlling or too lax either way.

I appreciate the help and perspectives anybody would lend to this situation.  The last thing I want is another messy break-up and resentful ex.  I like this girl too much.

If in the off chance that my girlfriend is reading this, and she'll probably know from the details, just know I'm still a bit of a mental mess and need some help for this.

We’re entering phase two of our new flair system and we’re so excited to tell you about the new changes we’re making. 

By popular demand, we’re moving away from having individual subreddits for various relationship-related issues, and we’re merging all our subreddits together. We are going to incorporate the satellite subs into /r/relationships with our new, amazing tag system. We’re hoping this will alleviate some of the tension over people being asked to move their posts into smaller subreddits. 

Instead of posting to /r/dating_advice, you will be staying in /r/relationships with your post tagged for 'Dating'. Users can use the filtering function, [seen here]( http://i.imgur.com/1VJWaSJ.png), to decide what posts they want to read.

**Subreddits that we’re rolling into /r/relationships**

**Subreddits remaining separate**

* /r/Settlethis

/r/Settlethis is remaining separate because it is our brand new project and we want it to have some space to breathe and grow on its own. This subreddit is a place for couples to come, make their own posts regarding a relationship issue or disagreement, and link to one another’s content. Then users can weigh in to help that couple sort out their disagreement and arbitrate the discussion. Because that’s such an odd format for reddit, we wanted to give this new project its own space.

We then started texting back and forth for about a week, again finding that we had more and more stuff in common.

We finally met each other on St. Patrick's day, we drank and talked, and I had to leave because I had to work in the morning.  She walks with me to my car, and pretty much slams me against it, doing irrevocable damage to my dental work with her tongue and mouth.  The make out session was great, though short lived, and we were both a little drunk.

The next night we hang out, we drink some beers, and chat for a few hours.  I take her back to her place, and walk her to her front door.  We make out again, and I leave, feeling great about everything, and starting to feel enamored with this chick.

We hang out again the next Monday, she has to go do something after, and we make out before she leaves, she says she really wishes she didn't have to go help her friend plan a wedding, but she didn't have a choice.

We hang out the next day, Tuesday, and again end in a make out session, she invites me inside, and things start to get heavy.  She is rubbing me, and I am rubbing her, and she stops it.  She says he wants to take it slow, I agree, and we continue to make out until I go home.

We spend Friday together, but only a few hours, walking around a museum/garden, we kiss and make out randomly throughout this.

Monday, we hang out again.  We get some beers, and talk about stupid shit, go back to her place, we start making out, and it starts to get heavy again.  She stops making out with me, looks me in the eyes, and says 'do you want to go to my room and fuck me?'  I say yes, because what the fuck do you say in that situation.  The sex is great, and lasts for a few hours.

Tuesday, we don't hang out, but she sends me dirty texts and photos all night.

Thursday, we hang out, and end up fucking again.

Saturday, I take her to a museum charity boozefest, then to a bar after that, I get overly drunk, and tell her that I am not seeing anyone else, and actually stopped seeing the girl I was with before, because of her.  I then slur out that I really like her, she says she feels the same, or she wouldn't be doing this if she didn't feel the same.  This makes me feel good, and I make the first mistake, I tell her that I want to be exclusive.  She disagrees, because she wants to be able to date other people.  We go back to her place, and have sex again.  This is also the first time I have stayed over at her house.

The next morning, we wake up, and again with the sex.  We have breakfast(just some cereal), and talk some, nothing too big.  After I get home, she sends me a big text, saying how she can't stop thinking about me, and that she loves that when I say something I actually do it, I don't just talk about it.  I tell her that I can't get her off of my mind as well.

Monday, we hang out, have sex, and in the post-coital haze, I ask her about Saturday night(I didn't remember asking her any of that stuff).  She explained to me what all happened, and such.  I tell her again, fully sober, that I do want to be exclusive with her at one point, that I understand right now it is too early, but that I am not just in this for the sex.  She says that she just wants to take things slow, because she has a bad habit of jumping into things super fast.  I tell her I understand, and get ready to go home.  As she is standing by the door, we make out again. I go home.

The next morning, Tuesday, she texts me first, I ignore the first one(I was busy at work), and she sends another one asking if I feel alright after the talk last night.  I tell her that I feel fine, I understand where she is coming from, and so long as she is being honest with me I am perfectly fine with it.  If she wants to take things slow, then slow it will be.



I don't exactly want a relationship right now, but she is pretty fucking awesome.  Now, I am not sure exactly how to respond.  Normally to me, taking it slow means waiting to have sex.  I am willing to give her time for whatever she needs, but I just know I will have a time limit on being able to take it slow.

What exactly do I do?  Should I pull back on texting her as much?  Should I still be the one to ask her on dates, or should I just leave it until she asks me on one?  She sends me texts saying how I put her in a state of euphoria, and that she is thinking about me.  

My best friend is getting married in a month, and I have to RSVP, I want to take her with me, but would that be weird to ask her?

It is a weird state of being, because I like to be the one to initiate everything, do not hide emotion well, and when I want something, I go for it, regardless of what it may take to get.  So this is the total opposite of what is normal for me.

Both of us are working professionals in Boston, she will be entering law school in the fall. The past (only) three relationships I have been in were all friends who transitioned slowly into relationships, so despite my age I am relatively new to the dating song and dance. So here I am.

We met about a month ago, and we did what I suppose is the normal dating ritual. First date was dinner and drinks after work, I paid, she offered but only once. Left on a hug. Second date was a day date, but escalated to a movie, making out and staying over. Third date was very intimate in the same vein. Since then, been hanging out and just spending random free moments with each other.

And because I'm sure the question will come up, no sex yet.

She will be going on a family vacation to England soon, and to be very honest, I have not felt this smitten in regards to a girl, ever. Not even my previous relationships. My gut wants to ask her to make it official sooner rather than later. My head is saying to wait and be patient.

Things moved really fast- we rushed into a sexual relationship and spent days at a time hanging out together. I've gone out of my way to treat him really well (trying extra hard in bed, cooking for him, giving him nice compliments, etc.) and his friends tell me that he likes me a lot. I haven't been in a relationship in a long time and got excited I think, I just had fun playing house with someone and having a lot of sex. I really did think he was relationship material and was pretty into him at first. But now, all of sudden I've inexplicably lost all interest- just, *poof*, from crazy about him to no feelings at all. After spending so much time together, I think I just got bored of this guy, learned some things about him I didn't love, and hanging out with him has lost its appeal, unfortunately. That, and certain extraneous circumstances have arisen in my life that require a lot of my time and are really stressing me out, so sex and dating are the very last on my list of priorities right now.

I feel terrible; he's a really nice guy and he's done nothing wrong. I just feel like a jerk that I came on so strong and now I'm not interested in hanging out anymore. I've been on the other end of that equation before and it sucks. But what can I do, it's not fair but I can't help how I feel.

We've been talking less and less and haven't actually seen each other in about two weeks due to schedule issues so I'd imagine he must have some clue that things are not the same, but I don't know what to say if he asks me to hang out again. Since we only hung out for a few weeks and never made any kind of commitments to each other I feel odd coming out and ""breaking up"" with him, but we also have a lot of mutual friends and I am bound to run into him from time to time, so I feel like loose ends should be tied up.

I've been on 3 dates in my life, still a virgin, not even a first kiss.. I'm absolutely horrid at this kind of stuff.

I started with the advice of improving myself, which I did. I do a lot of hobbies I enjoy, bought a bit nicer clothes, spent a little bit more effort on my appearance. Been working out the past year, and I'm in pretty great shape now. Started an OKCupid account 4 months back, and used r/okcupid twice to get suggestions to improve my account. I also tried to get out more. I read papers at coffee shops, try to eat out once a week, attend local events at the college and city.

But, I haven't had any real results. After 4 months on OKCupid (and 82 messages as of now), I have been on 2 dates with one girl, who eventually said she was getting back with an ex. I don't think another 4 months and an additional 80 messages will work, as I've sort of tried with most of the women on my (I think reasonable) searches.

My trips around town have also been equally uneventful. Coffee shops don't lead to conversation, same with walks at the local parks. Now I just feel like I waste a lot of my time going out for the sole purpose of meeting people, and coming home disappointed. Meetup.com has nothing even remotely viable for me in the area, and all my coworkers are married with kids in high school. I know I would improve my chances by going up to random, single-looking women I see, and trying to start conversation somehow, but I really don't have the personality to do that. I've approached that point, but chicken out every time.

Not only have I had no close calls in terms of potential dates, but I worry that THEN I have to go through the process of explaining that I am a 27 year old male with the dating experience of a middle schooler.  If I try to hide that fact, it will soon be painfully obvious.. It feels like if I got to the (seemingly insurmountable) point of talking to a girl, getting together for something, it would quickly be dashed apart by this fact.

For example, once comfort level is established, I suppose that you're able to reveal more to your partner, etc. but what about going out on dates?

I hope that I am in the right section,

I (26) met this girl who I will name ""G"" (24). We both met during school of spring 2012 and during the first class when we saw each other I knew that G liked me and I liked her. This was in our physics lab class and we meet up every other week doing lab work together in a group with other people. During the semester G did asked me out if I wanted to grab a lunch together and I obliged (sort of mini date). By the end of the spring semester I asked her out on a date and G responded yes but I never called her back or text her till two months later, so I basically stood G up. 

I was accutane for oily skin, for anyone who had taken this drug(its for acne) knows that it has a lot of side effects and one of them I had was really bad depression/sad most of the time. I text her at the end of summer saying I was sorry but I haven't explain that I was on accutane. I don't think I recall that G even text me back. So fast forward to Fall 2012, during mid semester I went off accutane. By the end of the semester my depression came off and my happiness and confidence shot through the roof and now that I think about what happened with G I felt really bad and I wanted to explain it to her even though it leads to nowhere. 

Recently I text her and chat a little about how are we doing regarding our semester and I can tell that she wasn't really interested continuing with the chat. My question is that should I tell her or not? Part of me wanted to tell G because since there was no closure and at the same time I also wanted it to get it off my chest. Other part of me I know that she's no longer interested and I am wasting my time so I shouldn't say anything. 

tl;dr I stood a girl up due to accutane/depression and haven't talked to her in half a year with no reason stated besides an apology.

I'm not a guy that only wants sex. But if I'm being perfectly honest, it's the main thing I'm looking for. If a full-blown relationship blossoms out of it, that's great! If we just become friends, that's fine too. And, if things don't click perfectly and we just go our separate ways, then so be it. But what I've found is that sex is really important to me. If I go into a situation that has the potential to become sexual, but doesn't, I become disappointed, regardless of how good/bad the rest of the encounter went.

So, the actual question: what is a guy expected to do, if that's what he's looking for? I get the feeling (and correct me if I'm wrong) that most women are not as ready to jump into bed as I am. So, I've been dating and being friendly, making conversation, doing my best not to be pushy. But, at the same time, I try to be clear about what I'm looking for. Not ""hey, I'm hoping to have sex with you tonight,"" but something along the lines of, ""I really value physical intimacy, and I usually experience attraction very quickly.""

This seems to get me... nowhere fast. My dates are usually impressed with my honesty (and have often explicitly thanked me for being up-front) and then things have quickly turned into a smile and a ""no thank you."" I've considered pretending that I'm not looking for sex, but I cringe at the thought. It feels dishonest, and I don't want to feel like I have to trick a date into sleeping with me.
So, what's a guy to do? Slow down and pretend I'm looking for something else? Keep looking until I find someone who moves as quickly as I do? Or... is there some fundamental change that needs to occur? I've considered the idea that wanting sex so much might be a bad sign, but it's difficult to find motivation to change what you want. It seems absurd to try and want sex less in order to improve my chances of getting laid.

Advice needed,19,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/14dosb/25m_i_want_to_stop_looking_for_a_relationship_but/,"I'm not going to tell you my life's story. But I need to say that the urge to have a girlfriend has always been extremely strong in me. When I was 6 years old I started to get feelings for girls, I would declare myself ""in love"" as any child would, and from that point forward, girls and girlfriend was the main objective of my life. I pursued them without fear and regrets and was rejected a lot but I never changed. I think my eagerness drow them away, and when I started to realize how that worked I used it to my advantage. 

I started to fabricate scenarios where the girl had opportunities to be with me but it was very limited. The reasons I used ranged from being in love with someone already, moving away, wasn't open for a relationship, you name it. And I had tremendous success with it, but after 4 years of doing that and more than 15 girls I decided that I was fooling myself since I knew that deep down inside I wanted a relationship and not this. So I changed back, I joined online dating sites and I tried to find a girlfriend again but with no success. I think that is because I have an inflated sense of ego, thinking things like I should only settle for the best. Since this girlfriend thing has been the main goal of my existence I have hyped it up to be something that reality can never satisfy. 

Now I've stopped looking. I removed myself from all dating sites, I don't look around in the gym for somebody to say Hi to, I don't go to clubs and bars, and if I do in the weeks to come I will not go in there with the ambition of finding some girl to talk to. Because it is just so mentally draining to be focusing on that all the time. I've started to focus on my other intrest way more, I exercise longer, I read more, I write more, I play computer games with friends, I'm more devoted at my job. But the fact remains that I want to find somebody, I want it to happen naturally and without me having it as a main objective.

It's just so hard for me because that is not how I see anything else. I know that the guy that works out the best is getting the best physique, the guy that reads the most knows more, the one that works harder is richer. But this mindset doesn't really seem to apply to girlfriends, the more you try the less you get. 

Can you help me find a way to wrap my head around this? How can I let to of my goal to find a girlfriend, but still be able to get one? 

**TL,DR** I've always focus on getting girlfriends, and it has become a problem and I want to stop and relax. But I don't know how I can find somebody if I don't actively pursue girls.

I'm now regretting my word choices because I have no idea if this is just a friendly meet-up or a date. I don't think the typical advice of, ""If he pays, it's a date"" applies here since I did the asking. Any way to suss out what this is? 

Wow, this makes me sound like a teenager. 
Please understand that while I could simply ask him, 1) I've done my bold deed for the week and don't know if I have the nerves to do another quite yet, and 2) I don't want to scare him off as he, too, seems quite shy. 

**TL;DR** I asked a guy out for drinks, not sure if it's friendly or otherwise. Any advice on figuring it out?

When we're in the car, in the middle of a conversation, he'll turn up the radio and sing along. At his place, he'll pull out a guitar and serenade me. I get that many girls would love this, but the truth is I find it awkward, embarrassing, and totally cringe inducing. I cannot *stand* when people sing unless I'm at a concert. It's just a pet peeve of mine. That, and he's not all that good at it. He, of course, thinks he's the next Jim Morrison. The ego and the bad music together is just a colossal turn off.

It's not like I'm contemplating getting rid of a perfect match over nothing but some bad singing. He seems a bit conceited and he craves attention, singing is just one of the ways it manifests itself. However, if it weren't for the bad singing, I'd enjoy spending more time with him and seeing where it goes. It's still very early on. He has a lot of good qualities and I think he deserves more time for me to get to know him. Everyone has flaws. Maybe I'm expecting too much. Or maybe I feel guilty for having standards?

We hung out off and on for a few weeks and the last week we spent nearly every day together. He eventually told me that he wanted to be more than friends, so I told him that I was interested in him too, but that there was something we needed to talk about. The following night I told him I was transgendered. This is where my confusion starts.  
  
Normally when I tell guys about my past they are either fine with it or they're immediately put off by it. However, when I told this guy there was no reaction whatsoever. He remained completely expressionless and just said he had to think it over. After that he hardly said a word to me for almost a week and when I finally asked him if he's thought it through yet, he just said he'd been too distracted or busy to put any serious thought into it. To be fair he had been gone at some festival most of the week, so I understand him not talking to me, but it just makes no sense to me that he'd be uncertain about something that's normally so black and white with other guys. My suspicion is that he just didn't know how to tell me that my trans status was a deal breaker and is just trying to delay things in order to save face.  
  
I kind of feel like I should simply tell him that if he needs to think about whether or not he wants to date me then he's probably not the guy for me. But since I don't really know how most men think I figured I should probably get an unbiased opinion before throwing away a potentially good thing.  
  
So, to any straight guys out there who think they have a fairly average male perspective; think of a girl you have really been into and wanted to date... if she suddenly told you she was a transsexual, how would you react and why? Would any of you seriously need to think it through before knowing how you feel about it, or does that just seem like a way to avoid the issue?

EDIT: So I just decided I'm going to leave him be and wait for him to tell me either way. I'll post an update when  I know more.

I'm usually quite calm about stuff but this has got my mind racked a little.


Main Jist:

I went to a Meetup Group night out. Met a French woman who was part of the group and spoke to her for a while. We got on quite well, and there was obvious attraction, but just shyness on both sides to attempt anything at first.

As the night went on, the group moved to a small club where we had more of an opportunity to get closer. After a while of flirting, I straight up asked her if I'd be able to get a kiss...she gave me a kiss on the cheek and a hug, making the comment that she's probably a little older than me. I stated my age (25) and carefully asked hers (37). She looked very good for her age, so I complimented that. After a little more talking, and of course a little more drinking, she just went for it and started kissing me. She did stop me at one moment and say something along the lines of ""I don't ever do this sort of thing in public...it's not really me"" I told her she could stop if she wants, and she did. For about 2 mins. Then we were all over each other again.

Here's where it gets a little sticky: I walked her to a bus stop, and due to a bus strike, the buses took a long while to arrive, leaving us to talk (and kiss) more. I'll spare you the details, since she'd talked about her past, and got a little upset. Then she turned to the conversation of men who have messed about with her. She looked me in the eye and said, ""Look, If you want to be with me, just be honest, ok?...I like you and I'm just tired of most men being fake"". I replied that I liked her too, and that I'm looking for a relationship on the long-term agenda, and I'm not someone who goes behind a woman's back with someone else. There was more comment about the age difference but I said I was fine with it.......Now after the night has passed, and the haze of alcohol has subsided, I've been thinking about her all day. In particular, the age gap that I'd stated I was fine with. I'm just not sure about it. Completely split on whether I should pursue her or not. Not because she's older, but because I feel I won't meet what she wants in a partner and being significantly younger will be a big factor in that.

Should I go for it, throwing my fears out of window and pursue her to see what may come of us? Or should I tell her what I feel and stop her from a future disappointment.

I am curious as to what the general population thinks about this subject.  Personally, I believe it's a somewhat accurate portrayal of common psychology, although I don't really agree in the ideas these links express.  While of course I think some of it is acceptable, like maintaining a level of confidence.  I think that if everyone was similar to the kind of ""men"" these articles portray, we would live in a world of ignorance with a population unable to think critically.

Am I wrong?  Are these archetypes healthy, expected, and encouraged?  I do admit that I have experienced nothing but failure with women in my life, and although I am confident in most areas of my life, the one thing I lack confidence in is women mostly because while I have done nothing but fail, I see women date the biggest losers.  This lack of a win just perpetuates the lack of confidence with each loss and rejection.  I try to feel like each rejection brings me one step closer to meeting a female who accepts me for who I am, and where I am going in my life, but it's hard to act confident and ""NEVER"" feel insecure or nervous around women who treat me like I don't exist but date felons, gang members, wife beaters, drunks.  I understand that women like confidence.  I understand that I am letting what other people think effect me, but when it comes to confidence with women there is only one place that confidence can come from if you are a male...from women.  You can be as confident as you want with women, but what happens when you hold it up against reality and see yourself fail time and time again?  Should one still be confident?  Act like he can get any female he wants EVERY waking moment?  That's really hard to do.  I go back and forth between thinking I am better than these people, then thinking I must be less desirable, then rationally concluding that there is no right or wrong, good or bad, that I am doing the best I can, that I like who I am, and I wouldn't change for anyone.

**TL;DR**  Check above links, what do you think?  How do you think a society would function if every male was a ""man"" like these articles describe.  I think it's detrimental to our species on a macro scale.  Maybe this is why I'm single :P",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_rebzn,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rebzn/nice_guys/,

Sometimes when I meet women, we hit it off and they make it clear that they are interested with their body language and mannerisms and whatnot.

However, MOST of the women that I know have been attracted to me...made no indication of such at the time. I've had so many girls confess to me via facebook that they used to have crushes on me, but not until after the ""dating window"" closed.

Am I missing something here? Are us men expected to simply hit on women without any indication of interest? I always expect the woman to give a sign and then I make the move or approach, but it seems like this rarely happens and I feel I am missing alot of opportunities.

We met on JDate. We messaged back and forth a couple times, and then he asked for my number.  We talked on the phone for an hour and then made plans to meet.

It was the best date I've ever been on, and I go on a lot of dates.  I've been in three serious relationships since high school, and none of the first dates of those relationships were anywhere near as good as this one.  Seriously, so many things went wrong, it could have been terrible because of that.  But it was like... as soon as we saw each other, everything felt so natural and normal. There was no awkward window like there usually is in a first date.. We had this amazing rapport (physical and verbal) right away.  It felt more like a third or fourth date than a first date... I should add that we were both sober this entire time, so no social lubrication was needed.

I ended up spending the night at his apartment, which is really unusual for me (and apparently for him).  We didn't have sex, though, although we did get almost completely naked at various points.  Every time it seemed like it was building to that, he'd just stop, and roll away.  We spent most of the night talking, even talking about what we liked about the other person.  In the morning, he pulled me close to him, and was just rubbing my back and running his fingers up and down my arms, but again, we didn't have sex.  I even asked him if that's what he wanted to do, and he said no, he thought we should wait.

It was an amazing night.

The catch?  On Sunday, he leaves for California for a month.  And he'll be job hunting.  He's also applying for jobs in New York, so there's a chance he'll stay here.... Still, I don't know what to do.  We have so much in common, and I feel like we've already been intimate on a level that goes beyond sex (personally, I don't think sex necessarily is intimate)... i just feel like we really connected.  

I don't know what he's thinking about us.  I asked if he wanted to see me again, and he said yeah, but when I asked when he said probably not until he got back.  I'd like to keep in touch with him, because I keep thinking about things I want to talk to him about, but I haven't heard from him since our date (Saturday).  I know he's really busy, and he's got a lot on his mind, so I don't want to come off as clingy.  

My rational side says to wait it out, and at the earliest call him on Wednesday and wish him a safe flight/offer some recommendations (the city he's traveling to happens to be one I'm incredibly familiar with). Then, get his email, and proceed to keep in touch til he comes home.

The emotional side of me wants to call him right now and talk about this super nerdy science article I read that's relevant to something we talked about the other night.

1329850919.0,15,self.dating_advice,pznuj,"Are there any women left out there that actually want a relationship, a family, etc.?",20,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pznuj/are_there_any_women_left_out_there_that_actually/,"Hello, 31M here. 

I don't even know where to begin. Basically, I was in a relationship for almost 10 years in my 20's and we broke up right before I turned 30. That's a good thing, because I didn't realize until later that she was dragging me down. My life has improved in every way since then: doing good with money now, live in a great place, have some great friends, and I've gone back to school to finally finish my education. 

However, one area has been shitty as fuck: relationships. I've dated 4 women since my ex, and it just seems to be getting worse and worse. I fucking hate it and the further along I go I seem to be getting crappier at dating. I just want someone to share my life with, someone to go out to dinner with, someone to stay up late with, someone to talk to, and (obviously) someone to have sex with. 

The first woman I dated I really liked (and still do in a lot of ways). However, she claimed that she would never love anyone again and she never wanted kids and so we split. She's become a good friend since then and we have a FWB setup, but I notice that it's only when *she* wants it, never when I ask for it. Anyways, she's definitely not the right person if she says that she's never going to love again. 

I dated another girl for only one date then. She was an ex of one of my best friends. I actually really liked her, but I think she still has feelings for my friend and I felt ""dirty"" about the whole thing anyways, so we called it off. Plus, she wasn't interested in a relationship and I am. Just too many problems and differences there. 

The third woman I dated... well I don't think she ever really liked me at all, she just kept dragging me along. No person has ever made me feel worse about myself. I was dating her when I first decided to go back to school and money was tight since I had to pay tuition. She basically begged and begged me to go on a trip with her. I figured that I would probably finally get laid by her so I caved and agreed. She made out with some other guy right in front of me and then she made up some bullshit excuse as to why we couldn't share a room. Then, because I have low self esteem and I'm desperate, I continued to date her for another month before she breaks it off. I am very mad at myself for this one. 

Then there was the girl that I really liked. Really attractive (best looking girl I've ever had a date with by far), 5 years younger than me (all of the other women were my age), had similar tastes in music, we both loved hiking, we're both atheists, we had almost identical senses of humor, and we even had the same birthday. I met her in one of my classes. I was really good in the class, she was not. She just happened to sit by me one day and I helped her out a little and we were pretty close from that point on. Towards the end of the semester, we started going out for drinks after our Thursday class. We started hiking on the weekends and then *she* finally broke down one day and asked me out on a date (I didn't ask because I figured she was out of my league). However, two days later before our date, she told me that she made plans with some other friends later in the night. What? Then, on the date she basically had a drink and left. I'm guessing she met someone else. All I know is that I helped her a lot in that class and then she just dicked me over or something. She never attempted to call me once after the final. I believe she was just using my desperation to help her grade in that class. I don't know. 

The one common thing among all of these women is that all of them told me that they didn't want to have a relationship with me. I feel like women look at me and think ""He's not bad, but I could probably do better."" I don't know what it is. I know that I probably don't appear that stable to women because I'm back in school, but I'm more stable than I ever was before, and I can't get anywhere. 

The problem is that the older I get the less and less people I meet. In addition, pretty much every woman I meet now says that they aren't interested in a relationship, family, or kids (I should say that I'm not looking for some old-fashioned 1950's wife here, I'm just looking for a partner).  

I don't want to do the online thing because every friend I has that does the online thing ends up with more problems and more crazy people than I can shake a stick at. I don't want that so I don't do it. 

I guess my question is where do I meet new women that actually want a relationship? I'm so sick of getting dicked over and being used by women. My self esteem is just shot from the last few women I've dated. I just want to meet a girl who does want a relationship and is open to a family (eventually). Are there any of you left out there? If so, where the fuck do I find you? Any nice women left in the world?

TL;DR Are there any women left in the world that are nice and want families, or am I out of luck since I didn't find ""the one"" in my 20's?",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_pznuj,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pznuj/are_there_any_women_left_out_there_that_actually/,

She just invaded my dreams again. A stealthy assault on the mindfucking part of my brain. I haven’t thought about her in weeks. How does she keep slipping into my mind and doing this to me? She has to be the one that got away.

It’s almost been 10 years since we first met, back in the spring of 02 at a birthday party, both of us 15. She was beautiful.  Long, red hair, bright blue eyes and a giant smile with the most perfect teeth.  Girls like this never talk to me.  They don’t even give me the time of day, but not this one.  Hours of conversation ensued on our mutual friends’ picnic table on the porch.  Her and I couldn’t stop talking to each other as if that awkward silence that always happens, even between friends, was forever banished from our young minds.  Everything just flowed and our minds perfectly aligned.  I knew that I had to keep this girl in my life.

That summer, we kept running into each other through mutual friends and the conversations continued as if they never ended.  Eventually though, school would start up again in the fall and we would lose touch since we went to different schools.  We still had the same friends but it was hard to keep seeing each other throughout that year.  

Summer of 03. Eventually, I decided to switch to her school, not because of her though, even at that age I knew that making life altering decisions based on a woman wasn’t a great idea. But I can’t say that she wasn’t part of the decision.  That summer we rekindled our friendship and it grew even tighter.  Our mutual friend base had been shrank to only a few of us.  This is when the night that I let it all slip through my hands.  We hung out a lot, but never just the two of us.  One night there was a friend of ours, her and I sitting on the back of my car, talking.  My feelings for her had grown quite strong over the summer and I really wanted to make her mine.  My neighbor, who was the same age, was having a party.  I didn’t associate with him and his friends, they all were into drugs and neither her nor I wanted to do that shit.  Our other friend was very open to getting her hands on anything and was easily enticed over to my neighbor’s party.  We were finally alone, just the two of us, sitting on the back of my car.  My stomach was flipping and turning from nervousness. My brain knew what I wanted but my body couldn’t get the words out.  That awkward silence finally came.  I couldn’t muster up the strength to ask her out.  I have regretted this to this day.  A couple days later she was asked out by a friend of mine.  I was angry that he had the balls to do what I couldn’t, but we all stayed friends.  I suddenly was put in the friend zone.

The next couple of years her and I stayed very close but on a strictly friends level.  We told each other everything.  I respected her boyfriend, my friend, too much to try to steal her away and I figured at least she is still a big part in my life, even if were just friends.  

Months would come and go and eventually we would graduate, all the while keeping a very close relationship even though it was just as friends.  She applied to college 6 hours away from town with her same boyfriend and I signed up for the military.  She was leaving in August for school and I was leaving in January 06 for boot camp.  This was going to be our last summer and after this, everything would change.
  
About 4 weeks before she left for college, her and her boyfriend were having problems.  She would confide in me and tell me everything.  I could feel her coming closer to me and feeling more comfortable with me than with him.  The problem was that she was leaving and there was no way we could start a relationship long distance.  The next couple of weeks our feelings grew stronger for each other, almost like the forbidden fruit.  I had the most intense feelings my life had ever felt, even to this day, for her.  These next couple of weeks, it was as if she didn’t even have a boyfriend.  I could feel her feelings for me and she could feel mine for her. She started ignoring her boyfriend and just being with me. We would hold hands and these intense feelings would grow but never crossing the physical line.  One night, while bringing her home, she finally broke the ice, turned off my radio and asked “what is going on with us?”

I replied “I don’t know but I like it”

She said “do you know what it’s like to want to jump your best friend’s bones?”

I just laughed that nervous laugh because I had been feeling that way for years.  We got her driveway and both sat there in my car talking for hours.  The sun eventually would start to rise as the conversation got deeper.  I finally shared with her how I had felt for the past couple of years and she was telling me the same.  I asked her if she remembered the night two summers ago when we both sat on the trunk of my car. I told her that I wanted to ask her out so badly but never did.  Her response still makes me regret not having the balls to do it. She asked “Why didn’t you ask me out?” I was destroyed.  If only I had taken that chance and gotten the strength to do it, who knows how things could have been?  We kept talking and finally coming to the decision that timing was on our side, she was leaving shortly for college. We decided that maybe someday we would be together.  

She left for college, I left for boot camp a few months after.  Over the years I still would call and we’d talk for hours but eventually more and more time would pass between each phone call. We might talk once every 6 weeks but it isn’t like it used to be. Not even close. 

I wrote this because I just woke up from dreaming about her.  In the dream, those feeling came back and I was on cloud 9. I was awoken though to my reality, a meaningless relationship with a girl that I can’t say that I really have that strong of feeling for. There isn’t anything I can do now though about the girl of my past, we live ½ way across the US from each other. I do hope though that someday we will be brought back together.
I guess that I finally decided to write this hopefully as a lesson for the younger readers that might be in the same situation.  You might be a nervous, shy person but that girl that you’ve been close too and have feelings for wont ever know how you feel if you never tell her. Don’t have regrets like I do.

(I have no idea what the prognosis is for this? Does anybody here know?) Also, she has been very successful at things (such as singing and dance), but has had those endeavors cut short because of conditions and sicknesses (laryngitis and a blown ACL).

Now, I am not a forever aloner so don't get me wrong or anything, I've been in a couple solid relationships and I've been around, but I'm still very insecure on the inside. I can easily talk to girls and stuff, no problem. But that is when I actually know them or something. It is hard as shit to go up to a complete stranger and start talking to them. What the hell do I say? I don't even know what she likes or wants to talk about.

The problem is mainly those fucking girls that go out to clubs, dance alone wearing VERY slutty ""welcoming"" clothes and refuse to dance with any guy and turn everybody down. I get it if you want to go out and have fun with your friends, but don't dress so ho and be a tease to everyone. Seriously, who does that? It's hard enough for a guy to have confidence 'cause WE are the ones expected to approach the girl, not the other way around. So if you're fucking wearing something uber slutty, of course you're going to be approached by a guy because THAT'S HOW YOU ASK FOR IT.

But, back to my question. How do we approach a girl? And I'm not asking for an answer like ""Just spark up a convo, be natural"" because I know that. Obviously, I should talk to the girl. Obviously, I shouldn't be a dick to her. But what, SPECIFICALLY can I do. Give some examples or something. Maybe give some real life situations that you had that worked.

See, THIS is why I like dubstep. It is perfectly explained as ""music for the rest of us."" When I go to a dubstep concert or rave or something, it is SO much easier to get with a girl.

I'm also her ex's best friend, it's a bit sit-com-y, but all parties were totally cool with the situation.

Basically, in dating casually, there have been two issues that I've encountered. The first, and generally foremost, is that I live with an attractive woman, and she'll generally even share something of a resemblance with the woman I'm trying to date (I have a type, and my roommate happens to fall into that). The second issue is that my ex, who I lived with for the better part of two years, and who dumped me, is here pretty frequently.

I am so overwhelmingly confident that I don't feel any romantic sentiment for either of them, and there isn't even the most remote chance that I ever will. I'm also confident that the feeling is mutual. As far as I'm concerned, they're basically... dudes, I guess. I get along with them both great, and there just isn't any sexual or romantic tension involved.

When bringing a girl back to my place, or even just discussing my situation, explaining that seems to be totally futile. I've started to refrain from mentioning my ex's involvement, but I dunno, the idea of two reasonably attractive adults living together completely platonically seems to be a tough pill for people (other than our circle of friends) to swallow.

At first I thought it'd be a decent way of vetting someone who would be cool to date casually (I'm not looking for something super serious right now), but it's turned into basically a brick wall with every woman I might have otherwise had a chance with. What can I do about this?

This feeling didn't hit until very recently. I am a 19 year old straight female. I haven't had a serious relationship yet, which is already weird and makes me embarrassed. It's not that I haven't had the chance to be in a long time relationship. In high school, I wasted a lot of time on guys who were just looking to hook up but made it seem like they wanted a relationship (which bothers me... I would have been down to just hook up but they fucked it up by making it seem like they really liked me). I also dealt with a guy for about a year and a half/ 2 years who was my best, best friend and ended up liking me, but when I liked him back he decided to cut off our friendship (long story.. he likely has intimacy issues).

In my first year of college, I had some hook ups when I wanted to but I didn't concentrate on creating a relationship. I just didn't find any guys that I wanted to be in one with. But now after a summer of waiting around for a guy who ended up being too shy to contact me, it finally has hit me that I'm fucking up the possibilities of being in a fun relationship. I keep waiting around for these guys who either just wanted to hook up or who are too shy to contact me. The guy I have been waiting around for all summer apparently is too nervous to ask me to hang out because he thinks I'm too hot for him EVEN THOUGH he knows that I want him equally. 

To sum it up, I'm just sad that I have wasted so much time and want to learn how to grab life by the horns and make shit happen for myself. No more waiting around.

I texted her after lunch, and asked if she was still down for dinner that night. She said yes.

15 mins later, she texted me again, and told me she needs to stay at work late.

Instantly my attraction level with her just went down the drain.

But she said she can reschedule for Friday. I said I can't, because I have a meeting with my bosses, but will check with them tomorrow, and tell her my plans.

Skip to this afternoon, I told her that I can still make Friday, but just a bit later. She was thrilled, and asked what we're going to do. The following is the text log:

&gt;Her: So you got any idea what to do Friday?

&gt;Me: Well, it's Friday...I know a restaurant at X has a live band. They mostly play oldies songs.

&gt;H: Great! Are we going to meet with Y friends of yours or Z friends of yours?

&gt;M: ...neither. I only asked you out.

&gt;H: Oh.

At this point, I know it's a gigantic red flag, so I don't even bother anymore. I was being friendzoned. So I friendzone her back.

The texting still continued after that about me stating that I was being literal on messaging ""it's a date"" though, but I don't bother thinking about asking her out anymore. That's it.

I haven't been in a relationship since high school. Not that I haven't tried, but I think I was raised as the nice guy... and as we've all heard, we're not supposed to come out on top. I think I'm decent looking with a subtle boost in confidence since losing 40 lbs since this time last year, still its pretty damn low.


**About how I met her (Jane) [22F]:**
I met her a few months ago at an outing for her brother's 21st, I was invited by her cousin (John), so I automatically assumed off limits. Didn't put much thought into it at that point.

About 2 months ago I was at John's brother's house (after a banquet where John, myself and a few other attendants got well intoxicated) for a house party. I talked a little bit with her, but she ended up running off to drop off some friends. That was it, still figured off limits, so I didn't say or do anything about it.

**So here goes Saturday night:**
I was invited to attend a party on short notice by John. It was a going away party for Jane before she moves off next weekend for the summer (or more) to a city  about 2 hours away. I showed up with my own booze, and the full intention of sleeping on the couch. 

I wasn't thrilled that Jane was leaving for the summer, but again, I figured she was off limits anyway. Also I would have considered asking John if he would mind, but knowing my success in picking up girls from the past 7 years I figured it would probably be a waste. (hooray confidence)

So everyone starts drinking, judging by the guests this wasn't a 2-beers-and-we're-leaving sort of evening. Joining in I start working a bottle (read 5th) of rum mixed with coke and red bull throwing three sheets to the wind. A few cups in, and Jane comes over playing bartender, runs inside and whips up some more concoction. We start talking a bit in a group setting, I eventually finish my cup, and follow her to the kitchen to help restock my cup. This cup happened to be both the start to my evening, and gateway to my recollection of events. 

Not much after my cup is mixed, I find myself and Jane kissing ( how long, I don't know, the alcohol was starting to hit). We talk a little bit, I find out it was John himself that put in the good word. We go wandering around, talking to everyone, attached at the hip it would seem, stopping occasionally to go make out somewhere else in the house. Like an idiot, I continue to drink the drinks she keeps making. And this is where memory stops (for a while).

Memory fades back in when she has to leave to take her friend home (who was left at the party, and Jane hadn't been drinking). We text back and forth a bit at 3am and I'm left with ""text me in the morning if you're still interested"". (not bad for being pretty rusty and recently black-in drunk.)

**Sunday:** 
Texted her back and forth lightly throughout the day. Made some simple plans for recovery coffee , but they fell through.

**Monday:**
We may have wasted both our work days judging by my text message history. I think we both had slow days at work anyway. The conversations were kept to a funny (70%)/flirty(25%)/trying to piece together Saturday night (5%) mood. I get some good indicators ""...Glad we started talking :)"" and some bad news ""packing all week... leaving town saturday after work"" 

**Tuesday:**
Kept it to a minimum to see if Jane would initiate conversation, no contact (let me know if this is a fucked up thing to do, its obviously insecure)

**Where it stands:**
I would like to see the girl before she leaves, but she's not giving up much time. I'd rather do this than finding an excuse to make a conspicuous trip to her new home a few weeks from now. 

I'm not sure how to be push for further contact before she leaves without being obnoxious about it. She off-handedly mentioned a final going away party she will be having on Thursday, but I was not directly invited. Nor is it really the setting I was hoping for.

What can I possibly accomplish between now and Saturday, or am I better off just continuing to text and hope I don't fuck it up too bad?

I'm quite pathetic when it comes to dating and was wondering if you nice people (I've been lurking a bit) can help me.

A bit about myself: In my teen years, was painfully shy, socially awkward, and the school nerd so I didn't date. I had one boyfriend for a couple months when I was 17, kissed but nothing more than that, then he left for college and that was that.

I haven't dated since then, have not made my ""sexual debut,"" and am ashamed to admit that at this age I am both a) single for going on 6 years and b) still a virgin, which seems hugely uncommon at this age.

My looks aren't the problem anymore. I was quite unattractive in high school but grew into my looks, and though I often lack self-confidence (big nose and forehead, lingering acne) most guys objectively agree that I'm attractive - though I try not to bring it up and shy away from drawing too much attention to myself.

My real problem is my lack of any game whatsoever. Nowadays I'm friendly, social (though still a bit shy/reserve), and get along great with just about anybody. I just have serious issues approaching a guy I'm interested in (last time I did it a couple years ago the guy was shyer than me, ignored me, and I nearly lost the friendship). Also, being approached by a guy, flirted with, or hit on makes me uncomfortable and I tend to have an instinctive knee-jerk reaction to fend off romantic advances by men if and when they do come. Even guys I find attractive I tend to distance myself from if they start paying attention to me.

I think in large part, this due to my own insecurities. I think, deep down, I feel inadequate due to my complete lack of dating and sexual experience, and ashamed/afraid of what to do in an romantic setting with a guy. So, fear/awkwardness combined with an aversion to intimacy, or something like that...I'm an independent person (after 6 years being single, who wouldn't be, right) and am accustomed and comfortable flying solo by now, and while I can live with the way I am, I feel every so often like I'm missing out or that there's something wrong with me.

So, in conclusion, has anyone here been there before and been able to break out of it? Any tips on how to overcome this before I end up 50 and alone?

I'd point-blank ask them out, they'd say a tentative yes, and then I'd call them and bug them until I got the hint that they only said yes because they were too polite to say no. Now I'm the opposite; too aloof. I know I'm good-looking, funny, great to be around. But I'm just scared of being another guy creeping on women. I've dated a few feminists and have two sisters and several of my friends are women, and I notice just how much women are assaulted from all angles by men trying to get their attention. I know I'm not necessarily like those other guys, but I'm petrified of being that way nonetheless.

The other day we were all out at the bar, and I caught her sneaking glances at me. I went over to talk to her, and she was definitely giving me all her attention, putting her hand on my arm, teasing, etc. But I was all clammed up. I even got her number, but right after that I fled. I excused myself from the bar and went home early, out of fear of messing things up. She even asked if I was going to an event we were all attending, and I said no (I mean, I had intended not to go but in hindsight, I realized if a girl asks you if she'll see you somewhere, you should try to be there.) I do things like that often; there have been situations where girls essentially asked me out and I answered ""no"" before I even realized what was happening.

I do this a lot, shying away from women out of fear of being too eager. I've gone on a few first dates with women, but just didn't push hard enough and things fizzled out. I've dated some, but it's hard for me to land a relationship with a woman I'm very attracted to unless I explicitly know I've got a chance.

Everyone one has been shit and consisted of always being cheated on and left for the ex gf. I gave up, but WHOA. This awesome guy [18 m] hit me like a brick. (I posted a few asking if i might be just looking too much into it, and i was told he was courting me. )

Suddenly, i find myself being asked to do things every night with him. He'd pay for dinner. (if you're wondering, i'd offer to pay, and sometimes i'd make him let me pay) He'd hold every door open, walk me back to my place 30 minutes away. He'd cuddle up to me outside when it was cold, and start whining if i moved too far away. He'd give me hugs and lay his head ontop of mine. He would walk on the right side, because he said it was better that he died first if a car ran off the road. (apparently it's a rule. i dont know.) He'd message me everyday for a few hours. (his phone's broken at the moment.) I was hoping i wasn't looking TOO into this, but it seemed so clear. He's a very social guy. It's not like i was the only person he could hang out with.


Last night we went to dinner, and got dessert. (he payed for dinner, and i forced him to let me pay for dessert.) he asked if we could sit alone and just talk. (meanwhile, inside i'm happy!) and we're just chatting about life. (we're both freshmen so...sharing stories from high school.) And we get to relationships and laugh about how stupid we both were for being upset over getting cheated on. And finally i hear the infamous words...
""I'm burnt out on relationships. Y'know. It's college. Plus i haven't met anyone this semester that's even caught my attention."" I died a little inside.
Afterwards, not even 10 minutes after i'm back in my room. He messages me. OH GOD. I fell asleep shortly after that, and i wake up to, ""Hey! dont watch Donnie Darko yet!"" (He told me to watch it while we were eating) ""We should watch it together. : ) ""


I'm pretty sure I've hit a new level of being friend zoned...though he did mentioned while we were talking that he's never asked a girl out. (meanwhile, every guy i've asked out has rejected me, so i now just stick to being asked out) What do i do now?!

Am I supposed to say my age (24)?

Come Monday, we meet up for a pretty pleasant dinner, followed by a taxi make out and sex. And the sex was HOT if a couple orgasms is any indicator. After a little cuddling/pillow talk we fall asleep. We leave for work together, saying goodbye with a kiss on the cheek. 

To be honest, I feel a little excited thinking about future companionship, and look forward for a text or some type of feedback that day. It comes after I'm about to leave for work:

Molly: ""Yo! So last night was fun. Buuuuuut I don't reckon we're that into each other so let's just hang out as mates. Cya soon x""

Me: ""Cool. Don't be a stranger!""

Probably not the best response, but whatever. My question is: I this her testing if I'm desperate, or is she simply being assertive? Does this allow for a fuck buddy thing? 

It's weird for me because I've never been rejected like this after sex. I've NEVER had a one night stand thing. I've never not had a second date. It's just weird for me.

I'm in grade 11, cripplingly shy, not quite ugly, but... yanno nothing special (don't know if that's of any importance but oh well.) Oh, and I have ZERO EXPERIENCE with ANYTHING to do with dating. Remember when you were in third grade, and had a relationship for like two weeks? I don't. Because it never happened.

There's this guy. Back in, October or so, he told me (in person) about this subreddit. But, he was kind of mumbling, and I think he knew it, because he Facebook messaged me later that day with the link. And then, we messaged back and forth for about two weeks. Then I stopped because there was a lull in conversation (and because I didn't want to get too involved.) But, he picked it back up again. Repeat the following messaging patterns, one more time.

NOW, we've had this little message thing going since probably December. I am now involved, we are friends. We've never flirted. He told me I was ""awesome"" once. And, asked me to smoke a joint with him. I said no, because it's not really my thing, and he seemed fine with that.

Now, there's another one of those lulls. But, it's been going for so long, I don't think I can just *stop* talking to him. I have one class with him, but it's not a really talk-y class. And, I'd ask him to hang out, maybe, but he's also really quiet. And, we live in probably the shittiest town you can think of. There is one thing to do, watch hockey games, and I don't think he's really into that.

I think he might like me. I don't really like him as of right now, but I could eventually. (*HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW, we don't talk in person.*) 

So, what do I do? I know it seems childish, but the concept of ""boys liking me"" is so alien, and unheard of, that I am at a total loss.

She is beautiful and smart and very out going, our personalities seem to match very well, and I just spent 20 hours with her on a date, so I know we are at least somewhat compatible. Physical relationship is fantastic, and we are very clear on the parameters of the relationship(nothing too serious too fast). I do for see a few problems and I have outlined them below, I was very nit picky and not all of those issues are really issues, Just things I wanted to bring up here. I really am just looking for perspective and experience from anyone who has tried to transcend the cultural gap.

*****TL;DR Cultural and english barrier may prevent fully appreciating a relationship in ways that I am used too. Has anyone had experience with foreign partners from a culture more ""old fashioned"" than ours?*****

My concern is the fact that her culture is considerably different. She came from a war, and has even been married and divorced already(I am the first guy she has dated since the divorce 3 years ago). She seems a little more clingy as well,but I cant tell if she is joking or not when she talks about meeting my mom or things of that nature(some of it I think is part of the very traditonal marriagey culutre.) I am just an average suburban kid who likes to play video games and drink with friends in my free time, very opposite of the hard upbringing she had to endure. Some of the quirks in their culture I feel make it harder for her to understand when I am making a joke, so sometimes I think she would get mad at me because she did not understand. My sense of humor is very important to me and while its not the end of the world I feel like I may get somewhat bored with someone who doesn't find the same things funny that I do. Also their is a very slight language barrier, she speaks English very well but occasionally gets stumbled up on a words, or has to ask me to define what a word means when I say it, which I certainly don't mind but I could see this being somewhat irritating in a longer term relationship.

This is a question that not only has to do with a situation I'm currently in but something I've been wondering for quite some time.

So I've been texting with this chick I met a few months back.  Each time we talk, we talk for hours.  It's smart and clever...it's good stuff.  And we both seem to keep the conversation going.  But what I've found is that I'm always the one initiating these conversations.  All except for maybe like one time.

I won't lie, I do try to ""play it cool.""  I've been in situations with girls in the past where we would be texting with eachother all day/everyday, but it never went anywhere (If anything I ended up in the ""friend zone"" cause of it.)  So I like to really leave good amount days in between starting another convo but in between those I'm always hoping she would think to start one.

Now I know a lot of you out there will suggest to ask her to go out and talk in person, which I will totally do, but she's home in another state for a month.  

So basically what I'm wondering is,  how should I read this?  Is it a bad thing to always be the one initiating?  I mean the last thing I want to do is come off desperate or something.  Is her not starting any of these conversations, is that her ""playing cool,""  trying not to come off hooked, or is it that she really isn't interested as I am in keeping this thing going.

Sidenote:  We both kind of established an interest in eachother on New Year's Eve.  Being as we were in two different areas, we talked about how much we wish we coulda been together at midnight, if you catch my drift.  

I just don't know whether to be the one to start another conversation...again, or wait it out.  But then I'm worried waiting it out could kill the whole thing entirely.

Like I said, I hate this texting games thing (giving time to reply/waiting out responses/etc.)  I mean I obviously do it too.  I alot of people do, but I'm wondering what you people think about this situation.  Please help me out

It seems like I get overlooked for reasons beyond looks. What could these be? I a bit shy but I've made massive improvements in just one semester of college.

I was there partially to visit friends and partially to visit grad schools, one which she was going to. We ended up grabbing a few drinks and I spent the night at her place. I knew things were going that way early on when I took note of her bloody fingernails, chewed down from her nerves of meeting up with me, something she revealed later on that night...
We dated in High school for about 6 months and broke up for several reasons, but mostly because we were too headstrong and not ready for a serious relationship. We dated others in college and kept up a friendly relationship when on break. A few times, I got the sneaking suspicion she had a thing for me, but because were were both in relationships and going to school several hundred miles away, no move was ever made.
I've dated a bunch of girls, some who were great, some who weren't, but I cannot believe how well everything worked with her - it just ""flowed"" like I've never experienced before. Her reaction too, was ecstatic - not the kind of reaction you get from a slightly intoxicated hookup - but genuine excitement (maybe a bit too much excitement?) She most have told me a dozen times how happy she was this happened, and how she was a bit upset I didn't make a move sooner. We talked for hours into the wee hours of the morning, fighting off sleep even though we both had work in the morning. I remember her mentioning something about the 'terror' of a broken heart, presumably from fear that the distance and our hectic lives (we both work 60+ hours a week, she is in law school, I am studying for grad school, etc) would prevent us from working - I even told her not to dive headlong into this, and think it over...maybe that was my mistake.
I half expected her to pull back in fear, and thats exactly what she did. A few days over skype, in her traditionally vague ways telling me it wouldn't work (though never directly saying it) Since then, we havent talked much. I gave her a call one week saying I was going to be down in the city for work and if she would like to meet up, only to not respond to my texts when I was down there then finally say at the last minute she didn't want me to think it was a date (which I never did) That was at least three months ago and we haven't talked sense.
I've never felt so attached to a girl before, even ones who I have been excited to get with and date. I cannot believe how well we connected and I truly believe she felt the same way. I feel as if she is scared of the prospect of a heavy relationship (which she admitted to me that night) especially one over long distances. Well, it turns out that I got a job offer in Greenwich, one which I will be taking. Seeing as a good number of friends live in the city (and it's somewhere I have wanted to live for some time) I will be looking to live there. I want to tell her in a way that's both nonchalant yet still hinting at what I do want. The problem is, I don't know how to do so without coming off as being desperate to contact her. I'm not sure if telling her how I feel is a good idea - I don't want to scare her, but I'm not sure if covering it up is a good idea either.

I'm an eighteen-year-old girl, a freshman in college. I think I’m unable to flirt properly. Let me explain.

A lot of the time a guy will obviously be somewhat flirtatious with me (either touching, looking, giving me more attention, etc.) A couple of times this year I have been interested in a guy who seems interested, but it seems like something inside me stops me from reciprocating fully. If I’m interested, I'll playfully tease them back, laugh, smile, crack jokes – basically acting as I usually do but with more cuteness and directing my attention to him. Initially, All is well.
The thing is that they always seem to lose love interest. I always stay friends with them, but it seems like I’m getting friend zoned or something. I’m starting to think that the problem is how I’m acting, because I know that it’s hard to stay interested in somebody when it feels like they’ll never like you. I’m afraid of leading boys on too quickly, so I think I try to buy myself time by not being too flirtatious back, out of fear of rejection, seeming slutty, etc…I don’t really know why.

So how can I flirt like a normal person? How can I slowly reveal that I’m interested without them thinking I’m leading them on maliciously or making them think I’m not interested?

Thank you for any help you can offer. :)

What do I do?",16,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/12eyrb/32m_girl_ive_been_talking_to_is_trying_to_bully/,"A little background. This girl and I have hung out about 3 times, grand total. We had about a 3 month ""break"" after talking for a week or so, after she was trying to hold me to standards as though we were a couple, when no such agreement had even been discussed. Then, it started as playful banter, wanting to change her f---ing Facebook status to say ""in a relationship"" after the first date. I protested, saying I didn't wanna just jump into things, which I told her from the onset. She accused me of ""wanting to hide her from"" my friends. It blew up, and I just let her be for a bit. I started talking to her again a month or so ago, and for a bit, things were good, but we've went right back to the old pattern.

When we are hanging out, for the most part it's good. We laugh, talk constantly, and pretty well just click. But when I'm not there, things get crazy. Our work schedules counteract each other (I'm a 9-5 guy, she works two 24 hour shifts) so she has a lot of time during the day whereas I'm sitting at work trying to do my job. Not to mention, that now, she just had major surgery and is home bound for another few weeks. 

She is STILL trying to beat me into a relationship. Not a day goes by that I have to tell her that I don't wanna be pushed into a relationship, I want it to be something mutually desired. To top it all off, she is CONSTANTLY bugging me to spend time with her, which makes it feel like a chore. I've told her this, and she says she understands, but today alone she's either hinted at, or just flat out stated ""I'd really like you to come over"" at least 50 times. She makes it feel as though I'm obligated somehow, which just turns me off. I can't even really get to know her through all the banter. I'm just sick of the emotional roller coaster. I want to be with her, because I want to be with her, not because she's bullied me into it.

I've tried to talk to her, and things got better for a while, but now they're getting worse than ever. Not sure what to do? I like her, but she's making me crazy with her over the top ""we have to be in a relationship"" crap. Any thoughts?

Well, I took her out and it went great. All kinds of good chemistry, she seemed really into me, and I felt great about it.

Then, the next night I went out to a party and did something extremely out of character for me. I hit on, danced with, and got numbers from every girl I could find. By the end of the night, I had found a girl that I liked, and ended up making out with her on the couch until my friends dragged me home.

I feel like I've seriously screwed up here. I know one date doesn't signal any sort of commitment whatsoever, but I feel like I'm sneaking around behind girl #1's back. I feel dishonest.

Now I'm dealing with all kinds of different emotions here. I would like to see this new girl again, just to see if there is anything there, but I don't want to give up on girl #1. The concept of casually dating two girls at once just doesn't seem right to me. On top of that, I now have the idea planted in my mind that I can actually go out and get dates if I try, which has me second-guessing whether or not I even want to be in any sort of relationship right now until I get through this little phase.

I'm not sure if I went out and did that for the ""thrill of the chase"", or if I'm already going through the process described in my last post.

I guess it should also be noted that I've only been that ""party makeout guy"" 3 or 4 times in my entire life, and two of them were within the past week. So there is also the possibility that I'm just a little caught up in the novelty of that right now.

I'm pretty awkward and inexperienced, some tips would be cool.",16,1,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/11ox84/yaay_going_to_do_dinner_and_movie_at_my_place/,"I've actually been on several dates with this girl, mostly classical concerts, but I'm quite the inexperienced beta-male, so we haven't even held hands yet or kissed. I always tell myself to man up before the dates, but I failed every time. I think she wants more intimacy, we do like to stand and sit with shoulders touching etc. I definitely want more intimacy.

Some information about me; I'm 22M, university student, she's a student too, a bit younger. I've only made out with a girl once when I was 19, I enjoyed it a lot (expect that she was a smoker) but it was a one night-only thing, since then nothing happened. Then I went out with this girl a bunch of times, that is all the romantic experience I have.

So those dates in the past weren't really inherently intimate; I figured it's going to be a lot easier to transition into cuddling and making out when you're sitting next to each other on the couch, so I asked her to come over for dinner and a movie. She happily agreed today (sent her a message on facebook, alpha as fuck).

I live alone, don't have a tv so we'll watch on laptop, but I assume that's not a big deal. I'll clean my place a bit before she comes over, and we're going to cook together. Anything else I need to prepare? I've never done this before, I'll probably be nervous as shit tomorrow. I won't do things like set up candles and play smooth jazz, that is going to make everything super awkward, plus I'll probably burn down my place in the process. I could play some nice music, we have similar tastes.

Anyway, yeah, not a very concise post, but I'd like to get some advice before we meet. Some do's and don'ts maybe? It's crucial that we get intimate this time, we've been on too many dates without kissing already, it's probably some sort of record. So, thanks for reading!

**Update**: Okay, I actually failed :( sorry guys, very disappointed with myself now. Well, we actually had a pretty good time, we cooked together, ate and talked (food was good). Then we watched the movie sitting next to each other on the couch. I sat down really close next to her; hips touching and shoulders touching, she didn't seem to mind. We watched the movie like this, at the end of the movie we were at least as close as we were at the beginning, maybe with some more weight behind it, but it still wasn't like she was leaning into me or something. I guess she might be somewhat shy too, maybe inexperienced, many girls would put their heads on my shoulder at this point (unless she didn't want to). After the movie ended we talked some more, it was nice. Then she left at 11PM (she arrived at 6:45PM), we said goodbye but no hugging and shit because I suck.

Right now I feel pretty numb, not completely depressed. It all seemed so simple in my head, I couldn't imagine not being able to put my arm around her when we're already so close, but when she's actually sitting next to me the mental barrier is just too much. There was no flirty atmosphere.. On a more positive note; it was good practice and it'll be easier next time, we did get closer than we have before. Plus, I think we had a good enough time, I'll probably ask her out on monday.

The only type of relationship I have had these past 4 years was a FWB (37M &amp; extremely casual) that ended a few months ago.

My main problem with my dating history is that every now and then I will meet a man and have a wonderful time with him up until either our first date or I ask them where things are going between us. The worst part is that many of the men I go on dates with tell me I'm beautiful, smart, fun, sexy, and great to be around. However, they don't see the potential for a relationship. No reason is ever given and it drives me crazy. 

I try my best not to be clingy, I give them space, and I'm always excited to talk/be with them. Despite the fact that men are sexually attracted to me and have never denied me sex, I can't help but think there is something wrong with me physically (or sexually). However, when I discuss with my friends they always assure me that I haven't really done anything wrong.

But if that were true... I wouldn't be single and crying myself to sleep every night because I'm destined to be alone.

So Dear Reddit, why would someone describe me as being so great but not be willing to date me? Can you men/women give me some perspectives on why you would deny a relationship with someone you do like? I need some reassurance here before I cause some damage to my well being.

Now I treat reddit like an escape. I don't post much but know I can do so anonymously. I playfully decline to tell him and change subject. He tells me I'm 'becoming hard work'. I apologise. He says that's ok and I fall asleep. 

I wake up to 'did I upset you?'. 

Really busy day at work, unusually he doesn't text then at 5.30 sends 'hi, how's your day?'. I'm caught up in work trying to get things ready for important presentation tomorrow. 5.55 he sends 'sorry. i must have been a fuckwit to you. i get it. sorry. i'll leave you alone now. xx'

(X-post from r/Relationships)",19,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/vqyis/reddit_i_wasnt_thinking_and_i_asked_out_a_college/,"I am a high school student and 16 years old. I have never been on a date and I'm sort of a SAP. My parents also do not want me to date. I am volunteering at a college to get some lab experience. I don't have my license yet, so I take the bus to and from the college.

Today, I was waiting for my bus ride home out in the 90 degree weather. While I was waiting, a cute girl comes into the bus stop and waits for the same bus as me. Eventually the bus came and we boarded it. I sat down first and she sat down across from me. She had not expressed any interest in me. As the hour-long ride continued more people got onto the bus. I was just checking reddit on my phone and occasionally looking up at this girl. She was very pretty. Anyways, I stayed silent throughout the bus ride. She was on her laptop and listening to music through her headphones. I remember that her water bottle had fallen out of her backpack while she was distracted and started rolling towards me. I went to pick it up for her at the same time that she did and we made eye contact and she gave me a friendly smile. I think that it was because she was a little bit embarrassed about letting the bottle fall on the floor.

So shortly after, we went back to our silent and respective habits. Suddenly, I got a bit courageous. I felt like I had nothing to lose if I ask her out. I had NEVER asked a girl out before. I didn't want to make her embarrassed by doing this in front of everyone, so I ripped out a piece of notebook paper and did a quick sketch of her. I also wrote that I thought she was pretty and asked her if she would like to go on a date with me. I folded the paper and passed it to her. She looked confused, but then she opened the paper. She smiled, and looked up. We both smiled but neither of us said anything. She pulled a pen out of her backpack and wrote something on the paper. She passed it back and it said,""thank you for the compliments. haha I have never been on a date before, do you go to [the college]"". I responded by writing,""I am interning here for the summer and that's okay because I've never been on a date either"". She looked at the letter and smiled. She wrote down ""Sure I guess? I can skip a day of work next week...here's my email [email]"". She smiled again.

I was surprised and happy that my letter actually worked. But after I got off the bus, I realized how big of a mistake I had just made. I, a high school student, got a potential date with a college student who has also never been on a date. I don't think that the girl knows that I am in high school and is probably waiting for me to email her. She is also willing to skip a day of work to go on the date, which I don't know how to attend due to the fact that I don't even have a license! I don't want to lie to the girl and I don't want to leave her hanging. It's tough because this might be the first time a guy has ever asked her out, and I don't want to make her feel bad. I feel terrible about myself. I've made a big mistake, and I don't know what to do. Can you please help me?

TL;DR: I am a highschooler without a license who asked out a girl for the first time. The girl was in college and she has never been on a date either. She said yes. I have her email. I don't know what to do. Please help me.

I've really enjoyed our relationship since I met you about a year ago. I really feel like I can identify with you when it seems like there is no one else who does. We've laughed at rage comics and memes together and shared our deepest secrets together. You've helped me kill time through boring classes and 10 hour shifts many a'times. What I'm trying to say is that you are all my bros, much love and respect.

I guess what I am asking isn't typical of what's found in r/dating_advice. However I feel this is the most appropriate subreddit I could think of. Here's the deal: today is the day that i realized what should have been obvious all along. I am socially awkward penguin, I am forever alone, I am the character portrayed in zombieland, I am any character Steve carrell has ever played. 

I have read magic bullets, pua books, watched dating coach YouTube videos and have been picking up anything I can from here to help me find someone special for me. No matter how many hours I log at the gym, and no matter how much money I make nothing will ever change about my personality. I am horribly shy and scared of approaching females. The thought of approaching a girl gives me a feeling similar to looking off of a cliff. However, I understand sometimes I have to fucking man up and go for it, which I have tried, and failed. Every time.

I should be used to rejection by now but this time just hurts. I have tried all the methods of trying to express interest in a girl, ranging from respectful to douchey. It's just that when I finally get that 1on1 time I always ruin it. I have tried being sincere and I have tried ""fake it until I make it"". I've never been in a serious relationship before and I have the feeling it shows. If it wasn't for alcohol id probably be a virgin. 

This time I had met a very nice girl from college and dug deep into my courage reserves to ask for her phone number, which she seemed happy to give me. Next, it was time to plan my method of attack, and genius me decided to make a fake get together for her to come along to, and I would casually mention it and invite her. So I called in favors from all my friends and mentioned that we were going out and that I would love it if she came. Which she said yes, pretty enthusiastically. The event was for my 24th birthday.

Wish me happy birthday guys by the way. As soon as I go to pick her up I am one block away from her house, which is 30 minutes away, but I make sure to tell her its no problem I don't mind picking you up, because I'm a gentleman. Anyhoo, I then get a text saying she can't make it, citing legitimate excuse, she was tired. ""no problem, there's always next time, good night"" I say back. 

And that's that. I drove home frustrated at an average of 80mph, and here I am begging for sympathy. I even picked out a nice matching outfit from the mall earlier today. I called all my friends and said ""fuck it forget it"" and turned off my ringer. I have been laying down in my bed all night, tearing up occasionally. This is also my first thread, I have had no idea how to even make a thread until today. 

I know that I will never give up looking because i want female company, and someday, a loving family. It's just that this time hurts a little more I guess. I probably should have just went out tonight with my friends but I'm very tired of being the 9th wheel. 

So anyway reddit, today I have been single for 24 years and one day. All I'm asking for is a simple e-hug or e-bro hug. Shyness, and social awkwardness can really suck.

I met a new guy at the bar the other night. We instantly hit it off.. it was that kind of encounter you have with someone and you immediately both are attracted to each other and feel comfortable already. We hung out once after that alone. I live in a dorm/apartment building so he just came over and watched a movie. Things were kind of heating up and he seemed a little bit pushy with the whole sex thing (not sex, but me touching him down there). I shrugged it off, i understand it happens.

He talked about how he has a wall up and then later that day told me I broke it. I got a little freaked out because he said this the 2nd time we hung out. He also told me how much he liked me last night (3rd time we hung out) and how he wants to take things slow with me. Later that night he kept telling me ""you're mine"" and would get kind of jealous if he saw me texting someone on my phone. 

We were drinking and we went back to my apartment with my 2 other friends who were hooking up so he kind of was being pushy again with having sex with me (his friend is a huge douchebag, he kind of was saying shit to him all night about how he better get laid etc) I tried telling him that I just met him and I want to take things slow. I told him that I really want him to just respect me and I knew he won't if I put out so easily. 

I don't really know what to think. I have no idea if he actually is interested in me, or is just interested in my vagina. I don't want to get hurt and I hate having sex with guys who mean nothing to me. It sounds cliche, but I don't care; I don't enjoy having sex with guys who are only using me to get laid. 

What should I do? I know that guys won't want to stick around much longer if I don't give in eventually. I do want to have sex with him but I want to be respected and liked for me, and not JUST my vagina.

Help?,17,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sgcs7/so_i_found_out_this_girl_ive_been_seeing_has_a/,"I'm going to try to keep this short and as vague as possible. I'm 99% sure she browses reddit, and I'd like to wait for an opportunity to confront her organically about this, or something, rather than having a bunch of fallout over reddit or something. Here's the story:

I (22m) met this girl (18f) online about 3 weeks ago. Since then, we've been on a few dates, she stayed over, and she spent a weekend out of town with my family and I. We've been getting along really well, and we connect on a lot of things, and I've been looking forward to making this an exclusive, official thing.

She told me she had a blog and tried to send me a link shortly after we met, but I couldn't connect to it, and she's been a little dodgy about it  and very reluctant to share it with me since.

So I did some digging, going off the details I got from her original link, and other readily available information, and I eventually found it last night. Needless to say, it was a bit of a shock. She has some very colorful pictures of herself, along with some pretty flirty/suggestive posts, which has raised some concerns. She's told me that she's looking for something that actually matters, and a post she made a while back seems to confirm this, but there's quite a lot of suggestive material up there. From everything I could tell before, she's really into me and now I can understand why she was so hesitant to share this.

Given what little of her backstory I know, and considering her age and whatnot, it's quite possible she's looking for some sort of validation or self esteem boost. Which is fine, in and of itself, but this is a really unhealthy way to do it. The blog nowhere near anonymous, and it's public. The potential damage this could cause in several areas of her life is very high. 

I'm not judging her, or saying she's a bad person. Lord knows I have some pretty nasty skeletons in my closet too, but I'm concerned about what this entails about her, and about us.

I'm really at a loss. She's a very sweet girl, and I haven't met anyone that I have so much of a connection with. I still want to make something of this, but I know that unless some kind of arrangement was struck about the content of the page, I'd be constantly worried about her fidelity and/or perception of our relationship.

What can/should I do? Like I said, I really want to make something of this, but I'm also not going to put myself out there to be fucked with. It's not like I did anything wrong; All the information i needed to find this stuff was freely given to me. I just put the puzzle pieces together.
Is there any way to confront her about this? Should I bring out some of my skeletons to put us on equal ground? I know everyone hates the forced ""Where do we stand"" conversation, but should I go there? WTF do I do? =(

EDIT: We're seeing each other again on Friday. 


TL;DR
Met a girl who's very sweet and caring, but has a very colorful, exhibitionist side that she keeps up on her blog. Worried about what this could mean for us and where this is going.

Some of my friends have (jokingly or not, I'm not sure every time) told me that because of me being Asian, I should probably just stick to finding an Asian girlfriend because no white girls are going to bother with me.

I contacted him a few months ago, saying we should get drinks because I was around again. He had had a girlfriend for a bit so I didn't even know what his deal was because he's close-lipped about these things in general (could be seen as a bad sign but he's generally a really quiet person, so I didn't want to think too much of it). 

The second time we met up, he came back to my apartment and we had sex (after I made sure he had broken up with his girlfriend). He acted a little strange the next day, and when I saw him later that week he was acting pretty normal except not at all acknowledging the fact that we slept together. Since then, getting him to do shit with me has been unnecessarily difficult, and I'm pretty sick of trying (and I know Cosmo would shun me forever for initiating the whole thing to begin with... but fuck it, some guys are just shy).

I'm wondering if you have any strategies for this. This is not a new thing for me, i'm 25 and have been dating from a young age so I have plenty of experience. I've been single for a few months and feel ready to talk to women again. However after being in a 3 year LTR I have just lost the ability to do it.

I use to be smooth, joke with them, pick on them and girls loved it. I didn't even know I was doing the right thing when I was younger it was just my personality. Now i've grown up and became a 'professional' I find the entire process nerve racking. 

Girls like me and want me to approach them, thats not the problem, I am just so nervous that nothing but verbal diarrhoea comes from my mouth and i'm often visibly shakey! 

Did any of you experience this when getting back into the game? Theres one girl i've tried to approach about 3 times, shes very open to it but I just can't seem to get it right when I do it.

I've talked with her a few times, and we definitely we hit it off pretty well. I tried (tactfully) to make a move into starting a relationship beyond friends, and she (tactfully) shut me down, basically saying ""I'm just not ready for another relationship yet, and I'm not sure if I ever will be."" So friend-zoned it is; we're still in contact, although not often.

Details, FWIW:

Me: M, 24 
Her: F, 28

From what I can tell (I avoided prying too much), she had been involved with a guy for a few years. They were talking about getting married; he started becoming a controlling, manipulative asshole, and she made the tough decision to break it off. It sounds like the whole thing was very emotionally difficult for her, and she often says things like ""I'm happier now than I've been in a long time."" The whole thing went down something like 3-6 months ago, before we had met.

My questions is this: for those of you women who have been in a very serious (i.e. close to marriage) relationship and had it go bad for some reason, how long did it take you to be ready to start another relationship? How long did it take for another man's advances to be welcome? I think we have great potential but I definitely do not want to make her uncomfortable... any advice/experience is welcome!

**The Dating Machine**  
The dating machine is where you ask a gal for coffee or lunch and she accepts. The two of you then research each other online and prepare questions for the date. You pace uncontrollably for hours or even days before-hand worried how you will act or what she will think/is thinking ect ect until your nerves are shot and you've likely performed poorly at school/work durring this 'waiting period.' Then you get to the day of the date. You meet or take her to the predetermined location and fire 20 questions at each other for 30~40 minutes. Eventually, you run out of things to ask her. So, if you are lucky, a genuine conversation will start and there is a 70% chance that you will get to that second date.  
**Whats wrong here?**  
Well, girls judge quicker than men because they have far better insight and are taught by their mothers to rely on that insight (mother's intuition). A woman values her intuition and will judge you in the first five minutes of a date based on it. Now, there is nothing wrong with this and often gets a gal out of many bad relationships before they start. However, if you are wracked with nerves then she will likely see you as spineless. Or if you just ask her questions about her facebook she will see you as a stalker, creepy, or socially inept.  
Later, the date will be read into and combed through with a fine toothed comb. Women are sticklers for details and if every details of this first date isn't perfect then neither are you!  
**Break Things guide to a flawless first date**  
It, actually, is quite simple. I take the label of 'date' out of the equation. I add mystery to the situation by often asking the girl out to the grocery store. Now, you may be thinking 'this is corny' but it works! EVERYONE goes to the grocery. People are comfortable there and if the 'date' goes south then at least you have knocked out the chore of going to the grocer for that week.  
So, I ask a girl to the grocer and she often accepts thinking I'm a bit odd but harmless bc its a fucking grocery store. We shop together (something I have never had go bad) and typically talk about our favorite foods and memories associated with them.  
**CRITICAL**: The date can end here but you must seal up a second date before she leaves ""I like spending time with you, want to get dinner sometime"" or you will be friend-zoned as 'the shopping buddy'. If I am REALLY liking the girl and my roommate isn't home I will ask her to my place for dinner.  
""We have all this food, why not cook dinner together. No one likes to eat alone.""  
If she turns you down then don't take it personal, this whole process depends on the girl having a free dance card for the afternoon. Everything should be improvised and that makes you genuine. Being genuine is the basis for any good date.  
If you are lucky, you have flown in WAY under her radar and she is back at your place having a romantic dinner before she even realizes she didn't put makeup on or do her hair! I've never had this go bad.  
Disclamer:  
This can sometimes lead to sex (esp if wine is involved) so if you are not looking for that then you need to keep an eye out. It's easy to get swept up in the moment and make a decision you may later regret.

He has self confidence issues which have led to him not getting laid in over 3 years. I've only been with one guy since I left my ex-husband.

She's a white gal, about 45, divorced 7 years, has 2 children (about 11 and 17 years) who live with her.

I've been working at this job about 90 days.

She originally interviewed me and I was instantly attracted to her.

I only see her once a week or so at work (we work different shifts). When I speak with her, I get mixed signals. She laughs, has told me some of her personal life (troubles with her kids, her thoughts about her future, etc.)

I find that I'm spending time thinking about her. I like her smile, her laughter, pretty much the entire package.

She has taken extra time to 'chat' with me after work... but only a few times.

The thing is, I don't know if she's just being friendly or if she could be interested in 'more'. I'm not getting a clear signal (I'm pretty good at picking up those types of signals.)

I'm not shy or inhibited... I could ask her out for a coffee easily... but SHOULD I? If I'm misreading her, I could sort of screw things up at work.

I don't want to be a 'friend' and if I ask her out, I'd be sure to speak my mind and lay my cards on the table: I want to have a relationship with her.

But SHOULD I?

As a final thought, I'm not an unhappy camper. I have outside interests and I don't consider myself a 'forever alone' type. The fact is, she's the first woman that I've found of interest since my divorce almost 10 years ago.

I haven't WANTED to date until now... and she happens to be my new boss.

I look forward to hearing thoughts... especially from women.

================================

Ok. Enough. After reading the comments (thank you), I've come to my senses. The employee handbook says that relationships between supervisor and employee are forbidden... so the rules are in place.

I've taken a deep breath and decided to simply lay low on this.

The good news is that I'm sort of happy that my heart has appeared to come back to life after my divorce (it was quite harsh).

Sooo... I'll chalk this up to a delayed rebound and not act on my impulses.

Sure, she's nice and I it would have been nice... but another pretty face will come along in time.

I appreciate all of your comments.

I'm starting to wonder if the feeling is mutual, but I can't help but doubt it. I try to match his level of displayed interest, initiating conversation no more often than he does, but on the inside it's my natural instinct to want to keep pushing things further. 

But what do I want with him? What does he want with me? Surely not a committed relationship; he and I both very recently got out of long-term relationships and surely don't want to start another any time soon. There's also a good chance that he won't be living in the area after the summer, and I can't stand the thought of a long-distance relationship. If things stay the way they are, I'm worried that my emotions will take control of me, that I'll start to like him much more than he's into me, and maybe I'll start to feel used, and things will end in disappointment. Right now I just feel confused and extremely vulnerable and I can't get him off my mind. Not sure where to go from here. Should I talk to him? Leave things as they are, just go with whatever happens, and keep a realistic mindset about it? 

TL;DR: recently started a casual physical relationship with a coworker, but I'm worried that I'm getting more into him than he is into me.

However, throughout our ""talking"" phase, when we're hanging out with our social circle, she keeps a physical (maybe emotional?) distance between us.

There were physical and emotional abuse from my mother who ended up walking out, as well as being ignored by my father when he found a new gf.  I found being social as a child very difficult and have been extremely shy my entire life and never really dated.

I started to plan out how I was going to end my life.  The only thing that I felt like I still wanted to do before I followed through was to experience sex.

I ended up in a place where brothels are legal.  It was in the first world, I was there on a work trip.  After doing research to find a place that was clean, practiced safe sex and did not work with drug addicted or victims of trafficking.

I didn't enjoy myself at all and wasn't able to perform properly.  I thought there was something physically wrong with me, or that I wasn't attracted to women.  I ended up going back two more times.  The last time, I was with a woman who was an amazing person.  We talked for a long time before and I realized that my problem was that I didn't want to have meaningless unconnected sex, especially not for money.

This caused me to do a lot of thinking.  In my thoughts, I started to question more than just my motivations for seeking a brothel.  I'm starting to think that I might actually want to keep living.  When I'm in a better place mentally, I would like to find a woman who I could share my whole life with.  It isn't the sex that interests me, it's sharing with my life with someone.  If we have sex, that's great, but what I really want is to be with someone that I love, and someone who loves me.

The problem I have now is that I've paid for sex.  That can never be undone.  Looking around on a couple reddit subs, it seems that for most women, this is the most instant of instant deal breakers.  I totally understand and respect that.  It also seems that a lot of women think it's a major turn off because I would value sex differently.  Having never experienced love, I have no clue what sex is like with someone you love.

This is the only questionable thing I've ever done in my life.  When I think about what I've done, my stomach churns.  I can't believe that I did it.  I couldn't ever do it again.  It might be hard to believe given what I did, but I really do think of women as equals.  I think that if a woman chooses to sell sex with her, that it's her choice.  I don't at all support trafficking, pimping or abuse against women.  I have a lot of respect for sex workers, I can only imagine how difficult their lives can be.

In my search, some women said that they would be able to live with it if the guy was very upfront about it.  Others also said that they wouldn't want to know that I had or that previous sex lives are completely personal.  A lot of women said it was an instant, no mitigating deal breaker.  I even saw someone who said that she'd tell everyone she knew!

The first two stances are mutually incompatible.  If a woman needs to know, I need to tell her.  If she doesn't want to know, I shouldn't tell her, but I don't know if I could keep that from someone if I were getting very serious with them.  Some people suggested flat out lieing about it in all cases and never telling anyone, ever, for any reason.  Even if I was OK with that, I'm a terrible liar and don't think I could keep that up for a long time.

I don't think that I would lie if I was asked directly, but besides that I'm completely unsure how to handle this.  I really don't care about a future partner's sexual past.  It's completely her business, that's not just because of my actions.

When should I bring this up?  If you were dating someone, how would you want them to tell you something like this?  If you were told this, would you keep it private or would you tell other people?

Another possibility would be to lie and end the relationship for other reasons.  While this has the advantage of not requiring me to say anything, it could be really hurtful for her.  It feels like a coward's way out.

I feel like I've completely screwed up my life.  I'm still working on my other issues, but before I even start looking, I will be getting a complete STD test, and plan to continue doing so quarterly for at least two years, then yearly after that.

So about a little over a month ago she started telling me about her daughter again and how she needs to get out more and she wants her to date someone trustworthy.

Had a great first date this past Sunday which involved a few drinks, great conversation, and lots of kissing. As she leaves, we make somewhat solid plans for Thursday.  I planned to not really communicate this week, but call on Thursday to solidify plans.

Last night, I get an unprompted text from her that says: “hey, what are your plans this week and weekend?”  I’m a little confused, because we talked about Thursday.  Not wanting to bring it up, I said, “I’m busy Wednesday and Friday, but free on Thursday and as of right now, Saturday as well.  You?”  to which she replies “I’m free Saturday day or after 9”.  I tell her let’s shoot for Saturday and she says yeah, sounds great.

It’s great that she responded positively to Saturday, but I’m worried that her complete forgetfulness or disregard of Thursday’s plans could be a sign of trouble to come.  We had a few beers, but nowhere near enough to make things “hazy” and likely to forget.  So, I’m not sure how to take this.

She just facebooked me and asked if I want to go get coffee sometime.

Questions;
1.    Age difference.  Will it be seen as slightly creepy/odd (can't think of right word) if I accept the date?
2.    What the hell do I do if we do go get coffee.  Never done this kind of date before.    Do we just go to a starbucks, get coffee and sit around and chat for hours?   


**Well the initial feedback said that yeah its probably not a good idea to accept the date. The popular opinion now seems to be more positive.    In the end I said I was busy for the next few weeks and she said that was fine.  fin.**

It probably says something that I'm apathetic about declining.  It sounds weak, but I wouldn't have liked to deal with people questioning about the age difference, its partly why I asked the question.   Thanks for the advice

1361636154.0,15,self.dating_advice,19307b,I (m/24) dated this girl (f/22) for about a month before she went silent on me out of the blue and I'm not able to move on,18,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/19307b/i_m24_dated_this_girl_f22_for_about_a_month/,"So here's the story:

I met this girl on the internet. We started exchanging messages on the website we met on and she gave me her number to text her after the first day we started chatting. We started to text at a good pace, and then didn't talk for a week because she went on vacation. When she came back, we started texting more and eventually started talking on the phone. We'd talk for hours on. We really connected and she'd send me messages like ""I don't understand these feelings, they are so new and they came fast"". 

After about two weeks of talking every day, we set up our first date. Nothing fancy, just coffee. We met and hit it off, and ended up going to a bar after and then having one last drink in a park. I wanted to kiss her in the park but didn't, because sadly for me I'm kinda tentative in those moments and I generally wait until a girl gives me a clear sign before I go for a kiss on the first date.

Anyhow, we go our separate ways. We keep texting, she tells me she had a really good time and starts bringing up a second date. We keep talking everyday through phone/text until our second date about a week later. That time we were supposed to go for a meal and a movie. While we're eating, she tells me she'd rather not go to the movie because she wants to keep talking instead. I agree and we hit up this hookah bar where we have a wonderful time. She misses her last bus and tells me she has to come back at my place to sleep, but makes it clear nothing more than cuddling is going to happen. Fine with me (well, kinda). We go back to my place, talk and cuddle, I try to kiss her but she kinda turns me down because it was a bit awkward (I was pretty drunk/high and my approach wasn't the best lol). We sleep together, cuddle and everything seems well. 

At that point I'm really starting to fall for her. We have a stupid amount of stuff in common, she's super hot and exactly the kind of girl I've been looking for. I get the same kind of vibe from her too, she texts a lot, she makes it clear she's into me. 

We plan a third date, and before the date she sends me stuff like ""I can't wait to see you"", ""our next date is too far away"" - at which point we move the date sooner because we both want to see each other. At this point, I'm thinking we're about to make things official. 

We meet for food and it goes nicely, and we're already making plans for the following Friday. After the restaurant, we go to this other hookah bar (she really likes hookah). After about 20 minutes there, she says she's starting not to feel well. Bummed out but still confident, I tell her it's ok if she wants to cut the date short, because we were still seeing each other the next Friday. 

We go out separate ways. After that point, things go wrong. She starts seeming distant when we're talking, tells me the last date ""was different."" She tells me that maybe we're not into it as much as we thought since nothing really happened after three dates (which doesn't seem that weird to me... plus it's not like I didn't want stuff to happen, and she didn't seem opposed to it either). So I told her how I felt, that I liked her and wanted to be with her. She tells me she needs time to think about stuff - yeah, never good. 

We talk on and off the next few days, but I get the feeling she's mostly answering to be polite. On the Friday we're supposed to meet, she never answers my texts/calls. Later that night she answers ""Sorry I'm home, didn't know what to answer but thought I'd still answer."" WHOA. Wait, what?

We proceed to have a conversation where I ask her if she still wants to see me. She tells me yes, she wants to see me again but when she doesn't know what to think she becomes distant and she's gonna work on that. At that point I tell her I'm ready to take things slowly if she wants, all I ask of her is not too leave me hanging and tell me if she's not interested, because after all, that's what grown folks do, right?

Well ever since then, it's pretty much been radio silence. We've had some small talk a week or two ago when I tried to re-establish contact but nothing more. 

Now I've pretty much accepted the fact that it won't work between us, but for some reason, I'm just not able to move on. I don't know if it's because I didn't get any closure, or if it's because I fell for her hard (probably a mix of both), but I just can't take her out of my head. I see her online and it hurts. I'm angry at her, but at the same time I'd still do all I can to have her back. I just can't shake it off the way I generally do and I don't get it considering we only dated for a bit over a month. I keep thinking about messaging/calling her to get closure and try to understand how things could change so quick, but I haven't mustered up the courage to do it as of yet. I just don't know what to do right now. 

Any advice/opinion is appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text, hopefully you guys take the time to read. Thanks Redditors.

I just need to rant and reflect and would love any advice.",21,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/17vkjs/i_24m_just_had_a_first_date_with_a_girl_20f_whos/,"**TLDR:** *I'm a guy going through a low point in my life, and was not going to look for romance until I got myself back on track. Then super-awesome girl messages me on dating site. After first date, she is still oblivious to my less than ideal circumstances, and I'm just flat-out confused. Don't know if I should bother pursuing, not sure how I feel or how she feels, not sure if I'm being dishonest by not being upfront about my problems, though she hasn't specifically asked.*

We met on OkCupid, she messaged me first. She's going to school in the city where I grew up, and where I currently live with my parents.

So guys, I'm kind of a loser. I know, I know, low self-esteem sirens going off, how boring, but just bear with me. I know I'm not *really* a bad guy--I'm reasonably smart, super nice, compassionate, considerate. I'm semi-knowledgeable about a number of things, interesting to talk to, etc. Have been told by a couple people other than my mom that I have a handsome face, and would definitely be a pretty fetching-looking dude if I lost weight. So I do have potential, and it's these positive aspects of my personality that come across in my dating profile, as opposed to my current troubles which I'll list below.

Anyway, to get to the dating part, this girl I just met is like me during my prime, but better. In some ways we are very similar, but at the same time couldn't be more different. It's like she's a version of me that I wanted to be, but never ascended to, so I can relate to all her ideals/politics/interests but I don't actually walk the walk.

**Her**

* Very busy, active lifestyle, always has interesting and exciting plans
* Is in good shape
* On track to become a professor 
* Has traveled all over, bicycled around Europe and many other interesting experiences
* Is quite good-looking
* Outgoing, energetic personality

**Me**

* Dropped out of school, (many times,) did not finish even a three year degree. (Motivation problems, not stupid problems)
* Chronically unemployed, somewhat unable to hold any job I do get, totally supported by parents who I live with
* 70 lbs overweight, covered in sexy stretch marks (5'8 and weigh around 230 lbs)
* Rarely go out, have about 3 friends I actually talk to, don't do anything interesting, have no hobbies outside of internet/games 
* Have no definite plans, don't know what I'm going to do with my life
* Low self-esteem, terrible body image, etc.

My dating profile says I'm employed full-time because I was, briefly, when I wrote it, and she didn't ask me any questions about what I'm doing right now. We just had a first coffee date, and I rushed off after 45 minutes because I suddenly drew a blank on what else I could ask or say, panicked, and blurted out that I had to go. She seemed a little taken aback. Our conversation was neither crackling nor boring. I guess it could have been a lot better, but all ideas for interesting conversation topics fled from my mind at the time. She seemed like she had a reasonably good time though and was showing signs of nervousness. (The good kind of nervous, I mean. I might sound a bit unhinged in this rant but I assure you I seem quite normal in person.)

Anyway...I'm just so bewildered by this situation because...well, I was actually about to deactivate my profile on the dating site because frankly I thought I shouldn't even be looking for anyone right now, I should be working on improving myself. Other than perhaps being good company and a big sweetheart, what can I offer?  But people keep telling me that I'm too hard on myself and I shouldn't write dating off for now...and then I got this message from this girl out of the blue, decided to follow up, and now here I am with her still assuming I'm normal and stable. I kind of feel like I'm just leading her on to inevitable disappointment. 

Here are some areas where I'd like feedback: I think I want to see her again, but I don't even know if it's because I want to pursue this, or out of curiosity, or I'm just lonely and would like a friend, or...whatever. I guess it's okay that I don't know yet. I also just realized that I don't feel a strong gut-level lust for her, though objectively I think she looks great--I think this disconnect is just because imagining getting physical with her seems so unrealistic right now. Should I text her and say I had a good time? When? Should I make up an excuse for leaving early? Should I even see her again at all? What should we do for date #2, if she agrees to one? These are the most pressing questions running around my head at the moment. Thanks to anyone who read this.

1357751355.0,13,self.dating_advice,16998s,I (21/m) had a date tonight (21/f). Ran into a bit of a curfunkle. Is there any hope? ,19,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/16998s/i_21m_had_a_date_tonight_21f_ran_into_a_bit_of_a/,"So, I met this woman at an end of year Uni bash a while ago and decided to ask her if she wanted to do something. After some thought I suggested we hit up the hot springs near my place as a way to kick back after exams. She thought it was a good idea too, we picked a time and fast forward to today.

We were there for ~9 hours all up, including a nice lunch/dinner and alternating between the pools (They were all different temperatures, so people jumped around a bit as one got too hot/too cold.). We got on rather well, had a good time, and I thought things went swimmingly. I actually had no trouble maintaining the conversation for so long - usually I'm not too good at holding long conversations, so this was a surprise to me. 

Anyways, 9 hours in comfortably warm water will make anyone tired. So after dinner, I suggested we head back to my place (I rent near our Uni, so it wasn't an unfamiliar area for her.) and watch a movie. We did, and this is where the fun begins. It was ""Dark Shadows"" - For anyone unfamiliar, it's a comedy with supernatural themes - Vampires, **ghosts** (important), etc. She seemed eager, and I hadn't seen it yet, so I figured why not. I got the popcorn going while she put the DVD on and we sat down to watch it.  

Now, I want to take a break from talking about the date for a minute. I should probably mention this, but I am **terrified** of ghosts. I had nightmares about them almost every single night as a kid and to this day they still freak me out more than anything else. I'm not talking *just* scared either, I'm talking shaking, cold sweats, freezing up, tightening of grip, panic attacks, etc. I can't watch Casper, I can't watch Ghostbusters, I can't even look at pictures of them without this happening (To a lesser extent with pictures, but I still get some of the symptoms described above).

Anyway, I should probably have seen it beforehand but this movie did indeed have several scenes with ghosts in it. Each one got worse, I panicked and froze up every single time. She asked me if I was okay, I said ""Yeah, I just don't do too well with ghosts. Sorry if that hurt"" - referring to the squeezing/tightening of grip. All seemed well enough.

Anyway, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that I am starting to shake just thinking about. In this scene, a ghost *screams* and I swear it is the loudest scream you will ever hear in your life. It focuses in on the ghosts body/face. Needless to say she was not curled up against me at this point but rather had her head on a pillow on my lap. Not only did I freeze up at this point, I kind of uh...got up. Maybe halfway, my body was still on the couch but my stomach/chest had moved forward, tensed up, arms were gripping the chair, immediate cold sweat, etc. etc. Straight onto her head. I'm not quite sure what happened, it was completely involuntary. Everything just kind of seized up - nothing like that has ever happened before, I couldn't even think about what was happening for a few seconds. 

She got up in a hurry, asked in no fewer words: ""What the fuck, Mike?!"" and started to get her shoes on. I was still in kind of a state of shock and didn't really know what to say/couldn't say anything. I managed to get an apology out before she ran out, but that's it. 

I tried to call her once to explain a short while afterwards, and after I had calmed down again (And promptly thrown the dvd so far out the window that someone is probably watching it in Shanghai right about now.) but to no avail, she did not respond. 

Up until that point, the date had gone pretty well I thought. But I could easily see how one could misinterpret what was going on when I basically smothered her. 

So yeah... Is there any hope of another date? We got on really well, and I'd like to see her again, but I'm not sure there is any salvaging the situation.

However, I've been told by a few people that this is usually perceived by women as ""desperate"" and pretty much throws you out of dating potential (but not friend potential) immediately. I do have a few female friends, that I am still close with, and I don't regret it transitioning to that, but I've never been able to make the jump to dating when meeting a new girl. I always end up quickly being labelled as a friend, and then any potential for more in that relationship gets locked out.

How do I change?,16,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/136khh/tired_of_being_overeager_how_do_i_change/,"Female, late 20's. I recently had my heart broken and I'm trying to learn from what happened. I have a tendency to care/love too much and be too eager. I get really excited when I find someone who I can connect with and so far it hasn't done me any favors when it comes to relationships.

So, how do I change this behavior? I recently had a friend tell me that I need to broaden my horizons and remember there is a lot more out there when I find myself caring too much. Sometimes I'll even time my text responses to guys I'm interested in because I don't want to seem always available.

I have a lot of interests and I'm involved in a few activities outside of work. I feel like I'm a good multi-tasker when it comes to engaging in a conversation via text and carrying on with my life. I was told I need to stop that because it looks like I have no life. I feel good when people answer my texts and I wouldn't assume something like that about another person but trusting my instinct hasn't gotten me anything but hurt so far.

tl;dr Busy person but too caring, too eager with potential partners. How do I change?

30M, and due to alot of Me issues, I'm really just getting back into dating. It's been easily 13 or so years since I last had a date. I went out last night for a ""coffee date"" with a great looking girl. I was a bit nervous when I got there, but I like to think I hid it well enough.

I came home and it was all I could do to get changed and drop into bed. I slept (fitfully) for 12 hours.

The closest things I can compare it to was when some friends went skydiving a few years ago, they told me that the adrenaline rush and the endorphins after they landed made them feel like this for a day or so after the jump. 

Is this what dating does to people? Honestly I'm sitting here with another first date on Friday and I'm wondering If I can handle it. I was pretty confident about the whole process until this.

He did not pressure me and said that he would be fine just watching the movie and making out. Still a gentleman.

UPDATE: Talked to my step-brother about it without giving details. He said that a lot of guys lose interest in the girl if she has sex too soon because the mystery is gone. A lot of what keeps a girl on a guy's mind is wondering what she is like in bed which turns into emotional investment as the connection grows with more time spent together. He said the best way would probably be to wait till a committed relationship.

I've made some mistakes over the past three months. I broke up with my boyfriend of three years in January, because I fell out of love with him and wasn't attracted to him anymore. It was a very difficult decision and we had a wonderful three years; we communicated very well and we are on amicable terms now. 

I had been crushing on this guy who entered my friend group a few months before. I didn't think he was interested, but it turned out he ""was"" and we slept together. That was fine. He asked me if I wanted to do the casual thing, I said okay, but if you wanna be with anyone else in our friend group/outside of it let me know because I don't really want to share.  I made it clear it wasn't a restriction; it was ""fine"" (not really but I'd deal with it), but just to make it clear so I wasn't running around confused. Well, he totally did not do that and eventually after some bumps, he didn't speak to me for 5 days and when I asked him what was going on, he basically said that he hit it and quit it. Gave a bullshit excuse. I couldn't understand (at the time) why he didn't just tell me. I had really liked him and I felt used, and betrayed because he was someone that I thought of as a friend and I couldn't understand why a ""friend"" would do that. 

During my time getting over this, I met this other guy who I originally thought was the biggest dweeb ever and it turned out that he was super sexy and suave. I became smitten, the times we hung out we could chill and talk. We're very different, but  we enjoyed each others company. We both got out of our relationships at the same time, and we both wanted something casual. He would call/text me pretty often till about last week when he had a bunch of work he had to do for school. He called me Wednesday night and I told him that I liked him- and he said ""I like you and you're a great girl but I'm not looking for anything serious"". I thought we established this, and it didn't need repeating. I invited him out to a festival that happened this Sunday. He said he might be going away so I left it at that. I didn't hear from him until Sunday, and he apologized for ""being an asshole and not keeping in touch"" and asked to hang out. I couldn't, but he said he wanted to hang out soon and invited me to a play on some date that he didn't know. I accepted but haven't heard from him since.

Soooo, my feelings are pretty hurt, the second guy was wooing me like crazy and I had a pretty good feeling about it, now I feel like he's kind of backing off even though I have been so so so careful to give him space (and myself). I admit that I have been catching feelings. 

So, I guess my questions are:

How do you date casually without falling for all kinds of bullshit? 
How do you deal with actually liking the person you're casually dating? When they reject you--even if you know you've done nothing wrong--how do you minimize the disappointment and sadness you might feel from it? How do you get to know someone whilst still guarding your feelings? Sex? What do you do with it? Do you have sex? Cause I have a really hard time saying no. How do you build the emotional wall to deal with consistent disappointment and rejection? 

I've been trying to get advice on this from everyone. People thought I jumped into dating too soon (probably), that I slept with them too soon (definitely), that I'm not making these guys ""work for it"" (spend money on me and commit time to it which is not really my style), that I made myself too available, and maybe that I'm not a person who can casually date. I know that rejection itself isn't a big deal, and that there are billions of people out there, and why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you, etc. Its not terribly comforting though, and I'm terrible with compartmentalizing and the amount of time and energy I spend thinking about this stuff is actually affecting my school work. 

So, guys, I am finally turning to you and I hope you can lay some learning on me. ",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_rg1hy,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/rg1hy/building_the_great_emotional_wallaka_how_do_i/,

  Met her at workplace (which I only worked there for 3 months), and early we got along talking about basketball. We went to a bar to watch a game one night and each of us invited 1 other friend. She dressed up for it, and picked me up (since I don't have a car). I liked her after that outing but decided against asking her out because we were coworkers.


  She asked me once if i thought coworkers should date, and i told her i didn't like the idea, also asked me if i thought professionals in our field should date (and I sarcastically deflected the question....). 


  While working there we would get lunch together off-site at least once a week, and I've also gone over to her place to watch a game on a night where she rescheduled with a best friend who usually came over for some VH1 show. 

  PRESENT DAY: I just left the job a week ago unexpectedly, and have had communication with her only through text. I asked if she wanted to go see a game at a bar this upcoming week, we have agreed to meet. Is it time for me to go ahead and ask her out? 
  Should I worry that she is relocating in 2 months, or is it fine if i just want to date and get to know her while she in town, and discuss the move later on (if we date).

All signs pointed to yes, flirted, playfully touched, teased each other, flirty eye contact, spent V-day together, was introduced to parents on phone/in person, meet all ""requirements"" of type of guy she likes...did hanging out too often the thrill?


**Sign #1: Frequent eye contact (checking each other out) before 1st ""introduction of names""**


November: 
Over time, if I saw her I'd make conversation, simple things like ""how was your weekend"" and would ask questions about her family and such. It wasn't everyday or every week (in the beginning), it was casual. 

(BTW, at this point, I had ""figured out/assumed"" she was single. The way she carried herself, acted all projected ""i am single"".)

December: We didn't talk much nor see each other for no particular reason. 

January: Here is when things start to pick up quickly.


**Sign #2: I noticed ""Lauren"" was showing up my desk more and more.**


We would chat about whatever, she would laugh, I would tease her, playful banter. She would tease me back, which one of my coworkers told me was a test (how are you going to react to her teasing?). By this time, I had asked her for her gChat and we had chatted online a few times. One of the ongoing jokes, is how this security guard always tries to talk to her. When she notices him walking her way, she sends me a message ‘help’ and ill call her work phone to get her out of talking with him.


**Sign #3: The people I work around all noticed this sudden increase in her coming by and started to ""welcome her to the group"". They liked her. Girl coworker: ""she is starting to show a lot of interest"".**


I had invited her to a Thursday ""happy hour"" which she accepted (despite not initially being invited since were on different teams). Keep in mind; this was the first time ""outside of the office"" that we actually hung out and it went well.

I was out sick for 3 days and worked from home. 


**Sign #4: Well, after not talking/seeing each other for 3 days, she reached out to me to ask where I had been?**


We chatted for a bit online, smiley faces sent here and there, all playful chat - chat that regular coworkers don't do.


**Sign #5: When I came back to the office, guess who was there EVERYDAY stopping by.**



**Sign #6: Frequent prolonged eye contact**


**Sign #7: mirroring body language**


**Sign #8: laughs at my stupid jokes**



**Sign #9: I initiated playful touching by high fiving her, since then the touching has increased much more by her.**


I was beginning to feel the possibility of ""friendzone"" approaching) though as we began to see each other EVERYDAY.


**Sign #10: - Facebook friends (makes point about how we should be facebook friends – I add her late one night, within minutes she’s accepted) Flirty posts begin each other’s wall.**


A week after going out for ""happy hour"", the pressure to ""make a move"" started to increase. My coworker, who is 31, kept reminding me ""the window is closing, you need to make a move to prevent 'friendzone'.

February.

**Sign #11: - Buying ""squares"" together -- gives us another chance to talk/see each other.**


* Lauren: i think we picked some good spots!

* me: yeah? why do you think that?

* Lauren: just trying to think good thoughts... we better win!

* me: haha, its cause we make a good team duh!

* Lauren: yeah? why do you think that?
:)
I want to hear your reasoning.
....

* me: just trying to think good thoughts... we better win!

* Lauren: thats not a good answer
you are just copying me now
**what makes us a good team?**

* me: ah it'd took too long to write out:)
er take*

* Lauren: its that complicated?
have you strategized about who would make your best team member?

* me: yeah
my ""best team member"" is a winner.
but iunno if youre in club...yet

* Lauren: so i guess you dont have a best team member yet....

* me: just got you 
now youre turn
sigh your*

* Lauren: haha been a long day eh?

me: yomp

* Lauren: ditto...long but good

*FEB 10TH: I was chatting with her on gChat, waiting for the right opportunity to ask her what her plans were/phone number:

* me: hey,

* Lauren: yo

* **me: what are you doing sunday?**
im going to be in your neck of the woods

* Lauren: cool
ummm i have a dinner with a friend who just got engaged
but other than that i might be exchanging valentines with a girlfriend of mine
but no confirmed plans yet

* me: wow busy weekend!
iunno yet, 1st time dropping him off

* Lauren: oh cool
what time are you supposed to drop him off
i will let you know once plans are solidified and then maybe you can meet sister too

* me: was told ~11am

* Lauren: k

* me: how about this whats your number, ill fill you in once i know more kinda late to call him (he's a pup)
but thinkin brunch if youre interested, otherwise i was going to the airport and try race plans on the runway

* Lauren: lol
omg
* me: planes*

* Lauren: like running or by car

* me: ahem*
hmm, good question!

* Lauren: because you would get more steps in one way
just sayin :)


**Sign #10: Lauren: my cell is ******1234**


* me: omg youre right! i could actually beat your score
seriously, i cant figure out how you have more steps than me

* Lauren: hahaha
didnt you get my email?
i explained it all
i sent it from my iphone and it said it sent!

**Lauren: wait call me**

**Called and was put on speaker phone and talked to her Dad, Mom &amp; Sister for the first time.** 

**We ended up making plans to hang out that evening**

*Lauren + her sister (who she is very close with) and me. They said they needed to freshen up and would meet me at the wine bar (45 min drive for them). I called my friend and we met up. 
Met the sister for the first time, I equate it to how every hot girl has a fat/ugly friend who is loud and center of attention.
Lauren and I chatted, was hard to have a 1v1 since we both wanted to make sure her sister+my friend were doing ok. 

** FIRST FRIENDZONE WARNING SIGN:**

Can’t remember specifics, but I do remember her saying “dating…coworkers…what if something happened, then it could be awkward…” and How she doesn’t give out her phone # to random guys since shes afraid of them constantly calling her. Which I responded with “I feel pretty honored that you gave me your # then” to which she responded with, “…well, we work together”.
That comment(s) kinda threw me off and made me, uneasy as it was the first time, she a “negative” thought about “us” had been brought up. At the next bar, hot waitress was hitting on me, not sure if Lauren saw but it felt good. We chatted but as the night went on, I was starting to become less interested as her comment from earlier kept playing in my head. Walked them to their car, said goodbyes and for the first time, gave her a legitimate/bracing hug. We continued to make eye contact as she was walking/getting into her car.

The Bachelor 
One of her favorite shows, I ended up watching last weeks episode with her via chat. We would talk about what was going on.

**Became ""walking buddies""**

* Me: hey, thanks for being a trooper and coming out for a walk in stilettos - i had a good time:)
* Lauren: hahah im glad i didnt fall :)
ditto


**Sign #11: started bring workout clothes since I mentioned we should do harder/longer walks**



**Sign #12: We playfully pushed each other, walked close and made flirty smiles/eye contact.**
 


**Sign #13: Told her I had hit a new “level” in steps, causing her to run up and down her block to get more points to “try and beat me”**


**The Jealousy Test:**

While walking back to the office after one of our 1hr+ walks, we pass by a parking lot. A guy is sitting inside his truck talking on the phone. As we walk by, I turn to look at Lauren who I see is looking at the guy and smiling. I look at her and ask “were you just smiling at that guy?”,which she responded with “yeah, he smiled at me, so I smiled back at him”. We walked a few more steps, and she turned around and smiled back at the guy again. 

**To which I said, “omg, you just did the smile, walk, and lookback”, “you want me to leave you alone with him?”.** 

To which she said, “hes got tattoos on his arm and has got a hot car, why wouldn’t I smile?”. To which I responded with “NOTED”, pointed to my head and repeated “NOTED”. She didn’t seem to appreciate that almost as if I had called her out on her test. I went on to tease her and say, “you should go back there, get his phone number. Remember though, to keep a guy, you need to put out on the first date otherwise he wont like you.” To which she responded with “oh really, well im going to tell him you said that”. We got back and I went to my car to change and she went upstairs, grabbed her stuff and left. 
P.S. she did admit before the walk that “its that time of month” which I believe may have contributed to her moodiness.

At this point, I was a bit turned off by what she had just done, but figured it was a test and a test, that I called her out on. 

**2/14 Valentine’s Day:**
* Went out to lunch on Valentine ’s Day
* Went for another 1.5hr walk



**Sign #14: Towards the end of the walk, her mom called and Lauren put her on speakerphone. Her mom brought up how Lauren had spent the other evening running up and down her block to beat me in “points” while Lauren defended herself and said she was just trying to get the next “badge”.**


Every 10,000 points you get a new badge.

**1st RED FLAG!** With the mom on the phone, Lauren and I were teasing each other and the mom said “You guys are like brother/sister…Lauren you always wanted a big brother!”
I said outloud, “oh no, not the big brother comment!”
To which I think the mom picked up on and changed the conversation around. 


**Sign #15: ordered Valentine’s Day gift a week earlier, sent anonymously with note “hope this makes you smile”, she posted picture of gift to facebook: “from secret admirer: definitely made me smile”.**


The other day, I was in a conference room about to a make a personal call. She happens to be walking by and I invite her in. About 30 minutes into it, she mentions it would be fun to work in here. I agree and tell her to go and get her stuff so we can work in the room the rest of the day. 

**We spend the next 2 hours in the conference room, working and talking. I finally ask her how long she’s been single (since Oct.) and she starts to share her past relationships.** 

* College boyfriend of 4 years (ended 4 years ago) – emotionally abused her and threatened her numerous times yet she always went back to him

* “Friends with benefits” guys – “I don’t do that anymore” she says.

* Another guy who cheated on her with his ex.

* “We don’t talk about him” – she ended the relationship, I didn’t press to ask anything more but could tell it wasn’t good.

She showed me pictures of her family as they had just put together an online scrapbook and I shared stories about my family as well.

Last Friday – I knew a 3 day weekend was around the corner, a perfect opportunity to hang out with her and make a move.

* Me: are you still here?

* Lauren: no im at home now

i left early for a consultation i needed to get to at 3

* me: how was your day, i think today was the first time in a long time i didnt actually see you

* Lauren: i was around :)
it was busy lots of stuff to get done for next week
and i have 1 more major thing to get done but other than that it was good
how was your day?
how didnt you see me...we sit right near each other...

* me: busy girl!
i didn't get my Lauren fix today!...i feel so faint...

* **Lauren: i guess you are right, we see each other almost everyday
and now that we are walking buddies, definitely walking everyday
missed that today
were you even at your desk today? you would have seen me walk to the kitchen a couple times....
and where would i sit**

* me: walking buddies!!!

* **Lauren: hey you could have asked to go on a walk**

*  **me: you wanna hang out sunday?**

* Lauren: what do you have in mind?

* me: ok, so that or the city
i was actually looking for trails near your area...

* Lauren: we have some good ones

* me: nice, hiking/trail it is

* me: is it fun even though youve already been there?

* Lauren: it is better to go earlier than later though
like maybe around 10ish
we could start watching the hockey game at 9 and then go for our hike

* me: hey can you ask (your sister) if she wants to go?
yeah for sure, lets go early

* Lauren: ya if you want, i can ask her
doubtful she will be up by 9 :)
look like the weather is partly cloudy on sunday too
so it should be good

* me: you know, let's let her sleep in;)
* Lauren: if you want me to ask her i will, either way is fine with me
but i think the trail will be good
there is really pretty scenery
its a good hike
and there is a perfect lunch place afterwards

* me: are you going to be able to walk the whole trail?

* Lauren: ya i have done it tons of times
oh is that a dig at me?

* me: haha
i had a smile on my face waiting for your answer
so yeah

* Lauren: hahaha

* me: i set personal ""bests"" under ""my achievements"" on Valentine's Day.
for all 5 categories

* Lauren: sweet

* me: never thought id be setting records on v-day:)

* Lauren: that is because we did the long trail and you got 20,000
and so did i :)

* me: that was a good day:)

* Lauren: it was good
**i finished it running up and down my street to get to 20,000 :)

* me: whoa

* Lauren: nope

* me: just saved your number

* Lauren: good

**Yesterday:**

Drove to her house, stopped at starbucks to pick up some coffee for us, spent about an hour talking with the parents, playing with the dogs. Finally left, and drove to the trail. Walked the trail, talked, playfully teased and pushed each other. 

**Sign #16:She talked about how next weekend we could do a harder trail and that she wants to show me the lake etc.**

After we finished the trail, we met up with the parents+sister at a sandwich shop and had lunch. We all got along and I was told her previous bf was an asshole and her mom was surprised I Lauen hadn’t told me more about him. (“you don’t know about Peter?! He’s a fucking dickwad”).
We ride bikes back to her house where her dad and I play video games, its getting late and close to dinner and Im wondering if im ever going to have a chance to make a move. The mom, lauren+sister all drive out to a track and get more “steps” in and afterwards, Lauren wants to show me more of her hometown. We drive all over the town, shes showing me all the houses and where people live, downtown etc. Grand tour.
We get home and have dinner. Talk about wine, careers and future. Afterwards sister wants to walk to starbucks before it closes so Lauren+sister and I walk there. Its late and dark. I;m being playful with Lauren, touching her, she jumps onto my back for a piggy back ride etc. 

**You need to make a move**

We get back to the house, and are outside chatting. At this point, im tired and want the sister to go away. Except she doesn’t. I say my goodbyes, give them hugs and walk back to my car. I turn around and see both of them there watching me. “We want to make sure you get to your car safely”. At this point, my heart is racing because my opportunity is slipping away. 
I yell out to lauren, “hey lauren, come here, I want to ask you something”. She walks over, “whats up?” and I see the sister watching us from afar. I yell to her sister “go away” playfully and ask lauren if she wants to go for one more walk around the block. She says shes tired and “whats going on?” as she can tell something is on my mind. I say to myself “fuck it” and tell her:

FRIENDZONED

**“well, if your sister wasn’t watching, I was going to kiss you”**
*She responds with: “Scott, we’re friends”

To which I respond (one of the other) looking up in disbelief “shit, friends?!” or “shit, ive been friendzoned”. 
She says something but I don’t hear it and **turn and walk away to my car and say “Thanks Lauren…” and drive away…**

**Within 20 minutes, I receive the following text:**

* 12:14am **Lauren**: “Scott…I’m sorry…I didn’t know that you were looking for more than friendship. That’s all I can give, I hope things wont change because I really think you are an amazing person and I enjoy your friendship. I’m sorry. I had a great day though!.

At a gas station, I responded with:

* 12:21am **Me**: “&lt;&lt;&lt;vday secret admirer”
* 12:24am **Lauren**: “That was very sweet of you…it definitely made me smile:) ***I didn’t know, I just wasn’t looking for signs…***Im so sorry, I hope I didn’t hurt you or our friendship.

* 1:11am **Me**: Hey, no big deal – everything is cool. YOU better not be all weird and shit:) btw, im pretty sure I beat you for the 2nd week in a row…

* 12:29pm **Lauren**: Of course everything is good! I’m not that kind of a girl so don’t worry about it. Week 3 &amp; 4 might be very different so watch out:) Hope you have a restful day…My butt is killing me!

* Today, she sent me a text message of a picture showing she walked more steps then me... 

**I haven't responded to her text...**

Regarding ""points and steps"", basically we both wear fancy pedometers to track how many steps we take each day and compete against each other.

So, there you have it. Whether I did it to myself or not, I do feel better now that I got an answer and let her know. Now, (according to friendzone etiquette), ill become less available, ask her about girls and see what happens. 

**Did I read the signs correctly? Should I have been more aggressive? Was there a chance or was I just played?**

We talk sometimes, not really that often or in depth, but we are pleasant and polite.  One night a bunch of people went out for drinks after work and he was among them.  The next day he asked me when we would hang out again.  Fast forward a couple weeks and I realize I have a crush on this fellow.  I try to talk to him more but he is quiet at work and his quietness is really intimidating to me, as conversation doesn't really flow that well between us.  

Fast forward another coupla weeks and I have it pretty bad for him.   Me and some other girls are talking to him about babies or something (I don't remember) and I jokingly tell him I'd have his baby.  He blushes...a lot and walks away.  A week later I am talking to several people, including him, about how I used to live in another state and he says he was born there.  It turns out we both lived in the same city and in the same relative part of the city.  It's cool because it is like, 1500 miles away.  

I decide 2 days ago things are never going to progress between us because he makes me feel so shy, so I am gonna get over it.  It is that very day at work that H and his friend invite me out with them for drinks after work.  At the bar, H starts asking me who my celeb crush is so he can, ""figure out what kind of guys I like.""  I will give the highlights of our evening:

* I mention that he looks like the guy I lost my virginity to.  He says he would be happy to re-enact that.

* He gets down on one knee and fake proposes to me.  I fake accept and kiss him on the lips.

* He tells me that if I have ever drank too much to get home, I should come to his house because he lives very close to the bar we were at.

* I mention to his friend that we both lived in the same city.  His friend says, ""I know, H told me,"" AKA he mentioned me to his friend in conversation (reading into it too much?)

* His friend says we should just make out and basically leaves us alone for part of the night.


Today at work is his normal quiet self, whereas at the bar he was talkative and charming, even before we really drank much.  I am reading into it too much?

TL;DR Guy is charming and seems into me at bar, but does not act like it when we are at work.  Is he into me?

We work together and he makes me laugh all day long, is incredibly smart, and I suspect has a thing for me too. I'm no supermodel, but he's pretty overweight and the physical attraction is just not there for me at this point. I know for sure that if he just lost some weight I'd be completely infatuated. I don't mind guys that are a little chubby at all, two of my exes were and I enjoyed both of their bodies.

I don't want him to lose weight ""for me"". The idea of someone changing themselves for another person like that is completely repulsive to me. But it's unlikely that he's just going to spontaneously start eating better and working out, and I don't want to begin a relationship with someone when I truly, honestly do not like the way that they are. My question for /r/relationships is have any of you been in a similar situation and actually had a successful relationship come from it? Like, maybe you didn't find them attractive at first, but after a while you came to love them and it didn't matter after all? I don't know. I really like him, but I just don't want to sleep with him the way he is right now, as awful as that sounds, you know?

The one thing I will never do is try to ""encourage"" someone to fit a certain standard that I think they should be. I believe that you should love someone for who they are, the way they are, and if they want to change for themselves, then that should be their decision. I had a boyfriend who tried to change me and that relationship has left me scarred to this day. I will not take part in that. So I just want to know if you guys have had experience with developing physical attraction later on to someone whom you were initially not physically attracted to. Thanks :)

I've been on the dating scene for what seems like ages now, and am no closer to curing my terminal singledom. I've been lurking for a bit and picking up advice here and there. It's not like I don't get replies and go on dates but...

My brain is an absolute arsehole when I do go on dates. It's like someone put a mini logic inverter (for this and only this situation) in my brain somehow. If I really like a girl, I over analyse everything to the point of surpressing any area of my personality I consider might be bad. Like my sarcastic sense of humour (Brain: ""You sound like a smart arse"" or, ""that's offensive!"") or my love of gaming and tech, (Brain: ""No girl likes that sort of thing, shut up!"") etc, etc. I'm still mostly myself just the bland U rated version of myself that goes to conferences or meets relatives.

Of course if I'm not interested I completely relax make jokes, talk about whatever seems right and generally have a good time but I send the wrong signal to her.

With so many like minded folks hanging around here, I can't be the only one who experiences this problem. I know how I want to and should act, my brain just won't let me.

So reddit how do you trick you brain into playing for the home team?

I am a 21 year old male who has a bit of a problem. I've been in a long distance relationship since high school, and during that time I've had several (4-5) good (female) friends of mine come onto me pretty strongly. It pretty much goes like this:

* We talk (I'm sure to mention that I have a girlfriend, how awesome she is, etc) and they get the hint that I'm taken.
* Things go well for a while, we get to know each other and hang out more often. We talk about everything with each other: favorite music, movies, books, our worldviews, past experiences, relationships etc. Basically a normal friendship, and if the friend was a guy there would be no problem.
* Something happens and suddenly I realize that they are into me. (fight with SO, getting really drunk, etc)
* The friendship fizzles out from here when they realize that I am not interested in cheating on my girlfriend nor would I leave her for them

I love my girlfriend and haven't cheated on her in the years we have been together (nor do I plan on it). I just don't want to be afraid of leading people on to think that anything beyond friendship is on the table. So my question is, basically, how do I keep my friendships with women friendships and not a reverse-friendzone - thus losing their friendship?

Posted to dating_advice because I don't know where else to put this.

I'm male and 27, and I recently broke up with my gf of almost seven years. I'm ok about it but I'm worried about where I go from here. A friend of mine put the breakup well the other day - ending a 7 year relationship is more like a divorce than anything else. 

So I never dated at all when I was younger due to being a massive geek and very shy. My ex was my first and only girlfriend - we were friends before we got together and we just kind of ended up together, skipping the whole 'dating' part. I've never asked a girl out, never kissed or had sex with another girl. I feel very sheltered and quite scared as at my age I'm sure it's expected that I know what to do in terms of dating and asking people out and being confident in all that stuff... but I don't have a clue. To be honest I'm a little terrified. 

Right now I'm not in a place to start dating immediately anyway, still healing from the breakup. But I do want to have a go sometime. So I guess the questions are: 

* If a guy is unconfident, is this an instant turn off? How do I work on my confidence?
* Does online dating really work? If so which sites are best (in England)? And might this be a good route for me if I'm not at all confident about asking a girl out?
* How to go about meeting people? I work long hours and typically am not home till 7 or 8 at least. I work in a small business so meeting people there isn't an option. I keep hearing that it's important for a guy to have a passion or hobby, but I just don't have the time. I'm a pretty decent cook and photographer, and I'd love to try pottery and do some kayaking again... but I just can't find the time! Does this make me really boring and uninteresting? 
* Any other tips or advice on starting dating for the first time?

This creates a strange situation around relationships/dating within college (which is where one wants to date because it's where you know people): there are drunken hook-ups that are usually the result of two people liking each other but not having the guts to admit it sober, and there are people who drift into relationships without realising it, but there is almost no ""I like this person and will ask them out to do something fun to get to know them"" because asking someone out is seen as super-serious and requiring commitment etc.etc. which is absurd.

I've never been in a relationship before, but from time to time there are girls I like (such as right now), and I want to be proactive about it: if they're not bump into very often (like now), I want to go for coffee or something to see if I actually like them.  But I don't do it, because I fear that I'll be misinterpreted as I described above, and this leaves me feeling lonely.

Girls either think I'm amazing or a total creep/loser and there's no in between. One time a girl even told me I couldn't tell her that she was cute and she reported me to a professor (WTF. Good thing was the prof knew she was insane.). I dated a bunch, but I've basically been  holding myself back from dating a lot because when I like a girl I turn into a bumbling idiot  (I want to at least preserve some sort of dignity, however slim the chances are b/c I do that cheesy romantic stuff...ugh) and I had bad experiences w/ the girls I dated (they were users and I put so much effort into it dating that I ended up getting attached =/. I also predicted all of their motives and mind-games perfectly ).

How can I approach girls out and ask them out when I'm shy? I usually end up discouraging myself from dating girls if they're popular or good looking because even though I'm super smart, dress really nice (fixed that a long time ago), and am nice I probably won't stand a chance at getting any of them to date me. It's also really easy for me to do this for any type of girl. One girl approached me because I ask a lot of smart-sounding questions in class (she was amazing) and I wish that is what always happened, but really I've accepted that I got to do it most of the time and it just feels like a lot of work. 

When I do approach a girl (I usually pick someone who I know is single or can deduce is single super easily like a really unpopular girl or girl that most guys would be shallow enough to avoid) and start talking to her the idea of asking her out comes to mind too quickly (like I want to ask her out after talking to her for like 15-30 mins) and I get awkward about it, which probably puts a lot of pressure on me and especially her. Also, lately I pretty much just talked myself out of asking out any girls because I can't stand dealing with how I am. I used to organize things perfectly like take her aside after getting to know her and asking her out in a cool way, but lately I just feel like such a loser. There was also one period where I asked out pretty much every girl I talked to and I just felt like a complete tool doing that (kind of like doing cheesy romantic stuff makes me feel like a complete tool). 

I think almost all of it stems from lack of experience (i've never been in an actual relationship much to my chagrin), bad past experiences (shitty dating experiences and being bullied), and me trying too hard. I feel like everything's forced when I want to date a girl and I have to do 10X as much as any other guy for any girl to like me or ever fall for me (some lack of confidence because most of my life in college is just me doing really well in school and I'm going to medical school). Help? I'd like to work on most of this stuff on my own, but I unfortunately am constantly realizing that the best way to fix it is experience. It's like how I got 3 A+s in organic chemistry. I made myself dive in and do every single fucking thing without caring how many mistakes I was making at first and then I was perfect, confident and getting 100% on midterms. I need to do something like that with girls, but really I just would like a girl who would appreciate me, I wouldn't have to try super hard with, and didn't make me feel like shit. I also don't want to be a total callous douchebag, even though I'm slowly on my way there. I'm so cynical about everything in dating right now, especially girl's motives and stuff lol =/. I thought getting laid would take the edge off of this stuff, but I'm conflicted about that too b/c it's between deciding if I want to just find a special girl or just lose it.

I'm also very impressionable about this stuff because I  have don't have much experience. I really don't want to be defined by constant bad experiences in dating because I know it can be really fun and awesome w/ the right girl who cares about you and who you care about. If I did something stupid or just haphazardly dated losers that'd just mess w/ my mind.

I have a question for the guys out there and am looking for their opinions on the ""cool"" girl (my definition of cool = basically being able to fit in as ""one of the guys""). Is it possible for a guy to develop a romantic relationship with a girl who may not be the stereotypical ""girly girl?"" 

I've never been good at flirting, and I often feel better and more confident when I make jokes, curse, am sarcastic, and just try to be fun (and I just love to make people laugh). Sometimes, I feel like it sabotages my ability to develop a connection with guys on a romantic level because I can be labeled as the ""girl who will watch superhero movies and actually like them"" or ""the girl who curses more and says more inappropriate things than some guys.""

Don't get me wrong - I'm not a tomboy by any means. I do girly things (wear makeup, dresses, watch romcoms, etc.), I just find that a lot of guys become surprised from the things I say, the things I like, and the things I do.

TLDR: Basically, I'm worried that I will always be friend-zoned because of the fact that I can usually fit in well with the guys.

I used to have zero confidence, and I fell for men who were extremely confident, and almost perfect in each way.  They usually liked me at first because I am physically attractive, but that fades quickly.  So I'd be left hurt.

I have recently REALLY worked on myself, and feel that my confidence is at where it needs to be.  The thing is, I don't know anymore how to distinguish a good guy from a jerk.  I have only been with people who have enticed me but then left me hurt.  I have never had a guy fall in love with me.  I'm 26.  

I have high standards, and I want to find someone great.  How do I let go of my baggage, and learn to date the right way.  It's so easy for me to get attracted to men less than what I deserve because that's all I have ever known.

How do I know who's a good guy worth my time and who's not? How do I get a call back after a first date?  How do I keep him interested in me for the long-term?

I want to do dating the right way, I have been hurt way too many times and am ready to fall in love for real.  I am on OkCupid by the way, so meeting people isn't the issue.

EDIT: Thank you all SO much for your thoughtful advice.  A lot of it was really legit, and I will definitely be using it.  Like setting boundaries when I am not involved and not expanding those boundaries when I am!!! That really really resonated with me, because I tend to always expand my boundaries for men.  Meaning, at first, my expectation would be that I am informed of plans in advance, but then if he cancels, I start letting it slide and slowly, he's in control.

Just looking for reassurance.",14,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j59ps/i31m_tried_the_bar_scene_for_the_first_time_didnt/,"So background, 31M who was a bit of a late bloomer thanks to some ""high functional social anxiety"". Have only dated a few women, the latest being a LDR of almost 2 years. They were all matched up through mutual friends, never from approaching anyone. Since my younger years I've managed to work past a good deal of that aforementioned social anxiety, though there's still room for improvement. 

So I find myself single again, a new start in a new area, and I'm at the point in my life where I don't really have time to screw around with crap like shyness anymore. So I committed myself to do something I hadn't worked up the guts to do before; hit up the local nightlife to see what it had in store. The only other time I've ever gone to a bar by myself for any reason was game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals to watch Boston take on Vancouver (one of the most amazing nights of my life BTW).

Now I've literally have only been living in my new place for a week, so I didn't set my expectations high. The primary objective was just to get out there and get the lay of the land, and maybe make a friend or two. I wasn't putting any expectations past that.

I get to the bar at about 7:30, maybe a little early but whatever. Have some drinks, some grub, watch the ball game. Seems like more of a couples bar than a singles bar, but I do eventually spot 3 attractive looking girls go sit at a far table by themselves. I've been told that as soon as you spot someone interesting you should walk over and introduce yourself within the first 3 seconds so you don't have enough time to psyche yourself out. Well I don't do that. My social anxiety is greatly improved but not totally gone. I proceed to spend the next hour and a half or so to work up the balls to go talk to them.

I talk myself up by reminding myself that they likely would be as happy to have people come up and talk to them as I would be, 80% of success is showing up, what's the worst that could happen, etc etc. Most of all I tell myself no matter what it'll be a positive experience for me, at the very least breaking the seal on this dumb stigma against introducing myself to new women. Finally after a bunch of that and a little more liquid courage, I somehow get myself to walk on over.

I say ""How are you girls doing tonight? I'm new to the area and thought I should start saying hi to people."" (All true.) A couple of them laughed and one of them replied ""&lt;incomprehensible&gt;...You're not going to get far with us. Keep making the rounds.""

Well that was incredibly awkward and anticlimactic. Half the night to work up the courage and I'm shot down on the runway. Coupled with the fact that I'd already spent my nightly allotment, I head directly home at around 11:00 (which might be early by some standards). On the walk back to my car, I kind of work out that the incomprehensible part of what the one of them said was likely ""We aren't from around here."", which if right does take the sting off a bit. But suffice it to say it wasn't the result I was hoping for.

That all being said, I did accomplish most of what I set out to do. It's not like I was prime to take anyone home that night, half my place is still in boxes. It didn't end on a great note, but it was still the right thing to do. I think.

Now I can tell myself this all I want, but I guess what I'm looking for is some outside reassurance that I did the right thing to really drive it home for me and help me try it again later on. Assuming it's warranted, maybe some of you think differently.

1372967577.0,11,self.dating_advice,1hngr6,"My [M/30s] two months of rapid improvement: wallflower no longer, explored and approached and now exclusive. My reflections on the change in mindset.",13,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hngr6/my_m30s_two_months_of_rapid_improvement/,"WARNING - WALL OF TEXT.

This isn't a request for advice, so much as a reflection on what's happened to me in the past month or so. I'm a 33 year old male, which indicates two things: a) yes, it's possible for guys to be clueless at dating even well into their thirties; AND b) no, it's never too late for you to change your outlook. Hopefully this will help others who are struggling to make that initial overture, and stimulate discussion from more experienced people.

**TL;DR In the space of two months I broke a year-long dry spell, became romantically involved with two female friends with a promise of future interest from their straight friend, and finally asked out and began dating a fantastic lady exclusively. The main difference was being more forthcoming in giving honest compliments, and losing the mindset that it was somehow shameful or embarrassing to show my interest in a woman.**

*The background:* Before May 2013, I was a wallflower. I never had any confidence asking girls out, I couldn't really figure out how to express my feelings and attraction, and I thought that successful dates and happy connections ""just happened to other people"". Even before that, I had slept with six women in my life, only one of whom I actually approached. The other five had made the first approach to me, either online or face-to-face or through friends. A year before, I'd just broken off three online-generated relationships simultaneously because they had clearly just become physical over six months, and I wanted more than just a bedpartner.

I didn't know how to approach women. I'd be fine if I were just friends, making them laugh with stories and hanging out and being companionable - but the moment I developed any feelings of romantic interest, suddenly the wells of articulation dried up and I became tongue-tied. Basically, I was in the situation that women commonly find themselves in: they can get a physical connection if other people will approach them, but they want an emotional bond with somebody they really like, but they are unable to make that first approach to the target of their affections.

Two of my longstanding female friends are a lesbian couple, and they and their friends are all somewhat younger than me. We play board games and card games, and I took them to martial arts, rock climbing, and salsa dancing. Basically, I treated them like they were my guy friends - people I respected and cared about and wanted to share fun experiences with. They also had many other female friends, whom I largely discounted from romantic interest because of the age gap.

*The Tilt*: May 2013 is when things changed. First, one of their friends showed me the importance of being earnest.

One of their friends was a woman who would speak her mind very openly and unselfconsciously. I think she was undergoing counselling and one of the exercises was to build her self-esteem by just speaking her mind. Well, one odd little tangential benefit of this was that she said things like ""athmirleen, you have a beautiful voice"". Or ""athmirleen, you tell stories remarkably well"". She would say these as flat, straightforward statements of fact, clearly with no romantic ulterior motive. She would simply throw out these affirming positive statements with no doubts whatsoever, and get happily back to her routine.

Each of them made my day. Absolutely. And it was just a simple logical leap for me to realize: people like to receive genuine compliments. And this was coming from a woman who didn't even like me or have any romantic interest in me. Why had I been so timid with compliments all my life?

Instead I learned from a colleague undergoing counseling that a compliment is actually one of the least expensive, yet most reliably pleasant things you can give somebody. Wisdom from the mouths of children, right?

**If you admire something about somebody, tell them. The chances that they'll take offense at a compliment are low - and it's much more likely you'll make their day.**

This is related to the next step, which is ""If you *like* somebody, show them. If you can't show them, then alternatively just tell them. Whatever you do, don't bury it and hope they'll guess - that's minimally effective."" (Show over tell, because if you show them, it gives them some room to consider and digest it and to get on the same page as you. If you tell them outright, it puts them on the spot... which may be entirely okay if the other party is equally as gung-ho and ready to go as you are. By extension, the third option - waiting and hoping they ask you - requires not only that they are equally interested but also that they're *more willing to extend themselves* than you are, so it's even tougher to meet those requirements for success.)

In early May, my lesbian friends welcomed one of their gorgeous straight friends to town. I'd met her before, briefly, but in May something about seeing her made me realize I was no longer okay being single. That I no longer wanted my romantic emotions in deep freeze and I wanted to let them out again to play. I don't know if I was actually attracted to her, or more just what she represented - somebody comfortable with her own sexuality, for whom romance was easy, simple, and nonjudgmental. But I finally knew I was ready to meet somebody again and I was okay being honest to myself about that desire, rather than play the emotionless chessmaster eunuch.

I took them salsa dancing. They had a great time, but the straight friend was leaving town soon (having hooked up with a local admirer for a threesome in the meantime) and so I discounted her from consideration. Instead, I played the dance floor, chatting to various women and trying to feel out whether there was a connection. By the end of the evening, I'd struck out, and rejoined the lesbians and the visitor, who asked me gently how it had gone.

""No luck,"" I laughed ruefully. ""Now, if only *you* two were straight, and *you* weren't leaving town..."" It was the first sign of interest I'd shown them, semi-serious though it was.

The three women looked at me in surprise. Then, as we left, they dropped a surprise in my lap. They told me they'd all had crushes on me but they weren't sure how to say it.

Really? Seriously? Four grown people had all the requisite interest and requited inclination for relationships, but hadn't made a move because... *nobody said anything*? This is like a group of Tolkien fans all wanting to go watch the latest Hobbit movie together, but nobody suggesting it because they're afraid everybody else will think they're a geek.

Think about that for a second. All four of us were too afraid to say anything, and so we left three potential relationships completely unrealized because of it. Worse still, the gorgeous funny visitor had ended up going to bed with a guy she hadn't particularly liked, because she'd assumed ""athmirleen probably wouldn't be interested in me"".

There are some good reasons not to date somebody, but a simple communication error is not one of them - especially when both sides want it to happen.

(The outcome here was mixed. The gorgeous visitor had to leave the next morning, so we cuddled and kissed a bit and promised to ""see if we can resume where we left off"" next time she was in town. Given that I later started an exclusive relationship, this probably won't happen. Missed opportunities, and all that.)

With the lesbians, it went better. On my birthday, they treated me to a threesome and we continued an experimental physical relationship after that for a few weeks. They both said the reason behind this was that I'd proven I could be a good, trusted friend to them - and so when they began to desire heterosexual relationship experimentation, they knew I could be trusted not to hurt them. This concluded amicably in early June, just as an unrelated exclusive romantic prospect came onto the scene.

**If you like somebody, show them clearly. If you can't do that, then at least tell them openly. (Less tactful, but better than the third option, which is...) Do not just sit silently and hope they can read your mind. They might, but chances are low and it's much more likely you'll just end up regretting your reticence forever.**

This is getting lengthy so I'll end with one more lesson - once I'd overcome the mental block of hesitation or fear of rejection or faint shame attached to showing my interest, it simply became like any other social skill that improves with practice. I checked up [Nick the Dating Specialist's site](http://www.thedatingspecialist.com/dating-101/) (great for a gentle, nonjudgmental, nonmisogynistic introduction to effective honest dating). 

At a networking event my advances met with reciprocated interest - I struck up a conversation in English and Chinese with a beautiful Master's graduate, and played the courteous host to her, introducing her to as many colleagues as possible to help her with her career interests. I got her number and called her a few days later, telling her I enjoyed her company and would like to see her again. Our first date lasted four hours and the restaurant kicked us out to close up. She stayed the night a couple of weeks after our first date, and since then we've done gaming, martial arts, hiking, and lots of cooking together. Just over a month of seeing me, she had the exclusivity talk and is about to break it off with her other dating interests and go steady with me. I'm delighted.

I'm very happy with where I am now (not only with more dating and sexual experience under my belt, but more importantly a much more positive and active attitude towards dating) and I realize that many of the obstacles holding me back a mere two months ago were entirely in my head. 

I hope these reflections will be of some use to others who are wrestling with the same anxieties that I did - and that wiser, more experienced readers can chime in with their own observations and experiences too.

Now this brother is a great deal younger than me (19), and lives quite far away. And it appears at though this brother has taken QUITE some interest in me. To the point where older brother wants to take care of his younger brother and back off. And obviously, I'm interested in the older brother, the one who is my age, and who I've been having a fun time talking to.

Also, dealing with the status part, I'm keeping our chats pretty secretive. He didn't ask me to do it, I figured it was just the right thing to do. And obviously we're not ""dating"" just talking and such. It's my first experience with someone with any sort of fame!

How can I approach this situation and either get the younger brother to back off or get the older one to get over it? And, does anyone have any advice for dealing with a guy with status?

Thanks!

There is this girl I hit it off with that's in my major. But I have been so detached from this culture I am not really sure how it works. 

How does it work in college when I hit it off with someone? Are college girls really down for ""dates""? She is a senior, 22/23 years old.

Or, I could totally be off on how to approach a college girl to convey my interest in more than a friend way.

1368248668.0,11,self.dating_advice,1e4575,Some More General Advise: Rejection Really Isn't What It Seems.,15,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1e4575/some_more_general_advise_rejection_really_isnt/,"A while back I submitted some general advise and it seemed to be pretty well received so I am submitting some more. [Old post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/151eyv/some_general_advice_for_men_nice_guys_dont_have/)



Rejection is something that most of us are looking to avoid and is always on our mind anytime we see someone that we're interested in. For me personally, the fear of rejection was something that stopped me from taking the chance of approaching or asking someone out. I have definitely let this fear stop me more times than I have taken the chance of asking a women out. For the past few weeks I have taken a lot of time to think about rejection and what it really is.



There are a lot of mechanisms built into us that stop us from doing things that may have direct negative effects, like some have the fear of heights. We know that if we fall from a height of only a few feet off the ground that it could potentially cause injury or death so our brains send us the fear signal and we get our self to safety. This is understandable since our brains are programmed to avoid death and injury at all costs. Rejection on the other hand does not have a repercussion of injury or death yet it is still such a profound fear for most of us. The reason for that is because rejection injures our ego. 



Our ego is a very important part of our sense of self, it's responsible for how we think of our self and how we think others think of us. Getting rejected can cause us to look at our self and feel that we aren't attractive enough or smart enough to attain our dreams and desires. Feeling unworthy and unwanted is a huge shot to the ego. You dwell on all the possible reason as to why someone would not want to date you and with every thought it's like someone upper cutting you right in the ego. Although not physically painful it is one of the most unpleasant feelings there are. You start to fear that pain of your ego shattering and your fear of rejection develops. The good news is that you're probably thinking about rejection in the wrong way.




Most people feel rejection is due to something wrong or inadequate about them. This is not the case. While growing up your brain develops it's own idea of what a suitable mate is. It's largely based off your parents and your life experiences. In the end you really don't have a conscious choice to whom you're attracted to, you don't tell your self ""Hey. I'm attracted to that person over there"" you just get that feeling of damn, I want to get to know that person. That's your brain telling you, ""Dude! That's a person who could potentially give you some awesome offspring!!"". Did you make the decision to be attracted to this person, no you did not, your brain did. If the same exact things go off in the opposite sexes brain then you have mutual attraction. Unfortunately that's not always the case. Sometimes only one person gets that feeling. So why didn't they get that feeling? Well for example it has been proven that most women go for a guy that have similar qualities to their father. Is that your fault that your DNA doesn't contain the code that sets of the other person's boner alarm? Absolutely not. Does that mean you're inferior for not triggering their attraction response? Nope, because the DNA code you got was not a choice you made, it was given to you and there's nothing you can do to change it.



When being rejected it's not because a person is any less of a human being it's because the other person was given a set of DNA code and was brought up in an environment that just isn't compatible for mutual attraction with that one person. These are factors that are beyond your control, why take something like rejection so personal when it's the farthest thing from personal. The person is not rejecting you because there's something wrong with you, it's because a part of their brain that the person has no control over is telling them that this might not be the best mate to make some kick ass offspring. 


Bottom line is, this is not something you can't control. When you feel the desire to get to know someone of the opposite sex then do it. If the feelings not mutual then you move on to the next and I guarantee you, you will find mutual attraction. You don't get down on your self every time you don't win the lottery, so don't get down on your self for not winning the mutual attraction lottery because that's basically what it is.",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_1e4575,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1e4575/some_more_general_advise_rejection_really_isnt/,

I feel like I develop a generally good rapport with these fellows, but nothing clicks.  I don't sense what it is and it feels shitty, even if I didn't care about that person particularly, to be let down and not know what the reason is.  

For example, today after the date I had, the guy kissed me, and then told me he didn't want to go out again.  I just get mixed signals from everyone!  Or I am just super naive.

I am an attractive, intelligent person (on whatever scale these things are measured) and people always say that.  That I'm nice, smart, pretty, whatever.  But I've never had a lasting relationship, nor have I gotten even close to one.  I don't know if I would be deemed shy or awkward in these situations, but I don't know how to change that about myself, either.  

I like myself, I have lots of good friends, I'm a fun person to hang out with, but I can't ever get anything going.  How can I be more appealing, or whatever the word may be, without fundamentally changing myself?

Update if anyone cares: I asked the dude I went out with yesterday to tell me why he didn't think it went well, and he said: ""because I [the guy] hate sports, and you're too quiet for me, in personality, volume, and quantity of talk.""

This is an update to: http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/18rq3r/i_23f_confessed_my_attraction_to_my_friend_24m/

Long background story short: about a month ago, I left a letter on his car to explain that random phone confession, and last week we talked in person. Some things got cleared up, but now I have new things to puzzle over - new things that will entertain the ever-loving shit out of you.

I straight up asked him what he meant by stuff like ""that's not awkward on a personal level"" and ""just don't lose your head over it."" He explained what he meant, and it seemed that he didn't want to be more than friends. Obviously I was a little disappointed, but I still consider him a good friend, so we carried on as normal, catching up with each other. He told me about his brother's upcoming wedding, and how it was really putting him off relationships (his nonverbal communication seemed to say he was waffling on this, but at that point, I was sure he wasn't into me, so I didn't think much of it) and about all the crappy stuff going on with his mom, work, landlord, etc. He really opened up about how he felt most of his friends, people he thought he could really count on, had abandoned him over the past year and seemed pleased that I gave enough of a shit to check up on him. At one point, he expressed concern that I would still want to be his friend and was relieved when I assured him that I did. I figured, ""All he needs right now is a good friend, and that's what I'll be.""

Now, the whole time, he was patting me on the arm and hand and generally touching my arm a lot. He never did this with me before, but given what he'd said about not wanting a relationship, I assumed that these were friendly touches, not flirty ones and didn't read too much into them. I avoided touching him back so he wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Eventually talk turned to what's been going on in my life. I said he pretty much knew everything going on with me since I had explained in my letter about how recovering from being really sick was the impetus for me to confess my attraction (basically, my whole endocrine system took a shit on me and my reproductive system decided to join the party). I joked with him about how it felt like I was going through a second puberty and said that I'd gone a little hormonally nuts. To make my point, I told him about wanting to hate fuck my cancer-stricken obgyn.

He was doubled over laughing at my story when he suddenly straightened up with an odd look on his face. ""Can I tell you something?"" he asked.

""Of course,"" I answered.

He slowly dropped to a crouching position with a look of indecision on his face, clearly struggling with what he was about to say. Finally, he looked up at me with this, ""Aww, fuck it! I'm just gonna say it!"" look on his face and said, ""Have you ever heard of Adult [Something-or-other]?"" This was clearly the name of a porn site.

""No, I can't say I have,"" I replied in confusion. Now, I'm one of the least prudish people you'll ever meet. I talk about stuff like this with my friends all the time; it's not an awkward or unusual topic of conversation for me. All the same, I was not expecting him to bring anything like this up given that we'd only just got past me being into him and had never really talked about this type of stuff before.

""Well, it's uh..."" he couldn't seem to find a good reason for bringing it up, ""it's... really good. Yeah. You should check it out?""

""I... Will do that?!"" [Note: I haven't because what he said next caused me to forget the rest of the name.]

The look of indecision returned to his face, and he shifted around in his crouched position. Eventually, the ""aww, fuck it!"" look returned to his face, and he said, ""I have a sex toy.""

My thought process went a little like: ""WHAT? HOT. WHAT? SERIOUSLY. WHAT."" What do you even SAY to that in this situation? I know what I finally stuttered in a high pitched voice: ""Meeee toooooo?!""

Quite frankly, he looked overjoyed at my reaction, ""Yeah! They're just... Great, aren't they? They're good. They... Yeah,"" he babbled.

""Yeah, absolutely. They're good. Yeah. Totally worth the one hundred bucks I dropped on mine,"" I babbled back. My brain was short circuiting.

""A hundred bucks?! That's about how much mine cost! Awesome!""
""Yeah. Medical grade silicone, USB rechargeable, and a one year warranty,"" I elaborated.

""Damn! A warranty?! That's badass,"" he replied excitedly, holding out his fist for me to bro fist him. I bro fisted him. Yes. We bro fisted over my vibrator's warranty.

""Yeah, it's good,"" I said. ""Sometimes I still find myself on the prowl, but it's good.""

""You know what you should do?!"" he exclaimed, ""At the edge of town there's this... Entertainment place. One Friday a month, they have a gentleman's... A guys night. You should go and watch them shake it. You know. Get their junk all up in your face.""

I burst out laughing and literally face palmed. ""I think I will stick with the porn,"" I finally said.

""Yeah, totally. That's always a good choice,"" he agreed.

We chatted for a couple more minutes before he had to leave to go to see a friend. As I was leaving, he crawled half way through my car window, saying, ""Here, give me a hug."" It wasn't a long hug, but it definitely wasn't short, and it was completely of his own volition. His head was practically resting on my boobs. He's never even hugged me before that I can recall. I said absently said something like, ""Now you're gonna smell like my perfume."" He was not concerned at all by this. He was not remotely bothered by the fact that he was going to show up to his friend's house 20 minutes late and smelling like a girl.

And yeah. That's pretty much it. I don't even know what I'm asking here. Is there sexual tension? I think there's sexual tension. Is he into me somehow? What does this all MEAN? Anyone care to toss out some theories? I have some of my own, but I'd love to hear from some unbiased third parties.

We kissed the third time we met and the fourth time I tried to initiate some more intimacy but she turned me down. We talked about this and she said she wasn't really sure how she feels about me. 

Fifth time we saw she felt a little reserved so we talked about this again. She said she still wasn't sure how she feels about me but she said that she enjoyed spending time with me. She also mentioned that she had been lonely before meeting me and that she was enjoying the positive attention that she got from me and was worried that she was sort of using me because of this.

1362276593.0,11,self.dating_advice,19jzo0,[21M] Recovering drug addict looking for help to break out of my shell.  ,14,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/19jzo0/21m_recovering_drug_addict_looking_for_help_to/,"Have to use a throwaway because some real life friends know my account and who knows if they be shtoopin'. Anyways I'm just looking to gain some perspective on my life and some possible advice to better myself. Hopefully this won't be long.

So I'm a 21 year old college student, typical redditor kind of guy, shy/depressed, you've all heard it. My life has been plagued by celibacy and diffidence since it started mattering. I'm 21 years old and have never made out with a girl. I have only gotten short pecks after a date here and there. That's seriously it, not even first base status. I have not had very many chances with women in life, but I can only blame myself. And I want to change. 

I attribute two of my poor qualities to the hole I have dug myself. First, substance abuse.  I began abusing drugs at, what I consider, a very important time in my psychosocial/sexual development.  When I was 16, I started smoking marijuana daily, and experimenting with psychedelics by 18. This love for psychoactivity further progressed into an oxycodone habit my first year of college at 19, and finally a heroin addiction when I was 20.  Luckily, due to lack of availability of the drug, I was not incredibly deep into heroin addiction as the stereotyped junkie and I was able to stop using on my 21st birthday.  Now, without drugs, life has become very empty. Underlying emotional problems that I was probably masking with drugs have surfaced and been brought to light, maybe depression, I don't really know. But it's obvious that there is a void in my life.

Second, my introversion and resulting self-diffidence and fear of intimacy.  Coupled with drug use, these personality traits spelled out disaster for my social life.  When everyone was beginning to date, I stayed away abusing drugs, writing music, and being just generally introverted.  I rarely tried with girls to begin with, and when I did, I didn't have much confidence to ever take it anywhere. This just repeated the cycle of loneliness and drug abuse.  

Now, I'm known as the shy drug addict who people have little interest in getting to know. I can't blame them, I know how weird I am. BUT I'm trying to change and get myself out there so I can catch up on all the years I've wasted before it's too late.  I've been straying away from the same general social circle I've known for years and am trying to get a fresh start meeting new people.  

The questions I have in relation to dating is my level of honesty.  I'm so inexperienced with flirting, dating, the whole shebang, and I'm sure its quite easy for girls to pick up on this. When I begin to meet girls, how am I supposed to establish a connection that could show my potential? Considering my life has been in shambles for four years, faking it will only take me so far before they see a problem. How do I maintain my integrity without ruining my chances immediately (no one wants to date a celibate heroin addict), or having to resort to lies and deceit? When the moment of truth comes, and I suck with intimacy, how am I supposed to respond? By saying I have never made out because of schizoid behavior and heroin addiction that left me socially inept? That will weird people out beyond belief. 

I'm just pretty lost socially and looking for ways to break out of my shell to a point where people don't have to immediately shoot me down because of my past, or see me as a loser, etc. How am I supposed to show that I'm someone worth dating, when, clearly in my age demographic, I'm not because of how weird I am. What are ways to get over this long bout of celibacy, depression, loneliness, and drug use? I just try to not give a fuck and do my best, but no luck.

Sorry if this was long, or disparate.  I'm a little stoned and my thoughts are all over the place to be quite honest. But I appreciate any advice you guys can give. Cheers.

She wants to be a free spirit which is fully understood. 

When she wasn't single I’d playfully flirt with her, and now that she's single we've been hanging out more. She knows my stance, my feelings for her, and although we've made out, she will kiss me occasionally, she insists she just wants to be friends. ""Just be my FRIEND incindia""

Literally friend zoned very blatantly. We've talked about this, but I am at an impasse, I don’t know if it would be good to still hang out, I don’t want to just be friends with her, it'd be like torture and I’m not going to sit around like that while she potentially sees whomever she wants.

She knows I've been off-and-on talking to a couple girls, but I don’t see anything with them like I do with her. I suggested just letting whatever happens, happens and it doesn't have to mean anything (like no relationship, just FWB without labeling it) but she was quick to label it as such and kill the idea. We smoke trees together and usually at my place, my trees. I don’t want to feel like she's using me for good green too.

Their whole strategy revolves around minimizing risk and panicking when rejection approaches.

I feel like once you get used to rejection, dating becomes a lot more fun. Hopefully this thread can provide people with insight to just how common rejection can and should be, and can hopefully provide you with the confidence to act without rejection in mind. Ironically, in my opinion, losing the fear of rejection can instill confidence in you that may make you less likely to be rejected in the first place. People love confident people pursuing them, it strokes their egos.

So, personally, I'm 22 and I'm in a 2 year relationship, so in my dating experience before that, starting at maybe... 16, I've been rejected by girls I've had total absolute dream about them every night crushes five times. Amongst all that I've had 2 big relationships and about 3 smaller ones that didn't really evolve into much.

So if you do the math, I've dated less girls I've had huge crushes on than those I have. The relationships that did work were totally worth the risk, and those relationships may not have ever existed if I just stayed in pursuit of the same girl who ""just wanted to be friends""

An alternate way to think about it is also that rejection is a *good* thing and the sooner the better. Rejection allows you to move on to bigger and better things. So really, embrace it.

I went to college for a semester and dropped out because I didn't like it at all. I am currently pursuing auto-mechanics (which is my passion). I have never dated anyone before and I like to think it's because there has never been anyone in my life that I would want to date; besides, I'm an introvert and went to an all male high school.

So I had joined a group when I was attending college and am still part of that group as an ""Honorary Member"" because I am no longer a student at the university. Eventually, this girl joins the group. At first, I thought nothing of her, other than that she was incredibly stunning. We never talked. I hadn't thought to. But then I went on a trip recently with the group and she was there too. We sat on the same bench of the van we were riding in. Behind me was this douche talking to his girlfriend and her friend. He was boasting like an idiot and telling the least funny jokes and giving the worst impressions I have ever heard. The chicks were laughing this dumb nasal laugh. I started thinking to my introverted self while listening to my iPod about how much the people in the car were annoying me. Then I thought to myself, ""This chick beside me isn't annoying at all! She's not laughing at his stupid shit. *I would date her*..."" Then I couldn't get that thought out of my mind.

I have grown uneasy. My stomach feels weak, I can't eat. Even now I feel like I'm about to pass out over the extreme feelings of nervousness I am still experiencing. It feels like stage fright. I feel like I'm standing there and don't know what to do, I've forgotten my lines. Funny thing is, I'm just sitting in my room, alone (oh yeah, I live at home). I can't get this girl out of my mind and I really want to ask her out. I've never wanted to ask someone out before. I really want to try this!

Here's the problem. I only see her when we are at the group stuff. The way this group works is there isn't a moment alone. Everyone is together discussing stuff for the duration of the meetings. I don't know anything about her. I am guessing she's 21, that's all I know. I deleted Facebook after high school because all the dumb shit people were saying frustrated me too much. I was faced with the decision to either, make enemies out of all my friends and relatives, or delete my Facebook. So now I have no way of contacting this girl and a moment alone would possibly be more than abnormally awkward because there is absolutely no reason why we would ever be alone together.

**TL;DR**
I'm 19 she's 21. I dropped out of college, she's still studying. I don't know anything else about her and want to date her; I've never wanted to date anyone before. I have no idea how much requited or unrequited my feelings are.
(here's my questions)
How do I come onto her? How do I hint to her that maybe I like her? How do I determine whether she likes me at all? But of course, the obstacle is that there is no privacy. I'm not explicitly afraid to ask in front of everyone. If she says yes, then big deal, everyone would know eventually. But the problem is if she says no, then things would get awkward for everyone. I think I'm afraid she will say yes. I'm like a dog chasing a car, I wouldn't know what to do with one if I actually got one. Advice on the dating stuff if it goes through? I don't want to un-impress her by doing dinner and a movie; it sounds too immature and high school-ish to me. My friends say it's not.

I (18m) have a big crush on one of my closest friend's sister (18f). I've been friends with him for about 6 years and he's become like family to me. I never really noticed an attraction until about last September. We all started hanging out frequently then it became almost every weekend. I guess me catching feelings was bound to happen. She's got a very eccentric and awesome personality. I love everything about her. 



I've often found myself not being able to take my eyes off of her, mainly her lips. We do a decent amount of flirting back and forth. We'll playfully argue, text, and sometimes ill take her phone and she'll start to hit me until I give it back; little things here and there. The closest I've gotten to kissing her was on New Years, we had gotten a little silly together and went outside for a smoke and talked. After the talk I almost went in for it, but I held back. The thing that's stopping me is that her brother is one of my best friends. I have so much respect for him and his parents. I'm practically family over there since I'm always over hanging out with them. Idk what to do, advice is much appreciated.

By that time, i started having feelings for her, but she always talks to me about other guys she is hooking up with at partys and such.  

Everyone will question if we're ""talking"" because we're together all the time and finally one of her roommates/best friends approached me and accused me of loving her and said everyone's always wondering whats going on between us. I gave in and told the roommate how i felt about her. The roommate said i should tell her how i feel and grow some balls because it's not fair to both of us.

UPDATE1: Just told her how i feel.

So I met a guy online, seemed cool, kinda nerdy, divorced (about a year) and had a lot in common with him.  When setting up the date via text, I kind of got the feeling that this guy was going to be VERY on top of making sure he did everything right before we even met, and this gave me a cause for concern.  But I still went ahead, blaming it on his nerves.  

Get to the date, I'm right, he's trying WAY too hard to impress me.  For instance, he mentions why he picked the table he did, he asks a bunch of questions about whether I'm comfortable, dressed warm enough, how I would like to order, etc. etc.  At this point I'm just overwhelmed and I haven't even gotten a chance to check him out and decide whether I'm attracted to him.  

The conversation flowed well, we do have a lot in common, but this theme of trying too hard continued the whole date.  He managed to sneak in aspects of my online dating profile into how we are so alike and why he likes me so much.  Also, anything I said he was on me like a hawk and immediately would throw in something about himself that he thought was ""just like"" me.  It honestly started freaking me out.  

Towards the end of the date, he kind of opened the conversation up to ""how he was doing"" and I answered pretty honestly but nicely that I thought he was trying too hard and he needed to chill out a bit.  He admitted he was nervous and not good at dating as he had been married this whole time, which I could understand.  But he still insisted that he ""really liked me a LOT"" and that he wanted to see me again soon.  He got a kiss out of me (a peck), but it was kind of forced as he said, ""come here for a second"" and then kissed me. 

I agreed to another date, during the day, but I'm now very nervous about this whole thing.  I'm on the fence of whether I feel that he should get a free pass because he was nervous, or whether all of these things are major red flags and I should call it off now before it gets crazy.  

So, any advice is greatly appreciated, the date is a few hours.  

Edit: Update.  Just got back from 2nd date.  It was a lot less desperate, but still slightly trying hard. I made sure to treat him more like a friend, and I was a little standoffish (not intentionally, but I felt that way) but we had a good conversation.  I paid for the date to kind of show my intentions.  No kisses, just hugs and didn't make plans for anything else.  Nothing came up regarding him ""liking"" me so I assume that may have been the booze talking as the first date was at a bar.  I guess I'll deal with rejecting him if/when he calls, but maybe he got the hint from my lack of flirtation on this date and will get scared off.

So I met her last week. Went on a walk with her and grabbed a few drinks. I made many hints and she also talked a lot about ""us"" and ""how similar we are"". Had a great time with her. Sounds awesome right? But **unfortunately it didn't turn out like I imagined...**

After the date I was angry with myself that I didn't have the balls to lead the conversation straight to the point. So I said fuck it and texted her right afterwards how I feel about us. I didn't get an answer for 2 days. So I texted her again, asked her if she just isn't sure about her feelings and that we also just could stay friends like it is now. Then she told me what's up:

*""You really overwhelmed me a bit with that, sorry that I didn't contact you until now.. but I really think it would be better if we just let it be between us like it is now. I'm really attached to you and you know that, but rather as a friend""*

So how do I feel? I feel relieved and can finally look back without any regrets. I'm glad I did it. I fully accept her decision and hope that our friendship won't change because of that. 
It's somehow a good feeling despite the negative outcome.
And now I'm moving on...

I met a girl recently who I thought was giving me good signals and after texting back and forth a lot and chatting online, I said some sexual things that I shouldn't have and she made it clear that she had only thought of me as a friend and was upset that I thought of her that way. So now I feel awful about ruining what could have been a good friendship and I'm second guessing everything I thought I understood about reading women.

I had met her at work, she works in a different department but I started talking to her and she would make excuses to talk to me about nothing much in particular. She asked me to hang out outside of work with her and her friend where we seemed to get along quite well, we talked a lot and her friend left to do her own thing. I'm not a touchy person I but I made excuses to touch her and she seemed to be touching me back on my back or hands. I guess I read too much into this and when I was talking to her online and through texting she called me cute and made up nicknames, I thought that she was being flirty but now I'm not sure what else to think. 

So now with that colossal embarrassment behind me I'm trying to re-build my understanding of attraction and coming up short. I thought that the touching thing was big, I've never had people make excuses to touch me when they aren't into me. I also thought she would have acted negatively towards it if she wasn't into me. The online chatting and talking in person fit all the criteria I had thought of as flirting. Looking back at it, I suppose she said a few things that should have made me realize that she only thought of me as a friend, but I ignored them out of stupidity.

I'm now trying to figure out how do I initially tell if someone things I'm attractive and how to I make it clear to them that I think of them that way. I've grown up being one of those sad nice guys and now I don't know how to express to someone that I am into them. I've had a couple short relationships but maybe those were just out of dumb luck? Apparently I blindsided her by going from a nice innocent guy to being weird. What am I doing wrong and how do I fix it? This has shattered the confidence I was starting to build with meeting girls. Also, what do I need to do so that girls think of me in a romantic way as opposed to a nice and friendly but innocent guy?

I am female, single, and not looking for a serious relationship. I enjoy just going out with a man once or twice and having sex and not talking again. But to get to the point where I feel like I can actually get a first date, I sometimes feel like I have to greatly supress who I am, which is a confident, unashamed woman. 

I often will be the first to ask a guy out. For example, I ran into a guy I have known for a while at a Del the Funky Homosapien concert. We got drunk and started making out. We made out the whole night and it was awesome. A few days later, we started chatting on FB about how there was rumor going around that Del was a fake (seriously doubt it, but MF Doom does, so who knows). Anyways, we came around to the subject of how we made out and I said we should do it again sometime. 

I could tell this made him uncomfortable. I made a few more attempts at trying to hang out, but nothing ever happened. I am not too upset about this not working out (he was kind of self-involved and had that ""i-am-so-clever"" vibe about him). But this wasn't the first time, and I was surprised at how many people were telling me that I was overstepping my role as the female. Really? Are people still that backwards?
Is society sending some seriously mixed messages to women, in that she should be confident, yet also be able to repress her true feelings?

**TL;DR:** In dating, is it unappealing, or too pushy for a woman to make the first move?

We grabbed some lunch, then went ice skating and had some playful competition. He's terrible and he ended up ripping his pants (it was pretty funny), so I told him I'd hipster-fy him at Urban Outfitters and we ended up choosing ridiculous outfits for each other to try on. We could've easily been in a musical montage. Afterwards, we drove out to the beach (all the while jamming out to 80's rock) and we walked towards the dark beach. We were all alone and we laid out on the sand next to the waves and looked up at the stars. We just talked and it was amazing. It all culminated to a playful tackle-fight and I ended up on my back and he leaned towards me. All very movie-like.
Then he said, ""Man, I really want to kiss you now!"" I kinda wished he would've just leaned in and gone for it. Then when I gave him the OK, he was...very slobbery. Like, his mouth was over mine and kinda felt like he was sucking my face off. Then he used A LOT of tongue and I kinda had to back off and sort of show him how to kiss. I didn't really want to teach him how to kiss when it was our first kiss! Well, we got past that (I didn't make it a big deal) and then he drove me back and our date ended.
For some reason, his lack of kissing ability has just bothered me. I can't help but wish it would've been an awesome kiss. Now, even though the whole day was amazing and he's such a great guy, I can't help but reconsider pursuing the relationship. I feel so shallow for dwelling so much on this, because you can easily teach someone how to be a better kisser!

Please advise!",15,2,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/12t0vo/was_texted_i_love_you_by_a_guy_ive_never_been_on/,"Here's a bit of background. I'm 22(f) and he's 30(m), and we're both first-year students in a small (25 student) graduate program. The age seemed like a bit of a stretch for me but he's cute, nice, and well spoken. He has had a good career and is now working on his career part time while going to school. I came straight from my undergraduate with loans, and my only income is from a stipend I get for being a research assistant.

Ok, so starting a couple months ago we started texting back and forth, and it'd often get flirty, especially when one or the other of us was drinking. I was never the initiator of flirty texting mostly because I feel like I have no clue what I'm doing, but if he'd initiate then I'd respond. Never got anywhere past PG-13 level stuff though.

After about two weeks of texting often like this, he started asking me to grab coffee with him before class. We have two classes a week together, at four in the afternoon, so we'd walk over and get coffee at around 3:30 and he'd always insist on paying. At first it made me a little uncomfortable because I've never dated anyone who always insisted on paying, but since he had a good job and knew I couldn't afford Starbucks twice a week, he'd insist and I would enjoy the attention. I always figured that he would ask me out eventually, and I figured I'd try going on a date if he asked, but he never did.
Fast forward about two months and the same thing is happening, occasional (one or two nights a week) texting and coffee before class. Nothing is moving in any direction and he has never come out with the rest of our class when we go out to eat or drink on weekends. To be fair, he works on campaigns and would always talk about how after November 6th, he would come join us. But until then he would have to work early every morning and just couldn't come out.

So last night, night of the election, my graduate class had an election watch party, and he joined for the first hour before having to leave to deal with his campaign work. I had gone to the bathroom when he left, so he didn't even say goodbye. After Obama won the election, I sent him a single text that said ""Mazel Tov!"" and he responded ""I love you."" I laughed it off, figuring he'd been drinking and was just in a good mood from the election. I responded about how we were going to the bar to celebrate and asking how his party was, and he responded ""No, I don't think you understand, I really love you.""
So here's this guy who I've never been on an actual date with. Sure, he's bought me coffee for a couple weeks, but I wouldn't consider 30 minutes of chatting before class to be a date, especially because we wouldn't get to know each other, just talk and complain about class. After the second ""I love you"" text, I tried to give him an out by asking if he'd been celebrating a bit too much already for the evening, to which he responded ""Yeah, but does that change anything?""

It was late when that came in, so I decided to just ignore it for the evening and go to bed. Lo and behold, another hour later he texts ""Well boo on you"", I'm guessing because I didn't respond. I wrote back that he's been celebrating a bit too much, and that I liked him but we've never even hung out outside of class, and that he was coming on too strong.

My question is am I overreacting? I've dated casually before but only ever said I love you to one guy that I had been dating for months already. It honestly made me nervous when he kept pressing that, especially because it doesn't seem to me like how a 30 year old would approach a potential date. The entire conversation sounded like a 16 year old confessing his first love!

I have a class with him this afternoon and tomorrow, and he sits next to me in both classes. Our program is so small it'd be impossible to try and avoid him if it gets weird, and I'm going to be stuck here for the next year and a half.

Should I be concerned? If he does ask me out should I accept? I would have a week ago, but now I'm just not sure. Did I unknowingly lead him on to believe this was some serious thing?

The ""hookup"" culture is taking its toll on my morale and perception of human beings.

* In the past few months, 2 girls who have long distance, long term boyfriends have tried to get with me. In both cases, I didn't know about their boyfriends until they had already started interacting with me. I didn't sleep with either, thankfully, but it has impacted the way that I view women. I fear that I am slowly turning into a misogynist. F[19], F[19]

* Additionally, there have been 2 girls (at separate times of course) that I really liked who listed themselves as ""single"" on Facebook and were hanging out with me, until I realized that they had boy-toys who they were consistently sleeping with and I was crushed. They saw men as cute friends to have sex with, and that's about it. [F21], [F20]

I feel like my only chance of having someone to be with is if I agree to some sort of sexual arrangement, and on top of that I don't know how to approach women in a college setting. I'm not even interested in sex, I only want cuddles and someone to talk to.

I am losing faith in humanity. Where are the girls who actually want a trusting, committed relationship in college? Did everyone get tired of that after high school? Am I going to the wrong social events? Do people just not have time for relationships with all the homework in college?

All things considered, I am not sure that I even like girls anymore. Not that I'm turning gay, but I just feel like hugging a pillow instead, because a pillow won't manipulate me or look down on me. If someone needs to thrash-talk some sense into me, have at it. I need some sort of advice, just something so that I don't feel so hopeless. I want to be with someone, but I have the typical shy/nervous problems. On top of this, I don't even *want* to talk to women anymore with the way that I have seen them acting this year.

**TL;DR:** I don't understand why the hookup culture is so prevalent. Are girls in college just trying to get laid without putting effort into a relationship? Why does everyone only want to ""hook up?"" I don't like the way that women in college are acting. The atmosphere is apathetic and porn-like rather than loving.

*Notes: I'm not good with women in the first place, but I am getting this impression from the women around me regardless. I don't drink, but I go to parties. I am not ugly enough for that to be a factor; I'm pretty good looking compared to a lot of guys and I wear cologne/dress nice/shower. A big factor may be that I'm in the city, living with other students in a dorm that aren't in any of my classes.*

She's never expressed a loss in interest, if anything she has been pushing to hang out and be together.  I'm just a reserved guy, somewhat contemplative and lost in thought, and i see this as a turn off to girls, or a way for them to easily loose interest.

She says that i might be the kind of guy she needs after her last relationship being that I am so patient and understanding towards her and the fact that we havent had sex and that i'm not solely after that.  She says i'm a ""good guy"" and very ""zen"" centered and calm.

But the problem i'm facing is that i feel like she will eventually lose interest and find someone who is a bit higher energy and more fun i suppose.  Nobody wants to be in a zen garden forever, it's just a place you go to, to compose your thoughts until you move back to reality and life.

I still get their spam emails and every now and then I might click on one to see photos of women who ""like"" me.  Well, with the Google image search I decided to see if these women actually exist.  I just finished about 2 hours of searching every female's photo that has ever ""liked"" me on this sight and I have the following statistics:

78% of the women had profiles on Russian dating sites.  All of these women claimed to be from my home state (Florida).

3% of the women had Myspace profiles.  The name, date of birth, and state never matched up with the doyoulike.com profile.

3% of the women had profiles on modeling websites, and for some reason 100% of them resided in Hawaii.  Again, names, ages, and state locations did not match. 

2% of the women admitted to being from another country, such as Singapore (seemed to be most popular) and were looking for American men.

14% of the women I could not find a match for their image. They might have been genuine profiles, but it's hard to say.

I had a total of 219 images I searched.  As someone who spent countless hours on online dating, I thought I would just let people know not only about this site but that you might want to search profile pics of prospective online dates before you invest much time into perusing the person.  Online dating is frustrating enough!

Good luck to all the online daters out there!

I'm 28M and still a virgin, yes I know pathetic isn't it?  I have had several girlfriends.  A few of them we lost do to them moving away, the others I chose for the wrong reasons so the relationship never went anywhere.  Third base is as far as I ever got so I'm not a total stranger to sex, I've just never managed to get my dick wet.  Anyway I haven't been in a relationship in eight years, well the first three years after the last breakup I enjoyed being single o I guess they don't count.  But now that I am older I know what I want in a woman I just can't seem to find them.  I work at a university so I am surrounded by women every day, however the university's sexual harassment policy is so stacked against you that I'm scared shitless to even talk to a female at work.  Honestly this is what they said at the sexual harassment class we had to go to.  ""It's not what you say, it's how they take it.""  So more or less you can get charged just by complimenting someone if they don't like you.  So that eliminates finding a girlfriend at work.  

I have always considered myself one of the old fashioned romantic types, I want to know someone before I have sex with them, especially with all the stds floating around.  So I am not after a hook up, plus I don't drink so trying to find a girlfriend at a bar is not really an option since I don't think I'm going to find the type of girl I want there.  Besides I like heavy metal and the only bars we have around only play country or rap.  

I live in the country and there is not a damn thing to do around here, no places for casual socialization at all so it's not like I can just go hang out somewhere.  Which is why I decided to try dating sites.  Well so far I have had no luck with that.  I'll spend hours going through profile after profile and when I find a girl that catches my interest I send her a message, only to have it be deleted without even being read.  Or if they do read it they wont respond, ever.  The very few that have ever responded only gave me one word replies so getting to know them through conversation was impossible.  

The only thing I have to offer a woman is love,  I'm not rich, I'm not hung like a rhino, I'm over weight, people say that I am a decent looking guy, and I think I am, but that doesn't seem to help.  

I thought about trying an international marriage site but again I'm not rich and those things are expensive.

Loneliness has put me in a serious state of depression and nothing kills confidence more than depression does.  The few chances that I have had to ask a girl out I have passed by because I always told my self that she was out of my league, or some lame excuse like that.

I have managed to get myself out of that depressed state by not thinking about being alone.  Usually by reading, watching movies, or gaming.  

So do I continue the seemingly hopeless pursuit of trying to find a girlfriend and run the risk of falling back into the pit of depression where I might not be able to claw my way back out of?  Or do I embrace being alone and take what happiness I can get and just hope for a better roll of the dice in my next life?",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_zkchz,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/zkchz/im_about_to_give_up_hope_and_seriously_need_some/,

I would like someone to confirm a few things please",20,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/y7wd4/met_a_very_very_busy_girl_online_and_not_used_to/,"**Backstory**

* We are both mid-20s. I've only been in one serious relationship, which lasted many years. She seems much more experienced and casual about relationships. 
* Met the girl on a dating website. Our relationship goals are basically: ""see what happens"". We've been on half a dozen dates in the last 6 or so weeks. As far as I know, she is not seriously dating anyone else. 
* We have some of the best conversations I've ever had. Our personalities mesh incredibly well. We both find each other incredibly attractive
* We have great physical chemistry (more on that later)
* She basically works 2 full-time jobs during the summer... as well as a very active social life. She will start full-time school locally in September. 
* She does not phone/text. It can take her days to respond to things. In person, she seems a lot more into me. Outside of our dates, contact is MAYBE a text every 2-3 days. It gives me anxiety but don't want to push anything, as I don't want to come across as needy.
* On our dates, it tends to be a LOT of conversation with minimal physical contact and then eventually making out/heavy petting/oral/etc. 
* We have not slept together. We tried on our last serious date, but nervousness/the fact it was 4AM/hours of dry humping made it... not happen, unfortunately. This was about two weeks ago. I went on another casual date with her this last weekend, where I met some of her friends. 
* We tend to leave dates open-ended, with a ""I'll let you know when I'm free"" clause due to her unpredictable schedule. 
* On our last date, she was too tired to go dancing (our original date idea, though she had a rough week and understand how tired she must have been feeling), so she took me out to a coworker's party and she introduced me to everyone. During the party, there was some physical contact that showed affection towards me (rubbing of the back, hand on thigh). At the end of the night, she was falling asleep, so it ended with light kissing and a goodnight. Still left me cold, though I understand the circumstances were not in our favour.  

**My Questions**

* When busy people date, is it common to have little/no contact with the person in the initial stages of a relationship between dates? I'm used to texting/calling every day with almost all the girls I've dated, but this one seems unreadable.  
* I brought the (lack of) texting/calling thing up at the end of the last date, to which I told her that it'd be nice to have more contact with her over the course of the week. Would it be strange to start sending her short emails with bits of conversation and maybe get something going? Or should I wait for her to initiate to judge interest? 
* Is the fact that she took me out to a friend's party and introduced me as a friend/guy she's dating especially positive? Or does it not really say much? 
* I understand it's a ""if she wants to see me, she'll see me"" type of situation. Should I still invite her to do things with me? Or should I back off for once and see if she asks me? 
* Would it be beneficial to have a ""hey, are you into me?"" conversation the next time we see each other? I'm getting so many conflicting signals, but it may all just be in my head. Or does that come across as not confident?

Over the years she began to get more and more attractive until 9th grade where she easily became the prettiest girl in the grade. Of course I thought I had no chance (even though I am good looking, athletic, smart, and pretty popular and respected). 

However over the course of the year she began to make advances towards me (talking a lot more, staring at me, asking for help seemingly 24/7 (even though she's smart), getting my number somehow and starting to text, flirting), but I was stupid and decided to wait for a ""better"" time (note that I was never in the friend zone, I kept myself in the potential dates zone if there is such a thing). As the second semester went on she started to become anorexic though, and that was what made me decide not to ask her out, because I wanted someone who was content with who they are, not self conscious. 

Anyway I nearly stopped my attempts and basically lost contact when summer came around. However when recently discussing this with my cousin he pointed out that I didn't know WHY she went anorexic, and that she could have been going through tough times. In addition I also learned that someone finally convinced her to gain back weight. Finally I happened to see her randomly a couple days ago and text-flirted a little with her after. 
With school about to start I don't know if she's in any of my classes, so I don't know if I'd even see her next year at all. My point is that I'm not sure if it is too late or not to ask her out, and how I would go about it if I don't have many chances to see her. Is it possible to re-kindle this relationship, and how would I go about it?

Also I recently learned that while she was going for me, she was denying advances from some (admittedly) good yet slightly douchey guys. I also know that age is supposed to be an important factor but please understand that we aren't the stupid yolo teenagers of reddit yore.

Finally (for real) her personality is slightly more party oriented than mine while I tend to be more chill.
tl;dr Hot girl liked me, I effed up, is it too late? But seriously read it, I really want help and advice.

Edit 1: Ok guys really sorry for the long delay but I wanted a chance to open communications and try stuff and heres what happened. First off I found out that I didn't have any classes with her this year. I decided to try texting and after my first correspondence it didn't look like that same spark was there so I decided to drop it. 
         However after I texted her getting some homework info it seemed like it had returned. Then when I caught a couple glimpses of her at school I could notice her returning the looks, but I couldn't tell if it was like ""Hi!"" or like ""oh sh*t there he is gtg."" Anyway what I need is advice on how to get to talk to her without being in her classes, 'cause I do fine in those situations and I feel like I can hold my own while texting, but I don't know how to handle that. (And no one tell me that I need to treat her like any guy because that has its time and place and this isn't one of them (and btw when I see a guy friend I'll say something like ""yo homie where the fuck were you just now."") and I don't think that works so well with girls).",,False,,t5_2s4kl,1345681567.0,,,True,t3_xrkpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xrkpd/a_pretty_girl_flirted_with_me_i_didnt_ask_her_out/,

I'll keep it brief.  I'm a vibrant, outgoing person who's in love with life and humans in general.  I've been overweight my whole life, though, until I recently lost almost 130 lbs.  I've had a couple of boyfriends, I dated a bit when I was all cool and spinning vinyl for hipsters a ways back, but other than that, I am ridiculously green in dating department.  So, so green...  It's been a long time.  But, I'm feeling good and have my mojo back.

A guy I've thought was adorable for ages asked me on a date.  I'd only spoken to him a few times, but each time I""d see him I'd think, ""Ah...  Well, yes.  He's quite pleasing...""  So, I suggested he come to an awesome dance party I go to once a month.  He couldn't because of a prior plans, but he did ask me out.  He asked me on a Sunday and said he'd text me later with the location for our date on Thursday.  It got to be the day before, and I hadn't heard from him.  But instead of being worrier-weirdo-needy-girl, I figured I'd wait.  Later meant the afternoon before the date.  All good.

The date was awesome.  Pub first, but due to a melodramatic girl with a guitar, we mosied to his porch.  Great conversation, listened to tons of music - never a dull moment.  He about died when I had to see his apartment to use the bathroom.  Then, he suggested mindless TV, WHICH turns out was an adorably lame way to have an excuse to cuddle with me.  Commence makeout.  Super fun, aside from the fact I had a total Bridget Jones moment because I was wearing Spanx.  Baller.  He did say something about me being done kissing him yet, and I couldn't tell if he was being cheeky or was actually tired of it.  He didn't seem like it, so...

I fell asleep cuddled up to him for a while, walked me to my car, kiss goodbye, ba-dum-ching.  

There was a little back &amp; forth, but no plans made right away.  I sent him a message saying how much I adored a band he'd had me listen to more (shameful I hadn't yet), and he said it was a great time.

Then, I went on a bike ride around my city.  I was riding home from friends' and had to pass his house, but I wanted to avoid it for some reason, so I went to turn.  I blew a tire pretty much right outside his house, so I grabbed my bike, started huffing it, and ended up running into him a block down the street.  He said I should've called and gave me a ride home.  Chat, chat, nice, nice, etc.  I mentioned that now that I've gotten promoted I wanted to go somewhere for dinner that's really yummy just because I can.  Before I got out of the car, he said to let him know where I decided I wanted to go.

Little bit of texting - maybe one or two every couple days.  

Friday I texted and said I'd be busy for a while, but I really would like to see him again.  He said, yeah - I'll be busy for 4-5 days.   But I started getting antsy and I HATE texting.  So, I called.  He was busy.  He really is busy - he's consumed by his work, which I actually find very attractive.  He's incredibly driven and passionate about what he does.

Anyway - Wednesday the 4th he said he'd call back after a family event, but I decided, ""Screw it!  I'm going to be spontaneous and see if he wants to hang out in my friends' front yard and watch fireworks, etc.""  No answer, no word from him since.  

The couple of people I've spoken to about it have said, that's just how he is; he takes forever to get in touch.  He's consumed by his job, so you'll just have to be okay with maybe being a bit more direct/trying harder, etc.  But, I don't know.  If he were into me, I'd think he'd have asked me out by now.  

Should I just not bother anymore?  I loathe ambiguity.  A bit of clarity would be lovely, but I don't foresee it.

We met online and the first thing that I knew about him is that his profile specifically said that he was not interested in any kind of relationship/ commitment.  I am looking for one, but I'm in no rush, so I figured when we went on our first couple of dates - *ok, whatever, I'll just hang out with this cute guy for a little bit while I was still seeing other guys, no big deal*.  But since then, we've become intimate, we get together at least a couple of times a week and I stay over every time we see each other (we still go on dates, he takes me out, etc.), we've established that we really like each other/ enjoy each others company, he texts me constantly, and, to be honest, it's come to a point where I don't really have time to date other people.  BUT, he and I both still check our profiles regularly.  And, it bothers me that he does so I'll be completely honest with you, I'm really not even sure if I'm checking mine just to see if he's been on or if I'm actually checking to see who else is out there and I *know* that I'm being ridiculous snooping like that. 

Beyond that my friends are starting to drive me crazy asking if we've DTRed yet.  They make me feel like it's crazy that we haven't done that yet but I do think it's really soon and I never thought that it would go in that direction when I met him (considering what his profile said).  At this time, if I found out he was seeing other people, though, and especially if he was sleeping with other people (and to clarify I always use protection because we have not established that we are monogamous), it would definitely hurt my feelings.  I know I've put myself in a position where I can't really get upset and technically he wouldn't be at fault if he was doing so, but knowing that has definitely made me realize that I think I may be developing feelings for him. 

But, I'm scared to have a talk with him.  I mean, the first thing that I knew about this guy before I got to know anything else about him was the fact that he is NOT looking for a relationship.  So my question is this: how do I reach some sort of clarity with this guy?  Is it even worth it or should I just continue to try to see other people considering the fact that I already knew he wasn't seeking a relationship?

[M/24] She [F/20] Not dating yet, but might.

We start chatting via reddit for a while, I give her my info/pics, she grudgingly gives me 1 obscure one of hers, and no contact info. Then after about a day or two she wants to call me. I'm kinda nervous since I suck on the phone, but I go ahead and do it anyway. We talk for a solid 2 hours. Well, I do most of the talking because she's extremely quiet, but I get her to laugh a lot and so I think all is going well.

More texting over the following days, then she wants to do a video chat. We start chatting, again with me doing the vast majority of the talking, and then she asks if it's ok if she just gets naked. ""Um...yeah, sure, I guess so....*gulp*"" 

So she and I continue talking while she's massaging her breasts *just* below the frame on the webcam (I think she planned this). In my horny guy mind I think ""maybe if I make the first move, she'll reciprocate..."" So I walk across my room with only a shirt on. She doesn't say anything.... I ask. She says she missed it, and she makes a fuss about it like she's disappointed.

I reply with ""well...if you really want to..."" but she counter's that no, she's fine, but at this point my lesser mind is worked up and so later I do it again. This time she gets pissed, but doesn't say anything about it. As a matter of fact, she doesn't say much of anything at all, until I say that I'm heading to bed.

I text her afterwards asking if something was up, and she explained how she was upset with me for flashing her. I feel horribly ashamed and apologize, tell her that I'm not going to make excuses for it, etc. 

She replies with simply ""ok."" So I write her off as gone. No big deal, I really honestly don't mind being alone at this point in my life, but I'd really like sex. But whatever.

Two days passes and she texts me ""So I understand why I'm not talking to you, but why are you not talking to me?""

I told her that I figured it was over, that I wasn't the type to go bothering people, and it didn't upset me one way or the other if we continued to talk or not.

I think this confused her because maybe she's used to guys desperately begging for her attention? I got the feeling that she wanted me to beg for her attention too, but I wasn't going to do that. She then got irrated with me that I wasn't complimenting her enough, despite the fact that I said I thought she was cool and attractive.

She said she still wants to talk to me, but that she's worried because she in unable to say ""no"" to anything physical, and she's afraid I'll go to far and ruin everything, since that's what has happened to her in the past.

I told her ""look. I need you to communicate with me. I need a verbal ""no"" if something makes you uncomfortable. I don't want to do something, thinking you're enjoying it, only for you to tell me later that you weren't.""

It just feels like a guilt trap. She claims to be really aggressive sexually and that once she starts she can't stop, but I don't want that to suddenly turn around and be a ""Why did you do that to me? I didn't want that despite all the other signals I was giving you"" kind of thing.

So on one hand, we have a good looking person who's pretty interesting, despite difficulty with conversations, who is pretty aggressive sexually (which I like), but then on the other hand, she might be crazy and she lives 2 hours away.

My gut is telling me back away, but other parts of my body are saying forward. :-\

I think that I have a well-rounded personality.

I'm considered to be quite loud and outgoing - I'll say whatever is on my mind, I'll make dirty jokes with the boys, I'll play wingman for my male friends.. But I balance that out with gossip time with my girls, shopping, and taking care of my body (gym, nails, wax, hair, etc.).

Perhaps I intimidate men? Perhaps they don't like that sometimes I take charge? Perhaps I'm not nerdy enough for the nerdy guys, not hipster enough for the hipster guys, not arty enough for the arty guys, or not funny enough for the funny guys?

Either way, I have **no** trouble making friends, or talking to men - I just find that 99% of the time I immediately get friendzoned, and if I *were* to express my feelings towards someone they usually let me down gently with a *""..I hope we can just be good friends..""*

What am I doing wrong?

Sometimes I feel that being loud, being confident, and sometimes being a little aggressive means that I lose my femininity and are therefore less attractive for men.

So I’m dating this guy, we’ve been on 3 dates so far. We’re both in our mid 20s. He’s Mr. Perfect for me, I can’t put it any other way. The first date went really well, but it was about 10 days until we went out again. I asked him out once and he told me he was busy and then he asked me out and I was busy. We finally managed to meet. The second date, it was also amazing and pretty romantic. We talked and then we went for a walk but he didn’t make a move on me. He texted me that night telling me it was great. The next day, he called me to meet again. We met again and it was really sweet, we talked laughed and held each other and fondled each other.  Our conversations were great, he was interested in me, my plans, everything about me. He talked about some of his emotional problems in the past and also about his childhood, we really connected emotionally. He made a lot of compliments and he didn’t miss a chance to touch me. He didn’t kiss me despite the HIGH level of intimacy, he told me he was shy (he’s a bit inexperienced I guess and it’s been a long time since he went on a date). 

He did tried to put his hands all over me(we hugged, he played with my hair, held my hand, held me, even touched my breasts at some point while we were hugging and caressing each other ). But he continuously talked whenever our faces were close to each other. And I don't mean talking like a normal person, he was rambling about stupid unconnected things(like the paint on the ceiling, his hairdresser and bureaucracy) in this weird nervous voice. So I guess he might have been shy. He even insisted to come to my place but I had some problems with my flatmate at that moment so I explained to him why and we decided we will go another time (this happened at the beginning of the date). I gave him a hug at the end of the date, it seemed the proper thing to do. 

Now let me give you some information about my interaction with him. He’s really sweet in person, but when we chat or talk on the phone he’s very telegraphic. I understand some men are like that, but there’s a big, big difference and I would expect at least one message from time to time saying how are you. Two days ago I asked him out and he told me that he couldn’t talk because he was busy. Later I found out he was at this big event and he really couldn’t talk. I agonized for one day and told myself that I shouldn’t call him. Today he sends me this funny picture without even telling me anything.  He often did that in those 10 days we didn’t met, either randomly telling me something or sending me funny pictures. 

He’s also pretty jealous, which doesn’t really make sense since we’re not even together but he’s very inquisitive about other men in my life and he even went a little overboard when we met for our second date and I was with a friend. On the second date I just had lunch with a friend before and he called me and we met. My friend waited with me because he was meeting another person in the same spot. It was really funny when my date came and after meeting the friend he started acting very jealous. On our last date he was very curious when I got texts from people and he often commented about me getting a lot of long messages (he leaned to read my messages which was also a bit weird). He also asked me about different men I have casually talked about (friends or colleagues) and was really interested if I liked them in some way or not. 

Anyway, the thing is that, despite being pretty jealous and acting like a boyfriend almost, he hasn’t gave me an answer when I asked him to go out two days ago. I have no idea if he’s interested in me or not, or he’s just a weird guy. Maybe he's playing hard to get? I mean, I get a lot of attention from a lot of guys and he knows that and he also knows I don't really like guys who give me too much attention because we talked about it before our first date (we chatted about 12 hours before we met because we met online).

So what should I do next? Wait for him to ask me out? Ask him out again? I've been getting a lot of attention lately and it's pretty depressing that every other guy is interested in me, besides him. But I don't feel like dating other guys either because I really like him. 

I will apologize in advance for my grammar mistakes. English is my second language and it's also very late. 

TL;DR Went with a guy on three dates, didn’t kiss me but there was a lot of intimacy, now he’s been semi-ignoring me and I’m confused.

Here goes the story. I've known this girl for almost three years; I met her in class and thought she was highly attractive, quiet, and very down-to-earth. I was able to introduce myself and visit with her shortly thereafter, by which I found out she was dating a guy somewhat steady for almost two years at this point. They were living together, and she seemed somewhat happy from what I could tell. 

Not wanting to come in between their relationship, I left it at that, but made sure to say hi or visit with her whenever I saw her on campus. I didn't want to debase my own conscience with trying to compete with some other guy, and knew I wouldn't be able to trust her if she fell for it. I added her as a friend on Facebook after we shared a second class together the next semester, and gradually found out that she was having problems with her boyfriend's lack of motivation to complete his college degree, among other things. Still not wanting to be a douchebag, I filed this away in my memory and made a mental note to see if her status ever changed. 

Over the next two semesters I would see her occasionally, and for a little while that year she and I had a good Facebook conversation (She made a comment about something on her wall, I responded, and resulted in a huge conversation) that resulted in me talking about a TON of my past. She continued to act the same around me whenever I said hi to her later that semester, so I decided that I hadn't freaked her out or anything, and then I left it at that.

Last semester (fall 2011) I found out that her boyfriend asked her to marry him, and they decided on a long engagement (around two years, go figure). We both graduated in December, and I moved on from the college setting into an entry level position in a local firm; she stayed on campus studying for the GRE so she could apply to grad school in the fall. I didn't see her after that (because I wasn't on campus), and so that was that.

A week ago, I noticed her status updates on Facebook were very depressing. After investigating, I found that she and her fiancé were separated/broke up; I sent her a message expressing my sympathy and asked if she was doing okay. She was, and in the resulting conversation over the past week, I found out that she had pretty much cut ties completely, moved out of his place in a few hours, and had no compunctions against a future without him; she expressed her plans over the summer and fall semester, and he wasn't in them. This leads me to believe her boyfriend cheated on her with another woman (I only can hypothesize, as I didn't ask, and have no evidence); not much else would have made her cut ties so quickly, IMHO.

So, I've never had much experience in dating; I had two girlfriends prior to this when I was 21-22 (my home life when I was a kid was F***ed up and I didn't learn things other teenagers learn until later), and had gone out on a few dates with a handful of other girls up to this point (23-present). I guess I'm picky. I've never been too terribly good with timing, and hate the thought of screwing this up because I didn't have the patience or know-how to wait for a better time; however, I would literally rather shoot myself in the foot than let some other guy go after her because I was too much of a pussy to take a chance. 

So, my question is this: assuming, based upon when the depressing Facebook updates started, that she and her boyfriend broke up in mid January, how long should I wait to go say hi and ask her out to a cup of coffee and start to invest in her?

I was planning on swinging by sometime early this week, but based upon suggestions in this thread, I am open to amending my plans. Thank you all in advance.

Raised Catholic, grew up on a farm, love big ideas, dave barry, garage rock, studying computer science. Never been in a relationship, kinda shy. I realize this next part is vague but getting at the truth and pursuing justice are important to me. To be more concrete, I liked philosophy because it seemed to be a search for truth, and I wanted to join the FBI or be a lawyer to protect people's rights. Also, I'm not overweight, and I'm not bad-looking, just to cover those bases.

Who I'm interested in: A smart, aggressive, independent guy who is good (good is a lame adjective, but I don't mean ""nice"", maybe honorable/virtuous?), free-thinking, funny, and grounded. 

The Problem: I get a lot of guys I'm not interested in, and I don't like leading them on, or hurting their feelings. Sometimes I catch myself subconsciously being unfriendly so I don't have to deal with either of the above options. (I know this is BAD.) When I do find someone I like, they don't seem interested. I can't figure out if it's because I'm not friendly enough, or not girly enough, or that me liking them a lot makes me seem desperate. Any ideas? Don't hold back.

You guys gave some spot on advice and needed affirmation, so thank you so very much for that.  Also, I'll go ahead and add ages to this one too:  we're both 25.

I just got back from spending two days with the girl I love.  We had a great time together and we spoke of many things:  the past, distant friends, recent history and, most importantly, the future.

She says she's leaving her boyfriend.  To frame what I'm about to say, I'll remind you that I was initially unsure about my decision to admit my love for her.  I did tell her that I love her, and that I always have.  It was something I had to get off my chest, and I explained that to her openly.  We talked about it again yesterday, and she assured me in no uncertain terms that my admission did not affect her judgment at all.  She is almost certain that she wants to leave him and has been mulling it over since before I ever came back into the scenario.  So there's that.

The way she detailed her intended course of action to me, I'm left with the distinct impression that we will be together sometime probably sooner than later.  It's still a very complicated situation, as I spent a lot of time with both her and her boyfriend over the last two days and he's actually a pretty cool guy.  I can definitely see how she could date him for as long as she has, and odds are that once they break up he's still going to be a part of her life.

So here's my worst-case projection based on what I learned over the last two days:  I show up out of nowhere, inexplicably, and enter into this girl's life again.  I come around and show her a great time while her boyfriend is at work.  Pretty soon, she's gonna drop him and probably soon after that she's going to get with me.  

If it looks and acts like a duck, well, I'm the kind of guy to say that it's probably a fucking duck.  So is her boyfriend.  

The point at which I have to make some pretty important decisions seems to be approaching rapidly.  I don't want to influence anything in her current relationship, but if she does end up severing her ties with him then I do have the responsibility of making sure the timing is right for us to be together.  I don't want her to run away from this guy and right into my arms, but I'm uncertain about my resolve on this.

Realistically, I've been waiting for something like this to happen for years.  If we meet the very day after she breaks up with him and she says she's ready to explore the possibility of us, well, I'm pretty sure any discretion I'm planning to employ will be set ablaze and thrown violently from the nearest window.  I'm very conscious of the fact that it's probably a terrible idea, but I'm also incredibly aware of my own shortcomings.  I tend to fly balls first into most every situation life throws at me.

I have a lot of things to consider now.  We live about an hour away from one another and I now know she's planning to leave her boyfriend.  She wants me to come back as soon as possible to hang out with her, and I can do that.  Should I?  Or should I back off for a while and maybe just talk to her on the phone for a couple of weeks?  If she does leave him, does it really matter how much time passes before we come together?  Part of me thinks people will think the same thing either way.  

A confrontation with her boyfriend at some point has now become a realistic possibility.  He does not appear to have any clue as to what's going on right now, and we're cool with one another.  What could possibly come of it should he approach me?  Should *I* be proactive and approach *him* at some point?  Should I invest in a kevlar vest, possibly a helmet?  

**tl;dr - Girl I love told me she's leaving her boyfriend and that she has always been curious about the prospect of being with me.**

I also find myself being jealous when she talks about her other guy friends, when she talks to ex-boyfriends, etc.

I am: M(24) 
Her: F(24)

About myself
----------------

-I've never had a serious relationship, nor sex w/ anyone.

-I've only asked out 1 person ever(not her) 6 years ago.  I was rejected &amp; lost this person in my life.

-I have been asked out, to hook up, and to fool around by other girls occasionally, but politely decline (edit:due to lack of interest in hook-ups or flings.)

-I'd like to maintain my own dignity for myself &amp; ""that special person"" I let into my life out of respect.

-I see relationships as an emotional connection above all else. Sex is secondary &amp; not a must.

-I would never think of using anybody or form a relationship just for sex.

-I'd consider myself a good person, but not a ""nice guy"".

-I am a very confident, outgoing guy all around.

-Despite the above, I am extremly shy, unsure, or fearful even when it comes to expressing feelings of love/caring.

-I am a non-vocal Atheist w/ a strong concience that doesnt mock those who choose to believe/practice. I only say I am when asked, &amp; nothing more.

-If it is relevant, I am by no means out of shape, very hygenic &amp; neat.

------------
About Us
------------

-We have been friends for close to 7 years. She's been my closest friend for 5 of them.

-I never viewed her as more than a friend until the past year or so.

-I would be content remaining as we are now if the feelings were 1-way.

-Our discussions have taken more personal tone in the past several months.

-The most I have done recently as far as expressing myself is telling her she's one of the few people I truly care about, she's the most important person in my life aside my father* &amp; Idk where I'd be without her at times. None of which weirded her out, &amp; I meant it all. This is the closest I've come to expressing love/caring.

-Prior to stating the above, I've noticed uncommonly strong presense from her in my personal bubble our last couple outings as well as an acceptance of me returning the contact. 

-Since I stated the above, our next discussions led to her telling me things she admires about me.

-I am scared of missing my chance to be with someone I've been blind to for so long that's come to mean more to me than anyone else. 

-I am even more scared by the idea of losing her presense in my life by telling her. 

*my father-the only family I have not severed ties with due to unrelated occurences.

-----------------------
Other details
------------------------

-A close personal friend of hers mentioned she says nothing but good things when I come up in their talks.

-A mutual guy friend, mentioned to me that he's be able to see us go far together not knowing I have feelings for her.

-Also w/o being aware my interest in her, my personal friends insist she has interest in me after bringing her out w/ me a couple times. I am unable to see these signs for myself though.

-When I do mention her around my personal friends, i've had nothing but good things to say of her. One of my friends mentioned this to her &amp; she seemed to really apprecate it.

TL;DR
-------------

 I have fallen for my best friend. I am unsure how to  find out if the feeling is mutual w/o scaring away the one that means most to me.

I have normal hearing up until ~1.5 kHz, where my hearing drops off like a rock - in other words, I have normal low-frequency hearing, but am completely deaf in the mid-high frequencies. Needless to say, the immediate consequences of this unfortunate fact is that I can hear guys fine, but unless I'm lipreading, I usually cannot hear girls at all due to higher pitched voices. And yeah, I've had girls ask if I was gay once they knew this, and to be honest, I wish I was; it would save me a lot of grief when it comes to relationships.

A bit of background information: I've been in two 'relationships' before, both of which didn't last long (~one month). I suspect not being able to really talk on dates (you can't always go to a quiet, solitary place where lipreading is easy) was a contributing factor, along with the fact that, well, given my situation I obviously haven't had much socialization in girl stuff.

I'm stuck with bad hearing for life; according to doctors in three countries, I'm not eligible for a cochlear implant, and if my hearing aids worked as they should I wouldn't be having this problem. Furthermore, I've been brought up in the hearing world, so I haven't had the option to meet deaf girls. Just think about how many deaf people you know, and then how many of these deaf people you'd date. Yeah, same here.

Anyhow, I'm having trouble overcoming the aforementioned physical barrier when meeting girls. I already know that I'm funny/attractive/intelligent, and being deaf I'm acutely aware of body language, so I'm pretty sure I come off as a confident person. The problem is, most social situations take place amidst lots of background noise, where I'm forced to shut down regardless of what I do.

I know the obvious solution is to meet people in quiet, study situations, but I'm entering my fourth year as a bio major and not many people make it this far; those that do are more concerned about actually studying than hooking up. I've talked to my shrink and my friends about this, but their solutions are variations of 'be more social...' but I don't have a problem with being social (at least as long as I'm the one doing the talking), I just have a problem responding appropriately because of not hearing, or maybe even because I'm still too naive given how much auditory communication I'm missing out on. Or maybe because of the fact that when I try to explain that I'm girl-deaf, girls just find me weird/awkward/gay.

Obviously there's more, but I've tried my best to balance relevant details with the interest of keeping this post at a reasonable length. Is there anything I can do about this, aside from swallowing my pride and turning to online dating? I'm graduating in a year, I'd at least like to experience one decent 'real' relationship before devoting my life to either med school or academic research in one of the loneliest scientific disciplines known to humanity (organic chemistry).

We met about two weeks ago through a mutual friend and I'm (hate to admit it) absolutely smitten by her. She's just so beautiful, sweet, thoughtful, and we have so many shared interests. I haven't dated in a long time because I was so tired of meeting girls that I could never see myself with in the future, and all of the fuss and pain that went with dating and breaking up. Now I'm finally talking with someone who I see a lot of potential in as far as a relationship goes.

We aren't dating yet, I've truthfully been way too passive about asking her out (I'm going to change that soon). We live in different cities, but the drive is no deal for me as I travel a lot for work and wind up in her area several times a week. So far we've spent most of our time talking through text and on facebook. My problem is that I'm so painfully boring on it. In person, I feel like I can be interesting/funny during a conversation, but on facebook I sit around for a minute thinking of a smart/funny/interesting reply to her ""Hey :)"" and all I can come up with is..""what are you up to?"". We've only met in person twice so far, so I don't really know too much about her past those initial convos and I don't know how to segue into conversations about stuff between us since we don't really know each other.

Is the solution as obvious as it seems to me, to quit wasting time and just ask her out to talk in person? I really want to come across as interesting/fun before we go on a date, but it's just not happening.

All fine and dandy, right?

I swear to god, anytime I'm talking to some guy who I think might be showing even the *tiniest* bit of interest, I start getting all nervous and anxious in my head and the normal me goes up in flames. And the sad thing is, generally, I'm pretty sure they're just being friendly. Because when I'm legitimately being hit on, (ex: got eyefucked pretty hard, was oblivious at the time and made a silly face back at them) you couldn't get me to notice the signs if there were blazing neon lights pointing to them.

I've (18) been dating a guy (20) for a few weeks and we get along well, I do find him attractive and we've fooled around a little, but at the same time I'm just not feeling it. I don't know why, but when I think about it just don't want to go any further.

I feel really mean, we haven't said anything specific about the relationship but I met his family before we were dating (I know his siblings) and I've been to his place and he acts as if he wants more.

I don't know what I'm waiting for, I suppose the ""relationship talk"" so that I can tell him that I'm not interested in being his girlfriend but it feels like it would be too late by then.

I feel like a bitch because I went after him but it's early on so it shouldn't be this hard to break it off, I'm just afraid of upsetting people.

Anyway, I'm 100% positive she's into me like I am to her, but I'm still struggling so hard with making moves, even when the opportunity is literally slapping me in the face.

For instance, last night. A group of our friends went out to the town square last night to see a free showing of ET. I didn't get there until the final scenes of the movie though. Anyway, after that we go to a friends place where we start watching Gangster Squad. The movie had barely started and then 4 people clear out, 3 girls and 1 guy, leaving me and my buddy along with my crush and the girl who's house we're at.

So me and my crush are sitting on the same couch, not really touching. As we get comfortable though, she leans in more towards me, to the point that part of her body is actually leaning into my left arm. I immediately knew what I should do; that is, put my arm around her and bring her close. However, I instead puss out and sit there for the duration of the movie letting her simply lean on me without ever making a move.

My buddy had been doing good work and got the lights turned out and kept the mood right for me to comfortably make a move, yet I still couldn't do it. I'm positive there will be more good moments for me to escalate this summer, so I'm not totally devastated by this. But I've been working at this for awhile and the fact that I'm having so much trouble moving forward is seriously beginning to worry me. I know this shouldn't be so hard, but I've got some serious mental blocks that I'm struggling with tremendously to break down.

I plan on seeing her tonight after we play soccer at 7:00. We'll probably be heading out to one of the pools my buddy works at tonight around 10 or 11, so I'm really hoping I can nut up and make something happen tonight if the opportunity presents itself.

P.S. I hate to use alcohol as a crutch, but I'll be drinking tonight where as I was completely sober last night. Hopefully I can get over some hurtles tonight more comfortably if I'm buzzing a bit.

Yesterday he said he would call when it was time/when he was ready to meet me. I haven't heard from him all day.

I think it's only bothering me because I am a planner, I like to have things set out so I know how long I have to do other things/get ready. Also, I do really want to see him and the waiting without knowing how long I will be waiting is killing me.

We see each other almost every day. 

We're coworkers. Sometimes in the mornings when we both work he'll bring me chocolate milk, he knows it's my favorite.

I go over to his house a lot. We always sit on his bed and watch a movie. 

The last two times I've been over there, he held my hand. It was a really slow process both times, like first our hands touch, then a little more, then his is on top of mine, then fingers are intertwined. 

I can be pretty sure he likes me, right? I mean, he wouldn't have held my hand twice if he didn't, right?

Anyway, I'm ready for a little more. I feel like we're stuck at hugs and hesitant hand holding. I don't want to rush into it, but I'd like for him to feel like he can just hold my hand without being slow about it. Maybe actually come out and say he likes me. Maybe a kiss goodnight.

I'm not sure how to go about doing this, though. I mean, obviously if he wants something he wants to take it slow. And he did tell me that he hasn't been with anyone in five years and he feels inexperienced with women.

What should I do? I want him to feel like we can move forward, but I'm hesitant to just move forward myself because I'm afraid that being too bold will scare him off.

We hung out from 7pm to 1am. She took a picture of us together. Watched the whole first season of Weeds. We cuddled on the couch together while watching.

Well I told her my mom was going to be leaving tomorrow so I better get going so I can get up to say goodbye to her. So I got my stuff together, we hugged a couple times before I headed for the door, she stood at the doorway as I was outside... I went for it... I'm a closed eyes kisser so as I made contact I don't think I felt lips.. so I opened my eyes as I leaned back up and she was smiling and I smiled back. Said have a good night and she said bye.

Now I was pretty dang tired by the end of the date and should of probably waited on a kiss.. but it seemed like good opportunity at the doorway. Now I'm wondering if I was just tired and had bad aim, or if she moved her face and gave me cheek.. also by the time I got home I noticed my lips were a bit chapped which I'm not sure how that happened, hopefully she didn't notice.

So yea I like to over-analyze... anyways I texted her today though and she wants to get together again! And she mentions how she wants to buy an MMO that I'm playing so she can play it with me too.

So what do you think reddit? Not sure if I should try a kiss again or not.. she is a bit of the Shy type btw but she is a lot of fun. :)

----------------------------------

**Update:** Asked her on text when she wanted to get together and she just said she can't wait and will let me know when she is free. Also said she is going to be driving up to visit her parents this weekend so probably not this weekend.

What should be my move now?

Edit: Also while waiting to hear from her when we should meet up again, should I be conversational with her through text or not say anything til I hear from her again?

DR.**  me, a 35m forever alone, inexperienced, no girlfriends, finds this wonderful girl 34f through commons friends and work. 

After several months meeting with friends I get to know her a little and I notice its the kind of person I was looking for a long time, after months of emails, and meeting I declared my intentions and got rejected. Can't conceive not being with her, feel like I have focused wrongly all the dating and if I did it right we could be happy together, What could I do now?


So the history is that I started emailing her, talking about common interests, and finally after some tries I managed to be with her alone a few times (for a walk in the park, getting some coffee, went to a concert, etc..). 


The thing is that when we meet alone I was very nervous, so I made an impression of being very serious and maybe I was sometimes too quiet and some awkward silents were had.


Finally after a bit more of a year I finally found the strength to invite her for a picnic (yea she is into that) and she said she was busy with work(I know and she knows I know that is hardly believable), next week I invited get for dinner and she directly said she was really sorry but it wasn't a good idea to meet.


So I did the only thing my heart pointed me to do, I told her we had a big elephant on the room and we should meet in person to acknowledge it, so we meet and I told her I liked her as a woman and as a person, but she said she was really sorry, but that kind of things should happen, and they didn't, not interested.


The thing is that I cannot stop thinking about her a minute (literally, I cant even properly focus, or sleep), I feel as I am not going to find ever that kind of person (I getting older (her too), and this kind of chances are rare or unique), I feel that I can't really give up, but she make it clear she is not interested. 


I feel like we are very similar and compatible souls, that being so shy around her, she hasn't really known me, because I have been too serious and not fun, and not expressing my thoughts around her.


5 days have passed from the rejection, and I am resisting my self of contacting her again so not to seem too needy or desperate (As a matter of fact I really are, but I don't want to scare her away...).


So, what should I do? Should I keep trying to arrange some dates with her, telling her I was too nervous and give me another chance?


Maybe try to keep her as a friend, leaving aside my romantic idea about her I think she has such a compatible personality with me that I can't let her go as a friend?, I  can count with one hand the persons I have meet in 35 years that could fall in that category.
  

Should I meet with her and ask her why she doesn't like me, if she has another person on her mind...?


At this moment, in my head doing nothing and forget about her is not an option (maybe I am wrong?), I rather crash and burn a 100 times on her than let her pass and don't find again a person like her. 


More about her:he is intelligent, has a good heart, we share the same views about politics, religion(or the lack of it)... a bit nerdy, logical-minded.... In the other hand she is a bit chubby so she isn't getting this kind of attention usually (but I like her with all my soul anyway, ohh what a face she has...), and she is vegetarian and I'm not, but I really don't care that much about it


More info about me: Forever Alone, 35M, terribly shy, socially awkward, not a single girlfriend in my life (yea 35M and that, it could put some heavy pressure on me), I am 5.7, 170 lb, so just a bit overweight for my country standards(and working extremely hard on improving), maybe she doesn't like me physically...¿?


Thanks in advance, from the deeps of my tortured soul.


P.S. English it's not my native language, please ignore my grammar errors.

**EDIT:** Thanks everybody for the feedback, I think it its helping me to share my feelings (even if it is anonymously on reddit)

From the current comments I see that everybody agrees that I should move on and don't look back, not even try to stay as friend with her. I will take very seriously your recommendations.

So, 6 years out of a long term relationship, I'm pretty much going on a date in the next week or so.  I haven't had any kind of relationship, hookup, w/e in these 6 years.  A girl I know (work buddies, prolly less then an hour of direct conversation while at work outside of typical work interaction) not so subtly told me that we should hang out sometime, gave me her number (before I could even ask for it...lol)

So I'm going to call her tommorow and set something up (not sure yet what) 

To be honest the last ""date"" I was on was the typical college friends of friends hang out and then the next time you hang out maybe just 4 people, then finally just the 2 of you.  And that was like, uh a decade ago.  So I am COMPLETELY new to the typical ""dating"" scene. 

And tips, things people overlook, or blunders that seem like a good idea at the time to avoid would be great.  

I'm considering something low-key, like a coffee place or something.  Unless someone convinces me here, I would like to avoid a movie.  Something about sitting quiet in the dark watching a movie in a theater not talking at all seems awkward.  /shrug

1)  small town.  not much to do aside from resturants, ice cream places and bars.
2)  how long a drive to the destination is normal? For a first date I would assume a short drive, something local is best, aka less then 10 minutes.  The nearest ""city"" with cooler stuff like comedy clubs, hockey teams etc is a good 35-45 minutes away.

What can I do?,16,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1d1x2j/i_feel_like_hes_losing_interest_what_can_i_do/,"I've been seeing this guy for a few weeks, we met on OKC.  I'm 25, he is 26. At first I wasn't sure that I liked him, but as I got to know him more I realized how much we have in common and how talented and ambitious he is.  Things were pretty passionate at first, and the sex is usually really good.  I asked him a few weeks ago if he might want to be my boyfriend, not necessarily now but in the future maybe, and he responded positively, though not overly-enthusiastically. I told him I wasn't going to seek out dates on OKC anymore.  I know now that that was stupid to do, that I shouldn't have been so easy.

We didn't see each other for a week and a half, and I feel like things are petering out.  We went on a date on Sunday and saw a movie, drove back in silence, then he said he was going to bed and kissed me on the cheek.  I was sick and he didn't want to catch it, but it still didn't feel great.

Sometimes I feel like it isn't easy to talk to him.  Its like I can't think of anything worthwhile to say.  I get nervous that I'm going to say the wrong things and portray myself as a stupid, uninteresting girl.  I have already said some things out of character that I've recanted and it makes me seem flaky and unsure of myself.  He said that his last girlfriend only lasted a few months, and then he just stopped wanting to hang out with her.  Like he would see her call and ignore it.  That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

I don't want to keep seeing him, continuing to meet his friends and get to know and like him better, if that is going to happen with me.  Firstly its a self-respect issue.  I don't want to waste my time waiting around for him, NOT dating other guys because I would feel bad for ""cheating"" on someone who isn't even my boyfriend, who might end up not giving a shit about me.  And that makes me feel shitty and manipulative, and slutty, like I need attention so badly that his isn't enough for me.  The situation is making me feel less confident about myself in general.

The other issue is, what could I possibly do or say to him to figure out how he feels about me WITHOUT making it seem like an ultimatum?  I don't want to push the issue, like,  ""What are we!?"", because it would probably end things there.  I haven't talked to him since Sunday, I'm waiting for him to contact me.  If he never does, I'm going to cry.

And lastly, What can I do to demonstrate that I'm an awesome person that he should want to have as his girlfriend? Because I am awesome, no doubt about that, and I'm pursuing my interests, bettering myself, but it doesn't seem to impress him.  I don't think he has had many meaningful relationships.

Talking to strangers (this idea used to terrify me), doing more fun activities outside the apt and my usual friends, dressing more attractively, ect  ... the thing is I can't seem to get anyone interested enough to actually stick around. 
I am a good person with a good heart for helping others, I have a good physique, I am attractive, I am smart, and I enjoy a good adventure. So what could I be doing wrong? I do live in a very large city full of exciting and beautiful people which can get intimidating at times but it also makes me wonder, with this many people why can I not seem to find anyone interested? 
This desire to be in a relationship is definitely strong right now in my life and something I hope for constantly, but I feel that since I can't seem to find anyone interested my confidence that I have worked hard to build is falling apart again.

I've always been a late bloomer. Started ""dating"" way into my 20s, got stuck with the wrong boyfriends, dated the wrong boyfriends again, etc.

Anyway, I'm recently out of three consecutive long-term relationships (4, 3, and 1.5 years). My boyfriends almost exclusively came out of my circle of friends, and never from traditional ""dating"". I don't get asked out either. As in: Never has a guy actually asked for my number/fb contact in all my life.

While I eventually would like to settle down and marry, right now I'm looking to experience what I've never had -- a ""normal"" dating experience. Just so this doesn't turn into a complete whine -- I don't mind being active, going on dating sites, having a public profile, messaging people, and being direct in talking to guys I'm interested in.

However, when I browse this subreddit, everyone here is so young. I never experienced all those problems, and I never really learned the lessons that come from dating. Most of my potential dating partners, if any exist, will have that experience. I won't, and it kind of scares me. It screams desparation and ""dating virginity"". I'm afraid that a) I won't find anyone whose personality meshes with mine, and b), if I do, that they'll reject me altogether. 

Right now, I've been thinking about going to speed dating events and creating an okcupid profile, just to meet a lot of guys and see. However, some days, I really think I'm too old for this.

In the last class period a few days ago, we were sitting across the room from each other and shared lots of strong eye contact and smiles. When class ended, she and I walked in a group and when I parted from the others, she made an excuse to separate from her friends in order to pick up her car.

I was preoccupied with a meeting I had to attend and was making a bee-line to the location, so I ended up failing to pick up on this, even with a final moment of lingering eye contact when she walked by me. I ended up kicking myself 10 seconds afterwards.

I've worked with her briefly in a group project before, and we've shared a few words, but we're just acquaintances. I added her on Facebook later that night and she accepted. I haven’t said anything to her yet. The thing is, I don't have of phone number (even though I had it months ago, hah) but I really want to see her again outside of class.

I was ""in love"" with one girl five years ago, my senior year of high school. She led me on and then absolutely crushed me. I was depressed for months, even contemplated suicide because the pain was just overwhelming.

I eventually recovered, but I haven't felt anything for anyone since. I mean I'm physically attracted to a lot of girls, but in five years of college I haven't met any I like. I try to sit next to girls in class, but I'm in engineering, so it's like an 8 to 1 guy/girl ratio. I try to join clubs and do things I'm interested in, but again, meet almost zero girls. I try to chat with girls on the bus, in the cafeteria, etc. but it never leads anywhere. My school is so huge it's really really hard to get to know *anyone* well at all. You meet someone and you never see them again. I've tried online dating. I've sent messages to hundreds of women. Maybe a few dozen even respond. It's led to three dates in two years, which were all just meh.

I'm getting so desperate I went out dancing tonight. I fucking hate dancing, but when I go it's like ""where the hell are all these attractive girls out in real life?!"" But it's so loud you can't hear a word anyone says, and how the hell is a skinny, nerdy guy who can't dance supposed to stand out in that crowd?

I wrote up my schedule so I could be in as many of her classes as possible(were in the same major so it's not like I'm taking random courses just because she's in them).  Now a big red flag should be going off here.  It's obvious that I'm desperate for her, and that pretty much means right there it's game over for me.  This is her last semester at school so there's not really enough time for me to completely change my life and get a huge network of friends so that I'm not so dependent on her for feelings of validation and self-worth.  My question is if I should continue talking to her/be friends with her or just ignore her?  I sit next to her in one of my classes so I feel like it'd be awkward if I just started sitting away from her for no reason(apparent to her, that is).  

For example, both of us usually arrive about ten minutes before class starts.  I usually don't talk that much in class because: 

1)I'm afraid people might make fun of me for something I said, so I tend to mumble to minimize the chance of someone hearing me.(Besides the person I am talking to, that is)

2)Small talk is really boring and most of the time I just like to sit in silence.  

Should I try to make small talk with her if in a normal scenario I normally wouldn't?

[25M] here (Warning: long),12,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/176tma/how_do_you_become_sure_about_whether_or_not_to/,"So i used to be in a 4 year relationship. It was my first major relationship and it was an amazing experience. When we met she was 17 and i was 19. There was a level of oneness we shared that was like no other person i've met before. So much love for eachother. I literally thought she was the one i was gonna be with for the rest of my life, and i was okay with that. We were teens growing into young adults and eventually we broke up (at 21f and 23m) because she felt like she needed to get out of her comfort zone, and to be honest i kinda agreed with her, she *did* need that. And i probably did too. I also think there was an element to it where she was curious about being with other people sexually but she didn't want to say that to risk hurting me, who knows. I'm cool with that though because i'm curious too, can't blame her. I guess the flame just flickered out, even though closesness and mutual respect was still there. Then a few months after the break up she is already with someone else and ends up being in an 18th month relationship. This was the most painful and dark period of my life, where i was in a real funk for most of 2011. And that depression made an impact on me as a person i feel.

Anyway fast forward 2 years and 3 months (i feel good these days) and here's the problem: I haven't been able to meet anyone i *really* like yet. There's been flings but nobody has been as breathtaking a connection as my first girl (i've pushed girls who are interested in me long-term-wise away). I find myself missing her when i think about this topic. However here's the kicker: Over the past 4 or so months there's been someone new that has slowly been becoming closer. We had sex for the first time the other night and now things are at a point where we're meeting up on weeknights. She's let it be known she's interested in me. In simple terms - the potential is high that i could make a relationship out of this if i pursue it. The thing is though there's something holding me back. It just doesn't feel as strong as before, i'm not crazy about her. I do like her, she's cool. And sexy. But i'm not head over heels. It doesn't feel as compatible as before. But there *are some* promising signs, but in comparison to last time it sure doesn't feel as ""yep this is the girl, go for it!"" as before. There's also a part of me that is afraid to hurt her down the road once she's become invested, and there's a part of me that sort of wants to sleep around while i'm young and decent looking and try ""all the different flavours"", and learn about sexuality along the way (i *was* in an exclusive 4 year relationship in my golden years after all). I *do* miss companionship, but i'm not sure i want to be ""exclusive"" yet, but at the same time i don't want to let a good thing slip through my fingers. Tricky one!! How do i approach this??  

1. Give it time, spend a bit more time with her, see what happens, and make a decision later.  

2. End it before it starts, if you're not fully convinced now then you never will. You'll only end up hurting her.  
  
3. Go for it, she likes you, you like her, just do it you pussy. It's not like you'll be together forever.  

4. Continue keeping an eye out for new girls. Enjoy single life and one night stands. Get your promiscuous desires out the way while you can. Be honest with her about it too.  

5. Other? (any questions just ask)  

**TL;DR: Used to be in an amazing 4 year relationship. New one possibly on the horizon, good but not as great as before. What do i do?**

I[m27] met this lady [f36] at my job and a few days later we liked each other; I liked her more on the physical level, whereas she had both a physical and emotional attraction. Some time later, she handed me her number and we started communicating on a regular basis, and soon enough we arrange a meet. She was ecstatic.

During that time I find out she is married with 3 kids but is in the process of a divorce (would file in about 5-7 months), yet her husband (who cheated on her, thus the reason for divorce) still stays with her at her place. Since we both had a few drinks that night, I tried to not let the married fact bother me, and proceeded to make out, and that is all, until she had to leave. She could not be happier about how the night went.

During the days that followed we kept in touch but that lingering fact of her being married bothered me. I told her I cannot offer her a relationship and we could stay more on the ""friends with benefits"" level - she was ok with that. This whole time my conscience lingering on the thought as to what should I do - as I have never been with a married woman before - since she wants to get us a hotel room and have a ""perfect night"". 

A couple of days later I decided to tell her over the phone that I do not feel comfortable with the fact that she is married, and would rather prefer being friends until she is single, due to the fact that I have to have respect for certain values and draw the line to prevent myself from becoming a moraless person who would sleep with anyone and ruin another person's life in the process for mere moments of pleasure. She accepted and hung up. Later, through text, I realized that she did not take this lightly and proceeded to blame me for ruining what we both had, blaming me for not telling her sooner, giving her high hopes, making her feel this way, and lastly that she is severely hurt. I tried to explain everything calmly but to no avail and I felt terrible afterwards. 

My main query is that, what I did, was it the right thing to do? I basically broke someone's heart in order to preserve the sanctity of marriage, did not disrespect her husband and family, and also did not become that person who would sleep with married women. Which is worse, to break someone's heart, or to become a person that has no respect for the idea of marriage?

Just look how often people are advised not to reveal certain things about themselves. Just look how often I read that my virginity is something I have to hide? Or, how I can't ask questions about what the other party is looking for in a relationship too early... How on earth does anyone move beyond this phase? 

In short, I really wish I could just have an arranged marriage or supervised courtship. Since neither of those are possibilities in modern secular Western culture, how does anyone forge a trust with the person they are seeing? Is there any way to make this easier if you are seeking a lasting relationship?

1357093502.0,12,self.dating_advice,15sw9a,I don't want to be a homewrecker...,13,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/15sw9a/i_dont_want_to_be_a_homewrecker/,"I [24m] have been friends with this guy for a few months. When I first met his wife [26f], I noticed that she was attractive but didn't really interact with her much. A few weeks ago, we were at a party and it ended up being me and her making a trip to the store. We happened to have really good chemistry together and hit it off. After joking around for a while we got to more serious topics and she started telling me about some problems in her marriage and how she has caught her husband cheating on her over and over (4 or 5 times that she caught him).

I did a pretty good job of making her feel better (I think) and lighten the mood, but somehow this led to me acting uncharacteristically super confident and forward. I was saying stuff like ""Oh I already know you're into me, it's just a fact"", just joking around since I didn't actually believe it or expect anything to happen. But suddenly we were kissing, and I realized that she actually IS into me. We had to get back to the party and it didn't go further than that.

Since then, whenever we are in the same location we spend our time ogling each other and trying to steal moments to ourselves (not with an opportunity to do anything physical, just to flirt). Luckily there's no awkwardness and we seem to be able to play it cool.

Now here's the factoid that makes this situation a bit more important to me: I'm a virgin. I had reasonable amounts of female attention in high school, but outside of a few squandered opportunities it's been pretty dry since then. I've always been sociable/able to make friends and I consider myself to be moderately good looking, but obviously the continual lack of action has hurt my confidence. Being able to attract this gorgeous (married) woman using fake confidence turned it into real confidence. For some reason I find it very easy to be smooth/confident/sexy/flirty around her.

I am aware that part of the reason that she is attracted to me is probably because it's ""forbidden"" and a subconscious desire to ""get back"" at her husband. 

Last night was new years eve and everyone was having a good time. It seemed like we were looking for an excuse to have some time alone together, but it couldn't be done. I don't know what might have happened if we did. I thought we weren't being too obvious, but someone there told me that all night she had been ""looking at me lustfully"". Since then I haven't been able to get her out of my mind.

I'm not asking for advice on how to hook up with this girl (even though I really really want to). The guilt and the consequences of being caught would be disastrous. What I am asking is a) how do I manage my feelings for this girl, and b) how do I learn to apply the confidence I seem to have around her in other situations?

Thanks for reading, I have never been anywhere near this type of situation so all comments and thoughts are appreciated.

And she isn't afraid to initiate hanging out with just the two of us either.

I decided that I want to go for her.  I told a friend of hers and she basically told me to roll with it and see what happens.  There are too many what-if's in my head and I want closure, so that's why I decided to man up and go for it.

In September i met a new girl (21F) at a club. We basically liked each other the moment we saw us and we had sex on the second ""date"" (we met at same club the next night).  
I didn't see much future with her because of that, but she was a little clingy and stuff, which was OK with me, because this somehow reassured me that she might really be into me. That first week we spent a lot of time together, got to know each other better and met some of her friends etc... all good. 

About 2 months into the relationship with her, she often comes and spends the weekends at my place (i live in a big city, she doesn't). I've noticed she gets text messages from guys, had a quick glance and see guys names. 
One time, she got a call while we were having dinner, she ignored the phone call. she usually ALWAYS picks up even during dinner. Also last weekend she got a text from a guy at 6am!
I asked her about the text at 6am, but she says he is and all the texts are from friends. It still is a little worrying for me...

About two weekends ago, we went out partying at her favorite club. So we were all having a good time and i saw her go to DJ, when some random guy talks her up, so they are striking up conversation -my girl has her back to me but knows i can see her-... when that guy goes for the ass grab. She didn't instantly pull his hand away nor did i see her get pissed off at him. She did take his hand away but not how i would of liked it. i got angry but thought it best to let her deal with it. I decided to go to the bathroom before doing something stupid.  When i left they were still chatting. 
I come back, shes back inside her circle of friends. Not 5 minutes pass and this guy comes back again and grabs her by the hand and wanted to pull her with him...i have to say i was a little tipsy by then, so i did a mistake. I stood up and grabbed her away from him, sat her down and asked her what the deal with that guy was... big discussion set off and stuff, my mind rushed to all the other nights she has been out alone, etc... she told me she had pulled his hand away and told him she had a BF. but in my opinion she didn't do it clear enough. otherwise this guy would have never dared to just grab her from a group of girls with him. my point was she didn't make it clear to that guy and blow him off instantly. 

how do i trust her now? i do like her, but she's young and these kind of things make me worry a lot.  I will be going away for xmas for two weeks and my mind keeps thinking crazy things.



TL;DR: Dating a girl for 3 months, she keeps getting texts from guys and one call while with me. got her ass grabbed at a club while with me, didn't blow the guy off instantly. I have trust issues now.

Please help.,12,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/13eh8m/confused_if_shes_interested_in_me_anymore_please/,"I met this girl at work in the beginning of the year. Initially I sense there was a mutual attraction. She always accepted my invitations to go out, gave me nicknames, touched my arm, etc. We went out just the two of us on a few dates, but I never made a move (yes, I know). 

This was going on for about 8 months then her birthday was approaching and i asked her out and before we said our goodbyes that night I confessed to her that i liked her, but she rejected me saying that she has been hurt in the past and was not ready for a relationship. A few days later I found out that she had gone back with her ex. She never told me that she was with her ex and has never really talked about other guys except her exes during conversation if it relates to the topic. 

They broke up three months later and since then she still has given me signs that she might be interested in me. She planned a thanksgiving event just the two us where we are going to volunteer in a soup kitchen. 

The things that now got me confused is we went to happy hour with some of our coworkers last Friday. We rode together and when we were heading to the bar she was laughing at all my stupid jokes, touching me and asked me if i liked her new nails. As we get to the bar she starts talking to this other guy at work(we'll call him Jack) and was giving him a lot of attention. They were dancing together and having a good time. While we were at the bar out of no where she mentions that her dentist is very polite and would marry him. I wasn't sure if she was trying to make me jealous or what? At one point during the night she takes off her coat to give it to Jack cause he was not wearing a jacket and it was a bit chilly. I'm very confused by her mixed signals. She knows that I have been interviewing for other jobs and when I told her that I might get an offer from this company, she sent me a text later that night that she does not want to see me go and that she doesn't want me to leave her alone. I pressed her for an answer, but she didn't say why. The other day she mentions that a friend whom he has had a crush on her called her to meet up, but that she isn't interested in him like that.

I confused as to whether she is trying to make me jealous by talking to other guys. She never talks about guys she likes or problems that she has had with her exes. I don't know if I was put in the friendzone or not.

tl;dr girl from work I have a crush is sending me mixed signals and I don't now if she has lost interest and put me in the friendzone or is trying to make me jealous by talking and flirting with other guys.

We go out to eat and then we go for the jog all the while having random conversation about our lives, places we worked, school, and it all goes great!

He didn't tell me what but I can only assume the worst, he told me that she told him something really personal and it seems like she might be caught up with an ex flame.

Nothing has really happened between us romantically. I was getting kind of concerned and asked her about her story. She told me that her last three relationships ended very badly and just wasn't ready yet. She told me that she wants to commit 100% into a relationship but she cant do that because she needs to work on her issues before she lets anyone in. 

For me this was a red flag and move on but then she said, ""I don't want you to feel like i'm stringing you along and everything that I told you was 100% the truth"". She also told me (never asked) that she hasn't had sex in the last 6 months that she has been dating. To top it off this was around the same time she told me that she was moving to Chicago for a job that pays really well. I was sad but at the same time, she was happy and who am I to stop her. So we went out a lot the last 2 weeks that she was here and had more of these ""great times"".

Then we basically ended it as friends (she does want to put me through a LDR) and we where pretty mutual about it. Before she said goodbye, she handed me a hand written note with every date that we went on together, even the important details like times when she laughed and what was going on. At the end of the note she states that ""not keeping in touch is nonnegotiable"". 

Now I normally don't get like this about a girl that I was dating but I'm at a crossroads because, I like her. I know that she has commitment issues from these past relationships. I also know that we both are going to see other people just because of the long distance situation. 

**So my main question is: If I go and visit her in Chicago** (I have never been) **can I rebuild the attraction like how it was before she moved? At the same time how will I know she is ready to go down that path before taking the trip? And is there also something I can do to keep me in mind when she is up there?**

-Thanks alot guys. This one seems very complex. This type of situation hasn't come up in the past for me.

i'm a 24 year old male young professional in an urban setting. used to drink frat-boy style in college, recently quit, at least for now, for a number of reasons:

* health
* avoidance of hangovers
* experimentation
* **alcoholism in the family:** the primary reason. it is a current, serious problem.

i haven't had a sip since march. i've still been going out to bars and whatnot on the weekends, although not EVERY weekend, and i'm working on learning to be outgoing and playful, without alcohol. when i go to bars at night, i just like to give them a nice dollar or two tip with my ginger ale, so i don't feel like i'm bad for business.

unfortunately this has made me a bit unsure of myself in the dating world. now i know at the end of the day if a girl isn't OK with my sobriety, she isn't the girl for me, but i get nervous on what to reveal on early dates. i don't want to unload all kinds of family crap on them obviously.

further compounding the problem, i like 'drinks' dates, or at least i like to stop at bars and grab a drink on a date. coffee shops are so quiet. bars are a little louder, a little darker, you move around a little bit more, you can sit right up next to her, it's good atmosphere. 

so basically, what i want to do is:

&gt; me: ""hey, do you want to stop at this bar and get a drink?""

we go inside, sit down

&gt; me: ""I'll have a ginger ale please""

but what i'm afraid of happening at this point is the bartender, or the girl, asking all kinds of questions about it and me feeling weird about it, and feeling weird about not giving the bar any money, and just feeling all weird in general.

also I should note, I don't have any problem with her drinking, and i realize that 99.9999% of my dating pool and social pool will in fact drink. but she'll probably feel weird drinking if i'm not and now the whole date has a weird vibe, all the momentum lost.

So on Monday night, I stopped by Jane's place and hung out for a bit drinking. Now I should mention beforehand she told me she'd surprise me with a kiss (told me this days before Monday).

Time passed and it got late, and I was still a bit drunk. She offered me to stay over... so I accepted. Eventually we go to bed, and as I'm about to crash on the couch she then gives me a kiss on the forehead (wut) saying there's the promised kiss. She then decides that rather than her sleeping in her bedroom down the hall, she'll crash near me in the same room.

I take notice of this and eventually offer her company, and she accepts. We sleep together (no sex, wasn't all for that at the time anyway since we were both drunk and didn't want her waking regretting something) and I woke multiple times to find her embracing me.

Morning comes and there's no awkwardness, all is well. What do you think about this situation? Should I continue my advances? I should mention we have mutual friends (including an ex of hers) and if I start dating her... I don't know if some friends may react positively.

I'm stumped. 

The general consensus seems to state that I'm not supposed to go looking for a girl. I'm supposed to let it happen. If I'm interested in finding a relationship, it's seen as being desperate. I can't be too forward lest I'll scare a girl off because it comes off as being desperate, and/or there's no challenge for her. 

I'm supposed to do my own thing and then I'll magically have a girl fall in my lap apparently. Forgive me if I'm a little jaded, I haven't been on a date in months. 

If I follow said advice, I'm not going to meet a girl. I work in a extremely male dominated work place (less than 1% female, I work for an engineering consulting firm). As for my hobbies, airsoft and video games. The only girls that play airsoft are the girlfriends of guys who play. As for video games, that's pretty anti-social and I don't see how I'd find someone through either of my two main hobbies. 

I'm pretty introverted and a homebody. I've been going out and doing social things a lot recently, but my main motivation of doing so is the hopes of meeting a girl. I don't hang out with my friends all that often (when we do, we're playing games online), and almost every girl is taken and doesn't have friends they think would be a good match for me. I have very little interest in large social gatherings such as festivals, concerts, conventions, and so on. 

I have no idea how to put myself out there without my motivation of being out there make me appear desperate. 

Obviously, I am ""desperate"". I just don't see why it's such a bad thing to want a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm dying for any date, but I'm just not meeting women I'm attracted to both physically and personality-wise. I have a pretty good idea of what I want.

I've had a few LTRs when I was younger, but that was through high school and college. 

So what the hell am I supposed to do here? Online dating hasn't been successful at all. Last date I went on was in March, which was a mistake, but I went on the date anyway. There was no second date. 

**TL;DR - I can't want a relationship otherwise I come off as desperate, but if I don't actively pursue one, I'm not going to be found by a girl.**

In these 2 weeks I have blown off by 3 different people on 3 completely different meeting events. 

Background. Trying online because I live in a small town without any catering whatsoever to a young professional demographic. Yes the larger city is 30 miiles away, so I figure I would try online to expand. I'm a 25m, have a great job and career, dress very decently, and take care of myself and life with a very caring attitude.

So within the past 2 weeks though, I've contacted some different women and arranged for the first dates. I felt very positive about each one, and been my very best self. Yet somehow on all three occasions, blown off. 

All of my messages I would think are normal. No sick humor, immature speak, well written, not at all something a 16 year old would write, or even a scred of disrespectful or malicious tone. All of them I got a phone number after a back and forth of at least 12 messages or so, just to make sure an interest seemed to have built. I asked just to meet a nice coffee shop in the city (but not the one I love the most so I don't go all super guns at once). All seemed great, and just before each date I texted them just a simple quick check to see if we were still on as soon as I got off work (5pm) to meet at 7:30. All were on, yet, non showed.

I just don't know what to say other than how depressed and ill it makes me feel. I've tried hard to try and put myself back, but, nothing. I just don't get it. I did not arrange for anywhere creepy, odd times, and yet all three ghosted away.

It's been a very hard time lately for me. I'm trying not to be hung up on a very great oppurtunuty, but how can I try to get out there with crap like this happening?

So I guess in short, is there something I can arrange better? Be more firm, or am I just really biting a painful trial? I don't want to give up because its been to long and I know very personally this is something I want back in my life.

Awful at attracting women, never done so much as held hands.

So, as a result of this sudden increase in female attention, I want to take things to the next level.

Anyway, one of said women I really like, and I took her out for coffee and it seemed to go really well. Problem is, I don't see any hint of her being attracted to me(which to be fair, no one's ever been attracted to me, so I could just be really bad at picking up signs). And there's also a guy among her friends that she seems to really like a lot(even though they're not dating). 

If she is really attracted to that guy, then me asking her out would just be embarrassing for both of us, not to mention extremely rude for me to try and interrupt her love life. I mean, every girl deserves to have her number one choice. If I'm not up to par, then it's not fair to her if I ask her out. If she says no, it'll be embarrassing for both of us, and if she says yes out of pity it'll be extremely humiliating.

Im about to give up but would like to ask reddit for new options on how to meet ""the one"". 

I'm willing to pay a local matchmaker thousands of dollars but apart from feeling like its a scam they all cater to busy professional types.
I really just want a regular girl who has a job and has time for a real relationship.

I'm wiling to hire a coach but there are none in my city.

I'm willing to try many things but part of my problem is while confident in my career etc I can't just walk up to women and flirt.
I don't have the confidence to hit on women out in the general public.

Should I hire a dating profile writer? Where do I find one?
And is it too late since I've already contacted a lot of the local women on these sites with obviously my bad profile/ messages.

Advice? Help? Professionals? Seriously looking for help here.

Help?",11,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r4466/26m_i_started_dating_this_girl_and_lied_to_her/,"So, I met this girl through mutual friends and immediately hit it off with her. We started talking all the time and began dating. At some point, we very lightly discussed our sexual past. I basically told her that I had been in a few sexual relationships and had a couple one night stands. The truth is that, when I had sex with her for the first time, it was only the 3rd time I had had sex. 



Long story short; I was raised very religiously and basically had my sexuality repressed. I dated my whole life, but with the idea of "" waiting until marriage"". When I shirked my religious beliefs, I obviously wanted to change my sexual history, I just felt soo awkward and behind the curve. I would get black out drunk and basically try to pick up girls. Did it a couple times, but I was drunk and it meant nothing to me other than I felt like I was accomplishing something by having sex. Enter this girl...



Everything was going great until we started actually having sex. It was super awkward the few time we did, and today she stopped us in the middle because, ""it's like, we don't even know what we're doing"". She kept trying to tell me that we both, obviously, knew what we were doing so it must just be that we're not sexually compatible. At this point I couldn't hold back anymore and told her the truth about my history. She freaked the fuck out. We talked about it for a while, and basically she feels super betrayed and manipulated sexually. Like I lied to her so she would have sex with me, which isn't entirely untrue.



So, I'm fucking lost. I know I fucked up by lying to her, but I'm just so insecure about my lack of experience. Not only does she feel like she started dating me based on a lie(which is totally true), but now she feels like she is responsible for me emotionally and sexually, which is obviously not a good thing. So, I don't know what to do. I really like her, and I know she like me, but this completly changes things. Im giving her some space now, but im freaking out a bit. Sorry for the length, I just need some advice. Help?



TL;DR I lied to a girl I was dating about being more sexually experienced than I am, now she's freaked out about it and need help.



UPDATE: It's done. Just talked to her and there is no way back. We went immediately to ""brah"" level, as we put it. I wasn't completely into her by any means, so life goes on. We're staying friends, whatever that means, but I might take the opportunity to use her friendship (if it develops) and be open with her and use it as an opportunity to feel more comfortable sexually.

I'm also a little dense when it comes to dating. 

Anyway. We've been hanging out a lot more lately, he's cooked dinner, I've baked, etc. Texting more, and I've become incredibly more cautious.

Last night, a group of our co-workers confronted me about our ""relationship"", pretty much asking me to fuck Derp on vacation because they seem to think that we have sexual tension that is apparently pretty obvious. 

I've very briefly spoken with him about my feelings before, and we've never really discussed it, pretty much just pretend it didn't happen. After last night, I feel like I should talk to him about it- because I don't want to just go buy a pack of rubbers and expect to have sex while we are away. 

I don't want to ruin a good friendship, but I'm too scared to think that there might be something there because I don't want to get hurt again.

now, there were probably 3 women that i wanted something serious with but nothing happened. i had a serious career problem, got depressed and dropped the first girl (who wasn't looking for anything serious). i tried to get back with her but she declined, saying that i should be with a more emotional woman. i dated the second girl for 2 months before she told me that she couldn't catch feelings for me and wanted to stay friends because she felt we had great chemistry that way. i politely declined that. 

my last one actually turned out to be slightly more successful. had a relationship for two weeks and it ended this past sunday. now, she blamed the breakup on 3 reasons:

* i refused to change a profile pic on FB which included my 16 year old niece who i'm close with.
* said i always texted her instead of calling her and that's not how a relationship should be based on as the main form of communication (she was always busy with school and work, so i didn't want to bother her).
* we were supposed to hang out this past saturday night but i got in touch with her ""too late"" when i suggested she have dinner with me and my friend before i drop my friend off to spend time with her.
  * my friend and i ended up hanging out with two female friends (who know her) and she was upset with that as well.

i'm sorry, but to me, those are bullshit reasons to break up with someone as opposed to discussing them to keep the relationship going. we spoke briefly on monday. she told me she wanted to keep dating me but was unsure if i was the only one she wanted to date. i told her we should talk about it in person. she ignores me all day.

tuesday comes around and she sends me a text (ironic) saying we should meet up later that night. i agree. she later sends me a text saying she's too tired and wants to hold it off. i told her fine, but that's two days in a row she's done this. a third time and i'm done.

wednesday comes along and she doesn't get in touch, so it's over. she ends up getting in touch with me today (thursday) confirming that this isn't going to work and we should just stay friends. i told her i have zero interest in a friendship with her, especially over how she treated me.

now here's where my issues come in. i think that both the second and my last girl were talking to someone else while we were involved. i'm not trying to sound conceited but i'm a really great guy. i look good, i make great money and i'm fun to be around with. i, honestly, am the catch of the century. or so i think.

obviously i must be doing something wrong if the women i want i can't keep and the women i have zero interest in flock to me. any advice on this? i don't even know if this is a question or a rant, but is there something i'm not doing right here?

Should I be worried?,16,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/q6uwt/still_no_kissing_after_the_fourth_date_should_i/,"Background: I (22 F) met him (21) on OKC and about three weeks ago we had our first date. It went well but neither of us had a lot of time that day, so we just met at a theater, saw a movie, and went our separate ways afterwords. Since then we've hung out each weekend (we go to school in cities about 1.5 hours apart) and we text each other almost every night.


I would definitely say things have been going well, but I'm getting worried that he's not very attracted to me. We've spent a lot of time cuddling and holding hands, but so far that's it (except for one hug). Granted, I did catch a cold right before our third date, so it's understandable that he'd be afraid of getting sick. Also he is very shy and quiet (but he gets more relaxed each time we hang out).



I know he's probably just not comfortable with it yet, but I wanted a little advice. Would it be inappropriate of me to ask him about it? And for those of you who are thinking ""why don't you just make a move,"" I don't really know how because I've never kissed anyone before but he has and I don't want to screw it up.

For background, I am a single woman in my early 30s.

I have started dating a guy who, on paper, is everything I'm looking for.  He has all the important qualities that I'm looking for and even has the same interests as me.  

However, he is easily 200 pounds overweight, possibly more.  There is no way I would want to see him naked, EVER.  It is also slightly embarrassing to be out with someone who doesn't fit in - literally.  He just plain doesn't fit in to a lot of chairs.  We went to a show last night, and he was.... overflowing from his seat so much that I was being crushed in my seat and was extremely uncomfortable.  Also, despite the fact that most of my friends tease me for how slow I walk, he can't keep up with me.

I really don't know what to do.  I don't want to be one of those people who judges people on their body, especially since I am overweight myself (although nowhere near to the extent that he is - and I am trying (and succeeding) to lose weight).  My best friend told me that I shouldn't judge potential partners on their appearance, but I feel like that's easier to say when you've never had to (he's a ten out of ten and can get anyone he wants).

So basically, since this man has all the other qualities I'm looking for, I'm trying to figure out: is it possible to have a relationship with someone you can barely stand to look at?  If so, how do you do it?  If NOT, how do you tell someone that you can't see him any more because despite having all the qualities you're looking for, you feel queasy when you think about the potential of having to see him naked?

I am not from New Zealand but I distinctly remember turning and for some reason proclaiming that I too was in fact from New Zealand. 2) Next thing I remember is hopping into a taxi outside in the street somwhere, with her there too. Given that I had spent all my cash on drinks earlier in the night, the cross-city taxi fare was either paid for by the poor girl, or by selling a kidney (my hangover did seem more potent than usual the next day) 3) I remember bits and pieces from the hotel - but most importantly she repeatedly asked me for my phone number because she wanted to keep in touch. I probably didn't think past ""Sorry I don't have a phone"" which was actually true since I was on holiday, but I neglected to get email/facebook... 4) At some point she left - quite possibly feeling used and shitty about what had happened with yours truly.

I would be happy just knowing her name - even if she has no interest in seeing me ever again. I know she also has a tattoo on her back. And yes she is of Asian ethnicity. That is all. Thanks for any help :)

1329191333.0,12,self.dating_advice,pokgt,Are my standards too high? M/41,14,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pokgt/are_my_standards_too_high_m41/,"Male, 41, no kids.

About three years ago I did a critical self examination of my life and really tried to nail down what I was and was not wanting out of a romantic relationship. The result was me coming up with a list of 4 absolute deal breakers. In the time that has passed since then, three of them have not been causing any issue for me but the fourth is turning out to be a major stumbling block. So now I am wondering if Im being too harsh in my judgement and maybe it should not be a deal breaker for me after all.

In its simplest explanation, whatever woman I date has to have something in life that interests them. They could knit, collect 18th century tableware, do clogdancing, moderate a neonatzi forum, surf, or attend art-house films. It doesn't matter much what they do, as long as they have something they take passion in. In a pinch I will even take being a hardcore fan of the Twilight books as being a legitimate hobby.

I am finding that this 'deal breaker' comes up way more often than I would have otherwise assumed. Emails on OkCupid or first date get-to-know-you questions have the disturbing tendency to come up empty.

ME: So what do you like to do for fun?

HER: Oh, just stuff.

ME: Like what for example?

HER: Well, I like having fun. And I enjoy going out and doing stuff. And I like to hang out with my friends.

ME: Well what are some of the things you do when you go out?

HER: Just having fun. And doing stuff.

It could be that they are just intentionally being bland because they fear I might get turned off if they announce their kooky odball hobbies on a first date. They want to 'cast a wide net' and are attempting to be as generic as they can manage to appeal to the widest number of possible matches. But I dont think this is the case because it continues even when I try and drill down into specifics.

ME: What kind of music do you like to listen to?

HER: All kinds.

ME: Any favorite band?

HER: Oh I like them all.

ME: Whats one of them?

HER: It would take to long to list them all. I enjoy so much different music.

ME: You don't have to name them all, just name one.

HER: I cant remember. \*giggle\*

There is one exception I make to this rule of mine. Getting blacked out drunk I do not count as being a hobby. Yes, it may be something she does frequently and is very vocally passionate about. So in the most technical sense she does have something she enjoys doing. But I dont want to be part of that sort of lifestyle. It may be forgiven somewhat for college age girls, but when you are over 40 thats just alcoholism trying to mask itself as 'just having fun'.

So now I come to the problem.

It could very well be that these women would make a good match for me. Lurking just below the surface could be a kind generous person who is supportive of me and affectionate and would genuinely care about my happiness. All I would need to do is give them a chance and I would find love.

So what if she is totally empty inside, devoid of any personality? There has been times in past relationships where I had to go out to the store and buy an pillow and she came with me to keep me company. I was comfortable around her and I enjoyed spending time together and I was happy whenever I was in her presence. That particular woman did have strong interests of her own (she went into grade-schools and taught origami). But put the two of us together in a store shopping for a pillow, and her strong personalized hobby was not what made me attracted to her. All of those things that make for a great relationship are still possible. They can still happen even if the woman is dull.

Since my dating life these past three years has been woefully lacking, I am starting to wonder if I should drop the requirement that me asking ""tell me about yourself"" should have an answer. It might not be such a deal breaker after all.

1329080346.0,11,self.dating_advice,pmg7h,Where did I go wrong...?,13,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pmg7h/where_did_i_go_wrong/,"Hey everyone! So I first want to apologize if this post ends up being a bit long. Anyways, so I've been dating this girl for almost two months. I'm a 24 yo M and she's a 21 yo F. We first met in Vegas at one of the nightclubs. I hit the dance floor and saw this girl in the middle of the floor and immediately she caught my eye and my eyes caught hers. We locked eyes and from then on we just danced the night away and I got her number afterwards. 

We started texting back and forth occasionally and eventually it became more frequent. After a couple of weeks we got a chance to hang out at a bar and dance the night away again. She would text me stuff like "":D you are too good to be true, I'm still waiting for you to drop the bomb. Like you have two kids or something lol which I wouldn't mind cause I love kids.""

Couple of weeks later and I'm driving down 90+ miles to hang out with her for the weekend. The Friday that I arrive, we hit up a club and again we danced the night away but this time we made out inside the club. It was awesome and it is at this point that I really started to fall for her. I must mention that she initiated all of this after talking to her about it and she even said that alcohol didn't play a role. I crashed at her apartment and slept with her. No sex or anything just spooning that's all. The next day Saturday we checked out the local zoo, art museum and finished the day by watching the sun set from a cliff overlooking the ocean.

After this we continually talk and text each other and just last week she texted me saying ""I don't want to hurt or offend you, but lately I've been feeling overwhelmed. I thought we were going to take this slow, but am feeling rushed. Not sure if I can return the feelings you've been showing for me. I've never met anyone like you, with time I know we could've been something great."" So at this point I tell her I respect her feelings and for her being honest with me and accept it like a man but then she goes back texting me ""Let's fix this, I don't think I will ever meet anyone like you. I don't want to lose you."" So I go with it and try my best to go with the flow.

So we talk/text again for about a week and just this past Friday she tells me ""Idk if I can be everything you expect and need. I just feel like you expect so much of this and it's truly my fault for leading you on but I swear those were not my intentions."" So after this we have pretty cut ties and stopped talking/texting. Now I'm not asking for sympathy or anything but I just want to know where did I go wrong? What did I do to make her feel like I overwhelmed her? I just want to know so I don't make the same mistakes again and make sure that I be careful with how I invest my time and emotions. Thanks a lot everyone and sorry for the long post.

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for all of your advice(s). It's great getting a lot of perspective from numerous people. Just to add a little more information about myself, this girl is the first I've dated after being in a 3.5 year relationship. I've already been broken up with my ex for about 6-7 months and have pretty much gotten over her before meeting this girl so my whole groove on dating is a bit off but I tried my best.

Also just to add more on to this story, this is what she also texted me. ""I was a little concerned when you were in Vegas and you put me before having fun with your boys. Yesterday I was just completely confused about what your true intentions were."" So the first part of her text is in reference to me going out to Vegas again with my friends. This Vegas trip wasn't the one where I first met her but about a month after meeting her. I went out clubbing with my friends again and I had a lot fun while texting her at the same time and keeping a conversation going.

The second part of her text was in reference to me texting something to her that was completely dumb on my part. I said something along the lines of "" You certainly aren't playing when you said I've had plenty of opportunities.."" and after texting her this, she got the impression that I was just in this to try and have sex with her. So this was probably one area that I screwed up with..

Anyways, thank you all once again for your advice(s). Although it hurts right now, I know with the passage of time I'll get through this and learn from this experience.

Now that I think about it, it's been more than a decade since I liked a girl...

The main problem for me is that she's way too attractive. I can say with 100% confidence that objectively any outsider would see us and think: wtf? I'm sure she could be a model (&gt; 6', thin) but is instead too busy intellectually running circles around me.

I'm going to see where this all goes, of course, but I'm skeptical that it could lead to anything. I mean, even if we start dating, how long until she wakes up one morning, looks over, and realizes that she can do better than a hairy yet bald overweight guy that's a couple inches shorter than her?

Anyone have experience with this? Did it work out? I would love to hear your guys' stories since I don't really have any experiences myself to compare to.

In the end, though, despite my lack of romantic success, it feels good to have a girl this beautiful show slight interest in me. First time it's happened in my life. Good motivation for my (much needed) self improvement.

I know her since 3 years, we used to work in the same studio, she was kind of my boss. Thinking she is totaly out of my league i never made any attempts asking her out, despite the fact me being a total moron when it comes to women. She quit 3 months ago and after that we had 4 ""touchy"" encounters.

First time at her farwell party, we were both totally drunk, talked a lot, and the whole thing ended her kissing me(total suprise). We hooked up, nothing happend, cause we were both pretty fucked up. I saw her the following morning at work, but totaly ignored her. I just thought "" well, its a one time thing. dont get to emotional.Forget it she's not really into you."" 

It happend that we met at a concert 2 weeks later. Same ending, got drunk, kissed, went home. No texting from both sides. I didnt want to initiate anything, just thought shes too good for me, because shes the total opposite of me. 

Im totaly nerdy, average looking guy loving his job.Working 12 hours per day i dont have much time for anything else. I keep my social life to a minimum using that little sparetime for researching. I didnt have a girlfriend (bassically girls in general) since 2 years, but it didnt really bother me. She on the other hand has a large circle of friends, is supersocial, extremly beautiful and that type of woman everyman wants to hook up with. 

So the third time i ran into her (in a club) things seem to go in the same direction as before, but this time i didnt want it to end, so i stopped drinking and really talked to her trying to get her know better. Things went smooth, we went to this abonded building next to the club. It was awesome, both ready to get it on. But suddenly she slipped, fell and smacked her head on the floor. Blood everywhere i called an ambulance. I was totally shocked and things went out of my hand, she drove away in the ambulance. I texted her asking if shes ok. She replied immediately and also immediately to all my message the following days. We made jokes about it. 

Three days later we met with some friends at a bar. I was pissed off from work, totally shy and didnt talk to her for a second. I went to the bar and had a few drinks on my own. On her way out she hugged me and asked if everything is ok. I said that we should have dinner together. We texted the rest of the night. But after that i stopped, i knew i should have been the one to take the initative, but damn i was afraid. 

I started to get feelings for her and was afraid to fuck it up. Over the last years I decided to concentrate on my work, master my field of expertise, and really shut down everything else. And i was happy about it. But suddenly she popped up and i really didnt know how to handle it.

So fastforward: yesterday i met her again at a party, one month after the head accident. First I tried to ignore her, not even hugging her while saying hy. After chatting with some random folks brutally trying not to look at her, we suddenly sat next to each other. I asked about the scar. 
It was pretty huge, but nothing you would recognize if you dont explictly look for it. So chitchat we ended up in a bar, and another one, and another one, till we finally talked about our last encounter. She was disappointed because i didnt call her and said she really likes me. So we ended up kissing and stuff and made the promise to see each other again after new years eve, because we would both be out of town. We texted all day yesterday, mainly joking about me and her and the head thingy. 

So here I am thinking about the best way to approach this date. 
One thing she really likes about me is my sarcasm (at its best in drunken ninja mode), but thats my way of coping with my insecurities. Im sure if i fuck this thing up she will loose interest in me. Its just unbelievable that someone like her would like me. I could talk about fine arts the whole date but i know shes not really into it.

I’ve only ever had two successful relationships, and both were in my teen years.  After I started going to university and working, it’s like my ability to date someone has just disappeared.  I had one guy I dated casually last year, but that fell apart after a month, much to my disappointment.  Other than that I’ve never seemed to be able to get a guy to go on more than one date with me.

I come to you, Reddit, in hopes that maybe you can steer me on the right course.  Clearly there’s something I’m doing wrong if I can’t keep a guy’s attention for any more than a few hours.

People tell me I’m charming and sweet, with a really great sense of humour.  I’ve got confidence to spare, and as far as I can tell I’m not unattractive.  I’ve got a great education, a decent job, and I’m taking a few classes to pursue my dream of being an illustrator.  

I play an assortment of video games (I’m pretty good too!) and I adore science fiction, but I’m not a fanatic about it.  And I dress well; modest, fashionable clothes that flatter my body type.

I have a hard time meeting guys, typically because I work in a 95% female environment and I attend a school that is predominately female.  It doesn’t help that I’m usually perceived as the ‘old person’ in all my classes, as most of the other students are 18-20.  Some of them even thought I was married with children until I corrected them.  

I meet guys online mostly, since I can’t stand bars or clubs.  I don’t drink, but that’s because I’ve never had a taste for it.  I’m also not a user of any drugs, simply because my mother is a law enforcement dog handler and I grew up in household with a sniffer dog.  I have no objections to anyone who enjoys these things and it’s never bothered me in the past.  

But whenever I go out with a guy and we hit it off, the second date just never materializes.  I usually get a line like “You’re great, but…”.  Today I was supposed to go out with a guy I went out with  before.  We made plans to catch a movie today, and when I tried to call him this morning he never picked up.  I tried a couple more times but he never answered, nor did he respond to a text I sent him.  Now I’m sitting home alone, disappointed, and wondering why he hasn’t contacted me.  I’m happy to give him the benefit of the doubt in the event something came up, but it bothers me that he hasn’t at least sent me a text to say ‘Sorry’.  

Are there any Redditors who can provide some sage advice?  Anyway I can improve my chances of going out with someone a second time?

He wanted me to read/borrow his books, watch certain movies he loved, went from store to store to store so I could see this movie he thought I would enjoy, his friends encouraged the 'relationship' by talking about how cute we were, he was always polite and considerate to me, whenever we drank he would make sure I never drank too much, he always answered my calls/texts, he called me a pet name, and he invited me on a 3day long vacation with two of his (male) friends (I declined, that seemed like too much for me).

Anyway, what the hell? This is my first time in the dating world. I have only been in one relationship and have no idea how things work, so maybe I'm naive/stupid but I thought the above was an indication that he actually LIKED me.

Our relationship thus far was MAINLY sexual but I saw nothing wrong with this because that's how my first relationship started and it ended up lasting two years.

He struck me as a very nice, caring guy. I am in absolute SHOCK that he is ignoring me and used me. My question is, is this usual? Do guys 'pretend' to like you just to fuck you like this? He went through a lot of effort to see me (living an hour away) and keep me interested (keeping contact with me while on lengthy business trips, sometimes for two weeks at a time). Also why introduce me to his friends? ""Hey guys, this is my living fuckdoll! just don't tell her lolz ITZ A SECRET!!!11""

And if he did just want to fuck me what's with his jealousy rage? And why not explain to me that he wanted something causal as I was obvious in my intentions (or at least I assumed I was)?

Blah. Reddit, sorry, I'm rambling. Maybe I'm just venting. He was the first guy I had feelings for and dated since my ex and I'm proud of myself for putting myself out there again, finally, even if it did blow up in my face. 

I have faith he will eventually contact me. What should I say if/when he does?

Also, one more thing; he comes from an extremely Jewish family. Was I denied a relationship because I'm a gentile? Is this common? That's what my friends/family say happened.

1316473413.0,11,self.dating_advice,kkz7p,"I think he just wants sex, but he is jealous and expects me to be exclusive when it comes to other guys.",13,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/kkz7p/i_think_he_just_wants_sex_but_he_is_jealous_and/,"Me: 21 f
Him: 25 m

Okay, I've been on maybe 5 dates with this guy over the past 2 months (we're both busy people and he lives an hour away).
1st date: watched movie together, no kiss
2nd date: hung out with his friends, spent the night, kissed
3/4/5th dates all involved sleeping together and alcohol. Also involved his friends.

Now originally I assumed he wanted to date me because he asked me out for ice cream. I was with someone at the time so I turned him down. 2 months later he asked again. I was impressed by his persistence and decided to give him a shot. Turns out I really like him.

I assumed because he took me on that original date and also because he was older and introduced me to his friends that he wanted a relationship, NOT JUST SEX. He was always very attentive and relationshipy up until lately, where he only texts/facebooks me about sex. I'm guessing he changed his mind and decided that he only wants to fuck me, not date me.

I just don't understand why I wasn't included in this switch. I'm in college so I'm surrounded by guys who are interested in me, but I turn them all down because I really like this guy. He knows this. And he also expresses jealousy whenever we're out and someone is hitting on me. He also EXPECTS me to turn people down. He told me he hasn't been with anyone since we first got together- so apparently we're exclusive? Which he never told me (I've been on dates with a few other guys, but no sex).

So, we're exclusive? But not bf/gf? Someone at a party asked if we were together and his reply was ""no"". 

I don't understand how he expects us to be exclusive if it's never going to lead anywhere. I've had FWB before and we had set rules to follow. This guy just seems to expect me to know what's going on. He never calls to talk so obviously I'm just a lay.

I don't necessarily want to stop sleeping with him, because I've never been so attracted to someone before. But I feel like I should be allowed to date other people. Should I let him know that I'm doing this? And also, is it even worth asking whether he wants a relationship from me due to how he's been treating me?

Also I have tried to make it obvious I have feelings for him. Especially when I'm drunk I never fail to let him know that I like him. Why wouldn't he stop me and explain, ""hey, calm down, I just wanna fuck you""?

I've probably included too many details that don't matter, so here's a tl/dr.

TL/DR: Been on 5 dates, he says he hasn't been with anyone else, gets jealous when other guys hit on me, yet he doesn't appear to want a relationship. He expects me to turn down guys who hit on me.

- Should I ask this person out?

- How to ask people out?

- Staying out of the friend zone.

- The rules of attraction.

- Dating to build a happy LTR.

As I say, this is just where we want to start. If anyone wants to get involved, message us mods so we can co-ordinate our efforts.

I met this person socially and we have been developing a very good friendship over the past few months.
At first I just liked having a close friend. I moved to where I live now almost 4 years ago and it's been hard enough to find friends let alone even think of a relationship.
The problem is I started to fall for them and it seemed mutual. I decided I didn't want to just hide how I felt so I let them know exactly what I thought about them.
I got a call today from them saying how great a friend I am and how flattered they are that I think of them this way... but they are just not ready for a relationship and how their life is too messed up right now to get involved. They still want to be friends and made it clear that this in no way changes our friendship.
My problem is that it just sucks. I have bad enough self esteem to begin and no matter how they put it, of course I feel like I'm just not good enough for someone to find me attractive. On top of it, I feel like being alone and don't want to even face them for a while. I know I can be friends but right now it just hurts all over.

I met this guy off a dating website, and we hit it off really well, chemistry - everything. We were on date 3 already...It was fun, super romantic, everything I couldve hoped for-but by date 3 - when the moment felt right, we were totally into each other...and next thing I know I'm in bed with him.
As into it as we both were, it kinda ..didnt go as well as we ""hoped"", he ..couldn't keep it going...and it kinda ended awkwardly.
I leave, then he sends me off with me a good bye text saying he was looking forward to seeing me again.
 Two days later, I'm in his town and he wants to meet up, briefly for 10 mins. We chat, but what bothered me is I invited him to some plans this weekend with friends, and he sort of denied! Then after the meeting, it's been over 24 hours and I've heard nothing from him via text/call/anything - which is weird to me b/c we've been talking everyday. 

Did I jump the gun too soon? Should I have denied getting with him so soon, eeeeven though it felt right? Is that a huge red flag to someone? I hear these rules all the time, that the girl should make him wait and earn it blah blah, but I'm not all about that..I'm a ""in the moment"" kind of person. Was this a bad call? Am I looking into this to much? Should I take this as a lesson and slow it down next time? Do these things REALLY matter?

I'm not sure if it's totally lost..he did make the effort to see me, even for 10 mins. He also sent that sweet goodbye text. But the whole ignoring me for 2 days, denying plans on the weekend/future thing freaks me out. What is going on!!

Update: We spoke, I texted him today about the weekend, he denied making plans bc he said he's going to be out of town (which I know isn't true). I think everyone here was right, the biggest thing was I probably shouldn't of asked him anything, bc its too soon.. but hey its ok! This is how I learn.

There is way too much background information to type but that's the general gist of our relationship. Last week we got into a really big fight after we had both been drinking.

I stay at a friends for about three days but she lives kind of far and I had to go to work so I went home to get clothes and we ended up talking and decided to still be together and get counseling. It hasn't even been a week and we are still arguing. I love him but feel like he's changed. I think it's my fault he's changed but it hurts. 

It just seems I'm always upset about something and he blames that for how he acts and reacts to me. I really care about him but I'm thinking I just need to move out but I feel like I can't.

&gt;I was really interested in this one girl (1), and about 3 months ago, I offered to take her out and got the reply *""It's nothing personal, but I don't date. You're the first guy to seriously ask me out and I appreciate it, and while I'm not saying a definite no to ever, but I'm not ready for anything serious right now"".*

&gt;I replied with *""Sure, I respect that, and if you ever want to go out, the offer stands"".*

&gt;I asked here, and got the unanimous answer to drop it. Which I did, and we still talk. I lost her number for about a month, because I had to get my phone repaired. She doesn't have any social networking except for Instagram and Snapchat (which I couldn't get on my loaner Blackberry)... Couldn't really get her number any way other than commenting on something on IG which I didn't want to do, so I just decided to wait til I got my phone back.

&gt;Got my phone back, and installed/opened Snapchat and turns out she sent me a pic every day about how her day was going/work/books/other stuff. LIke not in a stalker-ish way, just like cute picture texts. And I'm talking like, 30+ pics.

&gt;I explained why I hadn't replied and we have started talking again. 

&gt;**I don't know what to make of this.**

&gt;So recently, I reconnected with a friend (2) who I used to like and found out she was single and she asked me if I wanted to go out. 

&gt;I would like to catch up with her before I make any decisions obviously, but she asked me how I felt about it, and I told her that I had kind of made someone and offer and didn't want to just drop that and start seeing someone, but I wasn't saying no, I just wanted to get to know each other again. In a nutshell, I was completely honest.

&gt;She said that she appreciated the honesty and said that she understood and would still like to go out if I changed my mind.

&gt;Also, there are a couple of girls who I work with who have expressed interested in me and whether or not I'm open to dating or if I'm single or not (I'm not a fan of work relationships, but still, it's baffling my mind).

**What is this? I go a year through college with minimal female interaction.**

**In the last 3 weeks, I don't know what to think, because it would seem there are (possibly a few) girls actually interested in me for once. Haha**

Could someone help me out please?

We go to his house and he tells me to pick a movie, then says ""it's just going to be background anyways."" (Wtf). The movie hasn't started and he immediately lunges at me, trying to make out. He attempts this like 6 times over the next half hour.

Then, she kept asking me about any past relationships, what kinda girls I liked, and what kinda relationships I wanted. Whenever I told her anything, she would instantly say something that would make me think that she is that kinda girl. Like, she made me believe that she's the perfect girl for me. She said that I'm way too smart, I need to date someone who isn't so smart(guess who? her) to be happy. 
Then after that, I dont know what happened(she was hitting on me, and I did not give a single positive reply that she would have been able to decipher as to I liked her), but she tried to avoid me a lot(maybe it was the embarrassment? I've had the feeling that she is into me for the past 2+ years, but I never asked her out or told her I liked her, and so she started hitting on me badly). 
I am bad with girls as such, in the approaching part atleast, as once we start talking, I am able to woo pretty much any girl.

She said oh wow when he told her I had called her. 
Then, we talked for like an hour, and she kept blushing all the way through. 
I told her that these are my last 20 days in the city, and I'll be gone for 2 years.
Then I asked her for one of her girlfriends numbers, and then I said, let it be, what can I even do? I'd be gone for 2 years. 
Then she suggested a long distance relationship.(It was for her sake)
My intuition tells me that this girl likes me, and she is really cheerful and good. 
I do not have much time now, and I need to ask her out fast. 
We cant go on dates, as she has to study for exams, so asking her out on a date is pretty useless. 
Long distance works for me.

However, these circumstances are very strange.

1. We were in a foreign country.

2. She was leaving back to her country in a month. (also my home country, and same city. This was two months ago, so she has left already)

3. Because of her impending departure, she was very busy saying goodbye and getting her plans in order.

4. In this foreign country, we lived over 2 hours apart; a logistical nightmare.

5. She was eager to meet up. She asked for my phone number AND asked me out first, but I was busy; the ball was in my court. She also literally told me that she found me attractive. Cool.

6. The one date we eventually had was dinner. We had a lot of chemistry and common interests. She was easier to talk to than many of my closest friends. We had some good laughs and conversations, but no escalation. I wasn’t trying to escalate, either. I'll explain why later. I met her in her city because I was visiting a friend there earlier that day.

7. She dropped this bombshell when I was about to leave... No signals that I royally messed up to deserve that comment. I sheepishly replied that maybe I’d call her when I return to my country. She said, “Okay.”

8. She didn’t remove me from FB. I feel like a “no more dating this person” situation would warrant a removal. We haven't talked since, though.

9. She's hard to read. I'm hard to read.

I'm returning to my home country in a few months, and I would love to rekindle this interest. At the time, I didn't want to see her for a second date because the logistics of the whole situation were nightmarish. So I wanted to play it cool; I would hit her up when I return. No talking to her in between. When she first said ""We're probably never going to see each other again,"" I was taken aback and figured she meant she didn’t like me. Bummer. But today I was thinking about it, and now I am confused; who actually says that on the first date? Have I misinterpreted that statement? What do you folks think?

1372883045.0,11,self.dating_advice,1hl8pv,Reconnecting with a high school crush (who is sending mixed signals),14,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hl8pv/reconnecting_with_a_high_school_crush_who_is/,"I'm M/21, she's F/20.

Background: In high school I was a shy loner type who had a crush on a sweet, beautiful girl in my class. We always seemed to end up sitting next to each other and talked pretty often, but I didn't have the balls to make a move on her and risk looking like even more of a loser if she rejected me. She got a boyfriend after sophomore year and we gradually grew apart.

Fast forward to now: I've improved my social skills after three years at a big state university. I dress better, work out 3-4 times a week, have a small but close circle of friends, basically live the life of an average 21 year old guy. Months ago, this girl randomly comments on something that one of my friends (that she has never met) posted on my Facebook wall. I started catching up with her through a few messages, but she abruptly stopped replying in the middle of a conversation. I thought that was the end of it, but since then I've had some weird interactions with her. She followed me on Twitter at one point, I followed her back, then she unfollowed me like 2 days later; I liked a new picture of hers at one point and she immediately deleted it; weird little things like that. 

My birthday was Sunday and she posted ""happy birthday, hope all is well!!"" on my wall. I don't want to be THAT guy who gets worked up over a birthday wall post but I've NEVER seen her post on any of our mutual friends' walls for their birthdays. I looked into it and she had been dating that same guy from high school through 2.5 years of college but broke up with him about a month after we first reconnected. 

So she's interning in New York and going back to a school about 4 hours away from mine in the fall. I'm living at school right now, about 3 hours from our mutual hometown. I'm sure she'll be home at some point before she goes back to school.

I still like this girl, and if she's anything like she was in high school then I want to see her again. But I can't tell for the life of me if she's just being nice or really looking to see me again. I lost touch with so many people after high school that seeing her at home would take real effort, which I'm willing to do but only if I've got a real shot with her.

Do I try to meet up with her? Initiate another online convo and see where it goes? Or just forget about her completely? Any input's appreciated.

**TLDR**: Former loner/current average college guy having odd online interactions with a high school crush that I still like, what's my next move?

I've been on a cuple of dates with this girl and we chat everyday. I'm going to her house to watch a horror movie. She is home alone and I've been thinking on asking her if i could sleep at her house with her after the movie. I don't think she minds, but it's difficult for her to ask me to spend the night without implying something sexual. We haven't had sex, but I think we both are ready for it. I don't want to sleep at her house just to have sex, I'm just saying that there is a possibilty that sex can happen. It's also difficult for me to get home so late at night as there are no busses or trains that late. 

The question: How can I ask her whether or not i can spend the night without pressuring her to do something she doesn't want to? I think that a direct question can imply sex and make it difficult for her to say that she would prefer if i went home after the movie. She is saying that she wont be able to sleep for weeks after seeing the horror movie so maybe i can say something like ""what if I stayed with you so that you can be safe?"" in a kind of jokingly way. I do think that such a line can be to indirect and that she doesn't take it seriously. 

I hope you understand what i need help with. Please ask if there is something you need me to clarify. Thank you so much.

UPDATE: First of all the date DIDN'T HAPPEN. She had to cancel because she got sick and had to go to the hospital (nothing too serious). Regarding the sleep over thing, we weren't sure of which house we were going to stay at. She actually went pretty far to find me a possible ride home for her, so i didn't ask if i could stay with her for the night. When we talked about maybe doing it at my house instead i told her that it would be difficult for her to get home and that she could sleep over at my house. She responded positively and joked about that her mom was going to freak out.

First time posting on reddit. I don't browse, I've known it for years, I simply don't come here because I usually frequent other places on the internet, but I'm temporarily banned on those.

I'll try to make this short, but I think I won't be successful. 

I'm 20, male, University student and part time athlete and musician. Not that it matters.  I'm currently on exam period and can't focus because I'm depressed and infatuated at the same time, a recurring situation for me. 

I've never had a serious relationship, or a serious girlfriend. The last time I had any romantic thing was I was 17.

I used to be arrogant as fuck, because I was always led to believe by those around me (parents, teachers, other kids) that I am somehow on a higher level than other people. I was overcompensating for my insecurities but somehow I got by when it came to girls, they found me attractive, sometimes, maybe because we were kids and that fake confidence seemed like the real thing to their inexperienced eyes.
I started that type of behaviour when I was 13 and started reading all of that PUA crap. It's bullshit written by guys that are the cringiest, but during my teenage years it acted as a placebo and I was very (over)confident, and I think that's the reason I got lucky during those days.

Lots of personal issues went by, too many times I was heart broken when I found some girl I was ""playing"" didn't take me serious and thought of me as nothing more than a one time only guy (what a surprise, right?). Eventually I quit this behaviour and sought psychotherapy in order to try to fix the real problems in myself. Psychotherapy made me be honest with myself, but as a consequence all my self-loathing and desperate need to feel loved surfaced. 

Because of that, I have a mindset that makes me ultra unattractive. I don't regret the treatment I did (and still am doing), I used to be a blind kid, but it hasn't made me any happier, and added a side of me that I would prefer to have kept hidden. 

I spend my days wondering why every girl I show some interest to seems almost afraid/disgusted by me. Although academically I am currently weak due to my lethargy (I simply can't study/focus) I've always been an overachiever in everything I do, I've done some pretty cool stuff for my age. I also supposedly am very attractive, people frequently tell me I look like a model, and girls randomly stare at me on the street everyday. I look in the mirror and I don't really like what I see, I'm just telling about the feedback I get.

I know that my attitude is the reason I don't get any real attention instead of just empty looks, but while it's easy to say it, it's impossible for me to just pretend that I'm not desperate and act like I'm not. I'm not a sociopath.

Everytime I manage to face my enormous insecurities and try to go for it I end up being rejected and disappointed, and each attempt only makes me more miserable and keeps me from believing that someday I'll get it right.

The semester ended a little while ago and now we pretty much only talk through text (We live too far away to hang out really). She has some pretty strange texting habits that leave me confused as to whether she's interested or not.

1) Occasionally she won't respond at all when I text her. I'll just say something like ""Hey! What's up?"" And she simply won't respond. Alright, that's cool. People are busy sometimes. But she also sometimes just stops responding mid-conversation. We'll be talking about something and then she's just gone. She texts REALLY long. Like, one whole text sometimes doesn't fit on my screen. This confuses me because sometimes she doesn't respond and sometimes she fires words at me like a gatling gun.

2) Anyway, on one of those psuedo-dates I mentioned, it was getting late and we were both wondering if we should go home.

In the park we sit down and just eat, talk and drink for the better part of 3 hours. Conversation was flowing incredibly well, and I had her cracking up and laughing several times.

She remarks she has to be back at her apartment by 10 because her roommate forgot her key, I walk her to her train stop. On the walk over I ask her what she is doing this weekend, let's hang out again. She interjects saying she might be having a housewarming party on Friday, and if so I should come. I say im down for that. Give her a hug and kiss on the cheek goodbye.

Text her an hour or so later asking her if she got home just fine, she responds that she did and says thank you for everything and I had a great time. I reply telling her the same, and that if her party on Friday does not come to fruition then I want to take her to dinner. She replies and says that sounds good, smiley face.

Now, texted her about 7 hours ago, just asking her how her day is going and nothing.

What gives?

P.S: It might be worth it to mention that initially, when I first texted her upon getting her number, she did not respond. I then sent her a text the next day again, and she apologized saying she was driving when she got the first text, and it slipped her mind to text back.

So i'm thinking maybe is absent minded with her texts, and maybe I should text her again? I do not want to seem persistent though. I'm thinking call her tomorrow to inquire about Friday plans, if she does not respond to that, chalk it up as a loss, and onto the next.

FINALLY, I had a topic to try talking to him about. So I sent him a Facebook message telling him that I was thinking of applying to work there, and I asked him how he liked it. We've been taking on Facebook a fair amount since then, but that's the only real conversation we've ever had. 

My plan is to go to the grocery store and do my shopping there tomorrow. I'll be sure to get some bigger things that I need so I can use a cart. As a bagger, he's required to offer to take my cart out for me. So when we are heading out, I'll make some small talk. Ask him if he has any cool plans for the night. If he's free, I'll say ""well how about doing something adventurous? You could get to know someone new over some coffee"".

I'm pretty attractive, but overweight. I'd rate him as an 8 but none of my friends think he's attractive at all, he's also a little bit heavier so maybe my weight wouldn't matter to him as much?

I've liked her since the beginning of 11th grade, and she was a close friend of one my best friends (it's a girl, so I'm not worried about competition). I wanted to ask her out for a long time, but I was always to shy to do so.

I asked her to prom a while ago to which she said yes, and I also asked her out on a real date a little while after that. She said sure, but that she wanted to wait until after prom, because she wasn't sure if she was ready for a relationship. We went to prom, and I danced with her a couple of times, but she seemed really shy and didn't try to make too much eye contact. After one of the dances, I kissed her on the cheek, and she smiled and blushed. I held her hand on the way back home on the limo. I walked her over to a friends house where she slept over. That's when I asked her whether she wanted to be my girlfriend (big mistake; I know)

She said that she like really liked me and everything, but that she wasn't mentally ready for a relationship, but she wanted to go on a couple of dates and give it a try with me.

We went and saw Iron Man 3 the other day (she's a huge comicbook fan, which works out for me because I'm one too), and I held her hand during certain parts of the movie. Before watching IM3, I was waiting for her at the theater and I ran into one of her friends. We talked, and she mentioned that this girl really liked me. So while waiting for a ride after the movie, I pecked her on the cheek again, and she simply smiled and blushed. I'm making plans to see her again soon. 

Her and I are going to the same university next year, and we share some of the same classes. I think she might be some staying in residence, while I commute back home. I am not a 100% sure, but then it becomes somewhat difficult to spend time with her.

I really like this girl you guys. She's cute and we share a lot of the same interests. Unfortunately, she seems to be busy quite a bit. On top of that, she's really shy, so I have no idea what she thinks of me or anything. I don't want to move too fast, and come off as someone manipulative. Her last boyfriend from over 3 years ago, apparently tried to manipulate her, and the last thing I want to be is that guy (he's out of the picture btw). People keep asking me if we're ""official"" or not, and I don't know how to answer.

Now if guys haven't already been scared away by this wall of text and drama going on here, I would really appreciate some advice from you guys. I want to know how to find out whether she likes me or not, how to make sure that I'm not moving too fast, and whether or not I should keep this relationship going. If you redditors could take some time and help a 17 year old kid deal with the tip of the iceberg in his first relationship, I would gladly appreciate and cherish it.

We met in class last semester, hit it off, and got to know each other but never hung out. Last December, I went to a show of his. He seemed super stoked for me to be there and asked for my number at the end but never followed up. 

Come January, I hadn't heard from him and kind of liked this other guy who made a move, so other guy and I started dating. Literally the next week, I saw Dude again for an event; we talked, he hugged me and told me to keep in touch. That weekend, I went to a show and Dude's friends were there. They pretty much jumped me as soon as they saw me: ""Dude likes you! He's just really shy and hasn't really dated before.  You should call him.""
I shot him a text but he didn't respond, so I decided to give other guy a chance, but that didn't last long. Recently, Dude and Dude's friends came back into my life. I'm still really into him, and every time I've seen him he's been talking to me, hugging me, offering study help, etc. Also, I was with Dude, his friends, and my friend and left the room; my friend told me later that, once I left, Dude's friend had asked her if I was still into him. She pled the fifth and says Dude blushed but didn't say anything. 

I guess my question is this: When I'm with him, he seems like he's really into me. His friends claim he is. But he won't contact me. Then again, he's shy and hasn't really dated before. Does it seem like his friends just want him to date someone? Should I balls up and call him? Did I miss my chance the first time? I'm afraid of coming on too strong.

Advice please!,15,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1dgsp9/might_be_attracted_to_a_virgin_until_marriage_i/,"We are going on a second date soon and I am getting the feeling that she might be a virgin who is saving herself until marriage. I am not a virgin and I am not saving myself for marriage because - well that's water under the bridge at this point and - I am not interested in getting married. It's not for me, I have thought about it a bunch. No plans for children either.

So I just want to be able to date a woman, have a good time, maybe have some intimacy - if we both wanted to - and I don't want to have to think about shit like being together forever, meeting parents, or think about having kids. Hell I don't even want to think of all the religious meta baggage that comes along with subjects like virginity at 40 and saving one's self until marriage. I am getting close to 40 and so is she. To have a relationship like that at my age feels like I am stepping back into high school ... in GEORGIA.

I don't want to waste her time or mine by pursuing something that is essentially oil and water. If she really is a virgin and is saving herself for marriage then imho she should try to meet men who are like-minded. How do I even bring this up? This conversation would be super awkward for a virgin approaching 40. We need to discuss to find out what pages we are individually on.

It just feels unfair for me to be burdened with the ideologies from someone else that a. I don't share and b. probably stem from religion. For her I don't think it would be fair for me to just lead her on with more dates and phone conversations knowing what she wants could never come of this.

At the same time I don't want to be labeled as someone purely looking to get laid because nothing could be further from the truth. I really like talking to her and spending time with her I am just too old to go around the ""potential marriage material"" block again-and-again. Shit is dead ... can we still enjoy go out and have good time together or not?

TL;DR Now keep in mind everything I have written above is purely speculative mixed with how I would feel if it were true. I have no idea if she is a virgin or saving herself for marriage. HOW DO I FIND OUT w/o looking like a crass jerk only trying to get laid?

Hi, there, I'm 23, and I have a bit of a background. The first time I asked a girl out I was 16 (she said yes!), and had an on/off 3 year relationship. After the breakup, it was almost 3 years until I ""dated"" again, with a couple of one night stands and a weird fwb deal on the side in between those times. The second relationship lasted maybe 6 weeks, and I was sorta used, sorta not sure about that one still. Seriously, no idea what happened there. (That's a lie).




I am still scared at how emotionally immature, needy, clingy, and downright annoying I can be. I know I've been an absolutely amazing boyfriend, the kind that sweeps you off your feed romantically, physically delivers in an above average way, and is super thoughtful. The kind that makes you happy.

However, I can get clingy. Not like, ""I MUST SEE YOU EVERY DAY,"" clingy. It's different. It's what I would call routine clingy. We start going out, and there's a developing routine. Last time it was compulsive texting by her that got me into the routine of texting every day. Then when it stopped, I didn't really know... what to do with myself. I mean I have a life, but I was used to... the texting. Does that make sense?

Anyhow, I digress. I'm single again, and I'm wondering...

**Important Part**

How do... I date? Relationship 1 was this fluke thing that went from one ""yes"" into the typical HS sweetheart yeah right kinda deal. Relationship 2 was... well... let's just say it was fucking weird. I made a bad decision turning a long term crush into a rebound for her because of the words ""I love you"" coming out of her mouth. Don't date ex roomies... especially if you know their bf really well. Lesson learned!

But yeah... how... do I date? I mean, I hate bars. I am just getting out of college, and though I could easily afford an apartment I live with the parents. 

?? My personality type doesn't even seem to exist... but I would love to expand and date anyone.

For instance the girl today, who was at the college thingy I was at. Super cute. Obviously smart (it was a honoring thingy for academic excellence through internship... you know what nevermind but we were both there).

I walked right up to her, and asked her all about her internship, and then of course I was like... yeah...

Then she was all ""You know I'm in your class right?""

I didn't. But still we talked for a good 20 minutes. I really wanted to ask her out but... I don't know how.

I really wish she would have at least dropped ""Yeah oh my boyfriend..."" if she had one. Chances are though, she didn't think I was flirting.

I will see her obviously in class. How do I go about asking her out?

**TL;DR:** 
*Can anyone give me some tips on how to get into the dating groove? I don't really seem to attract women.
*How do I ask out a classmate? Are there protocols for girls who have boyfriends (as in, do they tell you)? How do I find out?
*How do I go about searching for a personality type that seems to keep to themselves most of the time?


Thanks...?

I submitted this post:
http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/17xu0k/i_m26_am_going_to_have_my_first_date_ever/
2 months ago and got really good help so i decided to ask you guys again with the follow up. I'll just continue from there so its best if you could take a little time to read the original thread to understand where i'm coming from.

2 months is probably quiet a long time for a follow up but let me explain.
So i got her number and called her. it was hard to reach her at the beginning because she is working as a nurse and often working late at nights or afternoons and i didnt know her schedule but we worked it out.
I was obviously nervous at first because a girl never gave me her number before with the clear intention of getting on a date. But we talked and talked and i really enjoyed it. After a while i told myself ""OK, time to ask her out now"" but she dodged around the topic quiet good and im not that kind of person that says ""Woman! Listen up now. I will tell you something and you will listen and like it"" so i just went with it and we continued to talk about random stuff.
Time went by flying and not long after 2 hours already passed and we ended the phone call because it was already late at night.
Even though she send me a text message later telling me that she really liked talking to me i couldnt help myself and thought ""Great, i already fucked it up"".

But we continued to talk and send text messages and 2 phone calls later we finally agreed on a day and place to meet. We are seperated by a 2 hour drive if the roads are clear and because of the fact that i dont have a car and she does she said she'd like to come to my area even though i said i have absolutely no problem taking the train so she wouldnt have to drive.
I was really excited and prepared myself like you guys told me to only to hear her say on the morning of the day that we would have met that she cant make it because it started snowing again and she didnt feel comfortable driving in such  bad weather. I didnt really know what to make of it but it was actually really bad weather-wise. And here in germany where i live it snows maybe 5 days/year tops so i accepted it.

After that it was hard finding a day where we both had the time to meet. Because she was working long night shifts again and didnt seem to have much free time. But i didnt want to ignore her so we continued texting and calling each other 1-2 times a week. She was mainly asking for it so she must have at least some kind of interest in me.

But then we decided to try meeting again earlier this month. Again she wanted to come close to me so we agreed on meeting in a ""neutral"" city near me which was actually her idea. Its not that far from me. I went there by train and it took me overall 1 hour to get there. I was fine with that.
I dont know that city too well so i researched a nice little café in the middle of the city on the internet to meet there.

I was already there waiting for her when i got the first text telling me that she cant find the place. I thought ""Hm, thats strange"" because from my point of view it was really easy to find especially given the fact that it was close to the center of the city including the main train station and that she had a navigation system. I tried explaining to her how to get there and tried to find another place which was maybe easier to find but everything i did she just blocked. After a while of texting (I tried calling but she didnt answer) she admitted that even though she was in the city she freaked out and was suddenly too shy to meet. I tried reasoning with her asking her what she really was afraid of but i didnt get a clear answer and after waiting there for nearly 2 hours without her showing up and her constantly telling me that she couldnt find it and wasnt so sure about it anymore i took the train home.

I just send her a text saying something like ""Im going home now and im really pissed. But everyone deserves a second chance. Try to figure out what you want and what you're afraid of and if you have an answer call me"" I wrote something stupid to my facebook like ""Fuck women..anyone wanna get drunk?"" and turned off my phone, went home, had a couple of drinks and went to bed.

When i woke up the next day and turned on my phone i had like 3 text messages and an email from her telling me that she really is sorry, didnt know why she reacted that way and that she would hate it if she messed it up and that she would somehow ""miss"" me if i decided to ignore her from now on. Then she also said that no women is worth getting drunk for. Keep in mind that i wrote that only to my facebook and not to her and i never added her on facebook nor told her whats my name there even though i use my real name.

I didnt reply to any of it at first and later that day got a message saying that she would really like to call me and explain everything. I agreed.
She told me again that she didnt know why she reacted that way but she was just too shy, was afraid that we wouldnt have anything to talk about and wasnt sure if she could look me in the eyes when we meet because she sort of is that way when meeting new people. She then also told me that i shouldnt worry about being stalked (The facebook thing). It was just a friend of her worrying for her and looking me up and told her about it. Today im still not sure if the last part is true.

Like i said before anyone deserves a second chance and she seemed to make sense, at least somehow. She told me that she would be more comfortable if we could meet anywhere outside when its starting to get dark so then she wouldnt have that problem of looking at me.

At this point i didnt want to go anywhere far for the possibility of it happening again so earlier this week we met in my city at 9pm. We just walked alongside a river and just talked. I wasnt nervous anymore at this point because i went into it with the mentality of ""Its already fucked up, lets just see where it goes""

I actually had a nice time but it was just talking. Nothing special happened it was just like a normal phone call. We did that for like 3 hours and then she drove home.

So now im at a point where i dont really know what to do. Even though we only had 1 date i feel like i know her well because we talked for months now and had  a lot of phone calls.

Everything on the internet about dating i looked up says that you should quickly get to the point. Meet up quickly and go from there. Which obviously makes sense but that ship is sailed for me. Because we know each other so well now i dont really know how to proceed from here. If we would go on a second date where would be a good place to go and how would i avoid getting put in the friendzone? Because that is a place i dont want to be in ever again.
I feel like I'm making myself too much available and the fact that i know she had relationships before and i am completely inexperienced when it comes to women doesnt really help at all.

So yeah. If you somehow managed to read everything i just typed. thank you for your time and hopefully you can share some advice with me.

This is my throwaway due to other redditor friends knowing both of us. This situation is a bit weird, but here are the bulliet points: met this gorgeous girl in 2007. We had/have so much in common, it's crazy. Nothing happened. We were just never on the same page. We saw each other a couple times randomly over the years, but I mostly ignored her. But then last summer we were at a bar together and had a long conversation. The topic was why we had never gone out. I got her number and asked her out. But fuck me if I wasn't moving to another city the next week. So I lived elsewhere for a few months, but we kept in contact and eventually went on an epically long date around Christmastime. My impression was that we really liked each other. It didn't end the way I was expecting it to. She cried...yeah. Self-doubt or fear. Definitely alcohol. Kiss on the cheek and agree to go out the next night. I was only there the next night. So she avoids me, but continues to talk over text. I think she was just embarrassed. We leave it on a ""let me know next time you're back.""

I go back to my new home city and sort of cut off communication. But a couple weeks before I come back, I text her. We talk for a while and I let her know I'm moving back. She seems excited and we agree to find a time to hang out when I'm back. Well, I move back and she ignores my text to ask when she's available. Then I see her at a bar and we talk for a minute. Then I invite her out with my friends the next week and we meet at a bar where there are basically 50 people that we know between the two of us. It was obviously distracting. But she was seemed happy I was there and we tried to talk as long as possible. And I said, ""Well, we need to go out again."" And she said, ""Yes, Fridays and Saturdays work best."" I say I'm out of town next week, but we'll find a day later on. Now, that's what I remember. But when I text her to ask her out again, she ignores me again! Why? I mean, unless I did something horribly embarrassing that I don't remember, why string me along and agree to a second date and even act excited if you're not into it?

PS maybe it's because of the informal text? But the one time I called her (admittedly pre-date) she didn't answer or call or text back. I just assumed she was a texter exclusively. But I think maybe I should call at this point.

1365001763.0,10,self.dating_advice,1bla5l,[23M] Been recently seeing this girl [20] but she is sending mixed signals. Is there any way this can turn out positively?,10,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1bla5l/23m_been_recently_seeing_this_girl_20_but_she_is/,"So I met this girl a couple of weeks ago, and we have really seemed to hit it off, I have been in enough stagnant quasi relationships that I typically avoid dating unless I really feel something special. We both are into the arts, she's into Theater and I am a musician. Our senses of humor are stupid similar and when we talk, time flies by for both of us. So anyways, she spent the night not too long ago and we both had a lot of fun. Of course we end up fooling around and the chemistry seems EXTREMELY compatible, she even goes as far to point it out. The night goes great, she holds me close. We wake up, watch a movie, talk some more, go to lunch and our day together is over. We of course get into a conversation about how great the night was, but then she uses the classic line thats a huge warning sign ""Im not sure I am ready for a relationship, I am confused."" Shit.

A couple days later she invites me to come to her place to watch movies, but with the warning that she's afraid things will get more confusing. I go anyways, but keep very intent to not be super outwardly affectionate. We have fun as usual, talk some more, and watch a movie. Its 1 AM so I decide its time to go home. We hug, which turns into an extremely long embrace. She then walks with me out to my car and another long embrace proceeds.

I go home, and she then sends a long string of texts telling me how awesome that I am, how fast time flies by with me, and how she had such a strong urge to kiss me, but that it would be unfair to expect me to hold out for her when she isn't sure where she is at emotionally. She is crying and says she feels like she might be making a mistake, and she doesn't want me to disappear from her life, but understands if I feel the need to.

We've still been texting since then and she has largely been the initiator of conversation. She also has let it slip a couple times that ""I cant stop thinking about kissing you."" She has been very open and honest about her feelings and thoughts with me, both good and bad.
Important Note about her:
I know she was in a year long relationship with a guy she thought she was going to marry and he dropped her out of nowhere about 4 months ago. So I feel like this might be a contributing factor to her sheepishness.

I am a very cynical man and I have been dragged through the mud enough times when I was younger that I am a little quick to assume the worst. I don't often become attached to most women I meet, so when I met this one and sparks started flying like crazy, it seems like a bad idea to drop it when I never have gotten these strong of feelings before.

Do think its possible that maybe she really just isn't ready yet, and it might be worth my time to stick around?
Or is this case pretty cut and dry like the worst of my suspicions?

TL;DR
Start seeing girl, hit it off really well, she stays over the night. Starts sending mixed signals about her feelings; but often still is the initiator of conversation and ""cant stop thinking about kissing"" me and how well we connect..

Hello there Reddit, I'll go by GadasGerogin here if its quite all right with you folks. I am 25 years old now, male, quite gay..yada yada yeah you've prolly heard this before but there is more to this Story.

About a year ago I started talking to this guy, through the internet, (yup it's onna those stories). Throughout the year I got to know him better, find out what his interests are, what he likes, what he looks for and what have you. And through that alone my interest in him only grew. I mean, finding out there is someone out there who seems to be what you want is one thing, I still need to meet the person to see if per chance this individual is worth all the time and effort and planning of long distance. I'm one of those old romantic fools who thinks that distance does not matter for very long, if the feelings are true and the will strong enough there will be a way for that distance to be erased one day. So I took a huge chance and some amount of money to finally go down and meet him. Now mind you I didn't want it to seem like as if I went down there just for him, I didn't want to give it away in that fashion. So I went down under the pretense that I was going down to a certain convention, in Atlanta, you can take your guesses as to what convention it was. I gave as much aid as was needed to make sure he could make it to the con, even going so far as to giving him a space in my room that I offered free of charge. 

Now on the way down I was also driving with my best friend, even though she doesn't drive her presence was quite appreciated in my car for the damned near 24 hour drive. As to why it took so damned long, I ran into a blizzard on the way South in West Virginia, not the best place to encounter frozen water in any form in a tiny little Nissan Sentra. She was kind of my coach on the way down cause I was nervous as all hell about finally meeting someone that by this point, was on the very verge of fallen for, but not yet ready to step up my game. She really kept my spirits bolstered while I was going down there to finally meet this guy, lord knows she kept telling me to be positive and just be myself. In fact, she stressed those two things constantly whenever I started getting nervous behind the wheel, hell I damn near vomited at one point cause of how nervous I was. 

When we finally reached his place, both our phones (my female friend and I) were barely with power. Hell, she did the last bit of navigation for me so I could reach his house without driving around in New York plates like an asshole. When we got there, I seized up, I literally could not drive myself to simply walk out and knock on his door. I wanted to message him but my phone was dead, and I couldn't for the life of me remember his number. She eventually shored up my courage and I got out, knocked on the door, and he answered. 

""Oh hey! I'll be out in a minute.""

Then the door closed and...as first impressions go it wasn't much. I got to see him in person finally (I had seen images before,) however they did him no justice. Now I know, thats a rather overused statement but when you finally meet someone who you only got to see through the pixels of a computer screen, or phone, you cannot help but to admire the first site of that someone with nothing but your two eyes and the space between them to him. 

Anyway, I froze up again and walked away after the door shut. My friend only giving me the thumbs up from the car, like as if I was someone who just pulled off some kind of aeronautical maneuver. To me it might as well have been such a difficult task at heart. Though finally he came out, I got him settled in my tiny car and we went along on our way to the convention, joking about various things, me doing my Skeletor impression with great glee heard from him while I felt like I was making a fool of myself...yet enjoying it. Made a few lame puns and what have you, which I already knew he enjoyed puns to some degree, hence why I thought of all sorts of bad jokes. 

Now at the con, we settled in and dropped off our luggage, my two other room mates hadn't arrived to Atlanta just yet so we went down to register for the con. He managed to register first..cause he didn't pre register..which made no sense to me. I opted to wait out till the line died down and instead used my amazing stealthy abilities to sneak past some badge checkpoints to stand by him on line. Turns out the con screwed up the registration with him so he had to wait until they had it figured out. Though I already had some spare scratch on me, I opted to try and help him out in a rather sly fashion, trying to sneak some extra money into the pocket on his hoody. Sadly he's skinny enough that he felt me trying to plant the cash on him and caught me with a starling smile after my hands were caught quite red. He opted to stay on line and wait till the issue was resolved and got his badge. 

The con itself was quite enjoyable, he and I spent our time mainly in the game room. Along with the artist rooms and what have you. It was quite enjoyable with him. Even got a smoothie together with him, which was one of the best smoothies I've had in a very long time. 

One night back in the room, he and I had a long conversation about video games, movies, tv shows, and past relationships, funny how that fit in there. At one point, as I remember I said that I enjoyed his laugh a great deal, how he always laughed even at my worst puns. HE said something along the lines of how his laugh isn't cute at all...

And then I forgot what I said, but in my sparking mind it just seemed the right thing to say and I leaned in and kissed him...only to not have him react at all. Which quite frankly broke something inside of me. He didn't object or push me away mind you, just, didn't react to this. I played it off calmly and cooly and appologized for my sudden forwardness and we went back along with our convention.

Eventually I had to ask about why he didn't react at my show of affection, only to hear that the reason being is that he isn't ready for a relationship. I felt, well honestly kind of shattered but still stlawart enough to keep a straight face. Mulling over if its possible he might be ready for one in the near future...or if he wanted to tell me he wasn't interested in me at all, but didn't want to hurt my feelings. After this encounter I retreated back to my room to think things through, honestly I did cry for a good portion, slept a bit too..I just didn't know what to do about this, my feelings were all pointing towards him and I could not control them well enough to stop me from feeling so shitty. 

Eventually I snapped out of it long enough to enjoy the rest of the con, with him mainly. I wasn't willing to seperate myself from him. On Sunday I had to drive him back before my long journey back home, after I dropped him off I felt like a piece of me, a big piece just left me. Sure he didn't say he had no interest in me, but my paranoia was spiking like you wouldn't believe. Then my friend, who was also with us on the way back, told me something that gave me hope again. BEfore I dropped him off, He told her that ""I really am something.."" 

With that..I felt like as if I had a shot again..

Though he is in current financial and residential issues, I have vowed to him that if he had absolutely no where else to stay, I would step in and do something. Now it doesn't have to be at my home no, I could merely assist him in finding some other spot but still, I have vowed to help. When I say I am going to do something, I will, its a matter of honor. 

Though the final thought of the story is..

With that first visit to him, meeting him for the first time, getting to know him far better, what makes him tick, what makes him smile...and all of those things that affect me. I have fallen for him. Now mind you I don't use the three words often, I don't toss them around unless its pertaining to NYC pizza...which I do love. But with him I just feel it, he has caught my interest to the fullest and I cannot simply move on and forget, his voice and his absolutely gorgeous smile still remain with me. I love him....

Reddit, this is my first post ever to you. I have lurked for a year and this is the first time I have ever wanted to post something to it, so I choose it to be this, and I ask of your help. How can I show him that I want a true chance at being with him, how can I do this when distance still seperates us. Reddit, he is someone that comes along once in a lifetime and I'm not willing to look closer. (Cause trust me, I have.) 

What do I do?

TL;DR

Finally met a guy I have been interested in for a year at a convention. Fell in love with him, yet he isn't ready for a relationship. What do I do?

I'd say forget her, but she left quite an impression — and she sends me photos of her garden and checks in on me at least every other day now, so it seems like I did too.

She recently told me she's concluded she doesn't have time for romance due to school; she deleted her dating profile, even. I think she's saying it won't work til the summer when she has more time, and doesn't exactly want to be rid of me but doesn't want to give me false hopes either.

I've never been particularly good at picking up the signs at when a girl might be attracted to me, although it's gotten better with time. There is this one girl at the moment though, who has me baffled. I've known her for maybe 7 months now, although we aren't particularly close at all. I only see her when she's out with the friend we have in common. She has always been pretty nice to me, nothing out of the ordinary though.

A month or so ago, while at the bar, we were discussing something and I jokingly said ""F**k you!"" because that's what happens when you drink margarita's, and she responded ""go ahead, it's been way too long."" I didn't really think anything of it, although I was a bit disarmed, she's a very good looking girl. 

Fast forward to a more recent date, and a bunch of us are hanging out, drinking beer and watching TV. I'm on the couch, she's on floor, and her leg runs into my foot, and she just keeps it there, which set off some of the probably too sensitive alarms in my head. Later that night, when the living room is packed, we are both on the couch, and she decides to use my legs to heat up her feat, as well as a lot more physical contact, although most of it seemed to be after telling a joke. Normally I would dismiss it as just that but not many relatively sober people grab my face or sort of stroke my shoulder. 

Normally, I would just dismiss this as friendly, I know a girl who does this all the time and I know she means it in a friendly nature. The thing that throws me off is we aren't particularly good friends, I mean I see her once a month, and even most of my friend's don't try to warm themselves up using my body heat. 

I hope this is the correct subreddit for this, any help you could give would be greatly appreciated.

It's a middle sized office and we are about 80% male employees. I have gotten to know most of the people that work there, both the females and the males, but there is this one girl that is extra friendly to me.

We chatter about almost everything during coffee breaks and lunch and seem to have the same weird humour. We also commute from the same location together and she usually sit next to me on the train too. Besides this she comes and sit next to me during lunch every day. If it should happen that we don't sit together she looks at me and smiles from the place she is sitting even when she's talking to other people. At company parties she also allways hang around with me.

I like her alot, she's very attractive and have a very good personality. Therefore I'm thinking about asking her out outside of work, to discover if it could develope to something else. I know our bosses would not care, heck - some of our bosses are even married together. What I'm more worried about is if we start dating and things go wrong, and then have to see each other at work and even on the train every day.

I am, by all accounts, regular and well adjusted... so, what am I missing?",11,1,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/198kdf/im_nearly_30_yr_old_male_and_havent_had_sex_or/,"Background:
As the title says, it's been ~10 years since I've been in a relationship.  My previous and only one lasted ~3 years and split due to distance.  Since then I have moved around a lot, traveled to over a dozen countries, and have finally been in the same place now for around five years.  My job is stable, I am very good at saving money as well.

Social life:
I have a decent number of friends of both genders.  I am not ""friend zoned"" by any of my female friends.  I have no issue making friends, and while I am an introvert I can sustain a conversation.  While my friends might describe me as ""odd"" it would be a term of endearment.  The best compliment I have ever gotten in my opinion was ""you're the most grounded and honest person I know"".  I'm not a fuck up, I've never done hard drugs and my family is typical and drama free.

Dating attempts:
For years I never bothered to even try and date... so that accounts for ~5 of 10.  But recently I thought perhaps I should.  I've been on numerous first dates.  None have been awkward.  I have both played the role of the person who talks a lot(if the other person isn't as strong on conversation)  and the person who listens (I once listened intently adding only occasionally bits relevant to her conversation for two hours) and everything in between.  Only once has a woman been forward in saying ""Nah, I don't think this is going to work, but we could still be friends"".  Numerous times despite seeming to want and agreeing to set up a second date, it never happens.  The couple times it has gone further I've simply become friends with them... and still am.  Not friend zoned because I'm not interested in sleeping with them, but never the less friends.

I don't lack self confidence, but I am not arrogant.  I am sure of myself, but always willing to question what I do.  I might be shy at first, but have no problem expressing myself as an individual.
I'm not a ""nice guy"" who expects anything in return for anything either.  I'll pay for both of us unless she stops me, in which case we split.  I don't sit around wondering ""why don't women want to sleep with me, they must be stupid"".  
I'm not a clinger.  I don't send creepy or repeated texts, and I can let things go very easily.

I don't blame society, it's clearly something on me... hence the post.  So, given by all accounts I seem to be so ""normal"", how have I been unable to even have a girl interested in me at all... even one I wouldn't welcome the advances of.

TL:DR I am by other people's standards a good person, no one seems interested in me... what's up with me?

I am firmly in the friendzone with my best female friend. Her and I have a good friendship and I've always been interested in her. We've hooked up a few times over the past couple years but only when we were really drunk. Afterward she's made it clear that she only wants to be just friends. 

Now, for the most part, I'm fine with this. I have plenty of female friends and don't have a problem with them. My situation is that this girl is not just any female friend, she's my best friend. She's my closest friend on campus. I'm much closer to her than I am with any of my male friends. The thing is I don't know what to do. 

I know she isn't interested in me romantically. I don't know if there's anything I can do to change that. Probably not. And I'm fine with that. The problem is that I'm always hanging out with her. We spend time together almost every day whether it is eating together or studying together etc.

I don't like this. I feel like I'll never be able to get over her as long as her and I are hanging out and being friends. I had a long conversation with her about this last semester when I was drunk one night. I told her that we shouldn't be friends. That it was hard for me etc. Didn't work. We hardly went any time without hanging out together. 

This is so hard for me because she is such a close friend. Plus I'm practically in love with her. And when we do go a long time without hanging out I get sad. 

I don't know what to do here reddit. How do I end a friendship of 3+years without feeling like an asshole?

Edit: Here's the main problem. She's friends with my friends. As a group of friends I can expect to see her often. Basically I can tell her I don't want to be friends but it will be hard to maintain.

I was so sure of things up until last night.

This is the part that really bothers me. After getting back from a date, we continue talking and I feel comfortable enough to tell her about my story and being molested. I did this because I wanted to let her know so she will understand why I might seem timid or frightened sometimes. After opening up and being at my most vulnerable she turns around and says thanks, then goes on to say she isn't looking for a relationship or anything. I guess something changed her mind. I talked to our mutual friend who tried to set us up and they were really confused. They went off on they own to try to figure out what happened but didn't hear anything yet.

I'm fine having a conversation with friends that are girls and a few strangers but I'm kinda lost when it comes to dating.

I have some friends telling me that I should wait a few days so that I don't seem eager, and some tell me to text her immediately before she loses interest. I know she's going out of town next weekend so if I were to ask her out it would have to be before or after she leaves. I also have no idea where to take her since, I only know of fast food places in town but I'm not sure that's date appropriate and I don't have a car since I live on campus and everything I do is pretty much on campus.

We're both college students if that helps at all.

My basic questions are:

1) When should I text her?

2)What should I say?

3) Where are some generally good places to go on a first date on a college budget?

**Update**

Ok so my parent's came over today which didn't give me a chance to text her cause I was showing them around the city, and going on a small outdoors trek. However, while I was showing them around she texted me a simple ""Hey :)"" which did catch me by surprise and we had a short conversation about school and I explained to her that I was showing my parents around which she was cool with.

I've known this girl (N) for about 4 years now. Just this year, we've gotten close, and she's the type of girl who like everyone, but doesn't have many close friends. Now it turns out, me and N are both quite close, where we are quite personal now. Here's where things get complicated, I REALLY like this girl, but I dont think these feelings are mutual. And because of this, I tend to get desperate time, and say things I immediately regret. For instance today, we were talking at lunch, and I bring up her Ex's, she immediately gets a bit embarrassed, and says something along the lines of ""I regret telling you things"". She then leaves the table, but returns about 10 seconds later. Still a bit awkward, but after a while things get back to normal, (and after this ordeal, she starts acting extra friendly towards me for like 20 minutes until I have to go).


Another thing with this girl, she doesn't go out much, and when she does it's usually with me, or one of her other two friends (both girls). Anyway, what always seems to happen is that we meet up on the weekend, we both really enjoy our time, and always end up talking that night for a while just about random things. Anyway for some reason, during school she tends not to act as close towards me, and I always seem to piss her off. Then the weekend comes, and we love each other again, and the cycle repeats.
Also another thing to consider is that me and N's parents have started to get close, her parents love me, and my parents love her. Anyway we went out for dinner as a who family, and we both agreed we loved it (this was last weekend). This weekend we're planning on going out for dinner, with her two friends (who are also my close friends).


Her two friends both have told me she has no romantic feelings towards me, which although does hurt, is completely fine. But I for some reason just don't her to be a friend... Moving on, we do indeed joke a lot, and sometimes our jokes are along the lines of ""let's get engaged"" or ""when we're married...."" Yesterday she made a joke along the lines of ""let's start our relationship now"". Anyway yea, I really have no idea what to do. I really like her, but she doesn't like me the same way, now I'm afraid our friendship might be in jeopardy because I always end up saying something I regret.


PS While I'm typing this, she's playing a joke with me by going on and off skype to mess with me (obviously as a joke though)

I had to tell her, otherwise I would be even more miserable heap than I am now. Her quiet reply was that then I am probably the first one who has ever loved her.

We met almost a year ago and I almost immediately fell for her, got rejected, thought I got completely over it, and then over time she became my best friend, my feelings came back and now I have loved her for some time. Love is not a word I say to just about anyone. So far there has been only two people, one who I dated on/off through my teens and one who I dated for two years at the end of four-year (BA, MSc) university.

She has repeatedly said that she could not wish for anyone better than me but the times when I have told her I like her she has rejected me (first in June/July, then Christmas). And no, she has not tried to ""seduce"" me or anything either. I was afraid that this would happen and normally when I fall for someone and get rejected, I move on and if needed then break contact for some time to get over it.

But my problem is that she really has become my best friend. Despite my unmet feelings towards her last year in general was great and I did some of the most fun and interesting things that I have done in my whole life - mostly with her. I can be myself with her, I can get her to come and try all kinds of new or wacky things with me and she likes most of them as I do. Just tonight she said tonight when we talked about our feelings she listed that as one of the best things about me and told me in so many ways how she likes me for who I am and would not want to lose me. Though, she also said that she is afraid that she will lose me because of my feelings towards her.

She also got out of a (mentally abusive) six year relationship a month before we met last year so in January/February. Although she was the one to leave it has still taken her quite a lot to get over it and she says that she is still probably not completely over it. But no, she does not say for me to wait or anything evil like that. But she does say that the next time she will get into a relationship will probably take quite a lot of time and she will be extra super picky about it. Though, who knows - she might fall for someone next week and that would be it, that's just how the world works.

So to close off this rant, I do not know what to do. How can I tell my heart not to love this girl because all that love goes to waste and only hurts me.

I know  I'm probably going to get a lot of weird messages because of this. ,,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_164jon,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/164jon/am_i_overly_sexual_for_my_age/,

We hit it off really well from the beginning, and seem to have a lot in common. I'm kind of afraid she might be taking advantage of me, though. The last few weeks we have been spending a lot of time together. We've went out to the bar about 4 times, ate out a few times, and I've cooked her probably a dozen meals at my house. So far, aside from one meal she cooked for me, I have paid for everything, and she doesn't offer. I like seeing her, but it's breaking the bank. Is it too soon for me to think she should start helping out a little? Any ideas of how I might approach the subject without sounding like a dick?

It's been about 6 years since I was in a new relationship, so it's hard for me to remember how things started. Is this just the norm?

She's gorgeous and we just bounce off each other really well. We were having a playful argument at work and I bet her if she was wrong she'd have to buy me dinner at this nice restaurant or vice versa. I won. A week or so later we meet up for lunch and we pretty much only stopped talking because I had to leave. Later that night I text her thanking her and telling her I had fun. And then she texts me back saying she did too and that we should definitely do this again.

A few days later I text her to initiate a second date next week but she says that week will be too tough. But then she starts getting flaky and dodgy, and I don't really know why. Eventually I just give up asking because I don't deserve to be treated like that and didn't know why I was wasting my time worrying about it. At work, I felt sort of awkard at first, but then really let it go I stopped trying to show her interest, but wasn't mean or ignoring her either, I just let conversation happen when it happened.

I noticed that, after about a day of that, she started sort of going out of her way to say hi to me and goodnight to me at work. Then Wednesday night, a bunch of us went out after work. I got there later than everyone. I noticed her right away but just ignored her and went to talk with some other friends. After that, she came up to the table, and out of my peripheral vision I could see her looking at me trying to get my attention. When that didn't work she came around the table and hugged me and started talking with me.

After a beer or so I sort of went into DGAF mode and went up to her and started chatting. We were teasing each other like we used to do, but I was initiating a little more physically and she was just laughing, teasing back, and wasn't shying away from my advances.

As the night went on we eventually split up and started talking to other people. And as the night ended I mentioned that I had walked and she said that her car was over to the side. I took what seemed like an indirect invitation and asked for a ride.

She took me home and we sat in the car talking for awhile--my arm just resting on her knee or something. Some how the talk turned to me and my trouble with women, I told her I was a virgin, only ever kissed 1 girl twice that wasn't while acting, never had a girlfriend, etc.

At some point during this, we transitioned and I told her I had a crush on her. After which I think the exact lines I used were, ""I've never had sex before and I don't have a large penis but I like you."" (That got a laugh and endearing smile from her.) That lead into us talkin about it, a lot and we were laughing and joking about a lot of things. At one point I mentioned that I know I'm horribly awkward physically but that I'll get better. To which she responded by telling me I'm super physical and great at letting a girl know that I'm into her. That obviously sort of spiked my courage and I started having my hand on her leg, grabbing her hand, holding her face, playing with and kissing her ears/neck throughout the rest of the conversation. She would smile, blush, laugh, giggle to this but told me she didn't wasn't going to kiss me.

I know she's insecure, about dating in or any sort of serious fashion so I was being open to that and told her all I wanted was a second date to see where things could go between us. If she could just be open to it. To which she would get this sad look in her eye, and shake her head or say no. I'd ask why and she'd give me some bullshit answer, that I'd turn around on her (I'm pretty whitty) and make her laugh. She started even trying to give me reasons (which again were all bullshit) why I shouldn't like her and I just kept using whit to make her laugh and roll her eyes. At one point she even exclaimed ""God, you're so fucking cute!"" But her answer kept staying the same no matter how many times I asked.

I even admitted that I wrote a monologue about her. And she asked me to tell her it, (I had it mostly memorized). I did and she laughed at all the parts she was supposed to laugh at, and afterwards she said something to the effect of ""Wow, that was really good"" with this sort of exacerbated look on her face as she leaned back in her seat. But even after all of that, the answer stayed the same. Mind you, the mood never really changed the whole time, it was really positive despite being turned down about a 1000 times. 

When I finally decided to call it a night, I kissed her hand, and said good night. But I never really felt negative about it. Actually I felt really elated. I know she told me no about a million times, but every sign she seems to give me is that she really is in to me. She's never said we should just be friends, or asked me to stop kissing her, or even asked me to stop asking. So later that night I texted her and told I'm going to keep fighting for her, to which I didn't expect a response and got none.

2 days pass without work and I see her. Obviously it's a little bit awkward, but then things get really nice and the only difference is there's a little bit more of this flirtatious look and smile she gives me than she used to. My goal was to start really flirting with her more physically/sensually at work to get her motor running, and stop asking her and just go for it with her.

My problem is that I have a hard time with flirting and getting sexual sort of in general because I get scared of it with it being so new to me. I get worried of offending her or something like that.

So all of that to ask 2 questions:

How can I ""appropriately"" touch and flirt and sort of get her aroused while we're working (we're both servers btw so there's a lot of passing by each other in cramped spaces)?

Should I even still be fighting for her or should I honestly just give up?

(Additional info: i'm a 22 year old female).

I've been friends with a guy for over 3 years. In the past I told him I liked him but he rejected me, then I had a bf for 2+ years and didn't talk to him much during that time, also he had a gf during that time. But we're both single now. And ever since, we've talked a lot (mostly facebook chat), we've gone out 3 times, twice to the movies and also had lunch together, he's paid for pretty much everything, except the last time, because we had an arrangement where he paid for the movies and i paid for a shared pizza for the both of us.

The thing is, i don't know if he's just being friendly or more... because of 3+ years ago, that he said he didn't like me but now it's being different between us, he offers to pay, we shared a taxi and he drove me home, also the times we've gone out he always sends me a few SMS's to make sure he got home safe (because I tell him to, i say stuff like ""if you can, please let me know when you arrive home"" and he does). He opens the doors for me, in the movies our shoulders touch and neither he or I move away that closeness. We didn't have that kind of relashionship before, we only used to talk, rarely... And of course, we talk a lot now (fb chat), also sometimes he stays up late with me, not doing much and actually last night he encouraged me to go to sleep because it was really late (like 4am) and he was tired and wanted to go to sleep but didn't want me to stay there awake on my own or something, so the only reason he was still awake, was because he was talking to me...

I invited him to go see 'The Hobbit' with me last week and i plan to invite him again to another place if he doesn't make a move any time soon. But we're friends and he's rejected me before, i'm not really sure if all of this means anything, i'm afraid to ask him again if he likes me or not and make awkward the friendship we've got.

NOTE: Three years ago, he gave me reasons of why he didn't like me back: 1. i was a bit taller than him, 2. i was childish to him, but 3. i was a really fun person (something like that). I confronted him about it a few months ago, told him that he thought i was immature and he said that he was wrong then and had low self-esteem.

So that's the story.

I'd be honored to read any comment, advice or help you could give me... Do you guys think he likes me or not?, Should I risk our friendship (again)?, What do you recommend me to do? Also, any dating advice you could share with me, it's really appreciated!

I've been seeing this wonderful man [23M] lately for about a month now, we've been on 3 dates. The dates are just coffee/lunch but we have a lot of fun.

I'm not expecting him to be ready for a relationship just yet, but even just a ""I want to keep seeing you"" works for me.  He's still hurt from a past relationship which is why I definitely don't want to rush things, but I also feel uncomfortable to keep dating if I'm not sure where we stand.

Started a fwb situation about 2 months ago when we hooked up after a party.

We've been hanging out every weekend since then, and we've moved from just meeting up for sex to meeting at bars and then sex, then meeting up, hanging out then sex. He's even met some of my friends through the bars and came to a party at my house once.

Well, the extra talking/hangout time has continued, and recently he actually put his arm around me/kissed me at the bar when we met up.

We've obliquely discussed the relationship thing when another fwb (call him Mark) wanted to hook up with me a few weeks ago. He said he wouldn't like it, but I can do what I want to. He hasn't hooked up with anyone else over this period of time, but he said (a while ago) that he doesn't want to start a relationship because he wants to go to grad school overseas and doesn't want a LDR.

I am starting to kind of want a...casual relationship, I guess? As in go out to dinner together, actually meet more friends, but it can end when he leaves to go overseas.

I guess I just don't know how to approach this. I already have monogomy from him, if only by default, so it would just be making this a bit more official.

An additional complication is that Mark is gonna be in town over winter break and wants to hook up while we are here. I am not sure what to do about Mark either way.

TL;DR: In a FWB situation that is starting to turn into more, but previous FWB is around wanting to hook up. If this becomes more official, I won't hook up with him, if not, then I probably will. Thoughts?

Thank you!


EDIT: almost forgot this - totally over the crush. It was an idealization thing because I wasn't as confident in HS as I was now, and he was just unattainable enough to like, but attainable enough to talk to me like a friend. I don't know if he knows about the crush or not.

1355199049.0,8,self.dating_advice,14nb5r,My best friend is becoming more than 'just a friend' what should I do about this?,13,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/14nb5r/my_best_friend_is_becoming_more_than_just_a/,"Sorry about the long story, I just think that it all will make more sense if you know the back story as well as the problem. 

 Okay...well, first off, I am a 17 year old girl who has a guy best friend whom just turned 16, let's call him Michael. I've known Michael for about 5 years now, and recently, things have become more impassioned between us then ever before.

 It all started about a year ago when he came over to my house for the thousandth time. Something was different about him, like he was flirty and wanted to constantly touch me (like hugging, touching my hips, and being a kissing distance away etc.) he still acted himself, talking wise, but his body language was totally different opposed to at school, around others, and our group.
 
I have two other best friends as well, whom are both girls. let's call them Rose, and Margret. Michael, Rose, Margret and I all hang out together often around our neighborhood. Around them, Michael and I don't act all flirty. We are just our normal jovial selves. Laughing, joking around, and talking like there is nothing going on. Now, because we are a group, we all share stories and secrets that no one else knows. So therefore, Margret and Rose both know that Michael and I have, or may have a thing. ""We can just see it. The way you look at each other, Honestly it's hard to NOT see."" They think that we should take things slowly, though. And I agree, I don't want to jump into something that may ruin the friendship we have.
 
Anyway, Michael started to come over more and more. It soon became to just watching a movie, to snuggling, and watching a movie. Then from snuggling and watching a movie, to wrestling, laying on each other, and almost kissing A LOT and watching a movie. Then after those things happened, he started to be flirty with me, around Rose! So far, he has not been passionate to me around anyone else... Margret says that Michael doesn't act this way when they are alone together, and same with Rose. When they asked him about what's going on between him and I, he just said, ""Nothing, her and I are just friends.""
 
When Margret and Rose told me that he only thought of me as a friend, I then thought the reason why he was doing all of those things, was because of stupid teenage hormones. 
 
But there is something else, Michael and I have admitted before that he or I like each other, but it has always been at separate times. For instance, I would admit that I like him at one point, when he has interest in someone else. Then when I get over him and into a different person, he would admit that he likes me. So, it's just this semi-mutual conflict that we keep having.
 
Recently, Michael came over again. That time, EVERYTHING was aberrant and intense. I put a movie on, but honestly, I don't remember what it was about, or what we were even watching. Michael and I were so preoccupied with ourselves it was uncanny. He was literally all over me, Michael started licking me, (not down there...) playfully biting me, messaging me, pulling me over him, kissing my neck, tickling me, and he even grabbed my boobs, ass and stuff. But for some reason, I liked it, and totally allowed it. (I did the same to him too of course, sort of...) After about 5 hours of doing those things, it was going on 11:30 and he said he had to go check on some pets he was babysitting. He then said, ""But before I leave, can I do something?"" I looked at him confused and thought to myself what else is there he wants to do that wont go too far off the 'friend zone'? I told him ""Sure."" Curiously awaiting what he plans to do next. Michael looks at me with the most amorous look I have ever seen before in my life, he leans in, and kisses me. Pretty soon, that affectionate kiss turns into an impassioned and fervent make-out. That went on for about 11 seconds, before I stopped him. I looked at him, confused on what had just happened, but also satisfied. He said, ""You have been wanting to do that for the longest time haven't you?"" looking at me like he just did me a favor. Unconsciously, I answered ""Yes!"" Michael hugged my tightly and whispered, ""That's okay, I have too.""
 
The next day, I immediately told Rose and Margret what Michael and I did. They weren't very surprised. They told me that we should either date, or just stay friends. They say that the middle part between friendship and dating could cause a big problem. But honestly, I like the middle part right now.. They also told me that Michael has to decide on what he wants to do, but the last couple days he hasn't said much about it. I mean, we still talk and stuff, and when I asked him what we are going to do about this, and how he feels about the whole thing. He told me he doesn't know what he's feeling, that he has no clue on what to do, or what to say. And he's afraid that if we date, that we might ruin our friendship. He said our friendship is more important to him. And I agree, our friendship IS more important, but after what happened my feelings are conflicting.
 
 This is the first time something like this has ever happened to me. I don't understand how to take this correctly, and honestly, I don't know if I want to date my best friend. It just seems, well, weird Y'know? I want to date Michael, but I also don't! I like that we can do things with each other and not be nervous or shy, but I also am afraid that I will change my mind. (teenage hormones do that...) What am I to do???? How are we going to get through this? Any advice on how to get through to him? How to know if he is just being hormonal or not? (like tell me whether or not he wants to date me) or, How I know I WANT to date him? Should I date my best friend? Anything? Please!

Primarily, I'm wondering if I'm ""settling"" for this girl, out of the embarrassment and discomfort from never having a relationship. I've already had an unhealthy obsession with a female friend who turned out to be a not very genuine person, I'd like to think this girl has more integrity and I'm four years older and a little more levelheaded.

I'm just looking for some advice from people with experience, any feedback would be appreciated.

I met a guy a couple of months ago and we got pretty close and have been sleeping together.  He lives a few hours away but comes to visit every couple of weeks or so for a few days at a time (he's also friends with my housemates).  We hang out, cuddle, talk a lot and have sex and it's all quite relationship-y.  We also text/FB a fair amount when we're apart. 

I really really enjoy his company and have more feelings for him than I'd like to, however I know I am certainly not in the right place for a proper relationship.  I've definitely made this clear to him and he has carried on coming round and keeping things the way they are.  My close friends are very insistent that he likes me a lot and I would certainly say that his behaviour and the things he says at least indicate he has feelings for me - during the first conversation I had about what we were doing, he said he would have liked to give things a go and seemed pretty sad about it.

As a result my dilemma is thus: Am I being unfair to him by letting this carry on, or am I justified on the basis that he is making an informed decision?  We get on really, really well and the company is very natural (and the sex is awesome) and so I'm reluctant to cut things off but am very aware that I may be being a total dick.

This is me:

During prom:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/44KTD)

So about 3 months ago I got dumped. The guy basically said that he liked me more as a friend. The relationship was 3 months long and I told him that I liked him first and he said, at the time, that he liked me too. 

In my 18 years of life I had two people ask me out. Once when I was 16 and once recently, but I turned the guy down because I wasn't over my ex. 

I had my first BF when I was 16 and had to end it because my parents we're strict and it was hard for me to go out on dates with him. That one lasted about 5months and I had to break up with him because I felt that I couldn't give him what he wanted. 

I am no in my first year of university and I have no confidence in my looks. I feel as if it is impossible for me to ever get asked out or have someone I like like me back because I'm shy. 

I've  basically been told that with out make up I'm not going to attract any guys. I am very inexperienced with make up and it takes me forever to do the most basic things. I also just don't have the time for it in the mornings and it irritates my eyes. 

I feel like I'm basically going to be forever alone because I don't have a huge chest like other girls and I play video games quite a bit. 

I think I might get put into the friend category quite a bit because I've always been kind of a tom boy. 

I feel like its hard to meet guys now because, in university you see a guy maybe once or twice a week. It's hard to get to know someone. I'm also shy so I havent joined any clubs yet. 

When I'm around new people I tend to wait for people to come to me because I'm too afraid of saying hi. If im around people I dont know I'm really quite but once I get to know someone I become quite out going. 

So reddit what do you think?

We've both confessed our love for each other but there are issues that I am not sure how to deal with and am making me start to wonder what is going on.

First, she still wears her wedding ring. I understand this but my friends do not. I would never ask her to remove it but I am worried about an upcoming xmas party at my company. I know its just looks, but company politics has a way of turning nasty. Second, I have yet to visit her home. Anytime we are together she is at my place. Third, she is worried about going to places near where she lives due to her friends seeing her. So we avoid them. I get the impression she is ashamed that she is dating someone else since her friends were friends of both her late husband and her. She did however tell me her friends were asking her out (male friends).

Last night, we both went out separately. I told her to get ready for some drunk texting and she freaked. She said she doesn't lock her phone and her friends might see it. She even said she would just leave her phone in the car. It was the first time that I sat back and started thinking about the situation. I am a very relaxed guy, but it's starting to add up and making me wonder.

So, I have two choices. I either let it go which might cause a build up of animosity and make me just vanish, or I confront her about it. However, due to her being a widow, I really have no idea what to say. I feel that I have no right to ask her to do things, but I know if it continues I will pull a disappearing act and I do not want to let her go.

[25F]...[28/F]",15,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1330da/cliche_hot_for_teacher_but_i_think_shes_into_me/,"So, I've got a pretty hot professor. I know the general consensus on reddit is ""don't go there,"" but in this situation I don't feel like it would be totally implausible. 

1) I wouldn't attempt anything until the semester is over.

2) Our department is pretty lax on student/teacher fraternizing.

3) She's an adjunct professor and is leaving (like, the state) after spring semester.

However, we're both chicks.. which adds a layer of complexity.

I know she likes me (in a platonic sense) but I've been treating things as just a fun crush until recently. She doesn't read as gay to me (I don't really come off as gay either) and she's mentioned men a few times (not like a current boyfriend).

There's a lot of flirty/teasing banter and we have common interests (she seems kind of.. ""impressed"" that I'm familiar with/into some of her specific favs). She's asked about personal life stuff, and after class one day we were joking around and the conversation led to what years we were in high school - she asked when I graduated. I said something like ""holy shit, we would have been in high school together!"" There's been times when I've said things like ""hey let's talk ___ stuff!!"" and she'd laugh and say ""later!""

Recently I've also noticed her checking me out. A few of us were hanging around after class one day and some guy was telling this long-winded story. I was paying attention to the dude talking and saw her staring at me out of the corner of my eye. I looked over, made eye contact, and looked away. I saw her looking again, and made eye contact long enough so she knew I'd caught her. After she looked away THAT time, I flipped things around and gave her the stare so I'd intentionally be ""caught"" when she looked over again. The eye contact tag's been going since.

If I'm reading this right and she IS interested (and I'll be a frank asshole here, I'm pretty attractive), I want to go for this.

I'm unsure about the best way to make a move where my intentions are clear. With women, there tends to be a lot of ""ambigu-dates.""

Should I make subtle hints for the rest of the semester that don't cross the line of ""professionalism?"" I was thinking about hanging around after our final and asking her for drinks. 

But grades wouldn't be posted yet. 

But I also probably won't see her around after the final. Should I just shoot her an e-mail...? Seems kind of lame.

In about a month I will have been single for six years. My last relationship lasted 2 years. It was a good relationship. I lost my virginity to her. We still remain friends. But since her, I've been single. I went out on a few dates with two girls, but nothing serious. My sex life has been non-existent since my ex (which was a very active and healthy sex life). The longer I go without, the more awkward I think it might be when the occasion actually arises.

A few of my problems: 
I still live at home. This weighs on me quite heavily. At my age, I didn't think I'd still be home and I feel most girls would prefer a guy out on his own. I have a college degree, but I've yet to land a job in my field. I work part-time making a scrap wage at a grocery store. I hate the job. The type of people there are not the type of people you want to date.  I have been actively seeking a job to start my career since graduation last December. I don't get to meet a lot of people. My group of friends are a little older than myself and most are in committed relationships so I don't have a wingman. 

This has brought my self-esteem down a bit, though I'm pretty good at staying positive. I'm no Ryan Gosling but I do feel I'm half decent looking. I'm in shape. I'm a very kind and generous person.

I've tried the dating sites. I've been on and off OkCupid and POF for the last 5 years. I've had maybe a half dozen conversations, but never met anyone from them.

I'm not sure what I'm asking. I guess just any kind of advice. Thanks in advance.

I smoke weed on the regular (Everything from a joint before bed to spending whole afternoons high), I've done psychedelics probably 10-15 times this year, MDMA probably 1-2 a month on the average and cocaine maybe 5-10 times a year. I never touch speed or pills (benzos, strong painkillers etc) and I've stopped experimenting with new drugs or research chemicals as I'm happy with the drugs I know and use regularly.  

I don't look like I do drugs (apart from when I'm on some of them..), I do sports/work out regularly, I go to a good university and I'm a pretty normal chilled out guy. I know that some people will never accept me as normal (or worth having any kind of relationship with) because of my drug use, and that's fine. We've all got different opinions. However, I've found a lot of people who initially was somewhat horrified learning my story with drugs becoming very accepting of me and the fact that I use drugs once they've gotten to know me a bit and see that I'm not flushing my life down the drain because of drugs. In other instances I have experienced people completely rejecting me/blocking me out when they learned about my drug use early on in our relationship.

This was because a really cool 30-year-old guy and I had five-starred each other's profiles on there, but I was hesitant to message him at first, thinking I was too old for him.

Thanks to your input, I went ahead and sent him a note, we had a great conversation, and wound up going out later that week. The physical chemistry when we met was off the charts, and we wound up hanging out together until dawn.

Since then, we've been out several times. Sometimes we just talk for hours; at other times we go on more traditional dates. No matter where we're at or what we're doing, it's been incredibly fun spending time with him and getting to know him better.

A few days ago, he told me he deactivated his profile since he said he likes to only seriously date one person at a time. (I'd already deactivated mine due to creepers/douchebags messaging me incessantly.) I cut the other dates I had planned loose and have agreed to date him exclusively.

He is, thus far, everything I'd been looking for in a match--kind, intelligent, laid-back, into a lot of similar things, incredibly funny, and is all about enjoying the moment. (Also: Smoking hot, but that's just a nice bonus on an already awesome guy. :D)

Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you all so much. I might not have taken the chance on messaging him otherwise, and would have missed out on making a connection with him. Even if we don't wind up together long-term (I'm optimistic, though), it's been utterly amazing, and has let me know that sometimes age really isn't a big deal when two people click.

Anyone remember a thread a while back called [Wondering if she's into you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/iq1qa/wondering_if_shes_into_you/) You may have seen it when it first posted about a year ago, or you may have seen it in r/dating_advice&gt;top&gt;all-time at any point since then.

I had a lot of fun answering your questions, gentlemen, and I really enjoyed being able to help out in an area that could be called murky, if by murky you mean completely illogical and ranging from 3 to 5 [Cuils](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7da5i/police_raids_reveal_baby_farms/c06cqxb) at any given time.

I got loads of questions in the thread that day, that week, that month, and even months and months later, after the thread was archived, through private messages. I tried to be as thorough as possible with each and every question, and I believe I got to all of them, though there were so many.

One of the moderators(was he a mod? I think so...) asked if I was interested in writing up some general FAQ-type articles on the subject of dating in general that could be posted on this subreddit's sidebar. I was thrilled with the idea, but my schedule was hectic and I never did get around to it. I also tossed around the idea of a dating advice blog.

And dammit, Reddit, I'm tired of putting it off. I'm starting that blog!

**My question to all of the gentlemen of r/dating_advice is, what do you want to know more about? What kind of articles can I write that will be most helpful to you?**

So far, I think I'd like to do the following articles: 

* Why Nice Guys Finish Last
* Relationship Red Ring of Death (the Friend Zone)
* How to Tell if She's Interested
* Clever Date Night Ideas
* How to Ask the Girl Behind the Counter
* How to Talk to Strangers
* The ""B"" Word (Girls with Boyfriends)


Let me know if you second any of these motions, or have a topic that doesn't fall under these categories that you'd really like explained.

I want to thank all of you in this subreddit for keeping me so entertained, sending me those out-of-the-blue private messages ten months after the original post and just generally being great, supportive people. Let me know what I can do to help!

We met through OkCupid's local app feature.  She was out with two other female friends, and we had a good time and I really liked her, but I had to leave to meet up with my friends at a party, so we both agreed to meet up the next weekend.  She had to work the day we went out, and the morning before the date cancelled and said she couldn't make it.  I thought that was reasonable enough she may have been tired after working all day, and not up to going out.  We rescheduled for a date tonight.

However, two days ago she texts me and asks if she can bring along her friends and if I was cool with that.  I gave her some playful teasing, but said it was cool.  By the end of the text exchange I asked her if the time we had was still good for her and there has been no response since.  Prior to that the texts were quickly being responded to.  

My instinct tells me she plans to bail and is no longer interested.  I should have told her if she wanted to hang out with her friends, go ahead.  I'm pretty sure she lost interest in me because I agreed to let her bring her friends along. My friends are going out tonight, and there are other options for me dating wise, but I really did click with this girl and I wanted to see if we could work. But her behavior seems very suspect and flaky, and I feel she's behaving a little selfish.  Granted we're strangers, but who pulls this kind of thing?

Now flash forward to yesterday, we had a little study session/date where we went out for frozen yogurt and studied together and finished the night at a burger joint for dinner, I dropped her off after. I thought she had a good time. Now today she was saying that some of her friends also wanted to go to the movie, so I checked for her and the tickets are sold out, I let her know and she cancelled on me. Where do I go from here?

I feel like I'm not good enough for someone to look at me as more than a fuckbuddy. My friends tell me this is a first world problem, but I just can't seem to attract girls like they do. They'll have girls blowing up their phones, hanging on them in public etc. while mine seem to be limited to private booty calls with the girls wanting nothing to do with me in public or group settings.

I'm a little over weight and I have terrible posture I've been working on)?? I'm not trying to be a man whore, but I mean, if a girl is dtf..

We are sexually active, but we haven't talked about exclusivity.

Yesterday I was at the gym and a girl we'll call Emily asked me to teach her how to do proper squats. After working out together for a little while, we went and got pizza then took a leisurely stroll. We exchanged numbers and kissed each other.

Now for a little introduction: 
I'm taking the advice of you fine redditors and am going to ask her out after class tomorrow. I'm a junior in college and she is a sophomore in my class. We've had small conversations here and there, but we meet eye contact regularly. Thinking of something along the lines of ""Hey, I just wanted to say you seem really cool. It's a shame I didn't get a chance to talk to you more this Quarter. So, I'm Seth."" If she seems receptive and genuinely happy to meet me, then I'll follow up with, ""I was wondering if you'd like to hang out some time. Get coffee maybe"". I hope this sounds good because I've basically repeated it in my head a million times. Never done this before. 

I think I know what to do if I get a ""yes"": Get her number and then say I'll call her and we'll figure it out.

But what I don't know is how I should appropriately respond to her saying ""no"": That's fine. Maybe we'll have a class next Quarter and we can talk then. Have a nice day. *smile*

Also, does ""I don't know"" generally mean that she isn't interested or that she's indecisive. I wouldn't want to be pushy or give up too easy, depending.

I think I can handle it if she says she has a boyfriend. Maybe...

Of the twelve I do not know, there is one particular male (I think 21 years old) that has caught my attention. He is very attractive, and I have seen positive posts about him on my facebook news feed. I also recently saw he is a redditor, so this account is a throwaway.

The class itself is a more laid back class, and we have a lot of time to socialize with each other and our professor. I'd like to approach him and talk to him, but I am socially awkward and have no idea how to go about that. In addition, he is 99% of the time surrounded by the same 3/4 girls that are his friends. The other 1% of the time, he is with the professor. I've thought about trying to wait around after class to introduce myself, but he leaves with his friends. I feel like it would be awkward if I tried to introduce myself with all of them present.

Is there anything I can do to approach him in a more casual way, just to break the ice? What should I say? What can I do to make sure I don't start off on the wrong foot?

I 'went out' with the girl I mentioned in this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/tsgul/23m_how_to_escalate_past_just_friends/). Things could have gone worse but they could have gone a lot better. I didn't physically escalate as much as I wanted to. I hugged and managed to place my hand on her shoulder/back (she didn't seem to resist those) but I didn't get any further. I probably blew my opportunity (If I had one at all) but I may get another chance in the next couple days, I asked if she wanted to do something with me again next week and she said yes.  
 
  
It probably doesn't help that we are both pretty shy (her especially) so physical contact is just awkward. When/if I see her next I am just going to go straight for hand holding to start. If that goes well I want to lean in close like I want to whisper a secret in her ear and then kiss her on the cheek. If that doesn't work then at least I tried.  
  
But if that sounds like a terrible plan let me know.

1337248539.0,11,self.dating_advice,trfv5,Been making out and sleeping in the same bed as my best friend for over three months now but not going any further...Help me figure this one out.,11,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/trfv5/been_making_out_and_sleeping_in_the_same_bed_as/,"Him -- 29M. Me -- 23F.

**BACKGROUND**

We have been friends (very good friends) for about three years now. Our attraction to one another has kind of been off and on. For a while when we first met, I think he was attracted to me, but I was very busy with school and just not wanting a relationship. Then I became attracted to him but he had just started a new job and was working 80hour weeks and we didn't see each other much. So, bad timing.

Anyway, all that was almost three years ago.

We settled into being 'just friends' and that's the way we've been for quite some time. We hang out (alone together) ~once a week. Longest I've ever gone without seeing him is a month.

**It's gotten more hot and heavy lately**

However, in early Feb 2012, we were having kind of a sexy talk, talking about what porn we like to watch, etc. He got turned on and (french) kissed me. He apologized profusely but I told him over and over it was fine and I liked it. We slept in the same bed for the first time that night (no sex).

Almost every weekend since then, we have repeated the routine. 

* Hang out (we don't call it 'dating' but we have done basically every standard 'date' you can think of), 

* make out several times (~5 times per weekend) 

* and then we'll spend the night together in the same bed on Saturday night (wearing pajamas).

Buuuut we never go further. I know he is the type to take things slowly and he doesn't like casual sex. But isn't three months of making out and three years of sexual tension slow enough?

I guess my question is why hasn't he asked me to be his girlfriend yet and what can I do to speed things along? I am pretty positive he likes me. He almost always initiates the kissing and whenever we are together he is hard. Also he does literally everything he can to help me with any sort of problem I have. Spent ten hours putting together some furniture for me, for example.

I have tried to initiate and indicate that I would like to go further but I am not quite sure if I've made it clear to him. 

* After one of the first times we made out, I said 'want to do anything else?' and he responded 'yes I would love to, but we should take things slow' (this was back in February). To me, the ball's now in his court and honestly I expect him to make the next move. 

* I've also nonchalantly changed my clothes in front of him (he goes crazy and starts making out with me, but again -- just making out, nothing further).

* While lying in bed after making out, I've also subtly rested my hand on his hard cock (through jeans) and stroked it very slowly. I only did this for like three minutes though, it felt slightly rape-y to me even though my other guy friends assured me it was just fine to do this. Anyway he didn't complain or move my hand, but he didn't say or do anything about it.

Sooo what should I do next? I KNOW I should say something along the lines of 'okay, what's up, want to have sex?' but I was raised in a religious household (no longer religious, and neither is he for what it's worth) and I really try to be a sex-positive person but have a really hard time of shaking off the whole ""girls who want sex = sluts"" thing. I just want to get him to initiate.

Can anyone think of reasons he's acting this way? I've thought of micropenis (but after feeling that sucker, nope) or an STD (possible but we've been friends for so long I think I would have some inkling) or virgin (99.99% sure he is not).

What should I do!!

**TL;DR**

* Definitely attracted to one another

* Sleep in the same bed, kiss a lot, but never go further

* How can I move things along, preferably without directly asking for sex?",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_trfv5,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/trfv5/been_making_out_and_sleeping_in_the_same_bed_as/,

Let me explain. I met some friends from work out last night. There's a new girl who just moved to our city, and I've talked to her some before tonight. She sits by me at the bar, and we have a pretty good conversation going, its the most we've talked so far, and I was slowly starting to get that attraction feeling towards her.

Now, I'm an average, to slightly above average looking guy, I've come to terms with this. 

Enter one of my friends cousins. The guy is LITERALLY a Calvin Cline  model. He's modeled for other large companies too, like Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana, and Armani, just to name a few. Think Edward Cullen with a more normal face, lighter hair, and lighter eyes (someone else's observation, not mine). The guy is good looking ok.

Anyway, the girl from work pretty much starts tracking him as soon as he walks in. She leans over to my gay guy friend from work, they have one of those whispering conversations, and asks who he is (I was able to hear this part)

The rest of the night, she was fairly close to him, she seemed too shy to talk to him thought, and she had almost like a puppy dog look on her face when looking at him. Her and my gay friend were practically drooling over him, along with every female in the bar. (both myself and the model guy are straight by the way)

I just spent the rest of the night talking to my other friends, and having a good time. I would talk to her throughout the night too, but I'm not the kind of guy to try and force something to happen.

I didn't get pissed at the guy, it's not his fault he's so attractive, and she wants to be around him for it. I also talked to him some, he was very friendly, a cool guy by my judgement.

So did I handle this ok? How would someone else have handled it? Is there something you all would have done differently to keep her attracted?",,False,,t5_2s4kl,False,,,True,t3_sxf7o,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/sxf7o/how_to_handle_rival_thats_insanely_better_looking/,

I present myself very well online, so she assumes I'm also kicking ass at life, when the reality is I'm either depressed or just really lazy, recently dropped out of school and have no job while I live with my parents. Is there any way to be honest about my situation without making her want to turn tail and run? How should I broach this topic? Should I even try? Thank you, sincerely, for all responses. Long-winded details below.**

I'm 23, male, she's 21, female. 

I've been corresponding with this girl since the beginning of March. She contacted me on OKCupid, (the first girl to ever initiate a conversation with me since I made the profile in October or so) and we've been writing these letters back and forth ever since. 

So here's the thing. I'm a reasonably smart guy, and I tend to sound very smart via textual communication, so I typically do very well talking to girls online. This girl and I have been having an intellectually-stimulating conversation, throwing out all kinds of pretentious references to see how the other person keeps up, and just having fun. She's clearly just as much of a geek as me, so that's great. When she first messaged me at the start of March, I was still in school and telling myself that I wouldn't have to drop out, and my dating profile reflects that situation of being a normal/ambitious student.

The problem is, she's clearly also a high-achiever, with lofty goals that she'll probably meet, and all that sort of thing. She's going places with her life and she hasn't hit a major snag yet.

Me, well...I've been struggling all through university. I started out fairly strong in the honors program (4 year degree) with aspirations of going the Masters =&gt; PhD route and becoming a professor in the field of cultural studies or something similar. But throughout school I had a harder and harder time motivating myself to do assignments, go to class, and so on. I started dropping courses, or failing because I was too lazy to drop them, and ultimately dropped out entirely in my third year for a year and a half, during which time I did basically nothing. Then I went back, and have been slowly collecting enough credits to graduate with a general BA (3 year degree in English) which basically gets you nothing anyway, but at least I could put ""BA in English"" on my resume. However, this past semester, with just two courses to go, my motivation bottomed out again, and I'm a dropout once more.

Now, right around the time of this most recent dropout, my psychiatrist, who I see regularly because I'm diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD, decided that I must be depressed as well. This diagnosis wasn't, and still isn't as obvious as you might think since I have never been sad, certainly not remotely suicidal or anything like that. So I've been on Prozac for about a month, and so far have been feeling maybe a bit better, but not that much. It's a work in progress, obviously.

Now, this is important: I'm well-aware that this new lady friend of mine could, and most likely has, plenty of issues of her own. Everyone has their thing, no one is anywhere near as perfect as they pretend to be on online dating sites. I'm not that naive. *But*, I think it's reasonable for me to assume that this girl at least has her life together. I have always been drawn to this kind of person, and they to me. I know it could turn out this girl is a whole basket full of crazy or something, but I should prepare myself for the most likely scenario that she is pretty normal.

Anyway, it's getting to the point where it's going to make sense for us to meet up soon, and I have no idea how to broach this topic. 

*""So, you know how we've been enjoying crackling intellectual discourse for the past two months and you probably think I sound like an amazing guy who's well on my way to great things? Well, I actually dropped out of the subpar program and am now living with my parents and not even working at bestbuy because I'm either too lazy to look for work, or too mentally ill--possibly both! Anyway, wanna make out?""*

I say this in self-depreciating jest, and I realize that any admission is going to require a lot of tact, but I fear that no matter how I word it, it's basically going to come across like this.

So my question, at the end of this harrowing tale which you have my undying thanks for slogging through, is pretty much in the title and the TLDR. Is there any way to be honest with this girl about my situation without making her want to run the other way? Or should I not even talk about it at all and try to cleverly avoid things and be all mysterious? Normally in this situation I wouldn't even try to pursue women until I've got my own life together, but when one so awesome has come to me, it's very hard to just ignore.

He bought a toothbrush for me to have at his place, he wanted to introduce me to his parents one night (and that was after only hanging out for a couple of times)... so things went on and we really only could see each other once to twice a week.

So we'd see each other every friday night at karaoke (he is the dj) and we would hook up, but it wasn't without all the nice sweetness. It wasn't just wham bam and then off we go... 
Until recently he became more and more distant and went a whole week without texting to say hi, and i saw him that friday and spent the night with him and then the cycle started again.
With him i don't understand the sudden distance. So i questioned it and he then said he promised himself he wouldn't get involved with anyone because he wanted to stay focused and driven to succeed in his business and make money again.
I get that, but am i wrong thinking if you really like someone you can find a way to squeeze them into your busy life?
The second guy (31 m) hung out for about 4 times and got distant and finally ended up basically telling me that he liked hanging out with me but it felt more like friends to him (this one i never had sex with but we did kiss and hug)

We broke up in september of 2011, and I was fine with it until I drank Ayahuasca in December, whereupon I was forced to examine not only the really shitty things I had done in our relationship, but also the love for her that I truly felt in my heart. So I wrote her a poem that I was inspired to write during my Ayahuasca ceremony (just google it if you don't know what I'm talking about), and presented it to my ex right after I got back to where we live. She started crying after I asked her to get back together with me, and told me she couldn't because she had done so much work to get over me. I then tried to pursue her for another month or so, based on hints she had given me that she was still interested (apparently she wasn't). I finally dropped the idea that we would get back together after she straight up told me about a month ago that there was absolutely no chance we could get back together now, but maybe in 3-4 years we could see where we are at.

So I cried, and cried, and talked to a therapist, and I signed up for okcupid.com about two weeks after my ex told me there was no chance, and immediately (same day), saw a profile I really liked, and the girl messaged me. We have a ton in common. 

Fast forward, we went on some dates, I liked her a lot, she liked me but wasn't sure if there was a spark, so she told me she wasn't looking for a relationship. So that weekend, when she was out of town, I had a total relapse and cried so hard about being lonely and missing my ex that I felt like killing myself (no plan, no attempt, just a feeling). That has happened to me before when I was much younger, but when it happens during such a strong emotional event it is overwhelming. 

Anyways, I talked with my therapist about that and she guided me towards a healthier perspective (which doesn't involve suicide, thankfully). I went on another couple of dates with that new girl, and she invited me to sleep over at her house, where we fooled around. 
After that, she told me she was definitely into me and that, while we aren't anything official, we could be exclusive now that she felt that this was something pursuing. 

I'm not trying to be shallow, and me and this girl have so much more in common than me and my ex, and she is the coolest chick I know right now (super stable, funny, smart, etc.), but sometimes I just don't feel super attracted to her, even though she is beautiful. Sometimes, nearly every day for the past 2 weeks, I have thought about my ex and felt a twinge of sadness. Nothing overwhelming, just sadness. 

I am questioning everything right now. Me and this new chick have been dating for 3-4 weeks, and we have everything in common, and my higher mind is telling me that I should give her a chance and not just break it off because of feelings for an ex that will settle with time. But these thoughts, these memories and emotions around my ex just keep popping into my head. Me and this new girl both agree that rushing into a relationship is like rushing onto ice, and we could both get hurt, so we aren't trying to take it too seriously, just exclusively. 

What do you guys think? And don't be afraid to be fucking honest, you won't hurt my feelings.

I go downtown pretty often. Meeting women out there hasn't ever really been fruitful, so I keep that business at bay most of the time.

About two weeks ago, I see this girl that I knew, and told my bartender to give her a drink (she was alone and looked like she needed a drink).

She got really (major understatement) upset that I tried to buy her alcohol. Apparently I was trying to get her drunk, and have my way with her, etc etc.

Whatever?

About an hour later, I'm at one of the music venues talking to some people, and here this girl waltzes in with her entourage. Makes a scene and I end up leaving just to keep the peace (even though I was there before her and was minding my own business prior).

I don't know if she's just really good at guessing where I'm going to be, or if we have similar locale preferences.... but shes fucking everywhere I go, and makes a scene every time she sees me.

I asked one of my exes (who is good friends with the girl) about any logical reasons this is happening. Later I hear that this girl has it in her head that *I'm* following *her*...

I really just want nothing to do with this girl, and I'm sorry for ever having tried to to buy her a drink... but I can't see a feasible way for me to just Jedi sense her going to a place I'm going and leave before she sees me... that's just asinine.

So unfortunately most of my experience with women involves college and alcohol. Plenty of drunken makeouts, but nobody is going to call you out on being a bad kisser in that arena.

My second kiss was basically a friend from high school. We were drunk my freshman year of college. She said something about ""giving me lessons"" after the kiss was over, meaning i needed kissing lessons. she was and is a little full of shit so I was never sure if I should take it seriously.

Fast forward a 5 years, I'm now graduated and working. I went out on a few dates with this girl from OKCupid a year ago. She was incredibly awkward, creeping me out, texting me every second, and wanted to basically marry me after a few dates. I stopped talking to her obviously. However, at some point while we were hanging out, kissing a little, I then stalked her twitter and saw that she tweeted something like ""i wish you could give guys kissing lessons."" Now this girl was a little crazy, but still the tweet messed with my head. (she did continue pursuing me even after the tweet)

A year later, I've gone out with a girl that I actually really do like, also from OKCupid. Date #1, I went in for the kiss and she turned her head, I kissed her cheek. Date #2, a little peck on the lips. Date #3, we started making out. I was mostly just trying to mirror what she did. She was putting her tongue in my mouth, I did a little bit, but she put her tongue in my mouth more. She bit my lip a little bit. I put my hand on her ass a little and also grazed one of her boobs for a second or two.

I felt like I was easing up and pulling back a little and *she* kept going. She also grabbed me and pressed her body into mine. If you're kissing a bad kisser, do you keep going or do you immediately stop? Do you kiss them again at the end of the date?

At the end of the date, we kissed again for a sec. In general, I thought the whole date was great.

That was last sunday. Then, I texted her tuesday and didnt hear back til weds, almost 24 hours later. On one hand, she did send me a detailed response. You'd think after waiting 24 hours, you could just not respond at all, so it's good she responded. We had a text convo. But, I was trying to get a day set for hanging out next and due to work schedules, we don't have our next date on the calendar yet. She does work odd hours, and I travel.

BUT I'm getting all self consious about my kissing and worried she'll gradually blow me off because my kissing was a turnoff. I can't help but worry I'm a bad kisser because of what those two girls said in the past. Am I crazy? Paranoid? I don't slobber, jam my tongue in and out, smack, swirl, or suck. So maybe it's that I don't have 'rhythm' or some other abstract nonsense. How can I know for sure? How will I ever successfully enter a relationship if I suck at kissing? How can I get better at kissing? It's like when you graduate college and all the employers want somebody with experience but you can't get any experience because nobody will hire you because you don't have experience. I don't think I'm bad at it, I think it's pretty simple, but people that are bad at it probably never think they're bad at it.

Several months ago I ended a 6 year relationship. I have no baggage from this, there's nothing in the emotions department that I'm worried about.

I've been seeing a new girl who I really like, and I know our first time sleeping together could be any day now. We've both had multiple partners, but given our age difference, I've just had a lot more time to gain experience.

I'm not into any fetishes or anything ""out of the ordinary,"" (no judgement intended whatsoever) but I'm just nervous about being too confident, if that makes sense?

I get the feeling she is a little intimidated by me, sexually, which is natural given the age gap and her knowing I was recently in such a long relationship. And I know the last guy she dated. He was super awkward and sexually inexperienced.

So while my default would be to go with the flow while trying to make her head explode, there's a nagging worry at the back of my mind that I'll do something, like put her in a position she's never been in before, and that it might put her in her head about our different experience levels.

She's a very confident girl, so I'm pretty sure it won't be an issue, but I like her and I don't want to mess it up.

So what do you all think? I'm sure a lot of you will say just to go with the flow in the moment, which I totally will, I'd just like some opinions from anyone who has maybe been on either side of this situation before.

This cute little girl who lives in my residence hall was sort of my friend but she was more like a friend of a friend of a friend, I'd see her around a lot and we got along, but we weren't that close.

Anyway one day I decided to hang out with her because I just had nothing going on. I sent her a few flirty texts and then she invited me over to her room to watch cartoons (her idea) and make blanket forts (mine).

We talked for a while, made the blanket fort and talked through hours of television, all the while making suggestive jokes like ""there's no rules in the blanket fort . . . anything goes"" eskimo kisses, butterfly kisses, thumb wrestles general touching and childish games. It all felt very natural and mirthful and fun. We started talking closer and closer until our lips were touching as we moved them to make words.

She caved first. She kissed me and I kissed her back. I got out of a long term relationship (3 years) about 10 months ago, and I hadn't felt anything from kissing a girl in a long time. This was the first kiss since that relationship that I felt something- or at least I wasn't sure that I felt nothing.

Our kiss turned in to lots of kisses. Which turned into clothes coming off. Which turned into various sexual activities. It was all very passionate. We stopped for a while when she told me that she doesn't do this kind of stuff often, or ever.

Afterwards we got dressed (the mirth of the night was still alive, I hid her underwear for a while and joked that she shouldn't ever wear clothes since she's so cute naked) and we continued hugging and touching and looking in mirrors, noting how cute we look together. But not long after I had to leave because my friend's flight was coming in. We kissed goodbye which took like 10 minutes I swear.

**The Aftermath**

I texted her the next day after that and things were still flirty and fun, but she slowly got less and less responsive. I'd ask if she wanted to hang out again and she'd tell me she was busy. Every day I asked and every day she was busy for a whole week. When the weekend came around she said ""finally it's the weekend, we should be able to hang out"" but last night my friends from home visited so I felt like they should have my undivided attention. Today I asked if she wanted to hang out at all and she said ""I don't know"" I asked her why she wouldn't, she said she's busy. I said ""but it's the weekend! save your work for Sunday night!"" and she said that she's just socially busy.

I asked her how many guys she had been with (since she said earlier that she wasn't experienced) and she said ""5. Am I slut now?"" I told her that I never thought she was a slut. Then I asked her if she felt something when we kissed. She said she didn't know. She felt something because she enjoyed it, but she doesn't know. I told her that I also don't know, which means either the timing was right or else I like her. Then she logged off facebook (these questions were over chat because she didn't want to hang out) without saying anything. I noticed all week she was trying to avoid me so I feel really dumb for telling her that I might like her. Wish I wouldn't have done that.

What should I do/say/feel? I'm really just sort of perplexed where thing went wrong.

I message back and we trade a few messages over a couple days before exchanging phone numbers. At this point we text every day and come to find out, we have several things in common:

* Both went to the same university, something that neither of us had mentioned in our dating profiles
* Both graduated from said university at the same time
* Both moved to the same town (several states away from the university) after graduation
* Mildly amusing, she worked at a bagel/coffee shop that I frequented on my way into class every morning. 

We have several phone conversations and the commonalities continue. We agree to meet for brunch the morning of the Super Bowl. We live an hour and a half apart, but I have friends in her area who had invited me to a SB viewing party. What was supposed to be a brunch date turns into a 5+ hour get-together with non-stop conversation &amp; laughter.

Plans are made for my return visit: I make reservations at a swanky restaurant, she has the bar picked out for after dinner drinks.

At midnight she suggests we go back to her apartment, which we do, arm in arm along the way. 

We enjoy a glass of scotch, talk more, flirt even more, and by 2am it's apparent that we are both a bit tired.

Here's the rub...we live an hour and a half apart and currently I'm the only one with an operable car. (Her's is in need of some work.)

We bumped into each other on several occasions in the following weeks and both of us pretty much ditched our friends to hang out with each other. We share a lot of the same interests, it turns out we have mutual friends and acquaintances, and our lives show some eerily similar paralels. 

We made out once. We were both pretty drunk. She texted me the day after to thank me for the great night out. When I wanted to talk to her about it some time after, she said she didn't remember much of that night.

I had mentioned to her that I am a great cook. So she wanted me to cook for her some day. I told her I was free on Valentine's. She would only agree with this date, if it would be just as friends without any romance in mind. I honoured her wishes so I didn't get her any flowers, didn't light any candles, and didn't make a move. I just cooked for her and we watched a movie. 
As I walked her back home, I detected a slight look of disappointment in her eyes. We barely said a word during that walk. Why I didn't make a move then, I do not know. Probably because I'm an idiot.

I haven't heard from her since. I've called and texted her a couple of times, but got no response. We had plans for last friday, but she didn't show.

I talked to a friend of hers and the friend told me that she had the impression that the girl had fallen for me. She also told me that the girl is or was pretty adamant in not wanting to have a relationship ever again, because most of her relationships ended pretty messy.

So there happen to be some major problems in her area and the networking closet is right by her desk. I got to have about a 3 hour conversation with her and I came to a conclusion. It turns out this girl is very unintelligent and oblivious to the world. I don't need a girl to be super smart or educated but just have some common sense and a interest in events which effect you. 



What pushed me over the edge was after I asked her if she could hand me the the allen key which was on the floor and she replied with ""I don't see any keys that can unlock anything"". That threw me but I was willing to let that go. We started talking about current events in the world and if the subject matter was not on the E! channel or in a tabloid magazine, she didn't have the slightest idea what I was talking about.

So I'm a sophmore in college, and have been unsuccessful with women my entire life; never been on a date, don't have any female friends. I am really really socially retarded.

That being said, every morning I run around the perimeter of my university at around 5 or 6 AM (cause there's usually noone to see my fatass running).

Anyways, today after I came back from an all-nighter project at the library (yes on a Saturday night I am working), I'm running and OUT OF NOWHERE this girl is catching up to me and yells at me to slow down. Now I'm pretty startled, and I run FASTER away from her; but she's like on the track team or something because within seconds she overtakes me and yells ""I have your ID card!"" Being socially awkward all I could say was ""Thanks"" before she sprinted away.

I look down at my ID card, and she scribbled her number on it 0.0
That being said, how do I know if it's legit or not? This has never ever happened to me once in my entire life; and I really really don't want to call and find myself talking to like Chris Hansen or a druggie or something.

(an 11 year epic of awkward passivity),14,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pkf0e/how_do_i_deal_with_the_most_confusing_boy_in_the/,"When I was 11 the most beautiful boy in the world swaggered into my math class.  He had dimples and that little hair flippy that was so popular in the late 90s and I just fell instantly in love. For the next three years my awkward self tried to position myself next to him in every class and during every game of gym Red Rover (we got to hold hands!!)
We became friendly but never saw each other outside of school and even though other people in our school dated, he never seemed interested and I was too afraid of rejection to ever try anything.  I hugged him good bye at 8th grade graduation and we went our separate ways, occasionally catching up on AIM throughout high school.  I continued to be obsessed with him for the next few years but still never felt comfortable asking to hang out.  Then one day when I was about 17, I realized I was kind of over it.

Fast forward two years: he calls me out of nowhere and tells me he was always in love with me and too nervous to say anything.  I go from 0 to Ecstatic in like 0.2 seconds and (as a new, confident, large breasted adult) tell him to come see me right away so we can discuss it.  He sounds elated, agrees.... Stands me up.  Calls next day to apologize but says he's afraid my expectations are too high and refuses to see me.  I tell him to STFU and we meet up, talk, walk around.  We go on about 5 little conversational date things, some where I ask first, some where he does.  Then one day, he says he'll see me tomorrow evening... and stands me up.  I call his phone, it's disconnected.  I don;t try again.
Eleven months later, I walk out of my house and he's standing across the street.  I try not to be conceited and think he's there for me, don't say hi, keep walking.  Then a week later I see him on my block again.  And then again.  I send him an email asking if he moved to my area and he replies that he just likes to stand there and absorb the atmosphere sometimes.  From that point on, he has long conversations with himself in my gchat window while I'm asleep.  I wake up mornings and read the transcripts and wonder if he realizes Im never there.  Then that suddenly stops.  We don't talk for another year at all.
Two months ago, I get six calls from a strange number.  I call back and it's him, telling me how much he wants me in his life, that's he's responsible, that he's turning his life around and really wants me in it. He tells me he will go anywhere to meet me and randomly shows up outside my job without me asking.  I'm busy and have to send him away without seeing him.  Finally, after weeks of him asking, I agree to meet up for coffee.  He tells me he's running late an he will call as soon as he's around.  
I have not heard from him since.

**TL;DR :  Tweenage crush waited until college to tell me he loved me back.  Now proceeds to come around and semi-stalk me for about one month every year and then dissapear from my life for the remaining 11 months.**

... any thoughts of any kind would be incredibly appreciated.  I have had plenty of relationships between and during these occurrences.  Nothing physical has ever happened between us.

Two girls, one choice.",10,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pf2vj/forever_aloner_gets_the_worst_good_luck_two_girls/,"So, I’m 25/M and until a couple weeks ago, I was FA. I have all the standard hang-ups about that. All of a sudden, I was thrust into a situation I’ve never dealt with before. 

1. Messaged M1 on OKC. Set up a date. Went on it, had a good time. Keep texting afterwards, try and set up something for the following weekend.

2. M1 tells me she has car trouble and needs the weekend to take care of it back home with her dad. I don’t hear from her the whole weekend. 

3. I decide that I do want to see someone that I’ve been messaging simultaneously on OKC. Send out a message to L2, setup for Friday. See her, really hit it off. 

4. See L2 again Saturday. Lose my v-card. We talk about what we’re looking for. We’re both looking for a relationship. Unfortunately, I don’t know where I’ll be after the summer and it seems like she’s sticking around. Also, we never indicate whether this is exclusive or supposed to be or whatever. She leaves Sunday, we keep texting. We decide to see each other again Monday.

5. At this point, I’ve written off M1. I haven’t heard from her in a few days after leaving the ball in her court. I become suspicious of the car excuse, and it’s the weekend so if she’s not sending even a single text over 3 days, then to me that signals non-interest. 

6. Come Monday, M1 tells me that the car was fine, the mechanics made a mistake, and she left her phone back at her own place so she wasn’t able to text me. I respond. Friendly texts back and forth.

7. I see L2 that night. I have resolved to come out with this situation. I’m too much of a coward/asshole to do so. End up having sex again. I tell her afterwards about M1, that I’d like to see M1 again, what she thinks about that. 

8. At this point, I really am not interested in dating anyone other than either L2 or M1. My thought is that, if I had just waited 2-3 more days, I would have probably seen M1 for sure no matter what because it was a totally innocent mistake about the phone and the car situation, and I was very interested in seeing her again. 

9. On the other hand, L2 has made it very clear how much it would hurt her for me to do that. And while she is telling me that she can’t “tell [me] what to do”, I’m feeling a little like I’m trapped. L2 says she has stopped seeing other people, cut off contact with other OKC guys, because of me. I feel like shit. I wish she hadn’t done that. I feel like maybe if I hadn’t pushed things on Saturday (sex) that this wouldn’t have happened.

10. I can’t be totally happy in this situation. I’m still thinking about what it would be like to keep seeing M1, and that it was just by a couple of shitty coincidences that a second date didn’t happen.

My thoughts:

1. My ideal situation would have been that L2 was also seeing other people and wasn’t so attached to me, which would just let me feel less bad when I was doing the same.

2. I told L2 that I would cut it off with M1, but in my heart of hearts, I really do want to see M1 again. 

3. L2 tells me she’s already bought me a V-day gift. Apparently she sees a deep connection between us. I can’t disagree. We talk easily. We’re both attracted to each other. 

4. **I think it stems from my being an FA for so long.** I want to know what I can do. I want to know that I can attract women, prove it to myself. That this one girl isn’t a fluke. I want to prove to myself that after 25 years of extreme doubt that has led me to seek counseling, that I am actually attractive.

5. And yes, maybe I want to shop around a little bit. Isn’t that what people do? That’s what I’ve heard from my friends and what I’ve seen on TV and movies. Exclusivity doesn’t happen that fast. Or maybe it does sometimes. My greatest fear about getting into a relationship was that I might be too into the person. Apparently, I’m not like that.

6. I do want to be a little selfish. **But I also really really loathe the fact that I will hurt L2, who I would like to continue seeing,** even if there was no sex for a bit. The last time I saw L2, I told her I would cut it off. But it came after an emotional discussion. There was a lot of guilt on my mind.

Kisses included!",12,2,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/pesg0/had_a_first_date_last_night_it_went_well_kisses/,"I met a girl at the bar Sunday. I thought she was cute, and I made all her friends laugh a lot. Because of this, she later tells me on the date she was attracted to me because I was making her laugh a lot. One other thing that made her want to go out with me was that I asked her to coffee at the bar, not back to my place or similar. So we met up yesterday for coffee and more.

What made it more interesting is that a girl we were mutually friends with was at the shop, so it added comfort to her that she was close with someone I knew.

As for the actual date, it definitely went well. We got coffee, we took her car ( I only had my motorcycle ) to a secret place on campus that she wasn't aware of. It was a castle in the woods. I asked her to turn her car lights off because it would make it spookier. She did, and then I felt the time for a kiss was right. She was facing straight, I leaned to her, she turned and a smirk, we kissed, a few times, somewhat hesitant and slow - very little tongue, but it clearly flustered her.

We drove away, and a minute later I said, ""I know you like me."" And she giggled and said, ""How do you know?"" And I replied, ""Because I know...and that's a pretty cocky statement to make."" She smiled and said yep it was. 

After we drove around, she seemed energized, and I showed her a few places that she was intrigued by. After, we got a drink and some food to split, and then we left (she was exhausted, had 3 hours of sleep, and I could tell she was - she apologized), and we went to her car. She took me back to my motorcycle, and then we parked, I said, ""How can I see you again"" and she said, ""Just let me know,"" (or something like that) and I went in for another kiss. She smiled again, I said I know she likes me, and in a youngish sounding voice she said, ""How do you know?"" (I said because of her dimples) and she covered her face, smiled, and said ""Thank you for the good time.""

1328119676.0,10,self.dating_advice,p6ef0,Girl from a party...,10,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/p6ef0/girl_from_a_party/,"Me:  24-M, Her: 25(?)-F.  I say 25 because I never got her actual age, but know she graduated a year before me so that is my guess.  I shall refer to her as The Girl.


For the understanding of the story, the first party was for spouse #1, and the second party was for spouse #2.  So each of them had their own birthday party/bash.

Back in November I went to a friends birthday party where nothing too crazy was going on, but The Girl came with a friend (neither of them I knew).  There was maybe 15-20 people there at the party; low key, just hanging out and chit chatting and such.  Eventually The Girl and I start chatting about random stuff (Not hitting on her, just being my jovial self and chatting with whomever).  When the party begins to die down, and The Girl and her friend leave.  End first encounter.  My thoughts were pretty much, ""She was cute and pretty cool.  Ok, time to help clean up"".


Two months go by and spouse #2 has their birthday party extravaganza.  To give an idea of the group, almost all of the people there fell into the 22 to 28 age range.  So as part of the extravaganza, by request of birthday spouse, we all go play Laser Tag (which was epic and amazing in and of itself).  Once we all get to the Laser tag place, lo and behold, The Girl is there with her friend.  I am not ""OMG SHE IS HERE!!!111!"", but I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly enthused to see The Girl.


During laser tag and after, we chat a bit and pick back up on some conversational topics we chatted about at the last party.  We all go to a local dive bar to hang out and finish out the night.  While there, we keep chatting about all different kinds of things; school, work, life...etc.  Come to find out, she is actually relatively new to the area by about 5 months.  She came up here for a job, and knows my friend (spouse 2) because they all go to the same gym.


As the night wears down, we both kind of drift off into conversations with other people since it is loud and crowded and The Girl and her friend eventually leave.  At this point, I am actually little bummed because I really enjoyed talking to her.


Now here is where I sit.  I would like to talk to her again: hang out, grab coffee...whatever.  She really is a laid back, intelligent person that I just would like to hang out with and see where things go (whether it just be a good friendship or something more).  The problem: I don't have her phone number.  


I know where she works (and she knows I know because we talked about it for quite a bit) and she is prominently displayed on her employers website because of her position (haha, porn jokes... moving on.).  So here is the big question: Am I out of line to call her work number and just ask her out or should I try and jump the channels and have the mutual friend put us together?  It isn't like I am Googleing her and stalking her Facebook page and sending messages.  She was prominently open about her position and company so from my standpoint, it doesn't seem crazy to go that route... or am I wrong?


I am not dieing to see her again, so if I should just ""move along"" then so be it.  But if I could, I would like to hang out with her, but I don't want to come off as creepy in the process.


Thoughts?


**tl;dr:**  girl from party and I had good conversation, I never got a number but I know where she works because she told me.  Is it OK to call her at work and ask her out or no?

I met this amazing girl a couple of months ago (me 25 m, her 23 f, both graduate students) through her roommate, who is a friend of mine. Her and I are both rock climbers, so her roommate put us in touch so that we could climb together.

Upon meeting, we hit it off and got along really great. Over the next couple of months, we continued hanging out and found that we really enjoy each other's company. We can talk effortlessly for hours, laughing and smiling the whole time. Things seemed to be going well, but were progressing really slowly. There was definitely some tension between us, to the point where things were a little bit awkward during goodbyes (like both of us were just nervous).

A little background on our dating history is relevant here. This last August, I ended a four year relationship in which it seemed like engagement and marriage was just a stone's throw away. Naturally, the aftermath was rough on me, and in all honesty, I'm still dealing with it a bit, though I'm starting to get to a really good place. As for her, she also ended a serious relationship this last summer, and it's been really hard on her. I heard this from her and her roommate (my friend), and it's something I can definitely understand. It sounds like she got burned pretty badly.

So anyways, one day I brought it up us and we talked about where things are going. Basically, she said that at this point she's not ready for a relationship because she's still very affected by her last one and is terrified about getting hurt. But, she told me that she has a blast spending time with me and doesn't want that to end. She also really drove home the point that this doesn't have anything to do with me and that as this point she's just not ready. Right now, we've agreed to be friends and are continuing to spend time together.

I know the obvious thought is that she's just making excuses and friend-zoning me. Maybe this is the case, and if it is, so be it. She's not yanking me around or stringing me along or anything, so I'm willing to be friends with her. She's a cool person and I'm not the kind of person to cut someone out of my life just because I can't date them. Obviously I'm still interested in her, but I want to make it clear that I'm not going to be a doormat or hold my breath for her.

However, I know for a fact (from her roommate, my friend) that she's still really struggling with the end of her last relationship and her not being ready might actually be the whole truth. It seems like there's a mutual attraction and we're still making time to see each other every so often (but not too often, besides for the class we have together, maybe we'll hang out once a week). Is it possible that not being ready for a relationship is really the truth? That maybe she wants to be an adult about this and not rebound? Or have I been friend-zoned?

I am a male in my early 30s. I cannot dance to save my life, and I believe this has lead to many lost opportunities. I'm not talking about grinding up some random girl on the floor in loud nightclubs, but many times I've chatted up girls in not-so-loud, neighborhood-y bars and eventually they want to get on the dance floor and that's when I bail.


I just can't do it - I think dancing is silly and I am pretty sure I'd make a fool of myself. However, all my friends dance, and I'm just standing by the wall like an idiot. I'm very athletic and have a flexible body - so I feel like I should put it to use and just get out there and dance.

Where can I start to learn to dance? I'm not sure if there's even anything to learn because I am not talking about a proper method - like salsa or swing. I just don't want to be the odd one out at bars. Since I couldn't dance sober, I tried using alcohol as a crutch and have had several girls tell me that I'm such a bad dancer! :( I figure I can be like ""Fuck it, let's dance"" if I am really drunk, but I'd rather not drive home drunk.

Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't have to do it if I don't like it, but then again, I used to be very shy and not talk to people at bars and found out that if I ""just keep being who I am"", nobody really wants to talk to me either.

i'm totally ready to be her wingwoman. i want this for her so badly, but i don't know the first thing about dating nor how to approach her particular situation. i've been in a few long term relationships since i was 17, little time between each relationship, and currently in a 4 year relationship with the man i'm going to marry. i never really did much dating. her lack of spare time and her insecurity issues are a concern for me too. i maybe have a couple male friends i can set her up with. or another idea i had was help her set up an account with eharmony, but i don't know if that's too much too soon.

what do you think i should do?

Wait! Please don't go yet! Here's the details:

I'm 19. I'm a heterosexual guy. The thing is, sex isn't a huge priority for me. I just want to be understood and loved. And to love someone in return.

I think I can see how being a nice guy just isn't attractive to most women. Fair enough. I still don't want to read up on seduction just to get my dick wet.

Nothing makes me happier than making other people happy. I can ignore the ape inside me that just wants to fuck around and compete with other males.

I've read that I should just be myself but I've also read that nothing will happen unless I do something about it. If doing something means practising with seduction to appear sexually attractive, that isn't being me.

Do I have to pretend that I'm just interested in sex by flirting, seducing and appearing cool? And when I trick a girl into liking me I finally tell her what I'm really like? That really all I want is someone to hold hands with.

Am I just fucking weird? I feel so alone. Thank you so much for reading this. And apologies if you hurt yourself from face-palming so hard.

So maybe the internet has ruined me because I'm scared that just making friends with a girl will mean I just stay in the 'friend zone'. I just want some friendly reassurance because I don't know who else to ask. Apologies again and thanks.

I've been taking advise from [/r/OkCupid](/r/OkCupid) on sending messages and have had some success this year. Managed to go on 7 dates (this is pretty poor, but I had zero last year, so I'm not complaining).

The problem with me is that I'm very shy and while I can make decent conversation, I take too long to initiate any kind of contact, which I think is putting off the women and I get the 'you're a great guy, but' speech afterward.

Can you give me some tips on doing this in a natural way in the first date? I usually invite her for coffee and take a walk afterward. Is this a good way to go about it? I also don't kiss the woman on the first date (again, the shyness). I would also appreciate some good first date ideas.

In the past two months, two great girls called things off after date two after what I thought were good first dates, so I'm pretty sure I'm doing it wrong.

Me: 23/F

Okay, so I've been friendzoned. From what I've read online, guys generally only friendzone girls when there is no physical attraction. 

I'm not quite sure this is the case here, though. I am pretty cute. I am thin and in decent shape (in contrast guy in question is slightly overweight).

Guy in question has told me how cute I am many times. He also constantly gets hard around me -- basically every time we hang out. He has done things like rub my butt and tell me how cute I am. He has given me extra-long hugs full of rubbing, stuff like that.

So you see what I mean? I definitely thought he was attracted to me. It took me some time to warm up, but after we had been friends for several months, I became attracted to him. However, our schedules got busy and we did not see each other for a while (couple months). 

When we hung out again, finally I basically asked him, do you want to start dating? He said no, and his excuses were along the lines of 'I never want to lose our friendship' 'I'm still scarred from my previous ex' (they broke up well over a year ago at the time of this conversation).

I should add that I don't think my personality is the problem either. There might be aspects he doesn't like I suppose, but we get along great. We have stayed up half the night talking; we can talk for hours. We have great intellectual conversations.

So, TL;DR, I'm pretty hot, we get along great, I'm just as smart as he is, we have great conversations and we have lots of fun together -- yet I've been friendzoned.

Could it be that he is doing some sort of weird playing-hard-to-get thing? 

Is it even slightly likely that he's still messed up from his crazy ex even when they broke up two years ago?

Or do you think maybe the age difference is a problem (29 him, 23 me)? It's well within the whole 'half your age plus seven' thing, but who knows.

Should I just move on? I am now pretty darn attracted to him, to the point that it's hard for me to date other guys because I just keep thinking 'I'd rather have guy-in-question'.

I hadn't done anything (sex, alcohol, weed, or any type of drugs for that matter) until this last May. I tried pot, and planned on doing it maybe once a month or something like that. Well, I started smoking more, maybe around 2-3 times a week this past month on average, and when I told him exactly how much I'd been smoking he sat with it for a night and then confronted me about it a couple hours ago.

I feel like I'm being treated like a full on drug addict. His friend talked to him and listed off a million different reasons why he wouldn't date a girl who smoked pot. He thinks I'm going to go down a sad road of harder drugs and dullness and getting stupider and I'll change etc. (He's going to a school with a lot of rich, white, Catholic kids who don't smoke pot at all by the by)

I was planning on toning it down when school started (maybe on school breaks?), but he's made it pretty clear that he thinks I'm addicted to the mental feeling and I really couldn't stop smoking pot at all. (I'd mentioned in the beginning that I would only smoke once a month or so, but then this summer I smoked more and he thinks I can't control myself).

I'm feeling so frustrated and controlled right now. He could have just asked me to stop and I would have. Instead I feel like he just confronted me with all these wild statistics (smoking pot is like smoking 20 cigarettes a day) and typical case studies of people going down a harder path and me not being able to handle myself with a little fucking pot.

He routinely got drunk about once a week and had a glass of wine before going to bed to help him relax over the summer and claims that having wine, and smoking pot are two completely different things.  I have no problem whatsoever with him drinking a little bit of wine to help him relax.  I know he's not an alcoholic.  So, why can't he understand I'd like to relax to?

Honestly, I like pot.  It's a nice way to unwind with friends and have some fun.  I'm also serious about school (3.5 GPA) have clear goals to transfer and scholarships I'm working on.  He just made me feel like I'm this out of control drug addict.  I really felt like he was overreacting.  And I absolutely said I would stop, even though he's convinced I can't and thought I'd just go back to it to cope with my life

1315864461.0,11,self.dating_advice,kdit3,"I'm dating a known cheater; in fact, she cheated on her last boyfriend with (an ignorant) me. Plz hlp. ",13,2,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/kdit3/im_dating_a_known_cheater_in_fact_she_cheated_on/,"**UPDATE**

**I broke up with her. There were tears. It was sad. The end.**

I need some help thinking about my current relationship situation. I think it might be too speculative to bring up with my girlfriend at the moment because she's never given *me* any reason to question her. There are **so many** questions I have for her though! Please help me sort this information and make some sense of it. 

Current Situation: 
I met my girlfriend about 3 months ago just as we were both graduating from college. We have since moved back in with our respective parents and now live about a 2 hour drive away from each other. We see each other 1-3 days per week depending on our schedules. We get along extremely well, and speak on the phone every morning and night. We're not speaking about the future because we're both potentially going back to school in a year or less, but we're enjoying the time we have together. It's almost scary how well we get along. Everything we do is so much better together. 

Me: 
I have very little relationship experience. I've only slept with a few women, and my current girlfriend is my longest-ever relationship at about 3 months. I have a friendly, reassuring, supportive disposition, and I don't think I'm prone to jealousy, but I need some assistance in thinking through this situation. 

Her:
She is incredibly smart and logical, but also the sweetest person I have ever met. She graduated college with honors, and is likely going to med school in the not-too-distant future. She is always happy, and loves to cuddle (I never realized how much I enjoyed cuddling until I met her). She has a wonderful, supportive family. She loves her cat. She loves to paint. What I'm trying to get at is she is amazing. Everything about her is everything I have ever wanted in a girlfriend. She recently surprised me with tickets to one of my favorite bands for an early birthday present and I had the night of my life. She is absolutely adorable, but there is one thing that's always stuck in the back of my mind...

The situation:
I met her under strange circumstances. She was a friend of a friend that I met in a casual bar while I was hanging out with friends. She was very sweet and friendly and we got on really well. We drank a bit too much, and she ended up coming home with me and some other friends under the pretext of playing beer pong and drinking for a while longer. I honestly had no idea I was going to score; that doesn't generally happen to me, and I'm not the type to go on sexual conquests. 

Everyone left eventually, except for her. We were watching tv, and the next thing I knew, we were making out. Then we're having sex in the living room! I couldn't believe it. I walked her home at 5 am and we exchanged numbers. We managed to hang out almost every night for the next week despite still having work and school. I was in heaven. 

We went to a party together the next weekend with some mutual friends. We left early to... go to bed. I got a text from one of my best friends saying that he needed to talk. I thought he meant he had an issue he wanted help with, but the next morning I found out he was trying to warn me. 

It turns out she had a boyfriend at the time. She had been hanging out with me for a week straight, having sexytimes and sharing warm moments together, and she never once gave me any indication that she had a boyfriend. I can't really complain about *how* we met since I'm glad we *did* meet, but still it's unnerving. 

Then I found out she had cheated multiple times on multiple boyfriends. She had cheated 4 times on her boyfriend at the time, and he had absolutely no idea (and probably still doesn't). And *then* I found out she had a running contest with one of her friends to see how many people they could sleep with. *She had a running tally of the number of guys she'd slept with*. I think it was something like 22 or 23, but I can't quite remember because I think I passed out for a few seconds. It's not the number of guys she's slept with that bothers me, but the fact that she'd made a contest out of it. 

A terrifying example of her cheating happened in Vegas (of course). She was with her boyfriend and some friends. She was dancing at a club with her friends when a guy came over to talk to her. He gave her his number and went on his way, probably not expecting much. Her boyfriend ended up getting too drunk that night and needed to go to bed, so she did what any nice girlfriend would do and tucked him in sweetly and probably gave him a kiss goodnight. She then proceeded to call the guy she met in the club and fucked him within an hour of tucking her boyfriend in. **Fuck**. 

I just got really light-headed writing that last part. Whew. 

I learned all of this (and more if you can believe it) after a week of hanging out with her. As soon as I heard all of this from reliable sources, I knew I had to confront her about it. I was walking on sunshine, but I suddenly felt like I was in free-fall. My heart has never sunk so low. 

The night after I learned all of this, I invited her over. I didn't let on that I was unhappy or nervous or anything, and we eventually ended up in my bed. She was beginning to initiate sexytimes when I began systematically and concisely laying down my concerns without getting too specific about who had told me what. She started crying. This was actually relieving, to be honest. Over the course of those 24 hours between hearing those stories and seeing her again, I had convinced myself that she was a heartless monster and a social chameleon. She was crying pitifully and I felt bad for her even though I was trying hard not to. She claimed that no one had ever confronted her about this, and she knew it was awful. She didn't seem embarrassed, surprisingly, but she seemed upset that everything had been laid out so plainly before her. She said that she was a very logical person, and in her previous relationships she had never had a reason *not* to cheat. She never saw them going anywhere and figured they would eventually end anyway. 

She broke up with her boyfriend and started going out with me (officially, whatever that means).

I was in no way trying to tie her down; I told her straight-up that I liked her and wanted to be with her, but that if she wanted to be single for a while or longer I totally understood. And she opted to stay with me. She said that I was different than everyone else she'd ever dated. While I'm sure this is true to *some* extent, I can't help but wonder to *what* extent. She said that people can change if they want to, but I've always felt that people don't change unless they absolutely have to. 

I feel like I'm almost bashing on her right now. Let me clear the air a little bit, mostly for myself. I love her. We're having a great time together, and she hasn't given me, specifically, anything to worry about beyond what she's done in the past. 

I have to be honest, she just finished summer school, and suddenly she has a lot of free time. It's difficult to imagine her not hanging out with guys she's known for a while, friends of friends, acquaintances from high school, etc. That doesn't bother me. It's the ease with which I, and many other guys, found myself sleeping with her and calling her my girlfriend. It's really strange, I know, complaining about how easily I was able to score, but there you have it. 

Right now it's difficult to imagine any future with her despite us getting along really well, sharing good laughs and memories, and cuddling sweetly all night long. There is this idea that there is another side of my girlfriend that I'm terrified to meet. And then it hits me, I *did* meet that side of her... on that very first night when she was so cute and sweet and seemingly innocent. I'm scared shitless. What if my paranoia ruins something wonderful? I've mentioned before, I'm not generally the jealous type, but this sort of thinking is doing me in. 

She's said on a couple different occasions when the conversation has taken an awkward turn, ""I couldn't ever cheat on you. I know you must worry, but I really couldn't. I care about you too much."" I can't decide if her feeling the need to say this sort of thing is comforting or quite the opposite. 

What is scary to me is that I'm totally prepared for if she cheated on me, almost to a point where I'm expecting to be cheated on. I feel sad for thinking this way, but it feels necessary. I can't imagine going completely head-over-heels for a girl who I know so many disturbing details about. But at the same time, I'd hate to ruin the love we share because I'm uncertain about her side of the bargain. 

If you have any advice or questions to ask, please share. I'll do my best to clear up any confusing bits, but trust me, those bits are probably even more confusing to me. I'm not looking for a cure-all solution. I really just need help consolidating the information that I have and clearing my head. Just writing this down has made things a little clearer for me. Every time I see her I can't help but grin like an idiot on the outside and cry a little on the inside. 

Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.
