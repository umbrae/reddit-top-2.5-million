I was going to wait and make this a celebration of 10,000 subscriptions to /r/accounting, but I felt it better to provide this information to you now in light of recruiting season's imminent start. This guide is split into three parts, continued in the comments section below (it is far too large to fit into one post). Be sure to refer to this guide frequently throughout the entire process this fall for the best results.

To start, a big thank you is in order to /u/computanti for the idea and providing a place for me to start in creating this guide. This guide was put together by myself and the acquired help from a fellow colleague that is an expert on the networking and recruiting process. We have recently been on both sides of the public accounting recruiting process as students as well as professionals recruiting for our firms. Questions and feedback are more than welcome. 

[**Here is the full guide provided in Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vZEI8_0rWePbVo0cIS6CWlM1sYbX0ywVsgIbokm2bk/edit?usp=sharing)

&gt;***Disclaimer***: This guide is based off of our experiences in the recruiting process and some aspects may differ at your school or region. The following is put together based on two schools in separate regions that are highly targeted by the Big 4 and regional public accounting firms. The information provided here is intended for your purposes to assist in the recruiting process only. *(If you would also like to offer advice, please provide your qualifications).* Also, please note that fall tax season is fast approaching as well, so I apologize if there is a delay or I am unable to answer all PMs. I encourage you to post here in order to allow others to help as well.



Part 1 - ***How to Prepare and Your School's Career Fair***

&gt;By now, you have heard time and time again how important networking is in order to obtain an internship or entry-level full-time position in the accounting field, but usually it is not thoroughly discussed on how to network. The purpose of this guide is to bridge that gap between the process of knowing about networking and how to properly execute it. There are two different types of students during the recruiting process:
 
&gt;&gt;**Prepared** Recruits &amp; **Unprepared** Recruits

&gt;This guide is provided to help inform you on how to best become a *prepared* recruit. Successful networking requires building a good rapport with firm representatives and this cannot be done by simply going to one or two events. The most prepared and successful recruits are the ones that go to every recruiting event. Firms pre-identify students through these events, so the more they meet you, the more you will stand out.

***How to Prepare***

&gt;**Use your resources to the fullest** – Networking is all about building relationships. Use your professors, fellow students, alumni network, graduate students, accounting organizations, and school’s Career Management Center in order to learn how to prepare and create connections. This field is as much about the people you know as it is what you know. With this in mind, do not ask someone to pass along your résumé without getting to know them first, as that person will be vouching for you.

&gt;**Linkedin Account** – See the Google Doc for notes on this, post has met its character limit.

&gt;**Join one or more student accounting organizations and get involved** – These organizations provide exclusive access and opportunities for firms to meet students and identify potential recruits. Firms are looking for well-rounded students in leadership positions on campus that is outside of the classroom. 

&gt;**Continuously improve your résumé** – Your résumé is always a work in progress and it never hurts to have others take a look at it. The more feedback you get, the more developed it can become. Firms receive thousands of résumés each recruiting season and likely hundreds just from your school’s career fair alone. Small details stand out when being compared to such a large candidate base. Know everything that is on your résumé and be prepared to talk about it in detail.

&gt;**Elevator Speech** – Have a well-rehearsed brief summary about yourself that lasts about 20-30 seconds. It is key to make a proper first introduction to professionals. State your name, major, year, expected graduation date, and position you are interested in (intern/full-time, tax/audit/advisory).

&gt;**Know your Goals** – You should have an idea of some of your short-term and long-term goals. For example, some short-term goals might be to obtain an internship or finish your degree, while long-term goals might be to pass the CPA Exam, decide on the service line you want to go into, and where you want to be in 5-10 years.

&gt;**Be able to answer the question “Why Audit or Why Tax?”** – The firms are looking to see if you have put significant effort into deciding what you want to do with your career. While you probably do not know what you want to do for sure, it is extremely important to pick one or the other during the recruiting process. Firms do not like to see candidates that are undecided. Generally during career fairs, firms have three piles: Audit, Tax, and Undecided. Most only take into consideration two of those piles.

&gt;**Stay current with news about firms of interest** – Most firms will either frequently be cited in the news or actively post their own articles on their firm’s website. Be sure to keep up with this information to provide relevant conversation topics and show that you are interested in the firm.

&gt;**Professional Attire** – This topic is often talked to death, but it is very important. Never be underdressed, it will never look bad to dress more professionally (make sure your clothes fit well). Conservative is always better, be sure to conceal tattoos and do not wear anything too revealing. When attending single firm events, try to match your attire with the firm’s colors, the firm representatives you meet will take noticed and be very impressed.

&gt;**Necessary Accessories** – There are a couple items you should consider having with you at smaller networking events, a *personalized name tag* (under debate) and your own *business card*. Often, networking events do not provide name tags. Having your own when they are not provided will help professionals and recruiters remember your name and thus recall how often you attended networking and recruiting events. Business cards are also important because outside the career fair, résumés are too obstructive to hand to professionals at each networking event. A simple business card providing your name, contact info, position you are interested in, and status in school is much more effective for smaller networking events. After you exchange business cards at the event, go home and e-mail the person you met with your résumé.

&gt;**Good Questions to Ask** - You should be asking thoughtful and engaging questions to learn more about the people you network with and their firms. Do not simply ask yes or no questions, and definitely do not try to ask highly technical questions with the objective of stumping the professional. *Use the following as a guide to come up with your own questions, do not just copy these:*

&gt;&gt;•	Give me an example of a time you made a mistake and describe how your superiors dealt with it.

&gt;&gt;•	What does your firm do to prevent conflicting assignments for low level staff between two different supervisors?

&gt;&gt;•	Give me some examples of how your firm distinguishes itself from the competition.

&gt;&gt;•	What is one realistic thing you wish you could change about your job?

&gt;&gt;•	Does your firm's culture reward employees who get outside their comfort zone and take on new challenges, even if they make mistakes while trying something new?


&gt;**Thank You Notes** – In most circumstances, e-mail is the appropriate form of sending thank you notes as it is faster and more convenient. Always send an e-mail to every professional you speak to at each event within 24 hours of meeting them. If this was at a small event and the first time you met them, attaching your résumé is a good idea. Firm professionals meet hundreds if not thousands of students throughout the year and if you do not follow up quickly, they are likely to forget who you are and the connection you made will be lost. In the e-mail, it is good to ask a relevant question in order to create a dialogue. Be sure to review your emails multiple times for errors before sending them.

***Your School’s Career Fair***

&gt;All your preparation above is to succeed at the Career Fair. **Most firms, at least in the southeastern region recruit at this event and meet most their hiring needs for the next 12 months during the fall recruiting season.** This makes it essential that you attend this event. Bring plenty of résumés and business cards, wear your best business professional attire, and prepare to network the entire time with recruiters and professionals. *The goal is to convince these people that you are someone they would like to work with.*

&gt;Do not go to your top choice of employers to start. Go to a couple firms you are not very interested in and use this as a chance to get warmed up. You are probably going to feel a little awkward and nervous standing around in a big convention center, waiting in line to talk to a stranger and hand them a résumé. That is exactly why you do not want to start out at your top choice and make a terrible impression. Get comfortable and then move to the booths of your favorite firms.

I selected these disbursements by picking the 25 that looked most likely to not have any exceptions.
2.	I have no idea why we continue to do this test but if I leave it out and we did it last year my reviewer is going to shit a brick.
3.	I don’t want to have to do a management letter either so if you could just stop fucking up it would be a lot less work for both of us.
4.	It’s not that your internal controls are deficient but I am pretty sure an 8 year old with a working knowledge of a keyboard could clear out your bank accounts in about 5 seconds.
5.	I don’t really care that the person who normally pulls that information is on vacation, if I thought I was going to have to wait two weeks for this shit I would have booked a trip to the Bahamas as well.
6.	Oh you’re surprised that we need the exact same report we asked for last year? Well I am surprised that you were able to get both arms in your shirt this morning.
7.	Materiality is the short form of “I legally don’t have to give a shit”
8.	I understand that it took a lot of time to do the programs this year, you should just be glad that I didn’t actually read all the crap they have on there.
9.	It is not my job to make your depreciation entries every year, that’s why it’s called an “Audit” and not a “Do It”
10.	I understand that you are very busy and that the audit is time consuming and probably not at the top of your priority list but seeing as how I haven’t seen my wife and kids awake in 6 months I am going to need you to stop bitching and get what I asked now.

Here's some of the lines I've got so far, PLEASE HELP ME COME UP WITH MORE, THE CHEESIER THE BETTER:

1. There's no one I'd rather change my filing status with.

2. I can't wait for our convergence to be official.

3. You complete my equation.

4. When we met, I was only a debit, a half-finished journal entry; now the perfect credit has come into my life. 

5. Now I finally have someone I can close my net income out to. 

6. Now that we're married, we should consider getting into double-entry.

All suggestions are welcome and I'll use as many as possible. Hell I may show her tonight.

 8:00 Wake up, hop in the shower and regret how late I stayed up last night on reddit. 

 8:30 Iron a white or blue button up shirt. Intern's should never be the worst, or best, dressed member of a team.

 9:00 Get to the client's office. Head to our a tiny audit room with a beautiful view of Central Park. My team has 6 people, and we all sit around the same table. 

 9:05 Boot up my laptop and check to see if there's any new email. 

 9:10 Ask the senior if there's anything I can work on. He hands me a 4 inch pile of confirmations. I have make sure the information on each confirmation matches an excel document. If it doesn't I tell my senior and he looks into it. 

 12:00 Still working on confirmations, with occasional facebook checks. It's mind numbing. An associate asks if I want to go to Panera Bread with him for lunch. I say sure. 

 12:30 Small talk with the associate. He says I'm lucky that it's not busy season. We talk about the Knicks. He's a cool guy.

 2:45 Finally finish confirmations. I ask the senior if there's anything else I can do. There isn't.

 3:00 The manager checks in. She's very polite to me, be berates the senior for forgetting something. 

 4:00 After pretending to look busy for a while, I reask my senior if there's anything I can do. He sends me 83 PDFs I need to print out and punch wholes in. I have no idea what they are, but it doesn't matter.

 5:30 My senior says we can leave. Everyone makes the same jokes about how glad they are it isn't busy season. 

 6:00 - I get home and do some  combination of eating, internets, working out, walking around NYC, or going out for drinks with other interns.

1371663860.0,56,self.Accounting,1go2az,Fellow accountants I need your help with an Audit I am working on and want to hear your opinions on how to catch this bookkeeper who is embezzling!,69,13,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1go2az/fellow_accountants_i_need_your_help_with_an_audit/,"I have been working on an audit for a company as a favor, and have found several red flags. Before you read below, know that so far, out of everything I have done, only a handful FOR THE YEAR transactions in the bank and Quickbooks actually reconcile. Even the biggest idiots who don't know how to use Quickbooks, the numbers will still reconcile. I am so close, but I can't put my finger on exactly how she is doing it!!!

1) The cash deposits in the bank, do not match the Quickbooks. Quickbooks is inflated. Included in this, is a ""deposit"" from AMEX company the same day that a check is written to the AMEX for the C/C bill. In the BKP reconciliation, she says the ""deposit"" from AMEX has cleared, to make the reconciliation of cleared transactions reconcile. Clearly something is off. In process of going through each month on this. AMEX doesn't make deposits. Thoughts?

2) She is taking 25% taxes from draws &amp; commissions paid for each employee (they pay mid month as a draw, and payroll once a month). However no record of where this said ""25%"" is going?!? Clearly the ""draws"" should be just that. Also there is no ""commission payable"" account on the books. I cannot find such record.

3) Something is off with the vacation hours used by employees. Just discovered this. In Quickbooks, it shows each employee as using anywhere from zero hours, to 36 used (which they have not used) and shows hours available all as negative numbers which clearly isn't right. Has anyone had experience with fraud using vacation hours?

4) She has been asking about ""if anyone has been messing with quickbooks"" and suddenly is retiring... because ""she has been frugal all her life"" even though she is a part-time bookkeeper and clearly not retirement age. Also she ""caught"" the previous BKP embezzling through writing checks to himself. So she wont do it easy. And yes, I have talked to the owner about Internal Controls.

5) TONS of voided transactions, checks, voided checks and such on the audit trial. For example, an invoice is entered one month, paid the next and than deleted... lots....I tried to print out the audit trail for this year, and it was over 2,000 pages. 

I am currently working on a spreadsheet comparing deposits in checking and deposits in Quickbooks. I am also comparing the  time cards to the hours paid on the pay stubs (which by the way are way under. She isn't paying vacation time, over-time or the hours reported on the time cards). I am also in the process of computing the paychecks as they should be per time cards and with draws to see what I get....Also reconciling the AMEX credit card.

I need your help fellow accounting peeps. Any suggestions on how to catch this thief!!! 

TL;DR What are some advanced auditing techniques for embezzlement through deposits in bank, payroll (vacation hours, commissions, hours worked and O/T) so I can tie it all together. I can't figure out exactly how she is doing it, but all the work thus far shows she is.",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,False,,tax,True,t3_1go2az,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1go2az/fellow_accountants_i_need_your_help_with_an_audit/,

She has been forced to move around with me as a military spouse, and despite that not only stitched together enough college credits for her Bachelors &amp; Masters degrees, but she also bent over backwards to get those tests done and find a CPA to apprentice under for the year.  
  
Currently we are stationed on a military base in the middle of the prairie of America, so there is virtually no legitimate work for her.  She is amazingly organized and disciplined though, so she has found wage work as an event organizer here on base (which she is very proud of).  
  
Hopefully next year we will move to a bigger city and she can get a job more attuned to her accounting talents.  
  
She doesn't use Reddit so she doesn't have an account, but I'm sure she'd love to see some nice words written by any other finance professionals!

Suggestions will be added to the list. Here's what I have so far - 

* [Red Pencils](http://www.amazon.com/Ticonderoga-Erasable-Checking-Pre-Sharpened-13941/dp/B001BQTOW2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361751670&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=red+pencils). This was from another thread here a couple days ago. Definitely helps with ticking and tying. 

* Some form of [programmable/gaming mouse](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Razer+-+Naga+2012+Expert+MMO+Laser+Gaming+Mouse+-+Black/5559544.p?id=1218661380065&amp;skuId=5559544&amp;st=gaming%20mouse&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1). Having excel shortcuts programmed on your mouse makes formatting that much easier. 

* If your firm already doesn't provide you with one - a [second monitor](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Toshiba+-+21.5%26%2334%3B+Widescreen+LED+HD+Monitor/3775601.p?id=1218431547951&amp;skuId=3775601&amp;st=toshiba%20monitor&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=3). Helps with having your working paper and a reference document open at the same time. Most likely already provided to you.

* [Keypad](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Compucessory+-+Keypad/4498185.p?id=1218479692596&amp;skuId=4498185&amp;sellerId=34492929). Makes those number inputs a lot quicker.

Your first job does not define who you are or what you will do for the rest of your life. To some extent neither does your major, although sure in accounting it tends to influence that first job you find.

Just having a job where you can learn, challenge yourself, develop and grow is what matters initially. After you have 1-2 years it's a bit easier to move on to different things to keep building up on your development. 

It's normal to be afraid of if you are making the right decision. View things as a learning opportunity and realize that a little uncertainty, confusion, and work that ""may not be for you"" can go a long ways to helping you get comfortable with being uncomfortable and being able to tackle road blocks and challenges. Because not everything is going to go how you want it. It's an excellent skill to have. 

After that first hump in the real world you'll have a better idea of what you can tolerate, what interests you, and how to deal with people who you might be at odds with at times.

So while those first couple steps seem really unknown and disconcerting, that can be a good thing. Embrace it as something along the way. It won't define everything about you or your career. Worry about if a job isn't developing and challenging you.

Just thought I'd say that since I see how many students stress about that first job, or where to start your career.

As some of you know, I currently work in public accounting with a regional firm, but I also am very active with recruiting in the southeast. I work closely with recruiters from all of the Big 4, as well as the national and regional firms in my area. Being CPA eligible and becoming a CPA is beginning to no longer be enough anymore.

The consensus I have come to for my region (population over 5 million) is that some of the Big 4 are now starting to require Master degrees of an MTx/MPA/MAcc/IT Audit/Forensic Accounting for entry level positions in the Audit and Tax practices, while others are favoring those with these degrees. This is just starting to develop, however with the growing number of higher education students, Bachelor degrees are starting to lose their value and I have no doubt this situation will continue to rise. With the economy being weak the last several years, more students have been targeting degrees that give them financial security, which has created an influx in Accounting majors, making the field much more competitive.

That being said, with more Accounting students for the firms to pick from, they are able to increase their hiring standards. The Big 4 have begun to be able to set their standards of only accepting Graduate students for full-time positions and offering internships only to those intending to pursue Masters degrees while still being able to meet their hiring quotas.

**Here's the Pros and Cons I see with going the route of a Masters degree:**

***Pros***

* Allows for the highest level of recruitment opportunities. Firms target graduate programs harder than anywhere else and are focusing on hiring students with more education.

* Creates expert knowledge in your field, allowing you to jump-start your career with a higher knowledge base.

* MPA/MAcc Students - Prepares you for the CPA exam which greatly reduces study time necessary to pass each part.

* Increases promotion ability and demand for a higher salary, ends up paying for itself and more over time.

* Distinguishes your name, increasing your credibility and ability to promote yourself to employers and clients (You're not just John Doe, CPA...you're John Doe, CPA, MTx). Clients will feel extra secure as well as feeling they are receiving more value knowing your advanced education accomplishments.

* Networking opportunities - You will meet other highly devoted individuals in similar situations, work hard together through the program, and create long lasting professional connections in the field that can benefit you in the future.

***Cons***

* The cost.

There is a significant number of benefits towards doing a Masters program, and the only real factor I see against it is the cost. However, most people don't seem to realize that there are ways to fight the cost of Graduate school. If you are determined to be active on campus, particularly in the Accounting program, you can work your way into becoming a GRA or GA and have tuition waived by the school. There are tons of scholarships out there as well that most people don't bother applying for. You wouldn't believe what the scholarship award rates are due to students not bothering to apply. Some scholarships are awarded to as many as 40-50% of those that apply.

So, those of you who are currently undergraduate students, this is something to take into consideration. Getting a double major or taking community college courses to hit the 150 might seem beneficial now, but you need to consider what is the appropriate investment for the long-term. Do you want to take that avenue to reach 150 hours and later realize you want to go back for your Masters degree anyways? With the costs of education continuing to rise, this is something that requires serious thought. In decades past, education wasn't very expensive and it wasn't a big deal for a professional in the field for 10-15 years to decide they want to get their Masters. Today, it's a serious investment and something you may not be able to afford later in your career.

For those of you in the public accounting field and active with recruiting, I'd like to hear your input for your regions as well. I think mainly Big 4 are the only ones actually restricting positions to Graduate students, but I have noticed many firms are prioritizing their hiring towards Graduate Students over the Undergraduates with 150 hours.",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,1362459280.0,,tax,True,t3_19ojlw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/19ojlw/discussion_on_the_growing_need_for_a_masters/,

A few thoughts on the job so far.,42,1,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1gpg5f/first_week_as_an_accounting_clerk_a_few_thoughts/,"Just started my new gig as an accounting clerk at an online retailer. This is my very first job out of college, where I studied accounting. I figure I write a few thoughts on the job so far. 

The AR team I work for currently consists of the AR manager (who is a Big Four alum), a woman with three years of experience with AR, another recently-hired college graduate (like myself) and me, of course. 

My manager tells me that the AR team is usually six people total (four accounting clerks have all left the company within the past couple of months), and they are looking to hire at least two more AR people before the end of July. But my manager is holding off on that until he can get me and the other new hire properly trained. The idea is that we will be able to train the other two new hires coming in so that the AR manager can focus on more important things. 

So far, my manager and the other AR clerk have been teaching me and the other new hire how to navigate the company's accounting information system (which is built completely in-house, by the way; they didn't opt for a third party solution like Great Plains or MAS400 or whatever) and post payment/revenue reconciliations on certain kinds of orders that the system doesn't process automatically for some reason or another. 

Since this online retailer operates through Amazon Marketplace and eBay, my primary job the last couple of days has been downloading the raw reports from those websites and matching the information from these reports with entries from our order database. The AIS matches most of the entries automatically, but quite a few have errors, and it's the AR team's job to fix those errors and reconcile both the payments and the revenue correctly so that everything is ultimately entered into the general ledger correctly. 

It took me a few days to get the hang of the system, but I feel comfortable with this task now. The AR manager tells me that he has even more tasks for me and the other new hire (which includes helping the software engineers in the company re-engineer certain AR processes within the AIS software, checking backgrounds and financials of companies we extend credit to, and more!) 

As for the working environment, it's pretty good. The chairs are comfortable, there's plenty of free coffee, and everyone I work with is generally sociable and cool from a first impression. 

I guess it's all cool so far... Just a lot of bitch work, but I guess that's every job out there in a nutshell. I hope I can move up and be a staff accountant.

I know there's plenty of options outside of public, but for the past few years, my career path has been a straight line: go to school, go to graduate school, public internship at some point, pass CPA, be CPA. 


Well, I don't want to work in public accounting. I was going towards that path because that's just what every accounting program will naturally push its students to do. Networking events are with public firms. Accounting career fairs are with public firms. Beta Alpha Psi meetings are trips to public firms or a speaker from a public firm speaking about public accounting. Everything I've learned about public from these things, the stress, the hours, the workload, the type of work...the everything, just makes me say, why the hell am I going to do this to myself? I have pretty horrible social anxiety and I swing in and out of major depression, both which I'm working on, but going into public accounting seems like something that'd easily break me in the first few months. I just don't think I can handle it at all. Big 4 would be suicide, I know a few people working for medium-sized firms and that seems almost as bad...I dunno, public just sounds like bad news for me.



The problem is, I just don't know what to do, or how to do it. I don't know what kind of accounting jobs I can get. I do like accounting, for what it's worth. It's fun and challenging and I have a 4.0GPA within my major (and a 3.95 outside of it). I really loved cost accounting and I loved both intermediate accounting classes (somehow). I mean, strangely enough, I like journal entries. Preparing statements. Balances and ledgers. I like different inventory costing methods and budgets and their variances and work-in-process inventory and spoilage and other cost-accounting things I can't remember. I certainly liked doing those things a lot more than what audit and tax taught me (though tax was pretty fun, too). Professor anecdotes that begin with, ""When I was working at Dow chemical..."" interest me a lot more than, ""When I was working at Deloitte..."" But who are the people who do that in the company? My mind gets stuck on ""bookkeeper"" or ""clerk"" and then my mind gets stuck on ""$10/hour part-time summer job with no room to advance"" and ""good luck living on $10 an hour, I'm sure it'll be totally doable and will lead to the low-stress life you're looking for"" 


I dunno. Maybe it's just the public bias I've been taught by this subreddit and my school. Maybe I'm overthinking this, and getting an accounting job at some manufacturing corporation that'd allow me to live, not extravagantly but at least securely, is more reasonable than I think. It's just...how? Where? For what position? I've been taught online applications are black holes for public accounting firms and the only way to get a job is career fairs, but what if it's not a public accounting firm? I guess I should head to the ""general"" career fair rather than the accounting one and hand out some resumes and try to speak to people and hope for the best? 


I guess at this point I'm just kind of ranting and rambling...so I'll end it here. **tl;dr: no public, what do?**


**Edit:** Thanks, everyone. I know accounting a huge field, and public isn't the ""be all end all"" of accounting as someone put it, but after 3 years at school and browsing this subreddit on occasion it's hard to see other opportunity. But I'm feeling a lot better about everything now, so, thanks again!

1361828229.0,35,self.Accounting,197rv1,"My biggest gripe with entry-level recruitment: forcing recent grads to choose between audit, tax, etc. right out of college",40,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/197rv1/my_biggest_gripe_with_entrylevel_recruitment/,"When I went through the recruitment process, I didn't know what accounting career path I wanted to take. I was genuinely interested in both audit and tax and didn't have the opportunity to complete an internship in public accounting since I wanted to study abroad for a portion of the summer before my senior year. Luckily, I found a real estate management firm offering an in-house accounting job that let me work whatever days I could outside of traveling. While it looked good on a resume, it didn't help me get any closer to a decision between audit and tax. 

Now, I understand that an internship in public accounting is (supposed to be) designed to shed some light on a prospective career path, but how can students possibly know that an alternative path isn't better for them in the long run? It seems unrealistic to expect college students to know what they want to spend several years (or more) of their lives doing. 

The firm I've been working for since graduation has a program that I think more should offer. We allow employees to spend 3-6 months in one of our other departments (we're split between audit, tax, and systems) if they elect to. The number of open spots is obviously limited each year and only certain employees (generally staff and some seniors) are eligible since client needs come first, but it's still a unique opportunity to offer. 

I don't really have a question or anything, just wanted to start some discussion since I feel like this is issue is so entrenched in the public accounting profession.

It is clear that a substantial amount of content on this subreddit has recently geared towards recruiting/entering accounting field, as well as general accounting homework help. As we work on updating our FAQ, I'm sure the amount of these types of posts will decrease, but that's not my focus of this post, as I continue to enjoy helping answer all those people.

As I'm sure many of you are aware, myself and several others on this subreddit dedicate much of our time out of our busy schedules towards answering all these requests for advice and help to no benefit of our own other than the satisfaction of helping others. With that in mind, I have noticed many submissions that are created with little effort or thought put into the post before submitting as well as some people never respond after we have taken the time to offer help.

It's sometimes disappointing when I put in a significant amount of time into responding to someone, when the submitter does not feel the need to put in any effort on their end or even bother to respond. As this community continues to grow, it's more difficult to keep a certain standard. However, I would like to see this community to continue to grow in the direction of having meaningful submissions of discussion rather than being used as a tool to get a quick question answered or homework problem solved. Even though you may be submitting something for yourself, understand that the thread can turn useful for many others in similar situations reading this subreddit.

I do not wish to steer anyone away from submitting to this subreddit, only to request that you contribute the amount of effort you receive in return. If I respond to you asking questions about a situation or for more information, it means that I can provide a better and more thorough answer if you provide that information, but I can't help you if you never respond. We're currently working on improving the quality of this subreddit, but it is going to take an effort from all of us to accomplish this. And for the love of Pete, if you're going to ask for homework help, you MUST show that you have given it your best effort and specifically explain what you have attempted and what you do not understand. Please don't just post a homework problem and expect us to be your personal homework slaves.

For those of you that took the time to read through this, thank you very much! Also, I wanted to mention that if any of you send me private messages and don't hear a response from me, please don't hesitate to send another.

They have an ""URGENT"" need for a financial analyst.  They want three years of public accounting experience, prefer Big4, and prefer that you already be a CPA.  It's in an area with a high cost of living too: Washington DC.  So what are they willing to pay for this URGENT need?  $45-55k per year.  That is less than what a fresh graduate in DC with no CPA and no experience would make at a Big4 or regional firm.  Maybe they'll find someone burned out during busy season and desperate to take anything?  I don't know.

I also had a recruiter leave a voicemail and email me about an ""exciting"" opportunity a few months back.  When I asked about compensation, it was a temp job, with no benefits, that paid about half of what I was making at the time.  Exciting indeed!

[**The Accountant**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222675/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) -- A charming 30-minute short about a hillbilly, alcoholic, savant tax accountant who spends his days trying to help local farmers out of financial trouble and prevent creditors from taking over multi-generational family farms. 

Some of my favorite quotes:

&gt; * *""Y'can tell a lot about a man by the kind of beer he drinks.""*

&gt; * (When asked if he wants a calculator) *""A man who can't add his own numbers aint' much of a man in my book""*

&gt; * *""Your grampa will roll over in his grave when some rich Yankee buys this place, paints it fuschia, and turns it into a bed and breakfast. I seen it happen.""*

[**The Untouchables**](http://www.imdb.com/find?q=the+untouchables&amp;s=all) -- Guns, bombs, booze...and Capone's empire is brought down by something as mundane as tax evasion.

[**Arbitrage**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764183/?ref_=sr_1) -- A big wig CEO of an investment firm is on the verge of selling the company for a hefty gain. The only thing is that he had to personally borrow $400M to replace investors' funds that he fraudulently lost gambling on a poor foreign investment and pray that the auditors don't catch it as a part of the due diligence. The kicker? His twenty-something daughter, who is CIO of the company, discovers this ""strange"" reconciling item that is unaccounted for. How the hell do you NOT think anyone is going to ask about a single $400M debit to cash?

[**Die Hard**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) -- Hans Gruber's main target is millions in negotiable bearer bonds...My corporate taxation professor once said this doesn't make sense, but I don't recall the reason why.

[**Heat**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) -- In one scene, a hacker discusses daily cash flow information that he intercepted from a bank's computer system in an attempt to entice Robert De Niro's crew into robbing the bank. The best part? [It's printed on green bar](http://i.imgur.com/3TyUm.jpg). Splooge.

[**Shawshank Redemption**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/) -- Tax returns, money laundering, bank fraud, and tax-free gifts. Mmmmmmmm.

[**Breaking Bad**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) -- **SPOILERS** In addition to cooking corporate books for her boss, Skyler shows her ""finesse"" as an accountant by figuring out that the best way to launder Walt's drug money is to buy a car wash to run the cash through, and boy does she do her due diligence:
&gt; While proposing an offer to the car wash's existing owner: 

&gt; *""On a typical day you average 19 cars per hour. Extrapolating, I added the extra revenues for hand-waxes and detailing, subtracted your overhead, salary and maintenance, operating fees, depreciation (which I obtained from comparable businesses in the Albuquerque area), giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow, to which I applied the industry standard multiplier and added the market value of your real estate giving me a total estimated value of $829,000 on top of which I generously added an extra $50,000 so as to not be insulting.""*

[**Margin Call**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615147/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) -- Great fictional portrayal of the night executives of a large investment banking firm first realize that the 2008 crash is about to hit. They spend the next day trying to off-load all of their investment positions in sub-prime mortgage insurance before the rest of the world finds out what's going on. Stars the guy who plays Spock in the new Star Trek movies, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey, Stanely Tucci, and others. 

[**Ghost Busters**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) -- In addition to being the Keymaster, Rick Moranis plays a kooky tax lawyer.

Looking at defense contractors may just be the stepping stone that could land you a job.  It is my personal opinion that with this economy it is no time to be a martyr...  Check out these links if nothing else just to see what is out there.  As we all know (from job postings), those first 2-3 years are what give you the edge out there.  This is just food for thought and I really appreciate the responses I have gotten from this forum:-)

I mentioned that I'd enjoy shadowing her and that an internship would be the next step for me in my education. She agreed and we are meeting next week to discuss the meat and bones of a contract etc.

Will the Real Accountant, Please Stand Up? – To the rhythm/beat (whatever) of “Slim Shady” by Eminem

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please? 
Will the real accountant, please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real accountant, please stand up?
We’re gonna have a problem here:

Y’all act like you’ve never seen a real audit before
Jaws all on the floor like Ernst and Young just burst through the door
Started sampling worse than before, going through drawers, turnin over furniture
It’s the return of the—aw wait, no wait, you’re kidding, he didn’t just say what I think he did…did he?
And Arthur Andersen said --- nothing you idiots Arthur Andersen’s dead, they’re all over the country

Feminist women love CPAs *chigga chigga chigga* “Deloitte, I’m sick of them, look at them
Walkin around, sampling you know what, interviewin you know who”
“yeah but they’re so efficient though” Yeah we probably got a couple of screws up in our head loose
But it’s no worse than what’s goin on inside your board room
Sometimes, we just want to leave our laptops and just let loose
But we can’t, so can we at least get some grey goose?

My rec is on your lips, my rec is on your lips, and if I’m lucky
You might just give me a little tip, and expect me not to know what the expenses balance is
Of course you’re gonna make me adjust entries, by the time I hit send re: here’s your reconciliation, reply please?
We ain’t nothin but camels, we go from audit to audit without stopping for even happy meals
But if we can balance budgets and fudge it through the audit, then there’s no reason that another
Auditor can’t get hope

If ya feel like I feel I got the antidote, seniors let us go on home, sing the chorus and it goes:

(Chorus – Repeat 2x)

I’m an accountant, yes I’m an accountant, all you other college majors are
finance and haters. So won’t the real accountant, please stand up? Please stand up? Please stand up?

You know, private companies don’t have to follow Sarbanes-Oxley. Well we do, so fuck that and fuck you too. You think we give a damn about your work flow? Half of you critics can’t even remember us, let alone understand us. 
But auditing, what if you weren’t, wouldn’t it be weird? Why, so you guys can just lie to keep me here, and sit me here next to Britney Spears, yo you know she needs an audit better switch me chairs, so I
Can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst, and hear em argue over who is goin bankrupt first
Lil Jon, he needs to file his 1040 and do it quick because it’s getting close to 10/15
I should download his audio on MP3 and show the whole world how we do our 1120’s
I’m sick of you little interns all you do is annoy me so I have been sittin here to destroy you
And there’s a million of us just like me, who dress like me, who just don’t give a fuck like me,
Walk talk and act like me and might just be the next best thing, but not quite me!

(chorus – 2x)

I’m like a head trip to listen to, cause I’m only giving you things you joke about in your cafeteria room,
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y’all and I don’t gotta
Be false and sugarcoat it all
I just get on Excel and hit it, and whether you like to admit it, I just did it 
Better than 90% of you associates out there and then you ask
“well how can firms take on these workloads in truckloads?” It’s funny, cause at the rate I’m going
When I’m 30, I’ll be the only person in the cubicle hurting, 
Crying to myself while outlook isn’t working, and the intern, he’s surfing 
The internet and isn’t working
And every single person is an accountant lurking 
He could be working around your state
Or checking out your LIBOR rate
Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming “I NEED A BALL POINT PEN”, with his windows down and his notepad up

So will the real accountant please stand up and put one of those blue pencils in each hand up
And be proud to be out of your house and under control one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

(Chorus 4x)

My idea is that I will post a topic the night before (around 11pm or so). I will also try to post some questions to get the critical thinking juices going. 

I've set up an email address (redditacctdailydiscussion@gmail.com), as a well as a dropbox because I can't always provide links to articles (mainly because you have to pay for many sources). I'll provide a link to the dropbox when an article is posted in there. 

I'll try to provide several articles on the same topic, so we can cover the many stakeholders of accounting information (investors, auditors, government, etc). If you have any recommendations or articles, don't be afraid to send me a link or just a general email. Also, I'll be looking for a lot of feedback on if ya'll think this is working or not. 

As usual, since we are all professionals, let's keep it to constructive criticism and don't take anything as professional advice.

The opportunity I have in front of me is through my first accounting job. I worked for this guy who owned a business selling computer and electronic related hardware online. They now selling pretty much everything and have grown from a $4 million dollars in revenue a year company when I left 3 years ago to a $24 million dollar company. I left that company because I needed to focus on school and also get different experience within accounting. 

Now the McGladrey position is a good job. It has good salary, good benefits, it’s safe, and there is growth. But my god, it is boring and not something I have passion for at all. I met with my old boss from the old company and he wants me back. Essentially, he wants to bring me up to a position that acts like a CFO. He never had a great accounting system going on. When he hired me, I was his first accountant and I set up quickbooks for him. Now he wants me back and have me take on roles that oversee the finances, accounting, and investments of the firm. This is something I’ve always wanted to do and is a great opportunity. The salary will be paying more than my current job after the first 90 days and the potential to make a lot more quickly along possible with equity in the firm. The biggest benefit and what I want most out of a job is to take ownership of my work and be part of something where I can help make it grow. I want that passion where I can wake up every morning with a purpose and I feel like this new career will take me to that place. 

The problem is that I have is that if I do make this switch, I can’t go back to McGladrey or the big corporate world. No one will want to see that I’ve only worked for McGladrey for two months on my resume and then see some company no one has heard of. Few will hire me and hire me to a position and salary I deserve. This new company though isn’t some 5 year job or 10 year job, it is a lifelong commitment that I will be part of and benefit from. I am friends with the owner and have known him for 5 years. In addition, I am not that experienced. I may have had two tax jobs and some other accounting internships but I will make a lot of mistakes. My old boss knows this and says he will bring me up to be where I need to be because he sees potential in me.

What do you think Reddit? Should I stick with McGladrey through this storm or should I make that life-changing and risky career decision that can leader to a happier life and potentially more $$?

While I don't think r/accounting is all of a sudden going to turn in to r/funny, I can understand the issue that those who have been around this subreddit a long time have with the possible watering down of content.

There's a lot of subreddits on this website that aren't really of any substance or unique. I think what makes /r/accounting unique is that we are not the typical reddit users. This is not anything against those outside of r/accounting, but we as a group are well educated and able to offer a lot of knowledgeable advice/information to each other through this subreddit. I'd argue that this subreddit is more of a resource and a forum for professional discussion/advice than it is for karma whoring, stereotypical comments, etc. that you find on a lot of other subreddits. 

This isn't a post meant to discourage people from posting in this subreddit or to make people second guess whether they should submit something. It's to make people think before they submit something in the subreddit. Ask yourself, ""Am I contributing to /r/accounting by posting this?"" 

Personally, I'm guilty previously of posting something to this subreddit that wasn't of any real content and was maybe good for a cheap laugh at best. But I don't want to see  those that expressed concerned about the use of memes driven away because of their valuable contributions to this forum.

I know that I'm missing a ton. Can anyone help me out and post some basic differences that I can add.

**Statement of Cash Flows:**

1. GAAP you can use either the indirect or direct method, IFRS you can only use the direct method

2. For GAAP Interest X, Interest Rev and Dividend Revenues are always reported as operating. Dividends paid are reported as financing. Under IFRS Interest X and Dividends Paid can be reported as either operating OR financing. Interest Revenue and Dividend Revenues can be reported as operating OR investing

**Construction contracts:**

1. GAAP uses either percentage of completion OR completed contracts method, whereas completed contracts is prohibited by IFRS

**Income Statement:**

1. GAAP has a separate classification for ""extraordinary items"" that must be reported net of tax beneath net income. In IFRS no such classification exists.

**Inventory:**

1. GAAP can choose between LIFO and FIFO, in IFRS there is no LIFO option

2. Under GAAP inventory is carried at lower of cost or replacement cost, for IFRS it is lower of cost or NRV

3. Under GAAP inventory write-downs cannot be reversed. For IFRS if the reasons for the impairments no longer exist, the inventory can be written up back to the original basis

**Current vs. Non-Current:**

1. GAAP can report current liabilities as long term if a refinancing agreement exists prior to the issuance of the balance sheet. For IFRS a refinancing agreement must exist prior to the balance sheet date to qualify as non-current

**Asset Valuation:**

1. For GAAP the revaluation of assets is prohibited. For IFRS, it is an acceptable accounting policy to periodically apply to an entire class of assets. IFRS can revalue intangibles to FMV if there is a market for them to easily determine FMV

2. In GAAP you rarely see component depreciation. For IFRS component depreciation is mandatory for assets where different components depreciate in different ways

3. IFRS has a separate classification for ""biological assets"" (living animals and plants), that are reported at fair value less estimated cost to sell. In GAAP no such classification exists, and biological assets are reported at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.

**Gains and Losses:**

1. Under GAAP a loss contingency is accrued only if the loss is PROBABLE and the amount is reasonably estimable. For IFRS the loss only needs to be more likely than not to be accrued

2. When a contingent loss is judged to be probable within a range of amounts and no number within that range is viewed as more likely, GAAP requires the recognition of the lowest number in that range. In that same circumstance, IFRS requires the recognition of the midpoint in the range

**Costs:**

1. R&amp;D costs are expensed under GAAP, unless there is a separate standard to guide it. Under IFRS development costs are capitalized at technological feasibility assuming future economic benefits are probable

2. Under GAAP costs incurred defending an intangible asset are capitalized as part of the intangible. Under IFRS they are expensed as incurred

**Bonds:**

1. Under IFRS any amount extra that is received for a bond because of its convertibility is recorded as equity rather than as a liability. According to GAAP, the entire amount received is reported as a liability until such time as the bond is actually converted

2. Under GAAP debt issue costs are put into an asset account and amortized over the life of the bond. Under IFRS, the bond liability is reported net of debt issue costs.

**Leases:**

1. To be a capital lease under GAAP one of the (TT, BPO, 75, 90) test must be met. To be a capital lease under IFRS the lease term must only consist of a ""significant portion"" of the assets useful life. This is a lower standard than GAAP

2. For capital leases under IFRS both the lessor and the lessee must use the interest rate implicit in the agreement. Under GAAP the lessee can use the incremental borrowing rate as his interest rate. This means that under GAAP the lessor ant the lessee can book different interest rates for the same transaction.

3. Under GAAP if the fair value of the land component of a lease is greater than 25% of the total lease, the land and building must be reported separately. For IFRS the land and building are always recorded separately",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,False,,student,True,t3_p0zwj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/p0zwj/im_making_a_list_of_differences_between_gaap_and/,

1376414268.0,21,self.Accounting,1kaf76,Why You Should Join Beta Alpha Psi (or a similar Accounting organization),39,18,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1kaf76/why_you_should_join_beta_alpha_psi_or_a_similar/,"If anyone has seen my posts around here, you have probably seen me recommend or asking about Beta Alpha Psi in a lot of them, especially on ""what are my chances"" or resume critiques. I figured I'd make a post about what I feel, in my experiences, are the benefits, both tangible and intangible, or joining BAP, or a similar organization if BAP isn't big at your school. I'm not talking about your basic ""Business"" fraternities. I'm talking about those directed specifically at Accounting students. Also, don't think just because you don't go to a top 10 accounting program that you're BAP chapter is inactive. I go to a large, but maybe not even top 100 school, and my chapter is incredibly active. I'm not expecting this to be stickied or anything like that, but hopefully a lot of students will see it, either now or in a search later, and learn what I feel are the huge benefits of BAP. 

Now here's my disclaimer/credentials combo. I'm an upcoming fourth year in a five year program. Some of you may scoff at my inexperience, and that's fine. Others of you who are interested in this, my ""credentials"" are a future Big 4 intern in a major metro well outside my school's recruiting market. I recruited for a Summer Leadership Program, got it, and got an internship offer directly after the program. I can now basically chill for the next two years. 

Without further ado, here is what I feel are the top reasons to join BAP.

**1. Resume Booster:** The obvious benefit of BAP is the fact that it's another line on your resume. Depending on how loaded your resume is, this may or may not be a big deal. If you're just a basic member, (i.e. not an officer, committee member or head, or mentor), all it really will be is something to list under ""Activities"" as a member. That said, I believe most firms are aware of the responsibilities that come with being a member, and look highly upon it even without being in a leadership role. 

On that point, being a leader in BAP can be even better for a resume booster. Officers, committee members, or mentors shows an added level of responsible. We all know that correlation does *not* equal causation, but I can say that at one of my Big 4 pre-interview dinners, there was 1 out of ~15 students that wasn't in BAP, and they were in the student accounting society.

**2. Information About Career Paths:** While many of us simply learned through online research the path we wanted to take (small firm vs big firm, public vs. private, audit vs. tax), many students in my chapter weren't so sure. We held meetings based on these topics, where older students would outline the differences, share experiences, and answer questions.

**3. Resume Workshops, Interview Workshops, and Mock Interviews:** Throughout the semester, we have several resume workshops that were quite helpful, especially if you are just looking for the ""finishing touches"" for your resume. If you have a great resume that you may just want a few pointers for, why not have a senior manager at EY (or a small firm, we have those too, just an example) look over it, and have them see how great your resume is? If your resume is weaker, maybe try career services first.

The interview workshops tend to be more just presentations than interactive workshops, but if you're looking for tips, who better to hear from than a firm you want to work for? The mock interviews are more interactive, and we bring out companies that don't really hire recent grads. This takes off the pressure of screwing up, and allows you to learn from the experience. I did one and it was an *incredible* confidence booster.

**4. Network With Your Peers:** BAP gives you a fantastic opportunity to get helpful tips on recruiting, career opportunities, classes, and everything in between from people who have been there, done that. Wanna know if you really need the book for an upcoming class? Trying to decide between audit and tax? Looking to go out of market and not sure where to start? There is almost definitely someone who would be more than willing to help. And my awesome job on campus where I set my own hours, work between classes, do homework when its slow, and get a bunch of fancy responsibilities for my resume to go with it at $11/hr? Got it with the help of my BAP mentor who was leaving for a Big 4. 

One other thing that people may forget that I think is important. When you surround yourself with motivated people, like in BAP, it makes you strive to be better yourself. You see how fierce the competition is, and it makes you push yourself to be that much better. I know my outlook changed when I realized that I wasn't the only one with great grades and work experience.

**5. Network With Professionals:** Almost every week, our meetings are with some sort of firm or company. The emphasis is put on Public Accounting firms, both large and regional, but we also have private. That means every single week members get a chance to hear from people who work at a firm they may be interested in, and more importantly, get a chance to network with them at the post-meeting social. You'd be surprised how candid some of these professionals and recruiters are, and you will learn a lot. The two main benefits, IMO, come from getting to know people who may be interviewing you on a first name basis, and becoming comfortable with speaking to the professionals, so you don't stutter at the Career Fair/Meet the Firms when it really counts. 

To speak a little more to the point of getting to know the recruiters, because I joined BAP so early, by the time Summer Leadership Program recruiting came around, I had already spoken with some recruiters several times, and was much more comfortable around them. I ended up going to several SLP programs and getting internship offers. While I obviously could only accept one (which was out of market where I really wanted to go), I now feel that I am in good standing enough with a Partner at another firm that if things didn't work out, I could still have a great shot at the other firm. 

I hope this was helpful for those of you on the fence about BAP or a similar organization, or just looking for something to improve your odds of landing with one of your preferred firms, be it a Big 4 or a regional firm. I can tell you with pretty good certainty that joining BAP was one of the best things I could do to increase my odds of landing at a Big 4, especially with my goal of going out of market. 

**TL;DR: BAP is really great for more than just a resume booster. If you're serious about landing a job at your preferred firm, I'd recommend it.**",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,1376414698.0,,student,True,t3_1kaf76,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1kaf76/why_you_should_join_beta_alpha_psi_or_a_similar/,

Hardest part of the exam for me, as I took it FOUR TIMES!! Anyways, I thought I would share if anyone out there is struggling. I tried EVERYTHING and studied numerous different prep courses, with no luck. I just could not score above low 60's. I knew the information, I just couldn't put it together on the exam. So one day I got fed up, and I thought ""What is the nature of Auditing?"". I came up with two things:

1) Enron. Auditing did a complete 180 after Enron. So I studied a book on Enron. What they did, how they go away with it and the nature of why Enron rocked the accounting world. On my exam, when I read questions, I put it in terms of Enron. Which created a real world example that my brain could link the information with reality, not just stupid test questions.


2) Audit reports. I printed out all the Audit reports, and read them outloud every night for two months. When your brain hears things instead of reading them in your head, it processes in a different part of your brain. So essentially you are storing the information in two parts of your brain. When I took the exam, literally when I read the questions, the wrong answer would stand out like a bright light.

What makes one want to become an accountant? The same question exists for lots of occupations, but accounting seems like the most occupation-as-a-job career out there. Maybe nobody grows up knowing they want to be a programmer, but they play some video games and figure out how to make those. Is it the same with accounting?

I'm a Chartered Accountant who designed [this app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finalytics/id666540465?ls=1&amp;mt=8) as a pet project. I had some free time between jobs and wanted to do something productive. It has been a great learning experience so far.

I noticed that the quality of the financial analysis apps on the itunes store were terrible and realized I could probably create a better version myself. I put together an Excel prototype and outsourced the programming to a freelance developer. I tried to keep the first version as simple as possible to keep costs down, but also to stay focused on the core functionality of the app. My aim was to produce the maximum amount of ratios with the minimum amount of inputs.

I would appreciate it if you guys had a look give me some feedback or tips for improvement. I would like to keep adding to the core functionality of the app, like expanding it to include cash flow ratios or basic valuations.

Here is the [link.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finalytics/id666540465?ls=1&amp;mt=8) It's free for this weekend only.

I graduated a year ago with my masters in accounting. I finished all my CPA tests (passed all) and I've been working in one of the big four. I love the work and I like the challenge aspect of the job. I like what I do. Sadly, I've quickly learned that the better you are the more you are utilized. When I say I'm being utilized, I mean I went through my 12/31s, currently going through a 3/31, have a small 6/30 and a large 9/30. I'm essentially in a perpetual busy season. I've tried talking to my 'career advisor' but he gives me the 'it's a great career advancement' speech. Like a lot of big four firms, we're understaffed so getting out of these clients I don't think it's much of an option. 

To put it bluntly, I want out. My original plan was do the 3-year jump out after getting the senior title but I don't know if I can physically take it. I've already put on what feels like 50 pounds. Although, I'm not sure where to go or what type of role to take. I still want a company that will advance my career, likely not as fast public accounting, but similarly. I've thought about internal audit or a financial analyst role but I'm not sure if those would be good career moves.

Make sure your formatting is consistent; that means fonts are the same, dates are in the same place, headings are the same size, what is under your headers matches what your headers say, etc.

Spelling and grammar

When listing what you did for an employer use action words, don't say
""Record journal entries each month""
instead say
""Entered monthly journal entries to help accurately reflect income"" or something similar. 

Be more specific:
Don't say ""Handled journal entries"" nobody knows what that means, does that mean you just passed them on?
Say ""Entered or Recorded or Created and entered journal entries to account for monthly depreciation expense to accurately reflect income""

If you're going to cite sales increases or something, you need to provide a number, accountants/managers like numbers

Don't list things that outsiders in the industry you worked might not understand, also don't list software you worked with that is very industry specific as it won't really apply to working in an accounting firm. You might mention it during an interview if you think it could help.

If you are going for an entry-level position, make sure to list your GPA on your resume, if your overall is sort of low, break them out: overall GPA 3.0, accounting GPA 3.5 or something, opposite is true if your accounting GPA is dragging you down, just list the overall.

Don't put references available upon request on your resume, the employer will ask for them when you fill out your paperwork to get hired.

Your resume should be what gets the employers interested to bring you in for the interview and once your in, make sure you can give a STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Resolution) to each point on your resume.

Seems like there is a lot of students and those interested in public accounting asking about the work life, interviews, lines of service, etc. I think it would beneficial to have a collective AMA to supplement the sort of activity we have in this subreddit to let people see the variety of responses and how our experience may or might have differed. 

Is there interest to those would be audience? And is there interest in others helping answer questions? This is more an interest check. Maybe we can organize something more scheduled.

However, the first $40,000 or so (up to the median personal income in the US) would not be taxable.

*Dear member,*

*CICA and CMA Canada have set January 1, 2013, as the target date for the official launch of CPA Canada, the national organization that will support provincial bodies that have unified, and all those that will unify, under the CPA banner. The initial members of CPA Canada will be CICA and CMA Canada. Provincial bodies (and their members) will become members of CPA Canada as they complete their process to become a CPA body.*

*Establishment of a national body for Canada's CPA profession is a significant step forward. Work is underway on development of the structure and by-laws for the new national body, as well as the Collaboration Accord that will govern the inter-relationship between CPA Canada and the provincial bodies that participate in unification. It is anticipated that initially only certain operations of CICA and CMA Canada, such as the development of the CPA certification program, will be integrated within CPA Canada. CICA and CMA Canada will remain in place until such time as all national operations are transferred to CPA Canada (expected in 2013) and all provincial organizations have completed the necessary process to unify under the CPA banner, which could take several years.*

*Creation of CPA Canada ensures that its top priority, the development of a new CPA certification program that is as rigorous as all existing programs, will be in place for delivery in parts of Canada by fall 2013, with the first CPA exams offered in the fall of 2015. The CPA competency map and supporting educational requirements will be released shortly.*

*More information will be shared with members as plans and timelines for establishing CPA Canada are developed.*

*Sincerely,*

*Kevin Dancey, FCA*
*President and CEO*

I'm not 100% clear what is going on.  I personally think it degrades the work we put in to get to our position versus the CMA. Sure they'll differentiate it now, but down the road, I personally think the designation will be ""watered down"". 

Just wanted to know what others opinion is on this.

=================

For those not familiar, for years apparently, there has always been discussions to merge the various accounting designations. But it wasn't until the past year that talks REALLY picked up. 

CA (Chartered Accountant) - Authorized to sign audits. Much more education required, including the exam process. Manditory university courses.

CMA (Certified Managerial Accountant) - Commonly the 'company accountant' type position. Can get through with university and college courses.

CGA (Certified General Accountant) - Commonly a 'personal accountant' that handles compilations and reviews.

1340002917.0,18,self.Accounting,v7r2d,What are your thoughts on a National CPA license with uniform requirements?,22,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/v7r2d/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_national_cpa_license/,"I have been wondering ever since I started studying accounting why CPA licenses were granted on a state by state basis. Since joining and participating on /r/accounting I have seen the degrees of differences between state requirements. For example, I live in Utah where most people I graduated my MAcc program with essentially had to have their MAcc degree in-hand *before* they could even apply to sit for the CPA exam. Instead of waiting a decent amount of people are testing under other states and transferring the test scores back to Utah upon completion of the CPA exams.

From my understanding the purpose of the education requirements were to make sure people are at a proficient level to ""protect the public"" so to speak. I haven't been able to reconcile why, under this argument, that there are such significant differences between the states. Are certain states with lower initial requirements alluding at something?

If I have a misunderstanding of the topic please let me know. I would like to know more about this. 

My questions are: 

What do you think about having a single national CPA designation? 

If so, what would be there requirements be that you would impose? 150 credit hours? Work Experience? BS/BA or MS? Test during school or after? Other?",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,False,,tax,True,t3_v7r2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/v7r2d/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_national_cpa_license/,

I would like to thank each of you for your interest in the post, firstly.  I understand that all the postings in response to this are merely the opinions of the poster, regardless of that individual’s accreditation, and I will not consider it legal advice or counsel; instead, solely as friendly opinions and points of discussion. I would prefer that opinions be supported with accredited sources when applicable. Again, thank you all for your incite and perspectives, trust that all information you can provide will be taken to heart. 

**Background:**

I am a senior undergraduate accounting major at a small, private, not-for-profit university. Because of the nature of the underlying questions involved in this posting and the confidentiality involved I will not disclose the name of the university. I am currently employed as the Intern to the Finance Department of that university, in which I work directly under the CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance, the Director of Risk Management/Assistant VP of Finance, and the Director of Compliance and Tax Issues. Additionally, I am currently wrapping up my 150 with plans to sit for all four sections of the CPA during the summer, after I graduate in May. Following my graduation, I have an offer to begin in the fall with a CPA firm as an auditor; I previously worked as a tax/audit intern with the firm. That firm currently audits the financial statement of the university of which I am employed and attend, however, though a different office than that which I would be employed and with a different partner than that I would work under.

**Situation:** 

Within the past week I became aware that a number of professors at my university, including one in the accounting department who informed me, believe that there may be a number of material misrepresentations in the university’s Form 990 (the not-for-profit tax return, issued to the IRS and disclosed to the public) and the possibility of a number of illegal accounting activities, as a result of management fraud. Specifically, to the best of my knowledge, the group of professors believes that three identifiable frauds may be occurring: misstatements in the 990 compensation disclosures, misrepresentations in the 990 treatment of our art collection, and the unlawful and fraudulent use of proceeds from the sale of assets included in that art collection. 

Firstly, this group of professors believes that the 990 form misrepresents the university it its disclosures related to the compensation; however, not the specific dollar values, but rather the related yes or no questions. I have no knowledge to suggest this accusation has any merit and have very limited knowledge as to the evidence or knowledge being used by the group of professors unofficially investigating the issue. 

However, I am more aware of the circumstances of possible fraud relating to the art collection and the use of its proceeds and its treatment on the 990. Our university has long held an art collection valued at roughly 1.5 million dollars which was reflected on both the audited financial statements and the 990 form until 3 years ago. At that time our university came under new management, including a new President and a new CFO/Treasurer/EVP of Finance. Apparently, under that new management the university decided that the art collection should be liquidated and assigned the accounting professor mentioned previously, along with others, to investigate how to go about the liquidation process. He informed me that he recommended that the university’s only options were to either reinvest the proceeds back into the art collection or donate the collection to a not-for-profit which could be better suited for the collection. He also informed me that the following year the art collection was no longer shown on the 990.

Since the conversation, I have started looking into the issue myself. I came to a similar conclusion regarding the proper treatment of art collections and the required reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of art collections, as is outlined in SFAS 116 and FASB ASC 958. Also, I have compared the audited financial statements against the 990 to confirm that the art collection still exists, and is shown as “Art Collection” on the audited financials, but shown as “Other” under the Part VI disclosure of the Schedule D attached the 990. Additionally, the 990 has a series of questions and additional disclosures related to art collections, these are either unanswered or answered in contrary to the existence of an art collection on the 990. My understanding of the instructions regarding the 990 would require alternative answers to those provided by management in the case of our art collections, and the purpose with which they were donated and had been capitalized and recognized. 

Today I was informed by one of my direct supervisors that I would be involved in the liquidation of some of the university’s art. I asked him what purpose the university was planning on using the proceeds of the sale of the pieces for and he informed me that the funds would be uses as general revenue and would go into our general fund without restrictions. Also, I asked what percentage of the collection we were planning on liquidating and he informed me that the pieces we were planning on liquidating where not included in our collection according to the financial statements, the collection is stored at a local art museum. These pieces were assorted items with which we had been unable to valuate and properly keep track of. He said there are inadequate records regarding these pieces and that updating and compiling those records would be the majority of my duties related to the liquidation. 

**Request for Advice:**

I would appreciate any additional understanding you could pass onto me regarding the proper treatment of these items and please correct any misunderstanding I may have regarding the regulations and laws related. 

I am looking for advice regarding how best to handle the situation in general. It is important to me that I uphold the code of conduct of the AICPA and avoid any unlawful and unethical actions during the remainder of my employment at the university. 

My university does have a whistleblower policy which I will be forced to utilize if I find any substantive evidence of fraud; I would appreciate any incite as to when/if you think I should use this. 

What disclosures am I required, permitted, discouraged, or prohibited from making to my department, the professors, and my CPA firm which audits the university?

What would you do in my situation?

Any other advise you think would be useful. 

**Current Opinion:**

I am currently leaning toward a course of action which will try and avoid involvement in the situation. I believe that I should make my supervisors aware of the restrictions and regulations related to art collections and inform them of my opinions regarding 990 disclosures related to art collections. Also, I believe I should inform them that “I have become aware of concerns related to the answers provided in the 990 form” and leave it at that. I may also have to request not to be involved in the art liquidation process. Additionally, I thought I would inform the professor I spoke to (and am currently taking an accounting ethics course with) that I was going to make this disclosure to my supervisors. Also, I do not believe I can inform the CPA firm of any of this because it is confidential information I acquired outside of my employment with them. 

**Conclusion:**

Thank you again for your input and concern. I truly appreciate any insight you all can offer and will consider it thoroughly. As I am sure you all can see, I really feel as though I have no other good source to seek counsel from, with my future firm, supervisors, and professors all intimately involved. As stated above I would prefer any references to creditable sources when available just because of the nature of reddit and the fact that I may have to support my positions in the future if an investigation ensues.

There currently exists a gap between the public's perception of an audit opinion and what an auditor is actually responsible for. This can present a liability for audit firms as client's shareholders attempt to pursue reparations for losses. 

[History of the Expectations Gap](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75590686/Articles/Towards%20an%20Understanding%20of%20the%20Expectations%20Gap.pdf) - I would recommend reading the first part of this academic paper as it defines the phrase ""Expectations Gap"" and gives  a short history.

[GOA](http://blogs.smeal.psu.edu/grumpyoldaccountants/archives/498#more-498) - The grump old accountants give their opinion on the problem of the expectations gap. They point to some good studies on the subject (one of which is the history study linked above).

[PCAOB](http://pcaobus.org/Rules/Rulemaking/Docket034/Concept_Release.pdf) - This is a link to the PCAOB's concept release for the revised audit opinion. This is critical reading for this discussion.

Some questions to help you get the creative juices flowing:

Does the responsibility for understanding the audit opinion fall on the public, or should auditors change it to allow better understanding?

Since audits are a function of risk-based cost/benefit, do you believe that expansion of the audit opinion creates greater cost with little benefit, or vice versa?

What is your opinion on the PCAOB concept release? Try to touch on some of the alternatives presented in the release (AD&amp;A, Emphasis, Assurance on items outside the financials, Clarification of language).

Since I started working here, I've been putting in 11-13 hour days during busy season, and when we're ""slow"" it's more like 50-60 hours a week.

Unlike a lot of my classmates, I was never able to crack the Big Four because of my poor interviewing skills. I applied for internships during junior year, got nothing, and applied for full-time positions, but still got nothing. 

Having given up on the Big Four, I started my job search in late April, about a month before graduation. I also brushed up on my interviewing skills. I was looking for entry-level accounting roles in the private and public sector. After about eight in-person interviews and another dozen phone ones, I was still without a job and started looking for temp work. 

A few days ago, I interviewed with a privately-held, medium-sized e-commerce company downtown for an entry-level A/R role within the company's accounting and finance department. The interview went well, but I had grown so pessimistic at this point that I wasn't expecting anything but a rejection. 

Today, they gave me the lucky break I was looking for. **I was offered a job.** I will note that a part of my compensation consisted of several hundred shares of restricted stock (which I cannot sell until 2018), so apparently they really want to keep people with the company for the long term. The guys I interviewed with (the general accounting manager, and the director of finance) both started their careers as interns at this company. 

Granted, my overall salary is low ($35K), but given my lack of experience and lack of other employment offers, I'm willing to take it. I did not negotiate further with the HR lady. 

I start in a few weeks, and I am excited. I'm planning to brush up on my Excel skills (particularly H and VLookups) and on SQL in the meanwhile, so that I am ready to go when I start. 

In terms of the future, if the upward mobility is as good as promised, I'll likely stay for the next long while (at least until I see an IPO). At this point, I don't feel like I missed out by not having received an offer from a Big Four firm - I like this company's vibe and I feel that they will do very well in the future.

1363056904.0,17,self.Accounting,1a4i2e,I think my company may have committed a small act of fraud.,20,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1a4i2e/i_think_my_company_may_have_committed_a_small_act/,"Okay, this is admittedly a small issue, but it's something that bothers me ethically, and it's one of many things contributing to my desire to leave this company once I obtain my CPA.

The company I work (let's call it ABC) for is a small partnership, with the majority shareholder being the S Corp (Mother Ship) we're a spin-off from.

I'm the only accountant for the company.  I cut checks, run financials, file, audit, etc.  About a month before the end of the year, I get a request from HR to cut and pay a check to the company CEO for a little over $10K.  In speaking with her and explaining that I need backup documents for what the check was for, she specifically mentioned to me that it was a reimbursement for a political contribution.  I'm still learning quite a bit in accounting, so I nonchalantly put it in our ""Contributions"" account and went on my way.

About a week later I get a phone call from the CFO, stating that she wants me to change the account that went into.  It's actually supposed to go into ""Executive Bonuses"".  This is when my ears pricked up, since HR was adamant that it was a political contribution reimbursement, and bonuses had already been paid for the year.  I relented to the CFO's request, but placed a note on the transaction that this was originally communicated to me as being a political contribution.

The check was cut and I delivered it to the CEO personally.  He seemed surprised that he got the check, but I casually mentioned it as a ""political reimbursement/bonus check...""  His eyes light up with recognition and he quickly remembers. ""Oh yea!  Thanks!  Make sure this goes into Bonuses, can't really deduct the contributions!...""

-*Fast-forward three months*

I'm now studying to take REG in April, and I pass by the lines stating that political contributions are NOT an allowable deduction... I also see that any WILLFUL act of fraud has no statute of limitation.

I was the one who carried through with that transaction, and now I feel that if that company ever gets audited that this will somehow come back to me.  I don't like this company, and this is one of the many frustrations that I have with them that's convincing me to hightail it somewhere else.  Is there anything I should do or anyone I should call if I suspect they've lied about something on their taxes?  The company is a privately-held partnership that makes about $6M per year, so I figure that $10K is a pretty small amount to worry about, but I also don't want to ignore something that can bite me in the future.

So far I have been rather disappointed. I am given basic tasks to do (obviously this is exactly what I was expecting and not disappointing in any way shape or form) and I do them to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately for me, the best of my abilities is much better than the team expected and I complete most of the data entry and excel work quite quickly as I have spent a considerable amount of my spare time at school learning how to be very efficient (not just hotkeys, but also macros). I can understand why this could be frustrating as the person giving me work as they have to carve out more time to give me work and think about what I can do. After talking to friends who have done the winter internship before they were all a little bit more involved and did tasks that were a lot more time consuming because in the past there was no real limit for overtime for interns while this year they have a fairly strict limit on overtime giving basically none(despite the fact that we were told we would be working 50-60 hours a week but that's beside the point).

In the end my question is what should I do? Should I intentionally take longer to complete my tasks because the senior is clearly a little frustrated that I am finishing them quickly (even though I'm finishing them quickly I still review everything and it is all high quality and in most cases more than what she is expecting)?

What i had in mind was that an experienced professional could essentially buddy up with one (or more) university students to assist them with either their studies, or various other questions they may have from time to time in relation to accounting.

I think the minimum requirement for a mentor should be CPA or equivalent and three years of work experience.

There shouldn't be a minimum requirement for a mentee.

I have a few questions though:

1. Would you be interested in joining this program as either a mentor or mentee (please specify which, along with relevant experience/qualifications)

I wasn't really aggressive trying to get a better rating so I'm not too upset about it, but I realize that none of my reviews from any of my seniors gave me any coaching or negative feedback at all.  I'm not really sure where I should start in trying to improve my rating.  I have thought/heard of some ideas that I want to run by you experienced big four vets out there:

- I could be more proactive in writing my own reviews.  Every time one of my seniors writes a review for me, they ask me to make a list of my accomplishments.  I noticed that this list usually ends up in my review, often with very little changes to the wording.  I could be more careful to keep a 'journal' of specific things that I did well and request that my senior includes them in my review.

- I could try harder to work even longer hours.  Then aggressively try to eat those hours as much as I can justify.  I haven't really ate many hours since I started, but I have worked with some seniors who are not so discrete about their expectations that I do this.  I'm not so exciting about this one because working way more hours might not be worth the extra 3k I might get for a better rating.  I'm also afraid this might turn me into the garbage dump where seniors just dump a bunch of extra crap on me because they know I'll just eat all the extra hours I worked.

-  I could start getting involved in more activities like attending recruiting events, firm sponsored 'volunteer' work, or special lunch meetings.  I've been *told* that these things look good on your review.  I'm thinking most of all it would allow me to get to know more higher ranked people who will likely be sitting on the round tables.

A big part of my job is processing payroll. I work in Arizona where there are very little labor laws, so we have to go by the (what can be) very vague FLSA rules for our salaried employees. I feel like my boss has gotten to the point of trying to find every legally shady way of either forcing people to burn through their ETO (earned time off) or just flat out not paying them. It's really wearing me down as a processor, and it's also wearing down the morale of my coworkers when they have to fight so hard just to get paid.

An example is of today's payroll that I'm processing. We have a salaried employee who is the supervisor for our field technicians. He managed to complete his work, that was scheduled to take five days, in four days because he had a family emergency that had come up. My boss made him use an ETO day for that fifth day even though there was no additional work to complete for the week.

I have another employee who doesn't want me to put down how many hours she actually worked because she's hourly and would have gotten some overtime (which her manager knew about). She doesn't want to piss off the owner so she reduced the amount of hours that she worked on the timesheet she turned in to me.

Being the person involved with the books and the more behind the scenes aspects of the company lets you see a lot about the company that maybe your other coworkers aren't exposed to. How do you keep yourself from getting disheartened at your job if your boss or supervisors are doing questionable things? Do you just suck it up as that's the way it is? Are there any techniques you use to disconnect yourself from the crappy way your coworkers are treated? Or do you just find an employer that treats their employees well?

Sometimes, your brain will acknowledge this fact, but only for a split second, for if any longer, you would realize the extent of your severe sleep deprivation. For me personally, I am sleepy at work all day long, and when I try to sleep, all I can think of is that tax return or that issue I cannot quite figure out. Yes it is quite amazing when you think about it… the hours and the lack of sleep, but yet your mind still finds a way to function and get the job done. You count down the days on your  calendar as though if you are counting down to the days before Christmas, all most with the same, if not more excitement that a child has opening the doors on the Christmas calendar.  Every day you can cross off, is one more day you can say you survived and that you made it. It is constant battle of trying to fit in your life, for 2 and ½ months out of the year with work.

I apologize for the length and content of this post, but I would be very grateful for any and all feedback, positive or negative.  Please be brutally honest.

I graduated with my bachelor's almost a year ago and have had almost no luck finding a job, primarily due to a misdemeanor charge on my record.  I was arrested for this charge in late 2004 and pled guilty in early 2006.  The charge is listed as ""Computer Crimes in the third degree, less than $1000.""  The charge stems from tech support at my university discovering some deleted images on my hard drive while attempting to recover data from it.  These images are of myself and the person I was dating during high school and was originally flagged as child pornography.  Through my lawyer and thanks to the judge and prosecutor, who realized it wasn't nearly as serious a situation as initially presented, I was allowed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge instead, which is the lowest level computer-related statute on the books in my state.  The sentence for this crime was 3 yrs of probation, 250 hours of community service and sex offender counseling. Since the probation was completed in 2009, I have not had any contact with any law enforcement office and am not required to register for any sort of list.

After taking several years off school during this ordeal, I decided to return to school and finish my undergrad degree - which I received last year.  I graduated with an in-major GPA of 3.97, which encompassed about the final 60 hours of my degree.  Overall, however, my GPA dating back to my initial college time after high school is a 3.1.  I have also recently taken the GMAT and received a score of 660, with perfect scores on the writing and reasoning sections as well.

I have a had a few part time, hourly positions since I graduated, and have proceeded to the actual offer stage with a few different companies for full time positions (nothing in public, all in industry or finance) only to be turned down because of this charge specifically.

I have since applied for a pardon from the state, with recommendation letters from the head of career services at my undergrad school, the head of the accounting department at my school and from the counselor who administered my sex offender counseling course.  I will know the results of this application next Spring.  From my understanding, it is a pardon and not an expungement of the record itself.

I have been in contact with my desired graduate program, at a well-respected business school that sees recruiting from all the Big 4 as well as dozens of regional, local and private companies.  They have a near 100% placement rate upon graduation and I have made them aware of this criminal record.  It is not a block from admission, but the director of the program has concerns that it will impede me from finding placement, which I share.  I am planning to begin next Fall, several months after I hopefully hear good news about the pardon application.

I am considering attending a MACC Program because it will help me collect the remaining credits for the CPA exam and will also be the first step toward my ultimate goal of one day teaching at the college level.

Here are my questions:

1.  I am concerned that I will never escape this charge, no matter how hard I try.  If it were to be pardoned (and almost eight years in the past by the time I would hit recruiting season), what sort of chances do I have?  I assume without the pardon, I'm screwed?

2.  I have tried to be as open and honest about this at interviews as possible.  Any thoughts on how I should present it?

3.  Is the simple passage of time working in my favor?  Is there a point at which this charge just doesn't show up any more?  How far back do firms check backgrounds for a misdemeanor level charge?  The most recent industry job I applied and interviewed for listed 7 years for a misdemeanor charge on their paperwork.  Is this standard?

I think academically and socially, I could be a great addition for any of these firms - I just made a mistake when I was much younger that came back to haunt me with a vengeance 8 years ago now.

I graduated in 2011 with my BS in (pure) mathematics from a good school with a good GPA, but have had trouble finding a job. I recognize now that it is mostly because I didn't work as hard at career oriented and professionally oriented work (internships and networking) as I did at doing well in classes. 

I've been looking for something to help me find myself in a career rather than just a job and accounting seems appealing, since I like working with numbers and data. I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for breaking into accounting. My thoughts right now are to start taking classes at a nearby Community College and leverage that into an internship and hopefully into a job. Do you think that would be effective? Alternatively I could consider entering into a second bachelor's but part of the appeal of the CC course would be starting quickly (I suppose I could even attempt to begin at the CC and transfer those credits to whatever university i would attend). 

In short, does anyone have ideas for how I could find my way into accounting?

Basically, unless you are a CPA in Texas, you cannot use the word ""accountant"" on your LinkedIn profile. You are also apparently not allowed to say that you're a ""CPA Candidate"" or that you've ""Passed X Sections of the CPA Exam."" You can list these things on a resume given directly to an employer, but not on any websites. Apparently, you're also not supposed to have your title on a business card that includes the word ""accountant"" because that's construed as ""offering your services to the public.""

Here's also a copy of the email that was sent along with it:

&gt;Attached is a copy of what the State sent me.  I called them this morning to get clarification on a few things.  It is ok for a person to put a job title with the words ""accountant"" or ""auditor"" on a resume if the resume is given directly to an employer.   However, it is NOT ok to post a copy of the resume with those words on any searchable job board.  Including Monster, Career Builder, LinkedIn, etc.  

&gt;So for me I can put that I was a ""Tax Accountant"" at XXX and a ""Senior Accountant"" at my current company because I was working in internal accounting departments but I can't post those titles anywhere else. I am also allowed to put down that I am a ""CPA Candidate"" on a resume but not anywhere else.  Again I can only put it on my resume if it is given directly to the company of a job I am applying for.   You can not post those titles on any public forum including online job boards.  Also I was told that private companies should not be issuing business cards with internal job tittles on them if they have the words ""accountant"" or ""auditor"" on them and they are not a CPA.  Not an issue for me I haven't had business cards since I worked at YYY but I have lots of friends who are not CPA and have business cards with their job title on them.

Personally, I think this is a little ridiculous. I understand where the board is coming from, but I don't think anyone goes looking on LinkedIn for an accountant. And if they do, they probably deserve what they're going to get.

As an aside, I was talking with one of my professors about this and he was furious. He does not have a CPA, but does have a CMA (oh, and a PhD in Accounting), but the way it appears they're enforcing this rule, he would not be allowed to call himself an accountant on LinkedIn since he is not a licensed CPA.

Kind of in a weird place; help me out here. ,20,8,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/13zivp/any_current_accountantscpas_who_used_to_suck_at/,"Please don't flame me. This is an honest question, and I'm actually really conflicted. 

To start: I graduating with accounting this semester, but will have to go back to school for the 150 credits requirement (probably night classes at a community college or CUNY Baruch if I can). Then I plan on taking the CPA exam, which I will hopefully pass. Hopefully I will be licensed in New York, where I reside.

Here's where it gets a bit complicated: I'm not really ""good"" at accounting. I'm not sure I'm gonna get any sympathy from this subreddit but I just SUCK at it. I don't hate it, far from it; I actually really wish I could be great at it but I'm not. I excelled in all my other business/non business classes, but really had a hard time with accounting. For my fellow accounting majors, everything just ""clicked"" for them; for me, I really struggled to understand all the concepts, and only after reviewing for hours over the same problem, did I begin to understand. I'm really envious of people who are able to say that accounting is such an easy field. 

Anyway, all my efforts went into accounting and fortunately I'm going to be able to graduate acceptably. I was kind of in denial about the whole thing, thinking that real life practical experience will differ from my slaving over my textbooks everyday. But as my graduation date gets closer, I'm starting to worry. I've worked for a small local firm, and the boss was really patient with me, because embarrassingly enough, it took me twice as long compared to my co-workers to really get it. But eventually I do, it's just harder for me. 

Now I'm just at the point where I'm convincing myself that I will be able to move further--to complete the extra courses successfully and even pass the CPA exam, even though people who know me think it's an unreasonable goal. Like if I'm struggling so much with basic accounting now, what makes me think that I can be a successful CPA? I feel like effort can only go so far when you clearly have some sort of major-specific learning disability, I don't know. So there's that.

So my question is, has anyone else been in my situation, but are doing fine now with as an accountant or even a CPA? Somehow overcome being terrible at it? And speaking of CPA, I know for a fact that I won't regret it if I have a license; it's just the part of getting there. I don't think I can emphasize this enough: I'm terrible at everything accounting and tax related, but I don't hate it and I really want to have a good future as a CPA. Is that motivation enough? Is there a time where being a CPA is just plain wrong and not worth it? Am I just delusional?

I know this all may sound ridiculous, but please don't think I'm trolling. I feel like I'm in the same boat as someone who can't cook wanting to work for Gordon Ramsey--really struggling to make passable work, but slightly delusional and aiming for the stars.

I need some serious life advice.",23,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/x3e45/accountants_do_you_hate_youre_lives_i_need_some/,"Hi Accountants and those following this subreddit. I'm in need of some very serious life advice. I'll try to keep it short.

I've been in my accounting program for a few months and runs for a total a bit over 2 years, part co-op and part school,  Though I was ready to considering accounting as my profession, my mom pushed me into this program earlier than I had wanted. I wanted to take another year off to sort out my life and to experience my life and youth before jumping into the the workforce (to be fair I only fully acknowledged that about 6 months before the program started). I feel as though my youth and life are just down the drain.

I'm doing well in the program but it takes up almost all my time. I have class all day and I have at least 2-3 tests/assignments due every single week as well as at least 1 recruiting event every week. 

I really feel miserable. I feel like I'm doing this and I'm not even sure I want to be in the program. I know that even if I don't want to be an accountant, I know that getting your CA opens a lot of doors. Nonetheless, I feel like I'm wasting my youth and my life. I feel as though I'm not going to have any free time for the next 5 years of my life (school, UFE, Co-op, etc.) and probably for the rest of my life.

I'm not an underachiever, I like to do well. I don't totally hate accounting, I find it kind of fun, kind of like a puzzle, but I don't know if it's right for my profession. And the truth is, if you guys think that all this work now is going to make life easier for me later on then I'm on board to do it. But I need to know. Does everyone feel like this? Or do most of you at least want to be accountants? I don't even care about being excessively rich in my life, as long as I make a good living and I'm comfortable, I'd rather enjoy what I do and lead a happy life. Will all this be worth it in the end? Is the work I put in at this age going to lead to a happier adult life (more free time as an adult because of financial security, etc.) or is it going to be this life-consuming for the next 30 years?


_______________________________________________________________________________
TL:DR -  I'm in an accounting program and I'm doing well but I don't know if its for me. I don't want a job that consumes my entire life (like this program does right now and I assume will for the next 5 years). Is working hard now worth the long term happiness or is my accounting career going to take up most of my time for the next 20 years of my life? Am I wasting my youth on something I don't want to do?

When they order dinner (since I'm pretty sure I'll be staying past 6 most nights, if my office visit was any indication), do you usually get to pick what you order (like could I submit a special order for brown rice and steamed veg? could I get something delivered from a healthy restaurant instead of whatever place they pick?) or do they just bring in catering trays of pad thai and pasta and burgers?

I've seen this question posed often in other subreddits like /r/personalfinance, /r/frugal and other areas of Reddit, but I'm curious to how the accounting community takes care of their own personal finances on a day to day basis. I don't mean preparing statements for your own company or estate - I mean day to day budgeting and spending.

Most of Reddit seems to use Mint, nothing at all, a little budgeting ""system"" like the envelope system, or Excel. 

What about /r/accounting? Do you use accounting software? If you use Excel, how elaborate is the worksheet? Is it just Mint, or your own system?

How in depth do you bother to track your finances?

I am an accounting graduate from one of the top programs in Canada, and have my 51 credit hours complete. My resume includes co ops at Deloitte, McKinsey and Company, and a small firm doing personal tax as well as two other large companies. 

**I want my CPA - CA.** 

I also want to be part of the Audit/Assurance group, as I am really interested in it and the few audits I was a part of I enjoyed (and shockingly I enjoy accounting/tax). However, I just got rejected from a firm after the second round interview as another candidate whose ""skill set and background"" more closely aligned with what they wanted. 

This was the first interview (or set of interviews) I have had since last fall in recruiting season, and I have applied everywhere. Now that I am graduated from University since April and approaching fall again, its going to be double the difficulty as a new crop of grads look for positions. I have no problem moving to any city, town in Canada for a job and will pack up at a moments notice. At the same time, I have applied to multiple places over the summer without hearing a whisper back besides this one interview. 

So basically, I am in the dumps right now and am starting to wonder if my goal of getting those letters behind my name is going to even be possible. Any advice, help finding job postings or even if anyone wants to look at my resume would be awesome. Right now after this rejection I'm pretty down, so any helpful tips would be great. 

The thing is, I know I can offer a lot to a firm and really would be excited to help a firm grow. Obviously everyone feels the same way, but I have many unique experiences from co founding a tech startup to extensive construction industry experience (parents own a construction company) that has given me a solid background in speaking to potential clients for firms. It just seems that no HR Manager or interviewer feels the same way.

1.) Graduate and go straight for a Masters Degree and then sit for the CPA exam then job. 

2.) Graduate, get a job for a few years then sit for the CPA exam

3.) Graduate, get a job, then get a Masters Degree, then sit for the CPA

Edit 1: I'm getting my undergrad at Ohio State, and I can afford to get a masters degree.

I'm a recent graduate from a respectable business university in the suburbs of Virginia. I have +3 years of accounting experience, in A/P, A/R aside from my other professional career jobs plus my recent four year degree. I've been sending out around 10 or so application per day, and have had zero luck with an accounting job. I’ve gone as low as using Craigslist job section and it's been rather disappointing. I have decent networking that I’ve used as referral for jobs to no end. 

I keep lowering my expectations, and applying to more and more entry level positions such as basic A/P specialist etc with extremely lousy salary, and yet it's been the same. I’m finding extreme salary bidding, and the overflow of applicants to be the cause of the decrease of salary and job vacancy.  It Seems like a simple A/P position gets around 100 applications if not more. Mind you, these are positions that pay around $15-$17/hr. If you work at an Apple store, selling apple items, you get more ($20/hr)… joke

I'm starting to question if an ""Accounting"" degree was another gold rush that has been over filled.

We need to make a major revision. 

The FAQ will be primarily what the name implies: Frequently Asked Questions. The goals are to ensure that commonly asked questions submitted to /r/Accounting can be answered nearly immediately with a link to a consistent and high quality answer, and we can begin directing people to the FAQ before they submit their question.

The latter goal will be the most important part. The FAQ will be featured more prominently in the sidebar and on the submission page. However, in order for this to be effective the FAQ will need to be easy to read, comprehensive yet as compact as it can reasonably be.

**Let me go over those points again before I direct you to how to begin editing:**

* Easy to read and navigate.
* Answers should be as comprehensive as possible yet,
* Compact - unnecessary fluff, side-tracking anecdotes, repetition within answers, and overly extensive answers that could be made more compact by providing additional reading are not needed
* Accurate, and use citations where possible when editing. Providing further reading is a great idea! 

Keep in mind that a large majority of readers are students, and some questions may be commonly asked by those with little to no accounting knowledge at all. 

For now this is going to be organized on the side via a Google Doc. **This document is editable by anybody, however nightly backups will be made on my end and Google Docs contains a revisions function.** **Be careful - changes you make are saved instantly and are live instantly.**

**This is a collaborative project in progress.** If you come up with a good question to add, write it. If you have a good answer, write it. You don't need to ask permission to write. **But if you want to delete or revise another persons answer, get feedback first using comments.** You may write your version below theirs and highlight it as a ""possible better alternative answer"" in another colour. There is also a commenting function so that you can highlight and add a comment to sections you want to provide/get feedback on. 

I would suggest you make a copy of your own answers locally. Someone may decide to replace your answer without your input and you might not notice until the final revision is being looked over. There will be a final proofread, without editing functionality before it is finalized so you we will have a chance to ensure the best answers were put forward if yours weren't. 

This is a link to the document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rcmn-RITqlBmGp7c6tMnTOwfqZ9kUtv2ZBsquxUDfbg/edit

Let me emphasize this: **Do not delete anything without a discussion within comments on why you want to make a change and at least someone/preferably the author agreeing with you.**

*If you think you are going to be heavily involved with this, or you have a level of expertise that lends itself to this project please [send ME a message with your email address](http://www.reddit.com/user/CrasyMike), so that I can add you as an Editor. This project is publicly editable for the time being, but if that changes I don't want to lock you out*

Any comments, questions or issues should be either directed to this thread or modmail.

2. You are paid a lot of money to keep your client happy.

3. You are paid well but your pimp gets most of the money.

4. You spend a majority of your time in a hotel room.

5. You charge by the hour but your time can be extended.

6. You are not proud of what you do.

7. Creating fantasies for your clients is rewarded.

8. It's difficult to have a family.

9. You have no job satisfaction.

10. If a client beats you up, the pimp just sends you to another client.

11. You are embarrassed to tell people what you do for a living.

12. People ask you, ""What do you do?"" and you can't explain it.

13. Your client pays for your hotel room plus your hourly rate.

14. Your client always wants to know how much you charge and what they get for the money.

15. Your pimp drives nice cars like Mercedes or Jaguars.

16. Your pimp encourages drinking and you become addicted to drugs to ease the pain of it all.

17. You know the pimp is charging more than you are worth but if the client is foolish enough to pay it's not your problem.

18. When you leave to go see a client, you look great, but return looking like hell (compare your appearance on Monday AM to Friday PM).

19. You are rated on your ""performance"" in an excruciating ordeal.

20. Even though you get paid the big bucks, it's the client who walks away smiling.

21. The client always thinks your ""cut"" of your billing rate is higher than it actually is, and in turn, expects miracles from you.

22. When you deduct your ""take"" from your billing rate, you constantly wonder if you could get a better deal with another pimp.

23. Your pimp seems to often abuse you, forgetting that without you, he would not have a business.

24. You do all the real work, but the pimp has a higher stigma and more money, and really just has to ""coordinate"" the work for you. Sometimes, you wonder if you could just make more money pimping out yourself.

25. You get so brainwashed into the lifestyle, that you don't realize that life can be better, until it is too late.

26. Personal time, or a work/life balance, is meaningless to your pimp, all he cares about is satisfying the clients, despite how many times he tells you he loves you.

27. After a few years, you find that all your non-prostitute friends are no longer your friends, because you lost touch and your schedule and lifestyle was difficult to manage, and you find that you associate primarily with other prostitutes.

28. The turnover rate is ridiculously high. Everyone thinks they can do it for a few years, no problem, but after just a few clients railing you, many break under the pressure, or quit for a better life.

29. Most of the time, your job could be performed by a well-trained monkey.

The problem is, they want Quicken &amp; Quickbooks versions to be installed all the way back to 1999 to make sure they have the ability to open clients data files that have yet to move to more modern versions. 

I purchased 7 computers for them (5 i7/16GB/Win7 Pro desktops + 2 laptops for the accountants when they travel). So I am supposed to install ALL these versions of Quicken &amp; Quickbooks, as well as ProSeries. I expected most of the older versions aren't compatible with Windows 7, so I am using XP mode for a lot of them, but with Quicken, every new version wants to uninstall the previous one.

EDIT: So any accountants in here using Win7? If so, how many versions back are you going and have you ran into any issues?

I've always been strong at math, but I got through high school and college by half-assing everything.

They were subjects I was quite passionate about, but unfortunately I lacked the foresight to realize that they weren't as career-ready as certain other majors, and as such, I find myself going back to school for retraining.  

I initially signed up for a Funeral Services Education class, imagining said trade to be both interesting and recession proof- however, whilst taking a required Accounting course, I found much to my surprise that I had an aptitude for the subject.  Further, the students and teacher all seem quite interesting, and have regaled me with stories that have piqued my interest in the field.  

Were I to pursue this course, I'd likely be 30 by the time I finished my AA, and I am assuming 32 by the time I had a meaningful enough degree to do well in the field.  This would put me up against untold legions of younger, fresher graduates, and people my own age with far more experience.

I met with one of my college professors a few weeks ago, and he mentioned that it would be hard to teach at an accredited university without a masters degree (either in accounting or another business discipline).

Lastly, I read endless posts on here and other boards that big 4 is hell on earth, with hours comparable to a sweatshop, and that I should turn around and never look back.

I graduated with an accounting degree last May, and after failed attempts to land a job with one of the small accounting practices in my rural area, I decided to study for the CPA exam so as to make myself more employable and to take advantage of my down-time.

I sat for the REG portion of the exam in January and recently found out I scored a 57.  I had taken the self-study Becker Review Course but caught the flu over the holidays which inhibited my study time.  Also before I became ill I found myself wanting to put off studying or take breaks throughout (when I'm overwhelmed I tend to put things off which then makes me feel worse and the cycle continues).  I know if I apply myself that I can pass but receiving such a low score has me worried.  Do I have a decent chance of obtaining a passing score from a 57 if I become more dedicated?  Also, do you have any study tips or suggestions on how to go about studying?  The Becker course is great but I've just become burnt out with school and my study habits have suffered.

I also find myself nervous in general about the accounting professional.  I graduated with a pretty good GPA (3.88) but I just feel like I don't know nearly what I should.  My biggest fear is arriving at a job and being expected to know something of which I have no idea.  My professors were nice people but had a hard time breaking the material down to a level that was easy to comprehend.  I am also at fault for not being as attentative or for studying material so that I actually know it instead of simply memorizing it for a test.  Did anyone else feel overwhelmed upon graduation or is it just me?

Sorry for the long post, I've just been really stressed/concerned and was hoping the good people of r/accounting would have some helpful advice.

EDIT:  Thanks for the advice everyone.  I really wasn't trying to make excuses for myself, I know I didnt work hard enough, I was just sharing my anxieties.

My boss is the CFO, and I was hired on to do a cost analysis of the bank's products (different deposit and loan products). After 8 months, I've finally finished that project, and I'm moving on to smaller things while things wind down.

My boss assigned me the task of going over the investment committee's policies to ensure that they comply with OCC regulations. He advised me to use the OCC examiner handbook and to comb through our policies and their relative handbooks. This is proving to be a much more daunting task than I thought it'd be.

The handbooks are all around 80 pages long and our policies are probably 10-15 pages long each. I've highlighted important information in the various PDFs and taken some hand written notes, but when it comes time to compare policies to regulations I feel like I am getting nowhere.

I know nothing about investment securities and the various terminology that goes along with it. My boss is a very busy man, and I have been told many times in the past that he is very happy with me because I do not require much coaching or handholding due to my ability to get the job done using outside resources (mainly AccountingCoach.com lol).

1376623331.0,10,self.Accounting,1kgrpo,Doing an MAcc in the fall as a full-time student and working full-time. Any advice?,11,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1kgrpo/doing_an_macc_in_the_fall_as_a_fulltime_student/,"Currently, I work in accounts receivable at a medium-sized company. This is my first job fresh out of college, and while it's laid-back and easy-going, I know that it's going to be tough to get out of A/R and into actual accounting without some background in public accounting and a CPA license. 

So, I am going back to my alma mater to complete an MAcc. Ideally, this fall, I want to achieve a couple of things:

1. Get enough credit hours for the CPA exam.
2. Get an offer in audit from any Big Four or regional CPA firm. 

However, because I work from 8AM to 5PM every Monday through Friday, I am mostly relegated to taking classes at night (I am so thankful that my school is great in this respect, since they offer night slots for every required class). I have only a few vacation days to play with, and I need to budget them very wisely for on-campus interviews I may have to schedule in the mornings, and for the career fair that my school is probably going to host in September. 

I will admit, I wasn't very focused when it came to Big Four recruiting as an undergraduate. I was nervous when it came to interviews (and it really shows), and I never really stood out from crowd. Furthermore, my social skills back then were weaker. 

However, after graduating from college, I realized that I needed a job, so I made the effort to improve my interviewing skills, my social skills, and my resume, and it paid off in the end: I got two offers (one from an e-commerce company, the other, from a local government agency), and I ended up accepting an A/R role with the e-commerce company. 

I do have a couple of weaknesses:

**My professional network is weak.** I've made many mistakes in past when I was doing recruiting - I was very haphazard in my efforts and as a result, I only know two guys (a partner at E&amp;Y and a manager at PwC). They both have been very helpful, and have reacted positively to my plans for going back to school. 

**Also, I lack time.** My fear is that I don't have enough time to network or reach out to people as well as some of my classmates who don't work full-time like I do. 

I suppose I can talk about the challenges of working full-time and being in school full-time as a way to differentiate myself from the crowd, perhaps. 

I am better equipped to get a job from a firm than I was two years ago, but I am feeling the heat. Is there any advice /r/accounting can offer me for this upcoming recruiting season, especially when it comes to time management, keeping in touch with people, and telling people that I work full-time?",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,1376623990.0,,Graduate Student,True,t3_1kgrpo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1kgrpo/doing_an_macc_in_the_fall_as_a_fulltime_student/,

I was wondering if anyone would have some insight on the audit industry groups, and what the outlook for them?

I have been fortunate to already try different industry groups through rotational co-op terms. I have tried Financial Services, public companies and private non-financial services company as well.

To be honest, they all seem to be relatively the same (besides location of the client) as a junior / intermediate staff, and I am pretty indifferent to which industry group I end up with full-time.

At the moment, I am interested in staying in public accounting until I at least hit manager, but I am also interested in seeing what industry jobs are available. I am fully aware that most exit opportunities will be financial reporting roles. Would not being in the ""Financial Services"" assurance group limit me from being able to land a financial reporting job at a national bank?

What are some other thoughts that you would like to share about the impact of industry groups in audit?

EDIT: I forgot to also ask, would it be more/less difficult to transfer to another service line (such as transaction, tax, etc.) by being in a specific audit industry group?

I've no idea if this is in or out of your subreddit's guidelines, but I'd appreciate your input or perhaps a suggestion on where to take the question if this isn't the place for it.

------------------------
My question regards how one might be required to report capital gain on Bitcoins. If, for example, I purchased $10,000 in Bitcoins in January of this year - I would be able to sell those bitcoins for $75,000 today.

* If I sold those bitcoin for USD - would that be a 'capital gain'?
* If, instead of bitcoin, I had purchased $10,000 in Japanese Yen in January my investment would now be worth nearly $11,000 - would that likewise be a capital gain if I sold it for USD?
* If I used my Bitcoin (or Yen) to buy something - say a car - would I be realizing capital gains or just swapping one asset for another of the same value?

As I said, I'm aware it's possible this isn't the right place for this question. I'm not looking to do my own taxes at this point - so no worries that you'd be providing accounting advice leading to action. I indemnify anyone who answers of any legal responsibility toward any action I might take and certify that I will not act on any information provided without first retaining the services of a verifiably certified accountant.

I'm just looking for a bit of a framework on how to think about these things.

Disclaimer: Yes, this is the topic of a paper from my Advanced Accounting class. 

Being a tax person primarily, I don't pay much attention to the IFRS/GAAP debate, but I thought I'd solicit some ideas from /r/accounting to help me get some direction.

At the moment, I'm inclined to argue that the US should NOT adopt IFRS purely as a practical matter. From my understanding, IFRS is much more principles-based while GAAP is more rules-based. In the US, we like our standards to provide a bright line test for how a transaction should be treated. For example, I remember leases from Intermediate II being a pretty good case (which may have been resolved by now). GAAP provides a very strict test for whether to expense or capitalize (I don't remember exactly but it's like 80% of the FMV of the assets or 75% of the useful life). IFRS, if I recall correctly, said something like, ""If the lease terms show that you substantially control the asset, then capitalize, otherwise expense it."" As a country, the US doesn't deal with ambiguity like this very well.

I'm a sophomore at a university in Canada. I have been pretty stressed lately with all this talk about accounting firms recruiting on campus. Two weeks ago, there was a recruiting session where the big 4, BDO and GT came by. 

I have heard mixed opinions about students having business cards but I was wondering if it was actually advantageous. At the session, I was asked for business cards by the firms. I felt very embarrassed when I said that I did not have one.

So the question I'm asking is, are business cards essential when it comes to getting a job at a good firm? If so, do I go for the generic card or do I try to make it all flashy to stand out? I heard in the previous posts that having your face on the business card does help, but I am unsure what employers actually want.

I know I'm not the only one.

Some background: I have a Master's degree (MAcc) from a state school with a high GPA (3.5+). My recruiting experience was poor and my networking was weak - which led to unemployment. I decided to take some time off to travel the world (personal development) and study for the CPA (passed all sections last December). I've had two accounting related contract jobs since then to strengthen my experience but I'm ready to start a public accounting career, preferably in auditing.

- After basically being away for a year, how would I get back into the whole recruiting/networking world? Would I have to go through the campus hire process again? Is it too desperate to go through all the other channels (i.e. LinkedIn, cold e-mailing, etc.)?

- I'm also thinking about going private and I have no idea how to even enter that realm. Is it harder to network with private industries and in what ways can I do that (or again, go through LinkedIn, cold e-mailing, etc.)?

- When networking and going to events, what do you talk to/ask recruiters and employees about? I'm thinking they have to be tired of the same questions over and over (what's the culture like, how can I stand out, etc.), but then again, random questions about anything don't seem to be effective (especially when people tend to group up around firm reps). Perhaps I'm wrong and HR people are just totally different.

- I'm open to moving elsewhere. How would I network concerning out-of-state firms or offices? How do I bring this up to recruiters here?

When an asset increases you debit that account
When a liability increases you credit that account
When owner equity increases, you credit that account? (is this because it's on the liabilities side of the balance sheet?)

Then you move to the income statement... when expenses increase, you debit the account? Can't quite remember!

I graduated with BA in Economics and then decided to pursue a MSA. My original goal was to start in auditing, but after a few unsuccessful Big 4 and middle-market interviews, the recruiting season ended and I needed to find work. In June 2011 I took a job here in Chicago in the private sector where I've gotten very relevant experience in the AP function, procurement process, budgeting/projecting, variance analysis, segment reporting, and exposure to accounting systems. As far as the CPA goes, I passed REG at the end of February, I'm taking FAR this upcoming week and hope to finish AUD and BEC in the next testing window.

Recently I decided at the ripe age of 24, I'd still like to give auditing a shot before I fall too far behind the pack. My questions are:

1. Will I have to go through the same campus recruiting process (and time frame) given I'll be applying for an associate position or are they able to make exceptions for those in my situation?

2. Am I actually any more likely to get an offer now than I was a year ago?

I have taken a few college level courses on accounting and understand most of the basic concepts, and so I think I can do much of the bookkeeping on my own hopefully.  But still feel unsure about some simple questions.

The business is located in the US.


1. Should I use cash or accrual accounting?

2. Should I use periodic or perpetual inventory systems?

3. Do I have to record each transaction individually or can I just record daily sales totals?

4. How would I record the journal entry for initial investment and increase in inventory, and the initial sales?

5. Would the inventory be valued at what I have the SALE price set as or what it cost me originally? What if it costs me nothing, how can i account for that?

So, I got into accounting because I was interesting in working on people's taxes. I graduated college a couple years ago with a degree in accounting and several upper level credits in taxation, and I did the VITA program in college and LOVED it. However, I've run into the typical catch-22 of not being able to find a position doing taxes because I don't have the requisite experience, yet I can't find a position to give me the experience in the first place. I did intern with a local CPA firm after college, but it was a short internship with no potential to hire and I felt like it didn't give me great experience in taxation. In the interim, I've been doing temp work in bookkeeping, but have not even touched taxes.

Now, the only ways I can see myself getting the experience is to 1. Somehow get a job with a CPA firm in their tax department, or 2. Get a job with a big name tax prep company like H&amp;R Block or Liberty Tax to get the experience, then move on from there.

My goal is to eventually get my EA or CPA designation, but I would like to get practical experience first.

Any suggestions on a course of action r/accounting? I am willing to work my ass off to do what I love - I just need some direction on how to work my ass off.

The partners of both firms have agreed to the combination. Pending final approvals, the merger will take effect Jan. 2, 2012. The new firm will be named CliftonLarsonAllen (CLA).



The merged company will maintain both of its headquarters in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.



The new firm will have more than $550 million in combined revenue, employ more than 3,600 professionals, including 500-plus partners, and will operate from 25 states and Washington, D.C.
CLA will have a dominant presence in the accounting profession with its highly specialized capabilities in the health care, financial institutions, governmentals, not-for-profits, manufacturing/distribution, construction, real estate, agribusiness, dealerships, employee benefit plans and other industries, in addition to its strong technical foundation in audit, accounting and advisory services.



“This merger of peer firms changes the landscape of the accounting profession and pioneers a new trend by focusing primarily on private companies and their owners,” said Clifton Gunderson chief executive officer Kris McMasters. “We will be the firm of choice, the champions and leading resource center for privately held companies, proactively addressing their needs with our comprehensive suite of services. The firm will be positioned as the go-to source of information, knowledge and unique offerings for owners and leaders looking for assistance in achieving their personal and business dreams and objectives.”



Gordy Viere, CEO of LarsonAllen, said industry specialization has been at the core of both firms’ practices. “Coming together heightens our capacity to develop that vital focus and extend it beyond our accounting and advisory services to our wealth management and outsourcing capabilities,” he said. “This cohesive trio of industry-focused guidance is uncommon for private businesses and public sector organizations. It’s a powerful new resource for them.”



Organizationally, the new firm will be built around a holding company and three entities: CLA LLP, CLA Wealth Advisory and CLA Outsourcing — all integrated in their capabilities and delivery of services. McMasters and Viere will continue as CEOs within the integrated CLA firm. Viere will oversee the CLA holding company, the wealth advisory practice and the outsourcing practice, and McMasters will oversee CLA LLP, the public accounting practice.



CLA will have a national wealth management practice positioned as one of the top three in the accounting profession, with nearly $3 billion in assets under management. The combined firm will boast a $50 million industry-specialized outsourcing practice to help clients meet their financial, tax regulatory compliance and reporting responsibilities. In addition, CLA will have the capacity to help clients with international dealings successfully do business in a global environment.""

But, I've always been a great employee and a hard worker, and I absolutely love accounting.  

I've got a 3.4 overall GPA, and since I've come back to school for accounting/business my major GPA is a 4.0.  I hold an officer position with BAP.  I tutor Financial and Managerial Accounting for my university, as well as Micro and Macroeconomics.  I got a 650 on my GMAT.  I'll be starting graduate school in the spring.  

I failed miserably at this recruiting season.  

I failed to get an interview with GT.  They were my top choice.  I had two interns with their ambassador program invite me to an invitation-only social.  When they were discussing who to choose for interviews, I had two new-hires advocate for me.  Still rejected.  

I had a campus interview with McGladrey, and despite a professor  telling them that I'd be great, I didn't get an office interview.  I also didn't hear back from PwC or a regional firm after campus interviews.  

I've made a lot of sacrifices by quitting my job and coming back to school.  I'm already a work-a-holic and I know where ever I end up I'll be valuable.  I sort of thought accounting was a great field for smart, hard-working people, and I'm in a super big rut after all this rejection.  

The only thing I can think to do now is run for President of BAP next semester (I have a pretty good shot of winning).  But, being an officer didn't seem to help me, so I don't know if I'll just be spinning my wheels and working myself to death for nothing (I plan on taking 4 grad classes, and hopefully still tutoring--either as a GA or with the academic resource center where I work now).  

I guess I'm just looking for a little advice or encouragement.  I never thought wanting a career in public accounting would start to feel like a pipe dream...

TL;DR I'm a great student.  Professors, interns and new-hires have advocated for me, but the firms seem to hate me.  I'm pretty depressed after all this rejection and I'm starting to feel like my hard work means nothing.  I could most likely be President of BAP next semester, but I'm not even sure if it will be worth it...

I'm a graduating senior in college with 150 hours, and I have offers from a Big 4 and GT--I've absolutely loved getting to know the GT people through the recruiting process, plus I eventually want to go into nonprofit accounting once I go private (not planning to stay much past senior associate at this point).  So these factors make me lean heavily towards GT.

My only reservation is about future job prospects once my auditing days are done.  Specifically, I have one friend at the Big 4 (who might be biased because she is trying to get me to accept her firm's offer) who says that GT people can sometimes have a hard time finding a job in the private sector because people want Big 4 on the resume.  But wouldn't a GT client not care, and be interested in hiring you if you impress them?  I'd like to hear one way or another--if you or someone you know had trouble jumping from GT to a position in industry, or if you or someone you know had no problem/had to swat away the headhunters once you made senior.

What I don't want to hear is ""oh you should go to Big 4 because pay is better/cooler clients/better people/whatever,"" or ""the people in my office of GT suck.""

With my private internship I worked as an auditor of cost reports and this was terribly boring as well.

I will be graduating in December with my degree and will be like 5 classes short of being able to sit for the CPA.

This is my first accounting job, and I definitely do not work too slowly. I take my time to look over last year's files and see how things were done, and create the new ones accordingly. I ask questions to the seniors as well, and try my best to get it right before I give it to the partner. Him telling me to spend less time on it AND mentioning that I haven't been very productive just encourages me to do a half-assed quick job to just hand in. But that brings problems too, it takes more of his time when it comes to review.

I worked in retail and food service for the past 8 years of my life. You come to work, clock in, clock out for lunch, and clock out to go home. There's no intermediary bullshit of having to manipulate your hours so the client's bill isn't too high. How do you guys deal with partner's upset by this? I'm growing increasingly frustrated having to bullshit my hours and basically take 1/3rd of it and allocate it to ""training"" since I have to spend time LEARNING what it is I am doing.

I refuse to eat more hours than necessary. A few months ago I was talked to about my hours since I was eating lunch quickly at my desk for 10 minutes and continuing to work, so I billed for the full day (8:30 am - 5:30 pm) or 9 hours. I was given a talk and he mentioned how the labor department could give us problems if I don't take my mandatory 45 minute off-the-clock lunch break.

Meanwhile the culture of my office is that nobody really goes out and disappears for that amount of time. My coworkers encourage me to ""go on facebook"" and mess around for the break, but it just looks unprofessional like I am not working. I can't win either way.

I'm beginning to really resent this profession already.


Edit: I also wanted to express that as an inexperienced professional, my billable hourly rate is fairly low ($55/hr). Therefore, it doesn't make much sense to me that the partner can't simply adjust any excess if I spend however much time on a project. I'm getting paid less for a reason.",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,1372371040.0,,Graduate Student,True,t3_1h7hu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1h7hu5/billable_hours_and_the_headache_with_budgeting/,

I have two years left in the accounting program for my bachelor's. After that I think I will probably want to sit for the CPA exam. Anyone on here know how much you make starting out with just a bachelor's, and then later on as a CPA? (I'm looking for real experience numbers, although I will be looking for them on other websites). 

Any tips for CPA exam would be helpful as well, or at least thoughts on it (I know passing rate is about 50%).
Also, I currently work at a bakery (I was going to learn baking, etc but an opportunity came up to go back to school, so I'm just doing the bakery clerk thing for right now, but making decent money for a retail position in a small business). I am thinking about trying to find a different part time job or internship while I'm going back to school. I need some ideas as to what I might be qualified for and what positions might help me get my foot in the door. I was even thinking as far as going to certain places that are hiring full time accounting assistants (which I'm not qualified for because I don't have an associate's degree in accounting and no real world experience) and asking for an internship. Anyone tried that bold move?


I was also wondering how I can get experience in Quickbooks or other things to help build my resume...do classes in these specific softwares help? (I have experience in Excel and other Microsoft Office programs, looking to broaden my competency in accounting software).

Is there another subreddit I can post this to?

I am also creating my profile in Linkedin, and currently have no one to link to, where do I begin??
I know this is kind of all over the place, but I don't even know where to begin...it's a lot of brainstorming right now.

Anyhoo, this was the journal entry I used as a basis for my paper

Income tax expense                                   XXX
                   Deferred tax assets                              XXX

Keep in mind, this entry was the basis for all of my analysis, and if wrong, would completely ruin the whole paper! (plus make me look like an idot in my professor's eyes)

Tonight, I woke up frantic, in cold sweats after having a nightmare about making an incorrent journal entry (the logic in my dream told me I should've debited tax asset and credited income tax expense) It's 3 am, and I have work in the morning, so needless to say, it normally would take a catastrophic event to get me out of bed, but it bothered me so bad that I had to go check my paper immediately. 

I ran over to my computer, 90% sleep walking, and nearly passed out when seeing I indeed made the entry my dream had falsely accused of being wrong. By this time, I had woke up a bit and the nogin decided it would finally boot up, realizing that this nightmare was playing tricks on me because I had the journal entry correct all along! 

I can't believe such a stupid dream about accounting rules had me jarred so badly considering how layed back I am. That's why I am sharing it with reddit. Just to calm my nerves some. Honestly, it's the worst nightmare I've ever encountered, thought I was going fail the class and have to retake it. Has any out there ever had an accounting nightmare? For my own benefit, I hope some poor sap has shared a similar experience.

But I've got so much daily crap to deal with,  I never seem to get a chance to get ahead,   im always just picking up the peices,  because a lot of the info i get is shit,  and i spend time fixing that,

I'm considering Chicago as a FT destination, and currently I'm in Tampa (though would consider anywhere in FL). Would hours (busy season and regular) be a lot more in the bigger office? 

I've heard both ways, that in big offices there will be more quarterly filings, basically making year round busy season hours. But then I've also heard small offices tend to be more understaffed, and you have more of a variety of clients leading to longer, more sporadic hours, sometimes with June YEs. 

Any experience in this?",,False,self,t5_2qw2b,False,,student,True,t3_19emx4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/19emx4/big_4_audit_big_office_vs_small_office/,
