It's still not over.,68,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1bzukh/never_give_up_my_12_month_transformation_its/,"Okay, back story: I graduated high school in 2005 weighing 155lbs. Well, when I finished college in 2010, I was at about 185lbs. It only took another 2 years for me to blow up to 205lbs. It happened so fast that I got horrendous stretch marks that I now have to live with. I was also on high blood pressure pills. I hated the way I looked and the way I felt. So I gave P90X a try. I only lasted two weeks. I made excuses for not working out. Well, a few months passed, and I decided to give it another shot. I finished the first round, felt great, but I still didn't look great. I decided to do a second consecutive round of P90X. It was a lot easier this time, and I lost even more weight. Well, I got done with that, but felt I still had to lose more body fat. I had heard about Insanity, but was afraid to try it. I decided to give it a go. Holy crap, even with two rounds of P90X under my belt, it totally kicked my ass! Well, I finished all three workouts, and then fell off the wagon for about 6 weeks. I realized I couldn't just waste all the hard work I had done, and decided to start Insanity again! I am now on week three round two of Insanity! I plan on doing another round once this one is done! I went from a size 38 to a 34, and I'm about to be in a 32, and large shirt's to mediums.

Welcome to the **Beginner’s Guide and Starter Tips** for Insanity! This guide is meant to help individuals who have purchased Insanity and have yet to begin the first day of hitting play and going the extra mile (or two). This guide is also a consensus of what you can expect your first week in the program.

First off, please note that the opinions expressed on this guide and on this subreddit in general are from individuals who have done or are currently in the middle of the Insanity workout program and are not necessarily that of trained professionals. If you are seeking a more detailed and credible explanation of what you can expect to experience with this or any other workout program, consult a certified physical trainer or doctor/physician. You can also sign-up to the [beachbody.com](http://www.beachbody.com/) site and consult the staff there for more details.

Secondly, if you’ve already purchased Insanity and are about to start, congrats for taking the first step towards a healthier you! You will find that the workouts are, as the name implies, insane and will test your limits physically and mentally. However, as you progress through the weeks, you will find that your limits will increase and you will be able to push yourself further and further (and look better in the process).

For those of you who are still not sure about starting the program or if you need some motivation to start day #1, do the following:

1)	Take a deep breath and relax. This is not an easy workout or an easy decision to make.

2)	Consult your doctor/physician before starting this workout program. Most of the workouts require fast-paced movements and physical agility to complete (i.e. jumping, squatting, sprinting, etc.), and your doctor/physician will be able to best gauge whether you should enter into this program.

3)	Talk or consult with some other people and Redditors who are in the middle of the program. We’ll be more than happy to answer any questions you may have (to the best of our ability, of course).

Before getting into the first day, here are a few suggested starter tips shared on this subreddit (some by Shaun T himself):

* **Find a safe surface to perform the workouts on.** I do the workouts in my carpeted living room, which, for the most part, helps a little when landing each of my jumps. Your situation may vary (hardwood floors, gymnasium, etc.), but always make sure it is a solid surface that does not move from your impacts to help prevent injury.

* **Form over speed!** You will be tempted to “break form” to get those last few reps in or to make the exercise easier, but the form of each exercise is safely designed to keep you from injuring yourself while maximizing effectiveness. If you find yourself losing form, take a quick break and get back into the workout.

* **Make sure to land softly on jumps, hops, and leaps** (recommended by **ShortWoman**). You will be performing a lot of jumps and various hops, especially in the warm-ups. It is important to not only maintain form, but to land softly to keep the floor impact minimal on your knees and legs. This may also minimize noise if you are doing this above the first floor in a multi-story apartment complex. 

* **Rest when you need to!** You will find all of the people working out in the background are physical trainers or instructors of some kind and you will not be able to keep up with them the entire time, especially when you are just starting out the program. Instead of focusing on keeping up with them, focus on doing as much of the workout you can and take an unscheduled break or two when you find yourself exhausted.

* **Drink lots of water!** We’re not talking about before, during, and after the workout; we’re talking all day! Water, in combination with a recovery/protein shake and a sound nutrition plan, will help minimize soreness overall. Plus, it can be cost-effective in the long-term versus soda or other unhealthy beverages.

* **Breathe and keep your core tight!** Most of the exercises will focus on your legs and core (hip flexors, glutes, and abs). Make sure to inhale and exhale deeply and often to work and contract your abdominal area. Try not to slouch too far back or forward.

* **Do the warm-ups and stretches EVERY time!** You may be tempted to skip the warm-ups or the stretches before and after the workouts, but do not do this! Make sure to do the warm-ups and stretches before and after each workout to maximize your efforts and prevent injuries from occurring.

* **Utilize your rest day!** Your body needs time to rest and recover from the workouts, so this day is equally important to observe and follow. If you must be active on this day, make it a light workout (running/walking, light weights, etc.) so you can still slightly recover and give it your all the next day.

* **Drink the recovery formula (recommended).** While this is not a bare necessity to this workout, it does help in giving your muscles the necessary nutrients to rebuild and recover quicker. You can also substitute the formula for a whey protein shake or another post-workout solution if you’re working on a budget. Some folks have even suggested low-fat chocolate milk for its many beneficial recovery properties.

* **Take a photo of yourself before starting the program and every few weeks after starting** (recommended by **Micosilver**).This, along with monitoring weight and your cardio endurance, may help motivate you and allow you to see your visible results as you progress through the program. Also, if you send in your ""before"" picture and your final ""after"" picture, the Beachbody team will send you a [free Insanity shirt!](http://www.beachbody.com/images/beachbody/en_us/pdf/products/programs/insanity/InsanityT-ShirtApplication.pdf) (links to the PDF form with the details; need a PDF viewer to view)

* **Find a workout buddy to do Insanity with you (recommended).** While you can do this program by yourself, you will find that having at least one workout buddy will push you even further than you could by yourself. You also have accountability in performing the workouts each day and eating right with this person or people. It’s a win/win for everyone involved!

With all of that out of the way, you are now ready to start the first Fit Test (FT). This test, which you will do about every two weeks in the program, will gauge your overall level of fitness and improvement. The FT will start with a warm-up and a stretch before going into the individual exercises, which Shaun T will demonstrate before you attempt them yourself. You will have one minute (60 seconds) on each exercise to complete as many of them as you can, followed by a brief rest period. During each rest period, you will get an opportunity to write down your results. We recommend writing down your results on the same sheet of paper each FT so you can compare your prior results and see how much you have improved throughout the program. If you cannot complete the first FT, then write down what you did and try the FT again after completing the first two weeks of the program. You will more than likely complete the full FT this time around and beat your other established results in the process!

Typically after the first and second days, you may start to feel quite sore, especially in the groin and glutes (buttocks area). Just remember to keep performing the warm-ups and stretches (as much as you physically and safely can do) and keep moving. This week will prove to be a huge hurdle as you and your body adjusts to the intensity of the workouts, but your body will feel better after the first full week (rest day included).

I hope this guide helps in giving you a realistic and positive mindset going into your first week! Please make sure to share your experiences with us and, once again, ask us any general questions you may have.

For anyone reading this – if you have any starter tips that you think everyone can benefit from, please leave a reply and I’ll add them on when I can.

First, progress pics.  Maybe they aren't quite as drastic as some, but I'm on the right track, I think!  Like I said in the subject, I've lost 4"" off my waist, 4"" off my hips, and 2.25"" off my chest.  

Also, I'm 27/f/5'11"".  As far as pounds go, I didn't have a scale the first week, so I started measuring at the second fit test.  Between the 2nd and last, I only lost 7 pounds, but since I lost so many inches, I guess it's okay!



So, here are my fit test results:

So for everyone just starting - IDK how inspirational my pics are, but hopefully those fit test numbers will help you feel like you can improve!  As you can see, I sucked when I started, LOL, but got much better by the end!  So, you can do it!!

Up next for me is a Chalean Extreme/Insanity hybrid in a couple weeks...wish me luck!  

Anyway, woo hoo, I'm done!  I still have lots of work to go on my body, but I'm going in the right direction, so I'm happy. Keep it up everybody!

Due to a new job, a move and other real life issues I had decided to try a home fitness program three months ago and looking back on it I guess i got sucked into the expensive, highly advertised products by beach body (Insanity, P90x, etc.).

**Routine:** I followed the program exactly, workouts 6 days a week for 9 weeks.

**Nutrition:** I was constantly craving carbs! I fought those cravings using oatmeal, whole wheat pasta and high protein bread (in moderation). For protein I used Whey Protein powder, yogurt and fish, no meat! I ate 5 times a day with the largest meal being breakfast, this was key. If I missed a meal I often felt weak and if I ate a large lunch I would feel heavy and nauseous during my workout even if it was 4 - 5 hours later...

**Supplements:** Whey protein powder, a multi vitamin, and Cardio Igniter.

I was skeptical at first but I stuck with it. I'll let you guys decide whether it was beneficial or not! Feel free to ask any questions in regards to eating habits, nutrition, supplements, the program itself or anything that comes to mind. Thanks!

- Weight down from 120 to 116.5 (I'm only 5'0 so it's a huge difference for me)
- Down a dress size, possibly 2!

- I get through the work day feeling light on my feet and healthy

I've been in and out of shape for about 2 years and a huge mountain biker so I wasnt completely out of shape...just shapes :)

I was sitting on the couch one Friday night around 2am completely wasted with my girlfriend and the infomercial for the Insanity program came on; I remember very vividly turning to her and saying ""I just want the damn t-shirt..."" I didn't know that by making that decision I was going to become borderline obsessed with fitness.

I kept it simple at first. I did 2 rounds of Insanity and saw awesome results by just simply losing the fat and eating healthy. I then did the Insanity Asylum series to start building up some of the muscle I lost or never had and then when I decided to bulk up I did Beachbody's Body Beast program - some might laugh, but I think it was a good intro into weight lifting and it allowed me to be more confident when I went to the gym. As of recently I've started the MFT28 schedule from bodybuilding.com - it's really high in volume, but if you have the time and motivation its not impossible to keep up with and I used this program as a cutting schedule to tone back up.

I was at 192lbs when I decided I needed to make a change and got down to 158. My current weight today is 173 and I feel fantastic! I can post before and afters for each program I completed when I get home.

EDIT:
Supplements i took: * Syntha-6 protein post workout and sometimes breakfast. Chocolate Peanut Butter is like tasting Christmas * Animal Pak daily * Inner Armour Casein before bed * C4 preworkout (didn't take this during cardio) * Fish oil

Diet: A lot of veggies (mixed bags and canned) and bananas, lean meat, fish and chicken. this was pretty much it for a long time. a bag of tilapia fillets will last a long time and they cook quickly on a george foreman grill. i kept it simple, light and protein rich. snacks usually consist of nuts or plain greek no fat yogurt with some honey and nuts. i substituted milk for Almond or Coconut milk and stocked up on cartons of egg whites (All Whites)

ive recently started getting some Met-RX big 100 bars and shave off the icing to get rid of the sugar...its a good mid day snack

My advice to people discouraged with their results, which is also what I tell myself- if you have spent the last 10 years eating crap and not exercising, you are not going to have the body of your dreams after just a few months of eating right and working out.

I'm really happy that I finished it! I almost quit after the first week but I pushed through. I'm planning to do another round after giving my self a week or two to recover before moving on to Asylum.

The program has not only changed my body, but changed my way of thinking in terms of health and nutrition. I've been eating more healthy and been much more active since. Yay!

Style -- A Guide to Getting Lit and Staying Fit in the Next 30 Days",39,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/146xcg/holiday_partying_insanity_style_a_guide_to/,"So it's that time of year again.  Office holiday parties, college kids home from school, and your local tavern decked out in romantic holiday lights.  And between the spiked eggnog and the fact that you have never looked better, it's time to get weird.  Good.  You deserve it.  

After countless hours of Shaun T screaming at you and Tanya's wooooing duck face, you owe it to yourself to knock back a half dozen Hot Toddies and see if some clothes come off with that cute dude or chick from Human Resources/sophomore Trig/the end of the bar.  Right on.  Get after it.

Now trust me, I am no nutritionist.  I hold no degrees in physiology or biology, and everything I know about dieting I read (skimmed) in the Insanity Fitness Guide.  

I am, however, a bartender.  A bartender in the best shape of his life, currently pounding away at Insanity! Round Two.  

So unless you want to be ski-abbing through an extra 10 pounds *on top* of a pile-driving hangover come the new year, heed the following:

**Beer**

Put away your doppelbocks and milk stouts for the season, boys.  Even the limited edition Christmas ale has got to go...  Because you're doing 12 oz curls, Insanity! style.  

The gold standard here is Miller 64 or Bud Select 55.  No reason to waver.  Both are terribly named and will prompt double takes when ordered at a bar.  Who cares?  They taste close enough to a normal light beer, and you know exactly how many calories you're getting (a third less than a normal light while only losing 1% ABV).  Guys, yeah, your pretend-beer-snob buddies are going to trash you unmercifully.  But they'll be doing it while their dates eye-bang you from across the room.  

If you're at a bar and you are uncomfortable publicly drinking a low-cal beer, A. grow up, B. ask for a glass.  Same goes at house parties.  Bring a bottle of good booze for the host and a twelve pack of Miller 64 for you. Throw it in the fridge and find a pint glass in the cabinet or a red cup by the keg.  Fill from your stash, don't be a jackass if someone wants one, and nobody will know the difference.  Office parties are harder, especially if they are not held at a bar.  Your best bet in terms of what will most likely be served is Amstel Light (95 cals), Miller Lite (96 cals), or Coors Light (102 cals per bottle).

For further reference on beer calories check out: http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=lowest_cal

**Wine**

Because of the numerous varietals and the myriad makers, pinning down exactly how many calories are in the glass of whatever bottle your match.com date is currently sniffing the cork of (idiot) is harder.  Generally speaking, the drier the wine, the fewer the calories.  The accepted thinking is that on average, a 4oz glass of red has about 95 calories and a 4oz glass of white has about 90.  

That's fine, but this is the holidays.  You will not be drinking 4 ounces of wine, you will be drinking 40.  So plan accordingly and just know you're gonna have to get serious with the globe jumps.  It's worth noting that they do make low-cal wine (Skinnygirl, So Light, Brightlight).  They clock in around 70 calories (more for the Housewife's brand).  They are relatively hard to find.  And they are garbage.  That is, don't show up to a party flashing low-cal wine as your contribution.  Bring a nice bottle of red for everybody and if you must, stash the low-cal bottle inconspicuously somewhere in the house (upstairs bathroom under the sink generally works).  Sneak away and refill accordingly.  

If you are hosting, it's easier.  Before your guests arrive, fill a decanter with a decent red.  Then fill the empty bottle with your garbage low-cal red.  Serve from the decanter, fill your own glass from the bottle.  But keep an eye on it!  The last thing you want is one of your friends or some dude you are trying to hook up with refilling his glass from the garbage bottle.  Even a Two-Buck-Chucker will know the difference.

**Cocktails**

When it's all said and done and the place is drank dry, alcohol is sugar.  No getting around it.  The key is not being an idiot about your mixers.  Bacardi, Bombay, Cuervo, Kettle, and Jack all come in around 40% ABV and 100 calories a shot (1.5oz).  Any of their equivalents generally do too.  It's not mixing it with nonsense that will save you the extra power jacks.  

If you must mix, make the smart (obvious) choices.  Stick to two ingredient drinks and go diet not regular, soda not tonic.  Avoid sour mix like poison.  Use extra fruit for flavor.  You know what you like, just modify it to cut out the excess calories.  If you drink brown:  Jack and soda, buncha limes.  Order it just like that.  If you drink clear:  Kettle, soda, splash of cran, with a lime.  Boom, now you're properly lubricated to charmingly deflect the jailbait intern's compliments on your shoulders.

As with wine, specifically made low-cal booze is out there (most notably, again, the Housewife's).  Let's be real honest here.  Ladies, stocking Skinnygirl in your home bar is probably acceptable.  Gentlemen, get real.  Save face, grab an empty Absolut bottle and pull the switch.  Also, if you plan on making cocktails with low-cal booze at someone else's holiday house party, you're flasking it.  And be discreet, otherwise you will look like you're spiking the punch at a 50's dance.

For further booze calorie reference, visit the hilariously named getdrunknotfat.com

Now then, it's snowing, the fire is roaring, and you look great... 

The stockings are hung by the chimney with care.  B-Boy Jeff has almost kicked Arielle in the face.  And somewhere Akil is probably giving up on power jumps.   

It's time to get hammered and make some questionable choices.

**Drink up, Dig Deeper, &amp; Happy Holidays**

Yesterday I went back and did Cardio Power and Resistance with proper form and wow, I could really feel a difference in how much more effective the moves were. 

Those little tips that flash up on the screen as you're working out? Pay attention to them! Always keep your knees behind your toes when going into any squat move.

Wow! I started this subreddit yesterday morning and we're already up to 59 members! Let's keep growing! If you see people talking about Insanity in r/fitness or r/loseit or anywhere else on Reddit, send them here.

Please don't hesitate to post content on the site. There are no ""stupid questions"". Let's keep this subreddit active.

I updated the flair today! Go to the right sidebar under ""insanityworkout"" and go to ""Show my flair on this subreddit"". Make sure thats checked, then go to edit to select your flair next to your name.

I've separated it out into four different sets of flair basically. ""Interested in Insanity"" if you're thinking about or planning on doing the workout soon. ""Veteran"" if you've completed the 60 day challenge. ""Certified Insane"" if you've done the 60 day routine two times or more. And also, ""Insanity in Progress"". There are 60 different ""Insanity In Progress"" flairs, with Days 1-60 for the workout. This way, along with the calendar you can update your flair as you progress through the workout. The idea is that people can motivate you and congratulate you as you progress through the 60 days. Every 10 days the color switches. 

Don't hesitate to contact me to suggest any changes to the subreddit. This is my first job moderating a subreddit so I am learning as well.

It's been a great resource and has kept me motivated to complete the Insanity challenge. 

Previous to Insanity I hadn't worked out for about a year. I used to do some light running until I experienced some knee/back pain. I'm getting married this summer which was my real motivation to lose my belly. Throughout the two months I still ate out, drank beer and ate some sweets/chocolate. My only regret is that I didn't measure my arms, belly, thighs etc before starting out.

Next stage is to repeat the second month of Insanity but a little less intense. I've re-arranged the workouts slightly to give 2 rest days per week. I will check in again in a month or so with some updated pics.

Currently I'm mainly a CrossFitter but during the weeks when I can't make it to the gym because of work I do Shaun T workouts.  I had mixed expectations about this program but I can say that it definitely lives up to what we've come to expect from Shaun T and BeachBody's more ""extreme"" workout series.  It's 25 min of pure workout.  I did the first one, Cardio, tonight.   No real warm-up/stretch/cool-down on both sides of the workout proper like you're used to with Insanity.  Each exercise does go through ""progressions"" though so they start out easier and get progressively harder.  I did have to take two mini-breaks just to get a breath.  The movements are similar to things you will have seen in Insanity and Asylum.  Interestingly, Tania (the machine) is on this one doing the ""modifications"" in case you want to go more low impact.  The fact that they have that option is really nice for people that want to keep moving but not stop outright, but it should give you an idea that BB is pushing towards making this program appeal to a larger audience than the other extreme workouts.  After the full 25 min workout, there was a 2:30 cool down stretch that was optional.  Overall fairly pleased with it so far.  Definitely sweated a lot and got the HR up pretty good.  I'm interested to see how the rest of the program goes.  This might not be much of a post, but just thought I'd throw it in for anyone curious.  I can post about the other workouts if anyone is interested or on the fence about trying this one out.  Keep pushing play everybody!

I didn't do that because I didn't have all that much to say about them enough to justify another full post (these ARE just my thoughts on these and in no way represent what I'd call an actual ""review"") and I wasn't really all that concerned about getting more karma or anything.

Every day I feel like it's just as hard as the first day, but I know I am improving. For the past week I am getting through the warm up without breaks, and my second fit test showed an average improvement of almost 20%.

However i noticed the biggest difference today. Last week I posted that I ran my first mile since high school. Today, I went for another run after the recovery work out. As I was going along, I was breathing harder, feeling slower, and when I felt like giving up, I glanced at the GPS and it said only .8 miles! I started to mentally beat myself up as I was performing worse, wanting to quit at only .8 miles. I dug deeper and pushed and when i finished my mile, I found out why I was so much more tired, my time went from 9 min to 8:30. A full 30 sec shaved off in just one week.

Today I completed my last fit test of Insanity(March 18th to May 19th). I feel absolutely great and proud of myself. 

Some background: Prior to starting Insanity, I would go to the gym almost every day. I would do 30 minutes of lifting and then 30 minutes of cardio either on the elliptical machine or treadmill. I sort of watched what I would eat, but didn't care too much about it. I started at around 190 pounds, dropped to 172, and then remained at 182 for most of the time. After about a year and a half of doing this, my wrist started hurting more and more each stay. Finally, the pain was too much and I could not lift anymore. I started to just go to the gym and do cardio, but I figured that it is not enough. I don't remember how, but then I found Insanity. 

Shaun is an amazing motivator. I have never done P90X or any other workout that's on DVD. I read how hard Insanity was prior to starting it, but just listening to that man's voice kept me both entertained and motivated. He has a great attitude and I just love the way he talks haha. After the first fit test, I felt like I got slapped in the face with a reality check. I thought I was in good shape for going to the gym for a year and a half, but I was wrong. I couldn't even finish the fit test, and I actually threw my results away because I couldn't even finish half the video. I was so upset and frustrated! Seriously, how the hell could I not even finish the video after hitting the gym for a good amount of time? Next day, I did the next video and decided that I needed to continue if I ever wanted to achieve my dream body. 

After two weeks of sticking with it, I immediately started to see results. My friends and family were telling me how much weight I lost, and how slim I looked. Girls in my class would talk to me more. Girls in the library would come sit next to me and then start a conversation with me, hot ones too! My confidence soared and so did my inner game. Long story short, I love how far I have come and how much I have improved. My eating habits are great now. I just feel totally awesome (like Barney Stinson) and I feel like the world is my oyster (so cliché right? lol). 

Since then, I have got multiple friends, family members, and even my girlfriends dad and brother to start Insanity. Only good things have come from doing this and I encourage all of you who want to start, or are currently doing Insanity to stick with it no matter what. 

Now, let's get to the numbers and pics. 
Note: I said earlier how I trashed my first fit test results because of how poorly I did on them. So my second fit test was on April 1st, and the last on May 19th (4 total).

Just some closing thoughts that I have is for everyone who is doing Insanity to just keep going. Never pause the video. Never quit. Never give up. Just keep going. Even on days where you don't want to do it, just shut up and do it. Remember, you will never regret doing a workout, only skipping one. My girlfriend started Insanity 1 month after me and is starting month 2 tomorrow! I will be starting the Asylum tomorrow and we are both super excited. I will report back in a month with both of our updated progress. If any of yall have any questions at all, I'm all ears.

First off, I really enjoyed insanity and recommend for everyone to keep it up.

If I was to do it all again I would probably follow the diet plan and count calories. Instead all I did was make a list of rules I would follow to ensure a healthy diet.

I am 23/m/6ft. When i started I was 192 lbs, 38.5"" waist and 16"" neck. When i finished i was 190 lbs, 34.5"" waist and 16"" neck.

At my best I was 181 lbs but after a week of an all inclusive resort where i broke all my rules and didn't do insanity I went all the way up to 196 :(

I was thinking about going for round 2 but i was getting tired of the moves so I plan on doing a week of recovery workouts and then hitting up asylum AND following the diet. I'll let you know how that goes.

• A big thing I figured out my second time was that injuries from insanity or outside of can really complicate your work outs. A lot of people rip on akeel(sp?) for not finishing all his workouts, if you look closely, his face is in agony in a couple of cutaway shots. Who knows what muscles were sore or if something was pulled prior those shoots. Personally, I went through shin splints last time and this time I'm getting over a pulled muscle in my rib cage so I've had to overcome pain a few times to get through these workouts.

• Form- Without a body mirror, its really hard to tell if you're doing it right. So if you can, try to set things up so you can monitor your form and try to be aware of your actions. Deep squats, flat backs.. Everything is done for a reason. 

• Improvise. My wrists are inherently weaker than I'd like so I bought some push up bars to use for plank work. Comes in handy for ski abs and full body drills. I can keep solid form for the full time instead of taking breaks. Hoping to ditch them soon but for now it works. *Edit* Also after having shin splints and flat feet issues, I've been doing insanity barefoot (with a mat) and those problems have all gone away.

• Adding on- I felt like, while the work out is great, I wanted to get more upper body work out in so I've been doing 3 day weight routines before insanity. It makes for a long morning but it feels good. I'm also an avid cyclist but this time around, my legs are too tired to take on 40+ mile rides after weeks of insanity. Hoping my body will adjust so I can get back into the game.

• Diet.. Ok, I'll admit. I dismissed the meal plan the first times around but the past few weeks I've been focusing on trying to make it work. Judging by the scale and how I feel, it definitely makes a difference. If nothing else, for the protein your body needs for muscle growth.

It feels good to be over my pulled muscle and back in the workout game. Hoping to continue working out hard and progressing onto another series or a hard gym routine.

Just completed insanity. I lost a total of 4 pounds...all in the last week. I didn't follow the diet plan but kept my diet clean and always stayed under calorie counts. 



I also surfed 2-4 hours on average 5 days a week (depending on the surf) and did yoga at least a couple times a week.  Those were in my normal workout regimen before I started insanity. I really hated the rest day workouts so I always just replaced it with yoga instead. Since I surfed so much when the surf was good too, I also missed some workout days. Trust me I lived.

I stopped doing Insanity for 10 days, and when I tried to get back to it (Max Interval Plyo), I couldn't keep up with even the first interval.

This was my first day with this workout, and it was honestly quite enjoyable and fun.

So I finally got started on Focus T25 this morning, and let me tell you, I. Am. BEAT!

This is a completely different setup from Insanity for anyone else who has done it. I did Insanity for the first time in February, and as anyone who has began that workout, after the first day you are sore all over. I did a two week stint of no working out between my rounds of Insanity, and was already sore again just from two weeks. After I finished the second round, I started running, and after two weeks of that, I am back to Shaun T kicking my ass on a daily basis.

So here we go: I wasn't really sure what this was going to be like whenever I pressed play, but it was definitely in a way similar to Insanity, but at the same time, extremely different. Over the 25 minutes of working out, you will do the exercises in 30-second spurts, which definitely helps to keep the monotony at an all time low.

There isn't a warm-up. There are, however, workouts in the beginning that steadily progress into the sheer force and power of this workout. You will start at a very mild pace (bringing knees up for example) and moving faster into different variations of the workout (high knees, etc.).

In the middle of the workout, about ten minutes in, there is a ""Burnout"" I believe it was called, where you do a selection of the workouts you just did, only much more intensely. You do this again near the end of the workout.

One thing that I was NOT expecting was the hand/foot coordination during some workouts. One in particular was left foot forward/right foot back, then bring to the middle, then swap the foot placement, and then bring your feet and hands outward twice, then repeat. I'm sure after a few go-arounds, it will become much easier. For me, this particular move was comparable to the side-attack move from Insanity (took me weeks to get it down right without messing up constantly).
By the end of the workout, I had to make 5, 5-10 second breaks.

I have done two rounds of Insanity, as I said earlier on, and I didn't have to make as many stops in that workout. This particular workout from the Alpha month is a definite workout on the legs, I was extremely sore by the end of it, and hoping that soreness doesn't resonate into tomorrow.

There is also a 2-minute cooldown stretch after the 25-minute beatdown. I would suggest to anyone that has to take even the slightest break during this behemoth to use the cooldown stretch to your advantage.

Overall, I feel as if I got exactly what I would've gotten from Insanity in a much shorter amount of time, maybe even a little more. This is much more of a muscle work than the cardio that it says it is called.

I would give this particular workout an 8.5/10",,False,self,t5_2ua71,False,,Certified,True,t3_1hpqc9,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1hpqc9/my_review_of_focus_t25_alpha_cardio_just_in_case/,

Before I get to the results, I just want to say that I did the Asylum/Insanity hybrid calendar but I did not follow a good meal plan. This month was my 21st birthday (lots of beer, shots, drink), plus many of my friends and families college graduations. In other words, lots of alcohol, pizza, cake, soda, etc. Despite this, I am quite pleased with my results, but feel that I would have had much better ones because of how poorly my diet was this month. I look forward to getting back on track with my previous diet this month during Asylum Vol. 2.

There's a short moment in every workout that I think ""I can't do this, I'm dying, why am I doing this?"" but I ignore it and push through. Some things I've learned in my first two weeks:

-Drink so much water. If you're not drinking tons of water leading up to the workout then you're going to be in bad shape. And make sure to hydrate during the exercise too.

-Buy an exercise mat, and head/wrist bands. You're going to sweat. Doing burpees or push-ups with an exercise mat to keep you from slipping is a must. 

-Ignore the scale, look in the mirror. My clothes are loose, and I have received a ton of compliments on how I have lost weight and look better from family and co-workers. 

-Stretching is underrated. My favorite part of the workout is the stretching. My back doesn't hurt anymore, and I am already much more flexible than when I started. 

-Take this as opportunity to improve more things in your life. Don't just do the workouts and call it a day. Improve your diet. Improve your attitude. Improve your work habits. Become more focused. When you know you're going home to do an incredibly difficult 45-60 minute workout everything else in the day seems easy.

- I work a 45 hour/week job
- I have not been on a workout schedule in years
- I live on the 4th floor of a 600 sq/foot apartment w/ downstairs neighbors
- I was going to have to start showering twice a day because of all the damn sweat
- My living room is carpet
- I pretty much died after the first Fit Test
- The only place I could work out is about 10' X 10' (I'm 5'9/m)
- I have knee problems
- I go out almost every Friday or Saturday night
- I like to come home and just relax after work
- I just didn't think I had the time

These are all the excuses I chose not to let stand in my way. It has now gotten the point that if I do not sweat, I feel off and tilted the whole day and I love it! This is not me trying to brag by any means. I am merely trying to tell anyone out there that may think there excuse is valid; it's not.

A bit about me:

Age: 21

Sex: Female

Weight: Last I checked it was 209. I know that sounds like a LOT for someone as short as me, but a thin weight for me is 145...wide frame

Height: 5'0""

I have a muscular Dystrophy disease called Myasthenia Gravis. I have good days and bad days, but I really want to push myself to lose weight. MG doesn't cause muscle damage, so I'm perfectly able to exercise. Last summer, when my husband was at Marine Corps boot camp, I went to Planet Fitness every day after work and worked out for over an hour.

Since we moved from NYC to a different state, money has been tight (I've been out of work) so instead of joining a gym, we bought insanity. 

So today I finally popped in the first insanity DVD to do the fit test.

After the fourth exercise, I couldn't push myself anymore. I fell to the floor and just could not get up.

What should I do? Should I continue on or should I just repeat the fit test tomorrow? Should I rest in between fit test workouts?

I'd really appreciate some advice. I'd feel like such a failure if I couldn't do this program. =[

I've lost 75 pounds since April 2012 and want to get these last 40 pounds off by the end of summer.

My trainer and I did HIIT training for 6 weeks back in February and I had amazing results (lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks and 15 inches!) I love doing HIIT type workouts.  The adrenaline rush is awesome, and seeing the results happen quickly is an adrenaline rush on its own.

My bf purchased the Insanity videos last summer and was trying to get me to do it with him. I asked my trainer about them, but he strongly discouraged me to do something that intense with little to no pre-training.

To give you an idea of my fitness level back then I was ~210 pounds (5'2 3/4"") with little to no training other than the occasional attempts at jogging. I couldn't do more than 5 jumping jacks, I couldn't do one single push up, I couldn't shoulder press 2 lbs, and lunges killed my knees. I was very weak.

Since then I've come a long way. I can squat up to 112 pounds up to 30 times (3 sets, 10 reps), I can shoulder press 20 pounds, I can do up to 120 jumping jacks in a row, I can mountain climb, plank for a full minute 3 times with 30 second breaks with 5 pound weight on my back. My cardio has greatly improved, I do interval running up a 15% incline hill 4 days a week after work for 45 minutes. I still suck at push ups, but can do them from my knees, or on an incline.

On Friday my bf came over and told me he'll be on training in another province for the month of July (he's military), then his daughter will be with him for part of August. He only sees her twice a year so I make sure she's his #1 priority when she's here and I do my own thing to give them as much time together as possible. I asked him to bring me his Insanity videos, which he did the next day.

I did the fit test, and my results were on par if not better than the people in the video's claims for their first day results. That was a bit unexpected on my part, considering I'm about 30-40 pounds heavier than them. On Monday I did the first Plyometrics Cardio video. Now that's high intensity stuff! I loved and hated every second of it. I mainly kept pace with everyone in the video, except near the end I started to falter a bit, but watching the video, I wasn't the only one having to back off. Afterwards I was more water than solid, that's for sure!  I had to mop up my workout mats, they were drenched with my sweat!

So my goal is to continue with the trainer twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), bike to work and back Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday (45 mins each way), and after work do the Insanity videos Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday (Saturdays being my rest day). It should take me two and a half months to finish the program.  I told my bf that when he sees me in August he's not going to recognize me. I think this goal is totally achievable, and I'm so excited about it!

After taking a diet break since March (eating great during the week, eating like a gross pig on the weekends), I'm put myself into maintenance mode, and lost my mojo to continue to lose. I think this has re-invigorated me to push to reach my goal of 110-120 pounds. Here are some [pics for reference](http://imgur.com/a/B4eON#0) the first ones are from Day 1 of the diet back in April, the second set are my halfway point in January (taken a week or two before my first HIIT session), and the last are from February after doing HIIT. I'm pretty much the same size now as I was in February. I took new pics on Sunday to record the before and after of doing the Insanity videos, those I'll post in August when I'm done the program.

I'll try and keep this post short. I wanted to share a quick success story involving this program that I just experienced today.

A few days before starting round #1 of Insanity, my work office held sign-ups for a ""Biggest Loser"" contest. In short, everyone had to pay an entry fee and the person who had the greatest percent of weight loss at the end of the contest would be the winner.

At the start of the contest, I weight about 204 lbs. After completing a round of Insanity and changing my diet, I weighed in today around 187, giving me an 8.04% weight loss percentage and securing my victory in the contest! The runner-up was around 7.5% and the third place was around 4%.

I won the contest, the prize money, today is payday, and my office is sponsoring today's lunch and possibly letting us leave early. A better Friday workday could not have been asked for!

Due to a hectic schedule I have had to miss a few days, but do not count missed days in my progress. I pick up where I left off or use my rest day as a makeup day.

When I started doing the new, harder workouts of month 2 I was really unmotivated... Not really a big help when the workouts are much more intense.

I was able to get through a month 1 workout with little difficulty by the end of month one...now I can barely get through the warm up... ha, is this what they call muscle confusion, or am I just not working hard enough??? 

Another strange thing is that in month one, when I took a break it was because my muscles were really burning due to lactic acid. Now when I take breaks it feels as though my muscles are okay..but my body is just unwilling to continue. I keep getting back in, but I have to stop somewhat frequently. Perhaps it's because I'm actually using my abs now, or perhaps it's a mental block I've put on myself due to many years of sedentary life?

1360609402.0,16,self.insanityworkout,18bnyy,Fit Test #2 and my thoughts on the program...,20,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/18bnyy/fit_test_2_and_my_thoughts_on_the_program/,"20/F/5'6""/152. I've never liked working out. In fact, it's a ~~slight~~ understatement to say I've always dreaded it. Between work, school, volunteering, eating, showering, and sleeping, I always thought it would be impossible to find time to work out. I've tried a few programs over the years, but they've all reaffirmed my belief that working out is un-doable for a chick like me.

What finally motivated me to start this program was an infomercial. That's right, those dirty, fake commercials that try to sell you a too-good-to-be-true product to fix all the woes of life in one fell swoop. That stupid commercial did a perfect job of reminding me how much weight I've gained (cough*20 pounds*cough) since high school, and that I can't fit into my own pants anymore. I may have also had a bit too much to smoke, and decided I needed to do something other than snack and study all night. Long story short, Insanity was sitting oh-so-harmlessly on my desktop not an hour later. If I knew what I had got myself into, I probably would have thought twice before pushing play.

For the first few days, I was convinced I was on the edge of death. I didn't dare compare my fit test results or starting stats against anyone else's online, because I knew mine would be lower than theirs. I felt humiliated about how many breaks I had to take, and thought I must be a complete failure at all things fitness. That stupid little folder sat on my desktop, mocking me every time I turned my computer on as if to say ""You can't do this. You'll never be able to."" 

That's where you awesome people come in.

While browsing Reddit between classes, it occurred to me that there might be a few posts about Insanity somewhere on here. I was pretty excited when I found r/insanity. After nervously poking through a few posts, something clicked for me. EVERYONE struggles with this. It's hard. It's meant to push you, and make you feel like every day is a challenge, because that's how our bodies improve.

By day two, I had been convinced that I wouldn't stick with it through the week. Now that I've seen what 15 days can do, I'm determined to stick with it til the end. Two short weeks have made me realize that I don't need a work out buddy or a class or a surgery to make a positive change. It's reversed an entire lifetime of negative feelings toward fitness. I'm no longer in it for weight loss-- I'm doing this for my health and strength (which I really need, working with 100+ lb dogs all day). I can already see and feel the changes starting.

While I'm not going to post any photos until day 63, here's my Fit Test #1/2 results:

* Switch Kicks: 34 --&gt; 54
* Power Jacks: 20 --&gt; 30
* Power Knees: 60 --&gt; 76
* Power Jumps: 14 --&gt; 17
* Globe Jumps: 5 --&gt; 8
* Suicide Jumps: 10 --&gt; 18
* Push-up Jacks: 3 --&gt; 18
* Low Plank Oblique: 40 --&gt; 70

I started at 151, went up to 155, and am now back down to 152. I am not following the meal plan, but am making an effort to eat less junk food, and am only drinking water. So far I've lost .5"" off each thigh, 1"" off my hips, waist, and butt, and 1.5"" from each arm. I'd call that a good start. :)

Progress pictures are from day 7 (I didn't take before I started) and day 30 (http://imgur.com/ktaLs).

I didn't use any of my rest days, and instead replaced them with the recovery video.  I didn't follow the meal plan, but I ate between 1,200 and 1,400 calories a day. I ate clean (no processed food) and cheated maybe twice the entire month.  I started at 133lbs and ended at 130. This was a bit frustrating, but I know that I didn't  lose weight because of muscle gain. For anyone starting insanity, try not to focus on the scale and focus on progress pictures and measurements. 

My fitness results:
Switch kicks: 95 - 106 (each kick counted as one)
Power jacks: 38 - 47
Power knees: 59- 76
Power jumps: 20- 24
Globe jumps: 7-10
Suicide jumps: 12-14
Push up jacks: 17-20
Low plank: 48-63

I'm a bit disappointed in my first month results, but I'm going to start following the nutrition guide in the second month and add yoga to my routine everyday. I hope this was helpful to anyone starting insanity and what they may expect over the next month.

I was in decent shape at the beginning of this year. I completed P90x in December, though I focused much more on the resistance than the cardio. Then alongside a million and one excuses, I traded off between doing nothing and almost nothing for the next seven months. One of those was a false start on Insanity. I counted that as my first fit test, though now I can't find it. 

Week one, I started with Plyo Cardio and Cardio Power as day 1 and 2, then a rest day, then followed the calendar rigidly from there. I learned to pause the stretching near the end and add a minute of lower leg/calf stretching, which I *really* advise to beginners.

I didn't follow the exactly diet plan, but I tracked every calorie using LoseIt and kept my intake between 1,500 - 2,000 net each day (with four of the Sunday off days being deliciously higher). 

**Results:**

38yo, M, 5'9"". Went from 203lbs to 191lbs. From 42"" waist to 38"". I lost a lot of fat on my arms and legs as well.

A bit part of today's improvements is that I didn't have to pace myself for Max Interval Circuit (I hate it!), so I went all out on each test. For the sake of your eyes, I'm withholding the before/after pics of my pasty white body.

So what's next? Tonight's plan is Ben &amp; Jerry's Phish Food. And I'm taking a few days off for my legs to regain feeling, and I have a pretty busy week with some other things. I'm lucky those happen to fall this week. On Saturday I'm starting the P90X/Insanity Hybrid.

I'm prepared to be sore, it may be naive, but I'm looking forward to a new challenge. I found recovery week exceedingly boring. 

I'm really, very proud of myself for sticking with this program for this long. I've always struggled to consistently work out, especially before work, and for 5 weeks, I've woken up at 6am to get my workout in before going in to work. Insanity has also kept me honest with my eating habits. I've been eating moderately low carb (&lt;100g a day) and eating mostly whole foods while staying around 1200-1400cals a day (I'm 5'1''). 

My strength and endurance has already improved so much! I rock climb and fly trapeze, and I've found myself more easily completing tricks and routes that before I was struggling with. Also the couple times I've gone for a run I've been amazed by my endurance. I didn't weigh in Day 1, but based on my progress, I can calculate that I've lost about 10lbs so far. I'm hoping for another 8lbs in month 2. 

Month 2 will bring a couple new challenges though... I'm heading into NYC to visit a friend this weekend and will miss 2 days there. I'm staying with her in her tiny 3rd floor NY apartment and it would be exceedingly rude of me to do the workout there. So I plan to just go for a run in the morning and pick up Insanity when I get home. I also have a camping trip planned to visit my parents in week three. I haven't figured out what I'll do then since that's a longer trip. 

Thanks /r/insanityworkout! You have all been an immense help at keeping me honest and committed. DIG DEEPER!

**Journey:**  
I'll make this brief. So I started at 260 lbs in 2009, lost 100 lbs, and ended up skinny fat.  Rode off my accomplishments until 2011, gained 40 lbs, and then started to workout again as of August 2011.  I did Insanity, lost fat but looked emaciated.

Started lifting in around April or May 2012, don't remember exactly.  Kept that up until now, and now I'm cutting so I can get down to ottermode.  I never really was into the whole swole look, although I certainly admire those that can manage to put in that much effort into their lives.

Saturday: Rest

I love cardio.  I'm a cyclist, though I never consider any time on the saddle as a workout.  That's my passion.  I prefer to just use cycling as my gateway and not consider it a workout.  So if I cycle, it's in there but it doesn't count.

**Lifts:** *(current maxes in parentheses)*  

Upper Body:  

* Bent Over Barbell Rows (3x5x135)  
* Barbell Shrugs (3x8x240)  
* OHP (3x5x105 - *without bending my knees*)  
* Squats (3x5x270)  
* EZ Bar Curls (3x8x85)  
(No powercleans due to a worn out rotator cuff)

Lower Body:

* Deadlift (3x5x305)
* Barbell Shrugs (duplicate)
* Squats (duplicate)
* Bench (4x5x175)

**Diet:**  
http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/freakinguy?date=2012-12-04

* IF 18/6 (I eat from 6 pm - 12 am everyday)  
* Currently eating a 1,000 cal deficit as 500 cals didn't work
* No alcohol/cigarettes, just recently stopped smoking pot
* No refined sugars/simple carbs

It's all there.  Blank days are days where I didn't log for one reason or another, but my nutrition remains the same.  I don't eat refined sugars or simple carbs, although I recently had my first In-n-Out milkshake a week ago.  It tasted terrible, nothing like I remembered, but since I drank some I just left it on as having finished the whole thing.  There will be some idiosyncrasies on there, but stuff happens.  It's about consistency more than anything.

Fast food options (if I'm able to have it that day):

* 4x4 animal style (no pickles, salt, or spread), protein style

That's basically it.  I can add another 3x3 if I'd like, but I generally don't right now since I'm cutting.

Snack options: Dried fruit with no sugar added from Trader Joe's.

**Future Goals:**  

* Improve delts
* Improve lats
* Improve traps
* 6 pack
* Bench 225
* Squat 315
* DL 405

We discussed my current routine and he kind of sniggered when I mentioned I've been doing Insanity/Asylum and then we hit the floor...

 The ten minute elliptical warm-up felt like a walk in the park. When we got into the actual workout, he kept asking me if I was tired after each set of moves/repetitions to which I just smiled and said ""Nope."" How about my discomfort level on a scale of 1-10? I was easily at a 2 the entire time. He was incredibly impressed with my form during the moves and at my flexibility at the ending stretch and I can honestly say that it is all thanks to Insanity. Had I done the same ""workout"" before Insanity I'm sure I would have been exhausted, sore, and crabby but this program WORKS. Do NOT give up! It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself! Even if your results don't end up being what you expected going into it, just know that you will be a stronger, healthier, more efficient person, even if the scale hardly moves or you don't have a six-pack.

It kicked my butt. Much more ""Insanity-esque""

***************

I was very excited to open the box this morning. To say the least.

The first exercise on the calendar is Alpha Cardio - Just finished it.
My thoughts: 

T25 a different beast than Insanity. While there is cardio and you do get your heart rate up (and sweat), it uses more of the ""muscle burner"" exercises, as opposed to the running/jumping exercises in Insanity. In some ways, that makes T25 harder. Plus, you don't get that adrenaline rush/second wind that you do with Insanity. I also miss the class atmosphere of the Insanity video.

Overall Alpha Cardio is an easier workout than any of the Insanity videos. But this is the alpha month, so I will be patient. I am going to go to Beta as soon as I try (at least once) all of the workouts in the alpha set.

Other things - 
The cool down is an additional 2 minutes AFTER the 25-minute workout.

It's not ""dance-y"". Looking at the ads, I had that fear, but I think that Shaun T can make anything look graceful.

Getting done in 25 minutes is really awesome. But you can do the same thing with Insanity month one if you cut out the first stretch (which I did. So sue me).

I am still sweating 20 minutes after finishing, and I live by the beach in SoCal - so it's only 69 degrees outside.

**addition - in Alpha Speed, Shaun T mixes the stretches in the cardio exercises. I really like that. No getting bogged down and bored in a long stretch session.

I have jogged for 30 minutes probably 25 times in the last 5 years and I have lifted weights probably 25 times in the last 5 years before fizzling out.

But not this time. Fitness test #1 was hard: I was so thirsty (yes, I drank water during) and dying for air throughout that I couldn't even do some of the exercises. I think this will subside with subsequent work-outs as my cardio improves. I did feel a little nausea after the first workout.

Switch Kicks: 85 kicks

Power Jacks: 40

Power Knees: 34 (did I miss something? Is this only one knee?)

Power Jumps: 04 &lt;--- I was totally shot after power knees, numbers decline

Globe Jumps: 03 &lt;--- bad form, will work on it

Suicide Jumps: 01 &lt;-- I had to do at least 1

Push-up: 04

Oblique: 13


I took my pre-workout pics so I'm ready to rock and roll through it. I feel really good right now about 1 hour after the workout. 

Does anybody think it is better for me to postpone starting this workout regiment and maybe start by jogging for 30 minutes a day? Or forget it and just dive in? I kind of want to just GO for it and do it at my own pace. 


Edit 1: It is amazing to see this support. Thanks so much for suggestions and motivation!

* I snuck in a few pure cardio videos on off days(I couldnt help myself) and sometimes double up videos with pure cardio at night. I have really enjoyed working out now, and feeling how much I am sweating and having my shirt and body be covered in sweat is very rewarding to me. I have never worked this hard in my life and I LOVE it!

I loved it. I felt great. I looked great. I received compliments from nearly everyone. I was a changed man.

Then I decided ""I'm just gonna take a week off"". The week off turned to 2 weeks off which turned to 3.5 months off. For the first month or so, my metabolism still kicked ass. I ate like shit. I became sedentary, yet I couldn't have gained a pound if I tried. Then it slowed, drastically. My skin became blubbery, my energy level plummeted, and I could see the weight creeping back into my face and my pants became restrictive.

My first round of insanity I started at 172 (5'9"") and ended at 160. I am now 168.

Being sick and tired of being sick and tired, I popped in insanity last night (plyo, as I'm skipping fit tests this go round), determined to get back to my fit level at the end of insanity.

In my first 63 day round, I never had a workout go as poorly as it did for me last night. It was depressing. I MAYBE finished 45% of the video, working out maybe 1-2 minutes consecutively at a time before focusing my attention on my vital signs as I felt like I was gonna die a few times.

I guess the point of this blurb is, upon reaching the end of Insanity, don't stop moving. Once you finish, don't let the fire in your muscles burn out. Eat healthy and control you meal portions, for it's pretty depressing to know that I voluntarily lived in hell for 63 days and now have nothing to show.

Cheers.

It's really nice to see so much improvement in the past 60+ days. Not sure what happened with the power knees, but I'm not too worried about it. I finish Reddit's Body Transformation Fitness Contest next week, so I will share the before and after pictures then. 

I started Insanity weighing 195 lbs, and ended at 179 lbs (I'm 6'5"", by the way.) I could have done the diet better toward the beginning, but I really saw the weight drop in the second month and am incredibly happy with the results. 

Thanks to Insanity, I successfully ran my first 5k in ~29 minutes. Obviously, I was incredibly sore, but for a person who never ran more than a mile pre-Insanity, I can't believe that I was fit enough to run one without proper training. I'm training to run an 8k in a few weeks.

It feels great to have ""VETERAN"" next to my name, finally. It's a lot of hard work, but don't give up! It's so worth it.

As per requested by a few familiar faces around here, I've gone ahead and updated the flair.  The flair's been a great motivation tool for myself and many others as I'm sure's been said just as much as ""JOSH!"" on this subreddit, so thank you for the suggestions on how to make it better and more usable.

The colors should be by week now rather than 10 days .

Each week's fore-and-background color represents your progress, from the blank slate of week one, to the glory that is the recovery week, to the foundation of week 6 and the intensity of your final fit test.  You'll notice that month one has paler colors, while month two has the more vibrant versions of those colors.  Similarly, month one has the black text while month two has the white text.  The rest week is a combination of the first and second halves by combining the dark text with the vibrant yellow.

As I said in that other thread, It was sort of simple; we'd take pictures every 10 days to keep track of our progress, and we'd have some (hopefully) unbiased people that would judge who they thought had made the most development in those 30 days. Winner gets $100 from the other.

We both have the pictures now, uploaded them to an image server, and we're ready for things to start! Here is how it's going to go:

* Pics will be in the comments, so upvote there. 
* Only upvotes will count. This is a way to prevent double-voting, such as people upvoting one pic and downvoting the other one. Saying 'I vote for ____' will not count either. 
* Judge on progress, not attraction to the person. This is not a 'Who would you rather' competition, but 'who kicked their ass the most' one.
* Feel free to leave comments in the pics!

I think I need to lay off the biking on Saturdays day to give my quads and knees a break and take a real workout break.  I've become a bit obsessed with working out lately, and any day I don't work out I feel horribly guilty.

Anyway, here are my results from Fit Test 1 to Fit Test 2:

Switch Kicks: 80 -&gt; 78 (correcting form made me slow down a bit)

Planks: 63 -&gt; 73

Just some background, I was 225 pounds in April 2012, now 154 lbs.  I lost the weight by eating only one ingredient food items (no packaged, pre-made, canned, bottled, wrapped, or processed foods of any kind), all low GI foods, no white starchy carbs, absolutely no carbs after lunch.  In August 2012 I hired a personal trainer and haven't turned back.  I love working out.  I've wanted to do Insanity since last summer, but I just wasn't at a point where I could do many of the moves with that much weight still on my body.  Now I can do most of the moves (I suck at push ups) and I can keep up with the people in the videos (except when Shaun T starts yelling IN, OUT, IN, OUT in plyometrics.  I'm getting better, but they still suck and I have to yell at myself to get back up and ""dig deeper"".)

I've just completed my first fit test and I'm SO demotivated..


I'm male, soon-to-be 26, 181 cm(5 feet 11 inches), 86 kg(189 pounds). Recently I gained some weight(from 81 -&gt; 85 kilos) and felt like I need to start moving my ass at last. I've considered my self out of shape, but capable of doing at least something.


So first Fit Test: 

* Switch Kicks	50 uglies (I can't get how to do it correctly, looking in the mirror - it's just so ugly, I can make kicks standalone - not too high though - but not coupled with jumping as they do in video) 

* Power Jacks	36

* Power Knees	40 (approximately, lost count)

* Power Jumps	12

* Globe Jumps	6

* Suicide Jumps	8

* Push-Up Jacks	13

* Low Plank Oblique	36


Not only I feel that I've totally fucked up the form, but after powerjumps I was totally devastated, i was only able to keep doing each of new exercises for like 20 seconds, after that I just felt down. I wasn't even able to complete cooldown routine - while they were doing stretching I was trying to decide if I have enough will power to crawl to trashcan or should I vomit on a carpet and clean it up later(I didn't vomit in the end). Couple of times while doing exercises I felt like I'm about to black out.


I've heard that the program is really hard, but I didn't expect that even Fit Test would kick my ass. I feel like my body is worthless piece of shit and I can't do it.


Please recommend me something.

Have any dietary tips for me?,15,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/18sqjg/hey_fellow_insanes_have_any_dietary_tips_for_me/,"I'm currently on day 47 of insanity and really digging it. The only slight problem I'm having is my diet. I've been attempting 5 meals a day each ranging around 300 ish calories. It's hard to count calories and eat efficiently as I'm a poor student living on my own. I'm posting this thread to get ideas of what people with the same lifestyle as me eat. 

I've lost roughly 13 pounds over insanity going from around 154 to 141 pounds (male, 5'7''). My biggest problem is that I feel like my slight belly fat is the most stubborn and doesn't want to go away. I might be impatient in seeing faster results but I want to be doing all I can to help my body lose the belly fat. I feel like I eat too many carbs but I may be wrong. I tried cutting out cereal recently but I feel like I need more options that are affordable and healthy. 
 


Here are some examples of what I eat:

For breakfast (usually 2 of these a day): 2 egg omelette with either veggies or a little salsa usually with one toast, Peanut butter and protein whey powder oatmeal, Peanut butter and banana sandwich (two toasts, peanut butter and either half or a whole banana), Cereal with skim or almond milk.

Post workout shake: Whey protein + ingredients changing depending on the day usually totalling around 300-350 calories. My favourite is Peanut butter, banana and low sugar chocolate milk with the whey scoop.

Other lunch/dinner (usually two of these in a day): Tuna+cottage cheese mix with veggies, Chicken breast with steamed veggies, salmon with steamed veggies, etc. Fried rice (soya sauce, chicken, veggies)


So if you guys could post examples of what you eat, or just any tips in general it would be appreciated!

- 12 to 18 baby carrots as a snack (10:00)

- small bowl of rice with chicken/beef/salmon (choose one) (this comes to roughly 250 calories)  + apple (12:30)

- yogurt cup and banana (~14:30)

- INSANITYYYYYYY (16:30 - whenever)

- Protein shake after workout (only on days which I do the weight training)

- bowl of salad mixed with a touch chicken (no later than 19:30) 

Also CONTRAST SHOWERS, SO GOOD AFTER INSANITY. 

Any more questions feel free to ask. I plan on taking a half-recovery week and then going to make a hybrid of month1/month2 exercises mixing it up. 

EDIT: I thought I should also add in I quit smoking a week before I started insanity, and I really think it has helped my lungs recover quicker. I know its not fully recovered but I feel like it is doing alot better than I would have been without insanity. Insanity was also sort of my addiction when I wanted to smoke I would just go press play, and I always kept it in my mind hey no your doing insanity your gonna die if you smoke (which I probably would die eventually due to smoking)... heres to almost 3 months without smoking :D.

Not gonna harp about how great it is, because honestly, if you're on this subreddit you know exactly what it feels like. I'm a pretty small guy (5""8 and 120lbs and 23 years old), but my reasoning to do this program was not to get buff or impress anyone. I did it because heart disease is somewhat prevalent in my family. So I took it upon myself to do something about it.

I started the program with 2 of my friends, though one dropped due to leaving to do a semester abroad right after month 1. Having a buddy in the same room as you is one of the best thing that I could have. They are there to give you support, and they're there to make you accountable. You're more likely to do the workout if you know your partner is counting on your to show up. Other than that, it's fun to swear at the TV/laptop together.

In terms of what I've noticed: In the 4th week, I was at a wedding with a bunch of my friends when we decided to hit the dancefloor. I was extremely surprised that I outlasted every single one of the guys. My stamina shot through the roof! I was still dancing when the rest of them were on the side panting from trying to keep up with me!  
Also, the multiple flights of stairs at work/subway stations are not a problem. And running to catch a bus is easier too ;)

Anyway, picture time:

Overall, taking test went from trying to take less breaks and being able to do a few more - to simply speed. In first two tests  if I had more time I would have just panted, in the last test- if I had more time - I would have completed more reps. It became a question of speed rather than ability. Some exercises, like power jumps I just had to make sure I did more reps than before, but switch kicks and knees - I will have to get faster to get more.

Now general information and reflections.

Background: M 39, 5'11, started about 180, now about 170 lbs.
I was never in really bad shape - I was in the military, then I always tried to stay active - swimming, running, some weights, but it was always sporadic, never followed any kind of diet. Lately I quit drinking soda, but that was about it. So while I was able to work out a couple of times a week, I would swim 1000 meters - it kept me from getting too fat, but once our two girls were born - I was not able to go to the gym any more. For a while I could work out during lunch, but since March, once I got a new job - that wasn't working either, so something had to be done.
 
Here is where Insanity came in. It had to be something I could do at home, it could not take more than an hour, and it could not include any equipment. Insanity was the only contestant and therefore the winner. So I got the videos, and a couple of weeks later I got myself to push ""play"" to see what would happen.
 
My first attempt at a Fit Test failed. I wasn't writing my results, and after 4 exercises I felt too sick to continue, so I simply gave up, and got back to it the next day. This time I was more prepared as to what to expect, and I completed the test and recorded the results. The main thing the test did was to hook me up. I realized the bad shape I was in, and I took it as a challenge. Overall, I did not miss one day of the program, anthough I did extend it - I split the days with Fit test in Month 2 into two days, and I split one day with Max Abs workout into two, mainly to shift my rest day to Saturday. First two days I did barefeet, but I quickly came to my senses and wore shoes since.
 
My diet started improving from day one - the body simply would not take any junk. I stopped eating carbs after lunch, and cut the amounts, I ate less at night, I almost completely quit drinking: I had a couple of beers on one occasion, a few shots on another, and one beer last week by myself. I quit smoking weed, which was huge: I used to smoke a little every other day once the kids went to bed, and this would bring in the munchies, so I had to chew on something or have a beer. So almost every day I would get fat right before bed - not a good diet for a 40 year old man. I looked into supplements, and I started with chocolate milk on the advice of r/insanityworkout. Later I consulted with a friend that used to be a personal trainer, and on his advice I started drinking ""Lean Muscle"" - protein drink I found at our discount grocery supermarket. I drink two per day. I should be drinking more water, but I am working on it. I always loved watermelon, and luckily now it is in season, so I eat alot of it. I don't eat anything like cakes, pastries, and I drastically cut down on bread and carbs all together.
 
Injuries: a couple of things that used to bother me before came back: knee pain, pulsing pain in lower back. One thing was new: it feels like I pulled a muscle somewhere in the ""oblique"" area, it hurts the most when I do pushups, but I just push through all fo it.
 
Results (other than Fit test improvements):
 
I lost some weight, but I look like I lost more - I actually had to shop for tighter pants (I already made peace with waist 34, but now I wear 33 comfortably, and I might go for 32 soon). People comment telling me that they see the difference. I definitely lost some of the muffin top, which was a big goal, more work there left to do. It doesn't look like I gained any muscle, but I am OK with that, at my age I don't want to get any heavier. I did see 169 lbs on ths scale once, something I haven't seen in 9 years. I would like to stay under 170 steady though.
 
The program pushed me to eat better, cut on the bad stuff (alcohol and weed).
 
The program gave me structure, and gave me better self-discipline. We all went through those days when you lay in bed and you go over all the reasons to skip the workout for today, but the pressure of the calendar, pride and I don't know what else kicked me out of the bed every morning. The flow of the video workout helps a lot too: when I used to work out in a gym the breaks would be longer, sometimes I didn't feel like this exersice or the other, or I would just cut the workout short - there is always another day, right? With the video - ""you are in it"", the whole time.
 
Having experience in the military - Insanity brought some memories from those day back. The desperation of pain, fatigue and soreness, the knowledge of the turture that is about to happen to me - flashbacks... But maybe being more mature - I took it better, I just went with it, and it got easier and better with time.
 
My advice and tips for others:
 
1. Examine your priorities, and put this program as close to the top as possible. Sometimes my wife got upset with me for exersicing rather than doing something with the family. I would be late to work because I would not skip or cut the workout. Realize that your health is more important in the long run, and a lot of other things are just excuses.
 
2. Stay with the program. Don't try to be a hero and do more, take your rest days. On the other hand - don't pause the tape, push as hard as you can, but if you can't - take a break, and don't get discouraged.
 
3. Invest in your nutrition. Don't starve yourself, but educate yourself on what you should be eating, and how you should be eating.
 
What's next? Well, Insanity Asylum has already arrived, as well as a set of adjustable dumbbells. I will take a week off, follow it with some time of recovery program - Max Sport training with Weights training and Max Abs, or a combination of sorts, then I do Asylum. Wish me luck.

I noticed my clothes were all way too big though, and pants/shorts I just recently bought needed to be replaced. So I figured I would keep pushing hard and break through the number plateau. 

That's when I found this subreddit, and decided to try insanity. After day three I went from a 288.9lbs weigh in to 283.4! That's an extreme shift, and I didn't expect the loss to stay at that speed, but I was so happy to get below 288.

 I was a little afraid of my 2nd fit test because I almost vomited on my first test and I had the impression that I would feel like shit after finishing the fit test. As you can see I improved and I didn't feel as tired as I thought I would be. That's why I decided to run an 8K in the afternoon to prepare for my 5K race in two weeks. Here is where I have to thank Shaun, I've tried almost everything to bring my 5K time under 25:41 and I just couldn't do it. Yesterday I was running pretty fast but I didn't feel tired all because of the insanity program. I finished my 5K in 24:38 which is a great improvement and I also managed to break my 8K record (41:32) though I ran into some friends and I talked to them for a minute, it could easily be a sub-40minute 8K but anyway. 

 I've also seen some small changes in my body which I'm pretty happy about. I can't wait for the next two weeks. I think that I will finally lose the fat that I couldn't get rid of all this time. 

 What do you think of a homemade milkshake after each workout?

Here's a quick rundown of my situation. I am a 26 year old male, 6'2"", weighing in at 293.6 lbs (I've weighted more, but have never reached the 300 lbs). I have very little balance.

I **need** to lose weight. Yes, I ***do*** want to look better, feel better, perform better (*ahem*), and give my significant other something she actually desires (she deserves it), but the most important thing about all this is that I am in dire need of improving my health. My doctor gave me a fair warning; either I do it or I'm ****ed for the rest of my life.

So... why not go insane? I've seen many people do this. I've visited this subreddit quite a few times. I had never gotten off my lazy ass to actually do it.

But you know what?  I CAN DO IT. 

So I did. I put in the first DVD, Fit Test 1. Here's my results, with comments. 

* **Switch Kicks:** 115 / I just know I did these wrong. I kicked really low and never tried kicking how I was supposed to. I did not follow form, so these don't really count.

* **Power Jacks:** 30 / These were hard. My form was ""almost good"". I'm sure I can improve it.

* **Power Knees:** 45 / I did these alright, I guess. Which means I will do better next time.

* **Power Jumps:** 16 / F*** everything about these. I shall kick their ass in the future.

* **Globe Jumps:** 4 / Hot. Damn. Almost fell doing these. These were good.

* **Suicide Jumps:** 6 / Stopped after doing just 2, but Shaun T's motivation kicked me up to high gear and I did 4 in the last 15 seconds. 

* **Push-up Jacks:** 3 / ... and damn proud of them. These were the hardest for me.

* **Low Plank Oblique:** 7 / 4 using the right leg, 3 with the left. My eyes opened real wide at the explanation of these. Even my buttocks hurt while doing them.

Comments: I ***LOVE*** his motivation. Shaun T's little tid-bits (""Keep pushin'"", ""I'm right there with you"", among others) really did the trick for me. 

As I cried during cool down, I felt the sweat dripping from me as if my head had hit the shower before the rest of the body. Is this normal Insanity stuff?

I would love feedback, so have at it. Good, bad, whatever. Just shoot.

As for my diet, I've kept it up for the most part very nicely. I am not really the type of person who 
munches on sweets on soda drinks on the first place. The biggest disadvantage so far I've found is to be a vegetarian. It would be easy to keep a high protein diet if I was an omnivore, but since I opted out of that years ago, I've recurred to protein drinks to make up for it. I don't really do the 5-meals a day every day. It gets a bit hard with the way I work and so, but I still try to do this as best as possible. Important things I do is not eat very late, and keep a balanced meal every time. I usually have an egg omelet after every workout, as well as my whey protein shake.

Additionally, for people who are trying to lose weight, I will just say: KEEP AT IT. This workout has put me in SO much shape ever since I started losing weight. For comparison, here is a pic with my personal year-long weight loss program.

EDIT: I didn't start working on my weight until July 2011, but I didn't change that much in those 7 months from when the pic was taken to when I started.

EDIT2: The first picture.... I'm not happy with it. The next one shows more of a progression because of a bet I have with a friend of mine. They might be better at showing progress.

I didn't think it was too bad, but I took it easy and decided to ice it, not do Day 10, and take some recovery time until I was 100% again. I was off it for about 7 days, with no change.

I finally got an appointment with my podiatrist this past Wednesday. Like I thought, it was an overuse injury - since I was coming from a sedentary lifestyle to Insanity, my tendon wasn't ready for it. I was asking too much of my body. Glad I stopped and listened, instead of pushing it more. I'm too damn young to ruin my Achilles!

In any case, got a new regimen of stretches to do to help strengthen my Achilles tendons, a modified Insanity workout regimen (two days on, one day off, 15-20 minutes of each until the tendons are up to more), and I need to buy new shoes. Again. Apparently my Nike crosstrainers aren't doing my feet any favors.

Just wanted to put all this out there for any other newbies or just-getting-started folks - and depending on your level of fitness, you may want to give yourself an extra rest day to recover. I know, it's anathema to the program's timeline, but I'm pretty sure Shaun T. wants you to use Insanity to get a better body - not to ruin it.",,False,self,t5_2ua71,1373070937.0,,2,True,t3_1hppyh,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1hppyh/to_all_newbies_take_care_of_your_body_when_youre/,
1372828442.0,10,self.insanityworkout,1hjspg,[PROGRESS] Fit Test 2 Results -- what I've done and what I hope to do.,12,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1hjspg/progress_fit_test_2_results_what_ive_done_and/,"Hey guys &amp; gals,

I'm not usually one for body pics but I'm absolutely thrilled by my results after the first two weeks of Insanity. [This](http://i.imgur.com/iLCutiqh.jpg) is me after the second Fit Test (2 weeks into the program). Unfortunately I don't have a picture from when I started, which I'm totally kicking myself for now since the results were **way more encouraging than expected**. Instead, [here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/xLsVmxB.jpg) from 3 years ago when I was at my worst -- it was the summer before my junior year of college and I weighed in around 220 pounds. That's right about when it hit me how overweight I had gotten.

Over the course of the next 6 months I lost about 40 of those pounds thanks to an extreme readjustment of my eating habits and semi-regular exercise. Then I increased the frequency of my workouts steadily until I was doing either cardio or lifting 6 days a week, but I still had lingering stomach fat that just wouldn't go away.

**My ""strategy,"" briefly:**

I've followed the Insanity nutrition plan loosely, doing some guesswork in place of obsessive portion control, and allowing for treats once in a while (a couple beers one day, a slice of pizza another).

I also don't follow the workout plan exactly because I play Ultimate Frisbee 3 days a week. Over these 2 weeks I've taken my rest days by necessity more than on schedule, and a couple days I skipped an Insanity workout for frisbee and then made up for it by doing 2 workouts on a day off. I've managed to keep up with the program without totally killing myself, but I have been beaten-up and sleeping like a baby basically every night (feels great!).

Lastly, I haven't used Shakeology or the Recovery Formula because I can't afford them. In place of the RF I've just been drinking chocolate milk.

**Fit Test Improvement:**

Exercise|Fit Test 1|Fit Test 2
:-----|:-----|:-----
Switch Kicks|55|95
Power Squat|36|55
Power Knees|60|91
Power Jumps|30|38
Globe Jumps|6|9
Suicide Jumps|16|11
Push-Up Jacks|23|30
Low Plank Ob.|42|52

**What I'm happiest about:**

As I mentioned already, during the last few years I developed an intense and enduring love of Ultimate Frisbee (and it has since become my most beloved diversion and my chief source of motivation). After I lost most of my weight and became much more active, I was surprised to find I had embarrassingly low stamina. I was getting tired out before guys who, by their appearance, had **no** business outlasting me on the field, and I had no idea why.

Then on a whim I said *fuck it* and decided to try Insanity, because the 10-15 miles of running a week and 3-4 days of lifting just wasn't doing it for me. **That's** when I discovered I'd been doing it all wrong.

My progress on the field over the last two weeks has been shocking. I went from having the least stamina of all the guys on my team to suddenly having the most. I've been outrunning, out jumping, outlasting *everyone* and it feels amazing. I've also added 2"" to my vertical (over the last month, but I suspect *most* of that was in the last 2 weeks), which has made a huge difference in my game. 

I've improved so much I feel like I'm ready to try out for a club team, and just the fact that that's a real possibility makes me so damn happy I can barely contain it. 

To anyone who is hesitant to start or is feeling defeated, keep going because it's totally worth it!

So I started Insanity yesterday and made it 15 whole minutes without dying. I really like it and am going to continue. Maybe I can make it to 25 today. The question I am asking is about the belly over hang or the front butt or the ""Mother's Apron"". I am 5' 9"" female and I weigh about 182. I carry almost all my weight in my stomach. At my heaviest I was 270 and probably higher because I never stepped on a scale unless I had too.

 I have been 180 for about 2 years now and I still have that dreaded belly overhang.Here is one of the before pics I took NSFW or NSFL really http://i.imgur.com/Iphiqyv.jpg You might not be able to see it but the belly keeps going down. If I didn't have it I would be able to fit into much smaller pants. 

I have never had children so it is natural. It is not pretty looking. I know I am going to have loose skin but I just wanted to see other people's results. I am going to continue regardless of what I look like in the end. I watched my father die at 44 and my mother die at 55, both from complications of diabetes and lifestyle choices. When the funeral director says they are going to have to order a special casket for your mother because she can't fit into a normal size one, it really drives the ""I am going to end up like this, too"" I was already feeling, home. 

So if any of you guys and girls (if any) have dealt with this problem, what were your results? I am curious. You can't go from almost 300 lbs to a beach body most of the time. I accept that.

After a bunch of good Inspirational comments, especially one about being able to play with my daughter and another about dying without knowing what our bodies are capable of, I decided to stop with the excuses and go for it.  I started Insanity at 190lbs (I am 5'7''), and ended at 160lbs with some of my abs showing (I will post pictures in another post).  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here for keeping me cheered up and excited about the workout.  I didn't post many things, but I found it inspirational to look through your success stories as well as the not-so-successful for the comments. Now, I will be doing an Insanity/p90x hybrid and see how things go after that.  Again, I will post my fit tests and pictures later, gotta get back to work.

My name is Seb, and I've been working on a new banner and upvote/downvote buttons that should be implemented very soon!

Before I summarize my tenure with Shaun T, I'd like you guys to check out the new sidebar links I've added to my personal fitness group Motivate Me Fitness!

We offer an accountability group that anyone is free to join [Here!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/364812853588872/)
I encourage all members who want motivation and accountability to go join! We're a very friendly very active community of people helping one another. Keep in mind that not everyone in the group is doing Insanity, these are people doing different workouts and different diets, so keep your mind open!

Also, anyone thinking of purchasing Insanity, you'll notice I've added a link in the sidebar! This is my affiliate link. I am a beachbody coach, so I figure anyone who wants to purchase it, will get thrown in with some random coach that BB assigns you. Instead you can purchase through me, someone who has already done Insanity, and be able to ask me any questions and let me make you recommendations! If you have any more questions you can message me, or email me at phillips.sebastian@gmail.com

**Now to the good part!**

I started Insanity in late may at 212 pounds, not of my own accord, but a friend wanted to workout with me. Well she fell off not too long after and I kept pushing through, dieting, working out every day and the results became addicting. I was losing weight and toning up more than I ever had been in my life. I am FINALLY at a healthy BMI for the first time in my entire life and it feel incredible. It was tough, I don't think anyone will argue that. But if you're thinking about Insanity **DO IT!!!** Stop thinking about what if, or if you can commit, buy it, and do it! You owe it to yourself to try. Unless you have an injury or health condition to prevent you from trying it, just do it, do it, do it. I GUARANTEE, that in 2 months, you'll be in this subreddit typing up the same thing I'm typing now, having your before and after pictures posted up for the world to see. Don't sell yourself short guys. It's time to stop making excuses and go for it. Month 2 was one of the hardest challenges I have ever had to over come. Yes I slipped up a few times, yes there were points I did the minimum, but I made it. I'm going to start round 2 next week to really feel accomplished and hit month 2 next time full force! I'll be editing later with my fit test results and a pic of my calendar! So come on guys, do this for yourself, you won't regret it. I promise, promise, promise! If you have ANY questions please **message me!!!** I'll talk to you about anything and everything! Hope you guys choose to go insane!

1341475761.0,12,self.insanityworkout,w2hrn,"I see a lot of people here starting out, just thought I would give some insight on the first month.",13,1,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/w2hrn/i_see_a_lot_of_people_here_starting_out_just/,"I'd like to start out by saying Insanity is one of the best workouts you can pick up if you really want to get in shape. But you need just that, to REALLY want to get fit, don't second guess your decision and get amped for every workout. It will definitely be the hardest the first week, getting used to all the workouts, especially if you were pretty inactive before. I just want to run through a few things people might want to hear about.

**Workouts:**
Starting the fitness test is definitely overwhelming the first time, but remember this is your first day, you don't want to over do it. Every two weeks you get to do it again and beat your previous tests. The cardio circuit was probably the hardest workout for me personally (the month 2 max circuit completely whips my ass) but do as much as you can the first week and just rest, don't pause the DVD, just rest. As for days off, I see a lot of people asking about spreading out the first week workouts, in my opinion just stick it out and give your best effort each day and move on. You can always repeat the workout after 60 days, but just keep pushing and do what you can. It's not about completion, it's about the effort you put forward everyday.

**Food:**
I honestly didn't really follow the nutrition guide the whole time, but I tried every style under the sun. At first I was eating too much of what I *thought* was good, like subway and sandwiches, but my portion were way too big and I was eating way to many carbs and too much sodium. So I cut back... a lot and was only eating once a day, which worked for about 5 days, at which point I began to plateau because my body wasn't metabolizing. So finally I started doing 5 smalls meals a day, SMALL meals, SMALL, learn your portion size, Not 2 pieces of chicken, not 1, about half of a chicken breast is the correct portion, about 3 oz. and once you get used to eating small meals often, you wont be hungry enough to eat a ton of food. Don't let yourself get over hungry, eat often enough to keep your stomach happy. There's a couple really good recipes in the guide, and just because you're eating healthy doesn't mean you have to eat nasty.

**DON'T**

* Drink Soda
* Eat a Lot of Sugar
* Eat carbs before you go to bed
* Snack on empty calories
* Get Overly Hungry

**Supplements**
I wouldn't really suggest supplements as they're really not needed but Here's what I take.

[Censor Body Fat Burning Pills](http://www.dietspotlight.com/censor-review/) : Not amazing, wouldn't really recommend them, definitely something you can do without. 

[C4 Extreme Pre-Workout](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/cellucor/c4-extreme.html): Not for everyone, but it really gives me the energy to push through the workouts, but at $40 a canister, it's kind of pricey. It's recommended to take 2 scoops prior to a work out, but I take one. Mine has lasted around 45 days, if I had to guess, 2 scoops would only last 3 weeks. So think before going with a pre-workout.

[Whey Protein](http://www.bodyfortress.com/SUPER-ADVANCED-WHEY-PROTEIN-VANILLA): Simple, fairly cheap, and effective, imo it's almost a necessity to a good workout if you want to build muscle. Drink after every workout.

**Other Helpful Items**

* Yoga Mat (For those recovery days, especially if you have a hard wood floor)
* Slimming Belt (Really gets the sweat going and helps shed that tummy and love handles)
* [GNC Blender Bottle](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3028914) Omg yes, just get one, god get one, great if you dont want to use a blender for protein, but still want your, pre-workout and protein to be smooth and not gritty.
* A *good* pair of workout shoes, light weight. (Nike, Puma, Etc.) Really keeps your feet in good shape and minimizes chance for injury. **DO NOT WORK OUT BAREFOOT.** Just don't.

That's about it for me. Just don't give up, you have to really want it and be ready to commit to an intense workout for 60 days if you really want the body you've been chasing. As long as you give it your all everyday, you'll just keep getting better. **Don't make excuses!!!** The only person you're hurting when you make excuses about your workout is yourself. Don't do it, you deserve to be healthy, don't sell yourself short! You can do it! Let's get this subreddit growing so we can have an awesome supportive community! Dig Deeper and go for it!

1340003854.0,11,self.insanityworkout,v7rkn,My Insanity story.  Hopefully will be motivating a few of you [Warning: Wall of text],13,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/v7rkn/my_insanity_story_hopefully_will_be_motivating_a/,"Rewind a year to when I first became interested in Insanity.  I was a 19, chubby gamer kid who just finished his first year as a physics major in college.  I had a lot of interest, mostly sparked from college, to get in shape.  I swam before college a bit, was pretty outdoorsy because I came from a small mountain town, but was terrible at cardio and strength.  I also (and still do) ate terribly.

So I decided to get Insanity.  Starting with the fitness test:  It made me light headed.  I had to stop the video in between tests.  looking at my old results of that firs test:  I was only able to do 10 pushups (not pushup jacks lol), 40 power jacks, 10 suicide jumps, 25 low plank obliques, etc... all with a good 5 minute break between each.  

Regardless I continued.  Pushing through day to day.  I would take hefty breaks between workouts, or skip various sets all together.  The stretches always felt AMAZING and I always felt great after I finished.  Come to the second fitness test I almost DOUBLE most of my numbers. 18 pushup jacks! 45 low plank obliques!  And I didn't die after each workout! nor did I feel light headed.  I was super happy with these results, especially considering I didn't change my eating habits much and it had only been 2 freakin weeks of this.  I don't think my weight changed much, although considering I gained so much strength I must have put on muscle and dropped weight.

I always loved Shawn's motivation, it pushed me to do my best with each workout and hes always reminding me to keep my form.  As I progressed through the workouts I was able to, more and more, keep my abs tight through the workouts, and do more of the workouts.  I also had to take less and less breaks as I progressed.  The stretches always felt great, and each time I would get better and deeper on each stretch.

Finally, I had to stop at workout 41.  I started college again, because I started insanity late in the summer.  Also the second month of workouts got considerably harder, so I had to take longer breaks and rest for a day or two here and there. Despite stopping at 41, insanity did amazing things for me.

Insanity taught me tons about my body, I now know how to stretch pretty much every muscle in my body, or can at least find a way to stretch it.  It also taught me a wonderful stretching routine.  Because Shawn does the same stretch after each video I came to memorize it.  Now when I go out running, to the gym, do some abs, whatever, I do that stretch.

Because of insanity I became more motivated to get in better shape.  In my second year of college I joined the Triathlon club.  Though Insanity didn't prepare me much for the triathlons specifically, it TRIPLED my fitness and allowed me the opportunity to train to do triathlons.  Now, I have done 2 sprint triathlons, and plan to do more sprints and an Olympic next year.  I went from being able to hardly run a mile on a flat treadmill, to comfortably running 3 miles up and down hills.

Also insanity made me very flexible.  Before insanity, when doing a hamstring stretch with both legs straight and under my hips reaching down, I could hardly touch the top of my ankle (when warmed up), now after insanity (and triathlon granted) I can ... allow me to stand up and try it... touch my fists to the ground in the same stretch, not warmed up.

So now that my second year has ended I plan to do insanity again form the start (meaning my flair is a bit of a lie).  Hopefully, now that I am quite a bit more fit, I can finish it and complete each exercise.  And finally be one of the people that goes from a chubby 210lb dude down to a 180lb dude with some tone.

So anyone who is interested in insanity GET THAT SHIT.  It is so worth it.  Take a picture of yourself to get an idea of your fitness before and after.  Follow his guide, take breaks when needed, but, as Shawn would say ""DIG DEEPER!""  Keep the videos after you finish the workout and go back to them.  If you want some cardio do pure cardio, if you want some abs do cardio abs, if you just want a stretch skip to the stretch part.  They are a great resource.

Shawn is a great instructor and knows what he's talking about.  And despite him not being in the room with you, he does a good job of making it feel like that.  You will sweat.  You will have to stop the video, you will be sore.  But you will love yourself about an hour after each and every workout.

Like everyone says, that faded and I was cruising through my second week.  Then, between traveling for work, a wedding, and a crazy few days, I missed about a week and a half of workouts.  I was nervous about restarting, thinking I would be really out of shape and I would be back at square one - I was super happy to find this wasn't the case.  I restarted Week 2 last night and felt great, I did more of the workout than I thought I would and have very little soreness today.

Basically, even if you fall off for a week or so just jump back in where you were!  I'm definitely in better shape after a 1.5 week layoff than I was before I started in the first place.

I had MFP automatically recalculate nutritional goals based on changes that have happened since I first signed up with MFP - namely, I've lost 25 lbs and I've started Insanity.  However, after limiting my carbs to ~50 per day for initial weight loss and lowering my caloric intake to 1250, this seems high :/

http://i.imgur.com/V5dbcLW.jpg

The protein I can understand, but the fat/carbs/calorie numbers blew my mind.  For reference, I'm currently at 246 lbs and 5'6"".  Is a lower carb diet really unsustainable when doing vigorous workouts?  I know /r/keto might disagree but I'm asking because you guys are familiar with Insanity and I really and truly have no idea.

I decided to try INSANITY as a few of my housemates are currently undertaking the program. I am also visiting the gym regularly and running outdoors. After the fit test I did yesterday, I ache and am so sore I can barely walk straight. Perhaps I need to learn some better stretching techniques? Should I push on and complete the daily workouts, or is rest advisable? I know I should expect a fair amount of pain, as I am very out of shape. Thanks in advance for your advice!


[EDIT] - Thank-you, but perhaps I should clarify a few things. I have been working out at my local gym at least once a week since last October - each session more than an hour. I have been working on improving my running stamina mainly, but also use some weights to get a more 'all over' body workout. This last week I have started a calorie controlled diet (1400 a day, when calculations suggest i'd need 1850 to stay at my current weight), as well as this I have been trying to run every day, not just once or twice a week. This is why I think i'm having a problem with INSANITY. It is completely different from what I am used to + I am calorie controlling + running. Is this too much? Or push through the initial pain and aches?

Fit Test #2 217lbs 28% BF: http://i.imgur.com/Tc1Qqzh.jpg


I'm 23 years old 5'9'' and currently 217lbs. I started exercising 2/17/13 when I was a little over 230lbs doing C25K. A little background on me, I always used to be pretty fit, 3 sport athlete growing up (football,soccer,lacrosse), so I was usually in the 165-180lb range. I played a little lacrosse my freshman year in college. The summer after freshman year I was playing on several different summer league soccer teams and broke my ankle pretty badly. I was told I'd be in a cast for 2 months but it was a pretty bad break and 2 months turned into 4 1/2 months followed by 1 to 2 months in a walking boot.

In that time my weight went up to 200lbs. Lost my place on the team because I was out of shape and it hurt my ankle to run. Got depressed but tried to hide it for like 3 years while I ballooned up to 230lbs. Was looking at myself in the mirror a couple weeks before my 23rd birthday and hated what I saw and decided to do something about it.

I started C25K and finished it between 2/17 and 3/21. But it kind of still hurt my ankle to run so I decided to try Insanity. Best decision I've made in a long time. I could barely do Fit Test#1 and was really nervous for what was to come but I have to say I've been really happy the last two weeks and I always feel like I have accomplished something after I finish my days workout.

Week 1, I don't remember which video it was but I could only do 2/3 of either the Plyometric Cardio or Pure Cardio video. Week 2 I did the whole video and was pretty proud of myself. I was surprised at how much my #'s improved from Test 1 to 2. Although I'm not too happy with how many Power/Globe/Suicide Jumps I did but my quads and hamstrings have been killing me the last 2 weeks but the burn feels good.

I look at myself in the mirror now and I can tell my face looks different. It's as if all the weight I lost came from my face. My face is back to an 0 shape instead of an O shape. I can't really tell if my body looks different but I wore some shorts this week that haven't fit me in a long time so I guess that's progress.

I've been pretty sore this week, but am already feeling great mentally and this subreddit has been great motivation! As a newbie to this type of exercise, I've had a few concerns:

1. I've been taking way more breaks than are built into the workout. It sounds like this is typical and encouraged, but any other advice on how to make sure that I hold myself accountable and ""dig deeper"" without injuring myself?
2. I'm not flexible AT ALL. As in, I don't know that I've ever been able to touch my toes. I can't do all of the stretches and I'm unsure that I'm stretching all of the right muscles when I modify them. Would you recommend doing my own stretching routine until I build up my flexibility?

I, like a few others, just started the insanity workout that I borrowed from my brother.  First of all, this is the third attempt at starting this workout.  Previous times I only lasted a couple of days and gave up.  This time I want to do it all the way.

I am 22 year old, 5'10"" and 200.9 pounds (As of this morning).  Little background for myself is that I am currently in school for my BS in Mechanical Engineering and I workout about zero times a week.  This made the fit test that much more excruciating!  I have been sticking to a high protein diet as best as I can.  Lots of chicken and fish and keeping the carbs down (college kids around the world know how hard this can be).  I used to play tennis in high school and then got lazy in college.  It was good for me because it is a very cardio intense sport and is a big lower body workout.  My lower body seems to accumulate most of my extra weight.  I've lived with thunder thighs and cankles for quite some time and quite frankly I'm self conscious as hell about it because I feel it makes my body look out of proportion.  Regardless, I'm looking to change all of that now.  I have discovered before that insanity is an extreme lower body workout.

My results for the Fit Test:

* **Switch Kicks** - 90
* **Power Jacks** - 45
* **Power Knees** - 56
* **Power jumps** - 20
* **Globe Jumps** - 4
* **Suicide jumps** - 4
* **Push up jacks** - 10
* **Low Plank Oblique** - 25

Current College Diet:  Chicken, Eggs, Fish, Yogurt, Chipotle (lol), Turkey Sammiches, Tuna Sammiches... I'm lacking veggies though.

**TL;DR:**  Day 1 Sucked!  About an hour later I felt alright though.

I currently go to the gym twice a day, 6 days a week, weights in the morning and cardio in the evening.  I'm looking to stop the evening cardio sessions and replace them with an insanity session, any thoughts on that would be appreciated.

Every time I was getting ready to drop, he invariably said something that made me push myself to finish. And I've never been happier that I did.
[Here are my pics.](http://i.imgur.com/RaXG4.jpg) Sorry they're not the greatest. I wish when I started I would have created a standard for them.

Now I'm going to be taking a week off to recuperate. Maybe do some light jogging just to keep some type of activity going during this week off.

**Backstory:** So I had to take a break from Insanity three weeks ago. I had a friend visit me and stay at my place for over a week, and working out with her around was basically impossible. We'd go to sleep late, and by the time I was up, I needed to be at work already, only to come back to her wanting to do something. I felt guilty enough to leave her alone for all of the time I was gone, and then to have work out for over an hour (as well as taking a shower and getting dressed again afterwards) while she just waited...


The point is, I didn't do Insanity for a week and half because of this. I was already on Day 44, and so I thought 'meh. Maybe I can just pick it right up after she's gone!'


**Working-out after the break:** I tried to do Max Interval Plyo (Day 45), and I learned what it's like for your body to just go 'Nope!'. I already had a bad feeling of what was going to happen during the warm-up, since I was feeling exhausted by the end of it. Halfway through the first interval I was already taking several rests (compared to the last time I had done this), and by by the end of it, I had absolutely NO energy left. When I saw that the clock still had 26 minutes left, I just went 'This isn't happening'.


This SUCKED. Mainly, because I didn't know what to do. I was obviously not going to restart the whole 'Insanity' program, but I didn't want to just force myself through what was left, mainly because I was doing worse than during my first day of month 2 (Day 36).

**Solution:** I created my own 'come-back week' to try to get right back on track with these workouts. This is what I did:


* Monday (Day 1): Core Cardio and Balance
* Tuesday (Day 2): Rest (I would've done another CC&amp;B, but I had some time issues this day and couldn't fit a workout into my schedule)
* Wednesday (Day 3): Core Cardio and Balance
* Thursday (Day 4): Core Cardio and Balance (I noticed that I did better this time than I had on Day 34, making me confident about jumping into a workout, but not one from month 2 just yet)
* Friday (Day 5): Pure Cardio &amp; Cardio Abs
* Saturday (Day 6): Max Recovery
* Sunday (Day 7): Rest

**Coming back to it:** Since I was able to restart this on a Monday, I went for a 4-mile run. I WOULD'VE done Day 43 here (Max Cardio Conditioning), but I had already driven 8 hours that day (getting back from my family's house), and by the time I came back to my apt, it was 11 PM and my roommates had already gone to sleep. 

I ran MUCH better this day than I ever had (I was able to jog 3 miles in 30 minutes without stopping), and this gave me the confidence to jump right back to it.

And so I did. Day 44, which was Max Interval Circuit, ended up just as great as the last time I had done it (if not slightly better). I think what I did helped me out tremendously, but what exactly did I do?

**Tips:**

* *Recover at least one day per every 2 days you didn't work out.* For example, if you weren't able to work out for 6 days, repeat the last 3-4 workouts you had done previously. If you were already on month 2, I suggest at least the first one be a 'Core Cardio &amp; Balance'.
* *Have one of the workouts be 'Pure Cardio'.* This is just an amazing workout because it will still kick your butt even if you are in Month 2. Throw in 'Cardio Abs' if you had gotten done it too already. If you were almost done with the program, you can substitute this with 'Max Cardio Conditioning'.
* *If you had more than 3 'come-back' days, have one of them be a 'Recovery' workout.* These recoveries are VERY helpful to help your body recuperate the flexibility you might have lost, as well as help up the soreness. Not working out for about a week might have you feel sore again. 
* *GET BACK TO IT.* This is the most important thing. Don't lose hope just because your come-back week isn't great. Your body already knows the way to get back *there*, but it is up to YOU to get it right back on track.

Any other tips from people who had to take breaks would be helpful. Inconveniences happen, but you shouldn't lose the willpower.",,False,self,t5_2ua71,1345824889.0,,6-2,True,t3_yrcxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/yrcxt/tips_on_how_to_recover_from_a_break/,

These are the little things I've noticed since I started:

* After doing the first workout, I collapsed on the floor in my own sweat puddle and didn't move for about 15 minutes. After today's workout, I just sat on the floor for a minute or two and I was pretty much back to a normal heart rate.

* I'm a constant clock watcher. Whenever I see the clear part of the timeline appear on the right side of the screen, I get really excited because I know a rest break is coming.

* The rest break is the fastest 30 seconds of my life.

* I drink a recovery formula after every workout (I'm using Dark Matter). The first time I drank it, I could barely tolerate it. Now I freaking crave the stuff.

* I haven't lost any weight, but now there is muscle where there once was fat (I have the typical programmer skinny-fat body type). If I can maintain my weight but lose a few more percentage points of body fat by the end of Insanity, I would be ecstatic.

* Since I live in Texas and this is the middle of summer, I get about one minute of cold water out of the shower before it turns crazy hot. That minute is so wonderful after my workout.

* I always ask myself which workout I dislike more: Pure Cardio or Plyo Circuit. The answer is: whichever one I just finished. After Pure Cardio, I always say ""That was harder than Plyo"". After Plyo I say, ""That was harder than Pure Cardio"".

So, I'm 5'1"", 106-111 lbs (it fluctuates so often, but usually I'm around the 108 range) and before Insanity, I didn't think myself particularly athletic at all. I'd swim every now and then I'm a pretty fair Ultimate player but I'd always get winded after sprinting down the field once (I hate running). After the work out, though I've seen a definite improvement in my endurance, stamina, strength and I'm pretty happy about that. I just joined a mountaineering and skin diving club and to be able to be a full member one has to complete some long runs and endurance swims and the like and I feel like Insanity has helped me ready for that!

Anyway, here are my Fit Test results: 

Switch Kicks: 34-&gt;48-&gt;62-&gt;55-&gt;**78**
Power Squats: 43-&gt;54-&gt;57-&gt;52-&gt;**68**
Power Knees: 70-&gt;90-&gt;115-&gt;90-&gt;**120**
Power Jumps: 30-&gt;36-&gt;40-&gt;45-&gt;**54**
Globe Jumps: 8-&gt;10-&gt;12-&gt;11-&gt;**13**
Suicide Jumps: 14-&gt;18-&gt;14-&gt;18-&gt;**21**
Push-Up Jacks: 19-&gt;22-&gt;31-&gt;29-&gt;**36**
Low Plank Oblique: 21-&gt;30-&gt;35-&gt;33-&gt;**42**

So uh final thoughts? While I don't think I lost much weight (I've always been pretty thin), I definitely gained more muscle tone--I think it could have helped more if I followed the diet. I don't think I've ever pushed myself in any workout as I have with Insanity so completing in spite of all the stress I've gotten recently thanks to academics, it feels amazing. Question is...what now?

I guess that's all for now. Keep pushing, people. Woo!

But at least I know that my upper body strength has definitely improved because my push-up jacks, holy wow!

How necessary is it to do all 6 days of the recovery week?  I ask for two reasons:

1. I don't want to do the same video 6 days in a row.  (Whiny but true!)

2. I had to take a lot of breaks in Month 1 because of different traveling I had to do.  So it ended up taking me 5 weeks to do the first 4 weeks of Insanity, basically two days off instead of one, or sometimes doing a half a week with a random day off in the middle.  

So, because of reason 2 I think I've had more ""recovery"" from the workouts because I've had more days off.  So should I do the whole Recovery week?

My next question is regarding Month 2.  I've heard a lot about how challenging Month 2 is compared to Month 1.  Because of my ""spaced out"" Month 1, I'm wondering if I should redo Month 1, or if I should just power ahead into Month 2.  
Really the biggest problem I have with Insanity is that I can't do pushups and most of the pushup variations, and I've heard that Month 2 has a lot more pushups so I'm worried that I may not be ready for it for that reason.  Usually I do modified pushups during the level 1/2 drills.

TL;DR: Is it necessary to do all of recovery week?

I wanted to get back into shape, but I knew I wasn’t fit enough to jump into Insanity right away. Another expensive doctor visit due to injury was the last thing I needed. So, I made a schedule and gradually worked my way up to Insanity.

My weight from day 1 to end 204lb - 183lb


My reasons for doing this work is when I was in highschool about 5-6 years ago I was very fit and athletic. College rolled in and I got lazy and got out of shape and even got a belly. So I always have been trying to do it but I finally muster enough willpower to stick with this program and I have to say I love it.  The feeling I get during and after the workout just feels great. It reminded me of the workouts I used to do. I love these kind of high intensity workouts and fit me very well. 


As to diet, I do not follow exactly the programs recommendation but I have cut off Soda and fast food completely.  Trying to eat healthy and watch out for my calorie intake. 


My sample daily meal would be like this

Breakfast: Toast with Orange juice

Lunch: Greek Yogurt and fruits

Dinner: Beef/Salmon with some white rice (im Asian I cant help it) and lots of vegetables.

Late Snack: Greek Yogurt and raw celery/kale (without dressing its still good)


I basically lost all my belly and I have more energy than ever before. My goal now is to get into even better shape (maybe sixpack in teh near future?) My plan currently is I am doing month 2 over again and this time I add cardio abs to every workout and I replace my Thursday stretch with Insane abs. Sunday is still a rest day. 


Anyways I want to thank you for this subreddit because knowing there are people like me and doing this and you guys have been very helpful.

TLDR: Insanity is great and this subreddit is really helpful

A little background on myself, I used to do some boxing back when I was 17/18 but I had to give it up due to school and work not allowing time for it. I'm now 20 and have class 5 days a week for 8 hours a day and I generally neglected my fitness and put on a few pounds. Then I found insanity and now that I've done 2 weeks of it I'm just generally feeling so much better about myself, I'm following a calorie deficit diet and already am seeing results and clothes feeling more loose.

Fit Test results and weight loss. ,12,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/yxc22/completed_round_one_of_insanity_last_night_fit/,"So, a little background on me: I am a 25 year old male. I have always considered myself to be in okay shape (weekend warrior, occasional gym rat, former college swimmer). A year ago, after getting too comfortable with myself, a relationship, and a stressful job, I blew up. I went from 5'10 195lbs to 252.8lbs. Needless to say, I still kept my weekend warrior ways but I felt slow and super unhealthy. So I started  Insanity after a health scare from my doctor. I also combined it with DDP Yoga which is amazing! Last night, I completed my first round of Insanity. 

Fit test results 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5:
Switch kicks: 32 - 54 - 70 - 75 - 84
Power jacks: 29 - 36 - 44 - 51 - 58
Power knee: 52 - 72 - 84 - 97 - 106
Power jumps: 15 - 24 - 30 - 38 - 45
Globe jumps (rotations): 5 - 7 - 9 - 10 - 11
Suicide jumps: 10 - 12 - 14 - 15 - 18
Jack push-ups: 9 - 16 - 20 - 24 - 29
Obliques: 24 - 42 - 52 - 62 - 70 

Towards the end, I became very tired, motivation decreased, and I hated the videos and hearing Shaun T. But I pushed through. **Today, I weighed in at 226.9lbs. A total loss of 25.9lbs in 60 days!**

As for diet and what not, I didn't go all out on it this time around. I just eliminated fried foods, sweets, and sodas/juices. I tried to control my portions consciously and my appetite has reduced and based itself around 1300-1600 calories a day. I do recommend a few products I have been taking: 

1) **Orgain Protein Meal Replacements** - The best tasting and most complete Protein shake I have found out there (at least for what I want). Available at Whole Foods. I used it routinely as a meal replacement. 
2) **Vega Sport Recover Accelerator** - all organic/natural recovery formula that tastes great. It has the right Carb : Protein ratio, adds some other helpful things like glucosamine, electrolytes. Great overall, I didn't feel sore one day! (http://vegasport.com/en/recover/recovery-accelerator) You can buy it at any Whole Foods. 
3) **Good Belly Probiotic Drink** - I have always had stomach issues. While eating health helped settle them down, this helped tremendously. It helps your immune system and makes you feel really balanced. 
4) **Green Vibrance** - More probiotics and great nutrients from veggies and fruits to supplement your body. 
5) **Alive! Multi-Vitamin** - I have trouble finding time, patience, need to eat a lot of veggies and this helped give me the benefits as if I was eating them regularly. It is a great multi-vitamin! 

I'm really happy with myself and my improved cardio and health, and I plan on doing another few rounds till I get to 185lbs. I want to save posting up pictures till after Round 2. I still have some fat to lose and want to lose more before showing you all. I can tell you though, I feel significantly lighter, healthier. My clothes are fitting loser and I am almost able to squeeze in to my old clothes.

I am so happy and motivated by so many of you on here. I hope to motivate and inspire at least some of you with my progress soon. Stay focused, motivated, and DIG DEEPER!

Really didnt sleep well last night, woke up itching bug bites idk how I got. So I'm extremely tired today...on top of that I had to bring my son into work with me because my fiancee got ANOTHER job working with a law firm. Im so proud of her though! So today I get to be dad ALL day which is usually reserved for me on the weekend since I work 9-5 during the week and she generally works weekends and/or nights.

I dont know how I am going to get my workout in today because I am more exhausted than normal.

On the plus side, due to recommendations made by my beachbody.com coach Jeremy, I woke up less nauseous than usual today...that doesnt mean to I was completely nauseous free but hopefully with a couple slight changes in my diet, that will go away with time. Again, Im sure some of it has to do with the nicotine withdrawal (im not using those expensive patches or chewing that nicorete gum) Im doing it the old fashioned unassisted way. Good thing is, is INSANITY is SOOOOO insane that it actually make me not want to smoke at all.

Hopefully as I finish this week and get into next week my entire body will be stronger and more able to push through each dvd. SOMEHOW SOMEWAY i just need to find the energy to push play today.

I do feel like I'm in much better shape, and I can definitely see it in most parts of my body (sorry, didn't take any pics), but the only place where I didn't see the results I was hoping for was in my stomach. While I am noticeably slimmer and my wife commented that my body feels different, overall I didn't get the results there I was looking for. 

Maybe another round would help, but I'm pretty much convinced that the key to getting truly great results is eating better. I did attempt to eat better and haven't had pop or juice for over 2 months now, but I still ate too many sweets and didn't always eat ""clean"". I'll probably look into doing Focus T25 when it comes out later this month and if I do that I'm convinced I need to go all in and get serious about changing my diet.

Well I didn't die! Or puke! I totally peed a little trying to do the push-up jacks. I'll blame that on having a 10 month old. yeah.



Switch Kicks: 37 pairs....or 74 (not sure how these are counted)

Power Jacks: 21

Suicide Jumps: 6 (but they were cheaty...stepping back and up sort of like mountain climbers)

I'm on currently on day 52, but I did my fourth (day 50) fit test today as I didn't want to leave my fit test for Sat. after working out all week. Since starting insanity I've gone from 6'3'', 233.6lbs down to 200lbs. I've kept a pretty strict diet, and whenever I did have something I shouldn't have I made sure to make it fit into my calorie budget for the day. Only twice have I gone over my TDEE while doing insanity (I ate a lot at my favorite sushi buffet those days :P). I've kept my protein high and my calories low and everything has been going well. I have also been playing soccer 3-4 times a week (around 2 hours) on top of insanity and doing some extra strength training here and there. I plan on getting back to lifting full time once I finish insanity and while doing round 2. Anyways here are the results of my fit tests so far:

Switch kicks (total, not divided by 2): 104 -&gt; 107 -&gt; 128 -&gt; 136

Power Jacks: 55 -&gt; 51 -&gt; 57 -&gt; 65

Low Plank Obliques: 50 -&gt; 49 -&gt; 59 -&gt; 75

My second fit test had a couple of drops, and I believe those were due to my form not being perfect on my first test. I have had my gf on facetime with me throughout the tests as well making sure all my tests are done with proper form and for motivation (somehow having someone yelling at me helps due to my competitiveness nature lol). I was able to beat Tanya and Jeff in most of my workouts and I NEVER thought that would be possible (they do however kick my ass in endurance throughout the workouts when I need breaks :P). Well, I just wanted to post my results and tell everyone that if you really put your all into this program you will get the results. I would say I am now in the best shape of my life though I've always been an athlete. I plan on posting pictures of my progress once I finish the program! Thanks for reading!!!

Today, I noticed my ankles/tops of my feet hurt. Like hurt to the point where I couldn't really do the work out. I have a feeling this might have to do with working out barefoot (it seemed like a good idea at the time...) but regardless of what caused it, I'm not sure how to move forward from here. Do I... 

A) Ignore the pain and keep going
B) Get a good pair of shoes and stay on schedule 
C) Take some time off until my joints feel better and pick up where I left off. 
D) Other? 

If I do take some time off I don't want to stop exercising. Doing this program has made me realize what a difference exercise makes for me, but what can I do that will not further injure my ankles? 

Or maybe I'm just being a pansy and I'm overreacting. I just worry about blowing up my joints as I plan on doing a 5 day hike/camping trip of the Appalachian trail this summer :)

This was a shitty period. 

First week of month 2 was incredibly hard, but on day 5 of month 2 I managed to get the best workout of the last month, I dug as a motherfucker and it felt awesome!

After that things went downhill. I started to feel lack of energy, like ""I cannot do any more push-ups, fuck you, my body is too heavy"". Week 2 month 2 I missed 2 workouts and made it up next day(so I had 3 days free, but 2 days with 2 workouts).

I tried to eat more, but gained a bit of weight(about 2 pounds, I was 83.5 kg already at first week of month 2) and that's it, it didn't help with energy.

I still feel like shit. But I'm close.

**What was done right(but should still be even better!):**

* finally got the feeling of power jumps - look at the numbers! - it helped me a lot, that Shawn makes people jump in bursts in one of workouts, I've discovered that you can actually jump quick, instead of slow and heavy feeling I've had before

* insane abs - I was expecting it to be really hard, but first time it was not that hard. BUT: second time I understood how wrong I was, I had first one 3 days before, but my abs didn't recover properly and I felt raped second time.

**Things to improve:**

* diet - go back to goddamn diet

* push more - but how?

Fit Test impression: started really good, but in the end was totally exhausted and push-up and obliques suffered - I was laying on the floor half of the time.

Fit Test is the hardest day for me so far, I guess.

**What was done right(but should still be even better!):**

* diet - took me some time to figure it out. I wonder if formulas are wrong, I needed to drop it down to ~1800 calories a day(against ~2200 recommended for weight loss for my age and weight) for weight to go down.

* form - mostly ok, still fighting with switch kicks - my core is weak! But improvement is noticeable.

* flexibility - started to improve, considering I'm usually flexible as a lighting pole. I like stretches.

**Things to improve:**

* joints are not recovering properly - having a little pain in my knees until I warm up, will be a bit careful with squats and jumps

* push more - HR is quite low even when I'm exhausted, I don't know how to push it up, but will keep trying

**Overall**:

I started insanity after doing basically no exercise for a long time. I did a ""warm-up"" week, doing all the week 1 videos (aside from the fit test), but at a much easier pace, working on form (and doing girly pushups).


**My numbers:**

power knees:        74 &gt;  94

power jumps:        24 &gt;  30

globe jumps:         7  &gt;  10

suicide jumps:      14  &gt; 19

pushup jacks:       12  &gt; 21

low plank oblique: 31  &gt; 35



**Measurements:**

Chest:  40 &gt; 39.5

Waist:  28 &gt; 27.5

Hips:    40 &gt; 39.5

Arm:    13 &gt; 12.5

Thigh:  24 &gt; 23.5

I started out at 151 lbs, I'm now up to 155. It seems that's not unusual for the first couple of weeks, but I'm hoping to see that go down in the next few weeks. My measurements have gone down, so I'm guessing it's just water retention in my muscles?

This is the first program I've stuck to for more than a week, and I have no desire to stop now, so I'm thinking I might actually make it through the whole thing! I couldn't be happier!

I've just purchased Insanity, thanks to the many commercials I've watched countless times after working out with Tony Horton. My husband and I have done 3 rounds of p90x and a year of p90x2. We're pretty fit, but I still want to get a little leaner. I'm also getting bored of p90x and could use a little less Tony in my life.

My main question is this... I like to work out with my husband, but he says he doesn't want to switch to Insanity because he like the strength workouts of p90x. He says he ""doesn't want to always do cardio."" 

If it ends up that we just have to workout at separate times, that is fine. However, I'm wondering if there is any tips or suggestions I can give my husband to convince him to just try Insanity with me?

For the record, his goals are to stay fit, maintain muscle (he's lean not too bulky), and... well he just likes to workout (almost every day) to de-stress.

I want to get leaner, lose some middle weight to better reveal the muscles I know I've acquired through p90x.

I saw a recent post regarding fit test 3 results and I thought I'd share some observations after having recently completed fit test 4. Here are my fit test results to date for weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. My recorded weights for weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 152, 155, 155, and 155, respectively.

* Switch kicks - 70 - 109 - 122 - 140

* Power knees - 73 - 81 - 86 - 102

* Push-up jacks - 24 - 28 - 31 - 35
* Oblique - 40 - 51 - 55 - 68

I improved between fit tests 2 and 3, though not nearly as dramatically as between fit tests 1 and 2 and fit tests 3 and 4. I'm wondering if anyone else experiences a plateau between tests 2 and 3? I imagine this is to be expected. But I was super happy to see the improvement in fit test 4. I'm especially excited about the power jump results. I think this says something about the success of the month 2 workouts.

I haven't lost weight over the program, but my measurements have improved, my fit test results have improved, and I feel better in general. And I'm almost finished! Can't wait to start all over again!

I am a new redditor and this is my first point so I’m looking forward to some interesting responses. Anyways, I am a 6'5 male and before insanity I weighed 261. I was tired of being front heavy so I just picked up Insanity and did it with no thorough planning. For the first week I followed the meal plan very loosely and only went shopping after my first week weigh in. Here is my week by week breakdown.

Week 1: lost 5 pounds (didn’t follow meal plan)

Week 2: lost 5 pounds (I bought 30 days of Muscle Milk which I drink after working out) **(followed the meal plan strictly)

Week 3: lost 5 pounds (followed the meal plan strictly)

Week 4: lost 5 pounds (followed the meal plan strictly) 

Week 5: (recovery week) lost 5 pounds (followed the meal plan strictly) 

Week 6: lost 0 pounds (became a little loose with meal plan*) *over ate some almonds and cashews, ate some moderately healthy food before bed (chobani yogurt)

Week 7: I am on day 45 of 63 (math may be off some because I missed some days due to medical reasons and pulled back twice) (back on a strict meal plan)

Meal plan: I eat 5 meals at 300 calories each and I know that’s less then I need but I also realize that I usually go over by having extra fruit throughout the day and maybe other snacks (1/2 cup of goldfish or something relatively healthy). I practically avoid all sweets. I cheated on Christmas eve, Christmas, and my Mom’s Birthday (i.e hot wings, cake)

So I did some research on how much weight people lose while doing insanity and I noticed the average was about 20-25 pounds for 60 days and haven’t found anyone that has lost as much as me (I expect to lose more in the next 15 days). 

So here is my question, is this fast weight loss normal? I’m not starving myself and I barely feel hungry at any time during the day. Everyone I tell is always extremely surprised but it’s obvious in my appearance. As of day 45 I have some moderate arm muscles and I can feels chest muscles under the fat as well abs muscles under my gut that I can feel if I tighten my core. Also, why have I stopped losing weight at this pace, am I doing something wrong? I plan on getting back on an even stricter schedule tomorrow and see if I can lose another 10 pounds by the end.

Long story short, I've gained 20 lbs in the last 4 months and I'm determined to lose it. I started Insanity a couple days ago and couldn't even finish day 1. Today, I finished the entire session and gave it 100% the entire time! It was difficult as hell, and I had to take more breaks than I thought I would have to, but I did it! 

It feels absolutely amazing. Does 4 days of working out get me to my fitness goal? No..but it sure does make me feel better about myself and make me more motivated to do it every single day.

I really just want to post on here for inspiration and motivation as I continue through to the 60 day mark. I've taken my before pictures and I'll post my 1 month picture side by side when I reach it. Thanks for the inspiration guys. I need it!

Our membership numbers are rising steadily so hopefully this'll help either motivate folks who are looking into Insanity or answer any questions they may have.

**Things I love**

* Most of the workouts are fast-paced and action-packed.  This is first and foremost a cardio workout which is what I enjoy the most.  It's great to be able to just forget about the burn for 20-30 minutes and go for it without having to focus too much on form and agonizing slow-moving moves.  This is a step up for me from the Power 90 workout series that I've done.
* The moves don't require me to pause the video to figure out how I'm supposed to be doing them.  While it was fun on paper, moves like the Dreya Roll or Heavenly Twist quickly lost their appeal because of how long I had to spend getting the form right and how frustrating it was not knowing if I was actually getting the benefit from them because my form wasn't impeccable.  
* The workouts are efficient.  I love Tony Horton to death, but there's something nice about how Shaun T. conducts his workouts with a no-nonsense approach.  He explains the upcoming moves during breaks and when the workout says you have 1:30:00 left, it means you have 1:30:00 left, not 30 seconds of working out because Tony/Shaun talks for a minute about whatever.  Which leads to...
* The workouts are quick.  The longest workout I've done so far was 44 minutes, with most between 33 and 40 minutes.  The Fit Test is right around 22-25 minutes (can't remember exactly).  I know later on there's another 20 minutes per day on average, but even those are coming well below the length of the P90X workouts.  
* It's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be.  I'm pretty overweight and I'm limiting how hard I push myself by using a heart rate monitor, but I'm burning north of 900 calories per 33-45 minute workout.  
* I'm already feeling the results.  While my weight is on the rise, and I'm not necessarily seeing a huge difference so far, I can definitely feel it in how my shirts and pants are fitting me.  Already I'm feeling less of an urge to ""suck it in"" and, while I'm an incredibly long way from having anything resembling rippling abs, I haven't woken up with indigestion since I started the workout.  On top of that, my bowel movements have all been pretty solid and easy to come by, even when I ate spicy wings this past week.  Normally after eating wings the next morning is a tough decision between speeding to work and possibly shitting my pants on the way there or waiting around to have diarrhea and going in 20 minutes late.  

**Things I don't like**

* Frankly? There isn't much.  There's a few folks in the tapes that I dislike solely based on how they conduct themselves, but there's also some eye-candy to make up for it.  

**Other thoughts**

* I'm having foot pain while warming up which I'm attributing to my shoes not being wide enough.  It's a similar pain to breaking in new ice skates for those who are familiar.  I think as my blood starts flowing and my feet swell  my shoes become cramped.  I ordered new cross training shoes that are a proper size so hopefully that fixes that ailment.
* I used an online target heart rate formula to determine what my range should be.  My resting heart rate of 90 and my age of 25 yielded me with a lower bounds of 134 and an upper bounds of 174.  My average heart rate over the workouts has been around 150-155 (keep in mind that's including the stretches and about 2 minutes of cooldown after the final stretching) and my calories burned per workout is around 900-950 from the time I take my recovery.
* During the opening warmups I give 75-85% for the first two rounds and then aim to have my heart rate peak around 175 right before the stretch.  This brings it to around 135 by the end of the stretch and then I spend the rest of the workout keeping it between 135 and 175 (averaging around 155).  
* For recovery I'm taking one scoop of whey isolate with around a tablespoon of chocolate syrup and 8 oz. of milk blended together.  I'm following the Phase 2 P90X diet.
* For the first 5 days, my legs were a mess and I was sore constantly.  Today is my rest day and for the first time so far I can stand up straight without my calves hurting.  My thighs are really the only thing sore that's noticeable, although my abs and chest are a bit tired, too.
* I noticed a huge difference in my endurance during the second Plyo workout of the week.  Besides having more cardio endurance, my legs felt more explosive and I was able to get down lower and jump a bit higher for a longer period of time.  
* Because of how out of shape and overweight I am, I modify the stretches and do the latter one at my own pace out of order so that I can still stretch while catching my breath.
* I definitely recommend having a workout buddy to keep you motivated while using a heart rate monitor to pace yourself.",,False,self,t5_2ua71,1340624531.0,,,True,t3_vkfy8,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/vkfy8/insanity_day_7_one_week_down/,

I decided this morning to do the fit test first thing, then in the afternoon start Month 2.  I've been doing a lot more working out than just Insanity so I didn't want to burn my body out all in one go.  Other workouts include: biking, weight lifting, cardio on my lunch breaks, Insanity after work, interval running (3 mph for 30 secs, 6 mph for 30 secs, repeat) for 45 minutes when I can find the time.  Lately I've been this workout freak and I feel guilty just sitting still and I feel restless a lot of the time too.

Anyway, here's my fit test results from #1, #2, and #3:

Switch Kicks: 80, 78 (correcting form slowed me down), 81

Power Jacks: 31, 48, 51

Power Knees: 73, 86, 91

Power Jumps: 26, 35, 40

Globe jumps: 8, 12, 12 (for some reason jumping backwards really wears me down, anyone else find this?)

Suicides (or Burpees): 13, 15, 18

Push up jacks: 13, 22, 31

Plank thingies: 63, 73, 81 (could have done more on the last one but I was really sweaty and my arms were sliding away from me, and I had to keep stopping to get back into place.)

I then consistently dropped to 140 lbs pounds throughout high school, but then started eating healthier and working out and remained between 123 and 128 lbs.

I also had problems with disordered eating in the forms of anorexia and orthorexia, always focused on how many calories I've burned. But that changed with the help of a nutritionist and some therapy. Now, about Insanity...

I started Insanity in the last days of April this year. I've never done the workout before, but what a difference it made. This workout pushed me to go past my ""limitations"" and I feel stronger and more solid. At the start of the workout I realized I wasn't eating enough (and by eating enough, I mean I was roughly 800 calories deficient each day and consuming -maybe- 1800 calories on a good day). So I pushed myself to eat more protein and more balanced meals and more often. I regained the energy my body needed and, now on week 10, I can happily say I have more respect with what I can do than I have ever been before.

This brings me to what occurred this morning at my doctor's office. The last time I was weighed there (2011), I was 123 lbs. This time it was... dun dun dun... 141 lbs. I was shocked, because my clothes are looser and my muscles more defined, and I am most certainly thinner than I had been in high school (size 12 then vs size 4-6 now). And when I mentioned this to my doctor, she poked and prodded my legs and abs and arms and said ""Wow... You are definitely solid."" (in an admiring sort of way).

I hate hip-flexor stretches. I suck at them. I guess it's a good thing they are there since I clearly need to work on them.

I can't seem to get the hang of 1st level drills, ski abs, or the in and outs. My knees don't want to get me from the floor to back up and once I'm on the floor my feet do not want to move. Need to work more on those.

The bottoms of my feet start burning every day during the workout. Is this shoe related or ""doing something wrong"" related. (I am gonna probably be getting proper cross-trainers this week).

I'm not overweight really and I'm in decent shape-- I actually did a half-marathon at the end of April. I was very slow, but I did it-- but I took about 6 weeks off after the half-- rest week, then I graduated from grad school, then I ha to take care of my grandma, then I moved and was dealing with all that, then I got a new job, etc. etc...lots of excuses that I could have worked around but I was exhausted and burnt out at that point.

So anyway, tried to finally start running again today and my knees weren't having any of it. I've always had knee problems and wear braces on em but it was just too much today. I run/walked 1.3 miles and came back to my apartment feeling a bit down.

Decided f it-- to make my knees better I have to cross train. Squats, lunges, etc. are the remedy, according to my physical therapist, so I figured Insanity would be a good way to keep my routine varied but start building that strength up.

HOLY SHIT. I am in worse shape than I thought. I was out of breath during the warm up! That said, I did all the test (minus the power jumps...for some reason those killed my knees while the other jumps didn't. Next time I'm going to try them again and really focus on technique) and feel good afterward! Sweaty, but good!
I'm looking forward to starting this program...I got into running through C25K a little less than a year ago and I really like having the structured schedule/someone tell me what to do. I'm not doing this to lose weight, but I'm sure my body will change doing it and I am looking forward to gaining a bit more muscle mass and not feeling like a huge weakling...

Need some advice, or encouragement, or just hugs are ok, too",12,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/1f9vrk/self_feeling_really_down_shin_and_calf_pain/,"Hiya.  I've got three more days to go before I complete my third week of Insanity, which makes me feel amazing!

However, this week has been very, very tough for me.  Upon resuming on Monday after rest day Sunday, I noticed that my calves (more like the inner front of them) were... not so much sore, but just in pain.  It was the fit test so I gave it my all (improved in everything but switch kicks, hooray).  Then yesterday during Plyo Cardio, about halfway through, I had to take long breaks because of the pain.

I always try to land softly, mostly because my knee gave me some issues a few years back and I tend to be really nice to it to avoid aggravating what I was told was arthritis (or the beginning stages of it).

I did some research and saw that the location of the pain may indicate shin splints.  I went out and bought a few things: arnica gel and a foam roller.  They helped to a point, used them off and on all day yesterday.  I used some stretches I saw, involving pushing off of a wall with your toe.

I also booked an appointment with an orthopaedist for Friday morning.  I'm prepared to ask questions like, ""Are my shoes crappy?  Do I need orthotics?  Are my gait and landing all wrong?""

What I'm not prepared to hear is that I need to stop :(

Today was Pure Cardio and Cardio Abs.  The Ab section was pretty ok, but I had to modify the jumps in Pure Cardio (for example, instead of stance jacks I just did squats, etc.)  The pain came back when I was done.  I did some massage to the area and used the foam roller, which has helped loosen it up a bit.

This is really bumming me out, so much.  I want to do this.  I want to finish.  I want to show myself and everyone that I have this in me, and that I can see it through to the end.  Even the *idea* that a doctor would tell me that I have to stop this program has me so sad... just typing that out, it seems stupid - but that's how badly I want to finish the full two months.

I'm afraid that if I skip a day, that will snowball into two days skipped, and then a week, and then giving up.

I'd love to hear from someone who had to stop and then went on to finish, or even advice on skipping a day - do I repeat the whole week?  Do I just go on with the program and consider it a rest day?

This post is two things: first, my journey to get to the Asylum, and second, a review of the first week. Skip down to the bottom if you only want the deets on Asylum's first week.

How I Got Here
--

First off, a little background on me, so you know where I'm coming from: I'm a 5'7"" male, 33 years old. I was 255 lbs, and doing Power 90 and Power 90 Master Series lost me about 55 pounds. Then, I found Insanity...

First round of Insanity was amazing. I had never had such an awesome workout before. As a 200 pound guy (still classified as obese at that point I think) it was brutal on my joints as I already had bad knees. Then, I found patella straps and later [patella sleeves (not these ones, but similar)](http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpagemanike-nopks2.html), and those basically cured my issues with my knees. I was able to jump around like a silly fool!

The first month of Insanity was a lot of trial and error. I was trying hard to figure out how best to lose weight with the new calorie restrictions I had to impose on my diet. Previously, I had been doing low-carb, and it essentially stopped working simply because I wasn't measuring portions or calories. That lead me to really get down to specifics in calorie counting, to truly maximize my weight loss. Well, that didn't work out quite right, as I ended up overeating when following the diet plan.

I tried to hit my macros (40:40:20 Protein:Carb:Fat) but eating that in 5 meals a day was difficult, especially since, as a 5'7"" guy, my number to hit was supposed to be 1500 calories. 5x300 calorie meals was unfeasible. So I switched to 3x500, and that worked much better. Now, I eat 2x750 (a little less actually since I am so close to my goal). It's important to note that frequency of meals isn't really important (the 6 meals a day to stoke the metabolic fire thing is a myth, based on faulty inferences from how the body reacts to digestion).

Insanity also had a recovery day mid-week, which allowed me to add a fasting day. I added two 24-hour fasts per week, one on the full rest day (Sunday) and one that started right as the previous workout day ended. For instance, in week 4, the Wednesday was Plyo Cardio Circuit and Thursday was Cardio Recovery, so I did the Plyo workout, had my recovery drink (a protein shake), and then started fasting. I wouldn't eat until just after the Cardio Recovery workout the next day. It was very comfortable and easy to do. After all was said and done, I felt awesome!

I lost 15 more pounds.

For Round 2, I did a P90X/Insanity Hybrid. Now, it started off really well, with the first 2 months seeing me lose another 10 pounds (putting me at 160 after a mini-back-slide). The P90X stuff was a welcome addition, but the cardio portions of P90X were just not up to snuff. P90X grads usually complain about how hard Plyo X is/was, but man, I had no trouble what so ever.

I had a bad month in month 3. Unfortunately for me, I gained about 10 pounds back due to a terrible back-slide of binge eating and ridiculous work-related stress. I have a couple of gray hairs in my beard now from it too :(

I was struggling with my diet, the binge eating notwithstanding. Even on the days where I ate clean, I was still eating too much. I eventually realized that in order to lose those last 10-15 pounds, I'd have to get really hardcore, really strict... I'm currently eating the same meal every day, hitting the 40:40:20 split exactly, at precisely 1400 calories.

Enter the Asylum...

Week 1 of Asylum
--

Asylum is only 1 month long. The official workout routine has week 1 like so:

* Day 1: Fit Test
* Day 2: Speed &amp; Agility
* Day 3: Strength
* Day 4: Back to Core
* Day 5: Vertical Plyo
* Day 6: Rest
* Day 7 and onward -- it is a 3-day then Relief (like recovery in Insanity) with 2 more workouts, ""Game Day"" and ""Overtime"" mixed in, and finishing with a 5-day then Rest block before one last workout and a final Fit Test.

The calendar is not like we're used to with Insanity, where you have 6 days of exercise and then a rest day. You only get 2 true rest days in the month, with every few days being a ""Relief"" day, where you do a stretching routine. Shaun T also recommends you do Relief every day if you are inflexible (I don't, though, despite not being as flexible as I should be).

I wanted to wait before I posted this until I had a chance to complete Game Day and Overtime, but I figured I may as well just post it and update later. 


**Fit Test**

This fit test is, in my opinion, superior to the original Insanity fit test, but harder to accurately gauge your performance. It takes a bit of practice to get the moves right (agility heisman, shoulder tap, and bear crawl for example), but the same can be said for most of Asylum. The program in itself is about agility and coordination, and part of that is doing complicated (or rather, more complicated than Insanity) moves within certain constraints. The agility ladder is how this is accomplished. In my opinion, it's fun to use, too. I like having a target, something measure your movements with. ""Don't hit the ladder!"" -- you hear that a lot throughout.

The order of the moves tests different parts of your body, and ends up being more balanced than the original fit test.

Fit test is:

* Agility Heisman
* In &amp; Out Ab Progression
* Lat Push-Up OR Pull-Up
* Mountain Clumber Switch Kicks
* Agility Shoulder Taps
* X Jumps
* Moving Push-Ups
* Agility Lateral Shuffle
* Agility Bear Crawl

**Speed and Agility**

That damn jump rope... 

Mountain Climber Progression and Moving Push-Up Progression are where you get your ass kicked. Most of the other moves are agility stuff, putting your feet in and out of the ladder, jumping around it, quite fun. The Moving Push-Up progression in particular, where you do a moving push-up, then jump into the ladder (you go from plank after push-up to pulling your feet into the ladder where your hands just were, much like a power push-up -- it's brutal). 

*Shaun T: ""it only counts when you're tried."" Oh fuck, I was tried.*

**Strength**

I absolutely loved this workout. Halo Deadlifts were awkward, but other than that, I really liked it all. It was very reminiscent of the ""Upper Body Weight Training"" workout in the Insanity Deluxe edition in that it's weights and cardio in one.

Progressive Dumbbell rotation was a beast. The level 3 is curl -&gt; squat -&gt; push-up -&gt; spider left, right -&gt; push-up -&gt; floor sprint -&gt; repeat. I absolutely loooooved it, hands down my favourite exercise so far.

*Shaun T: ""I laugh at pain"".*

**Back to Core**

Hmm, what to compare this to? It's a back and core exercise routine, so it's not a lot of plyo or lateral moves, it's a lot of control and focus routines. I suppose you can liken it to Core Cardio and Recovery. The Swimmer Band Exchange is probably the most interesting part of the workout (if you do it right!).

**Vertical Plyo**

Similar to Speed and Agility, except more jumps/squat jumps, and putting bands on your legs and arms during jumps. Oh god, the Resistance Power Jumps (Power Jumps with resistance bands on your legs) are really weird and difficult. I enjoy Power Jumps as is, but with the bands on your legs, man, it screws you up; it's hard to gauge just how to control your legs during the jump with the resistance. Similarly, Resistance X Jumps are just what they sound like: X-jumps with resistance, and it is awkward.

Lastly, Decoy Split Jumps are deceptively hard. 


**Game Day**

I haven't done this yet, but I checked out the video and it is very reminiscent of Max Interval Sports Training from Insanity Deluxe Edition. It just so happens that that was my favourite video from Insanity! I'm really pumped for this, can't wait to do it next week!

**Overtime**

I haven't done this yet. It's a little more push-ups, pull-ups and runs -- that little extra to kick your butt. I can't wait!


**Note:** I didn't modify any exercises except for the pull-ups (mountain climber) -- I opted for lat push-ups instead.

**Overall Positives**

* NO TONYA! Hurray! I know this will draw ire from some of this subreddit's denizens, but I'm a ""hater"". Not really a *hate*r per se, more of a ""greatly *dislike*r"". 
* A lot of the old crew are back, it's good to see familiar faces.
* The new moves are refreshing and in a lot of cases difficult and challenging.
* Some weight lifting!
* The music is better for pushing you -- IMO, it feels like it is more ""epic"" and drives you better.

**Some Negatives**

* Not enough warm-up (generally)
* The amount of stretching is generally reduced, this is because Relief is meant to be done by people who need this extra stretching. However, I believe a bit more stretching inside the main workouts would be beneficial across the board. To compensate for this, I tend to use a foam roller before and after the workouts.
* Requires a bit of practice (e.g. ladder drills)
* Only 1 month long; implies you will need to do it over again, or Volume 2 as well
* Requires equipment: agility ladder, dumbbells or resistance bands, resistance bands (that go around your legs and arms, not like the bands you replace free weights with) [optional], pull-up bar [optional], jump-rope [optional].

**Random Observations**

* Shaun T looks shredded in this, to the point where he makes himself look fat in Insanity. He must be like 4-6% body fat.
* Martin, Lloyd and Alycia work really hard in the fit test, and I found that to be very motivating (although, Martin is dead at the end of it. Oh, Martin!).


Closing Thoughts
--

Asylum is turning out to be a really fun and challenging workout. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and sometimes I find myself rewinding/replaying chapters to make sure I get the moves right, thus slowing my momentum, but overall I am really enjoying it. Once I nail the moves down and am able to really push myself (and not hit the ladder!) I feel like I will see awesome results. 

My current plan for exercise is to finish Asylum (I'm done round 1 of Volume 1 on May 25th) then do Body Beast to bulk-up a bit, then Asylum Volume 2 to cut a bit, then Asylum 1 and 2 in a hybrid ([hybrid schedule here](http://gf2revolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Av1+2.pdf)).

I basically haven't done any real exercise or eaten healthy in about 5 years. Oh, and I smoke about a pack a day. Off to a great start right? Then, well fuck, going on 2 years ago now, the girl I saw myself marrying left me. I sunk into a pretty deep depression, and that's where I still find myself now.

I'm 25, male, 5'10"", 150ish lbs, my endurance is horrible, I have next to no muscle left on me, and I carry a spare tire around my waist every day... now, why Insanity? Well, I have a very strong background in body weight training (hate lifting weights - so boring). I'm weak enough that while eating enough calories I'll surly build some muscle (as hard as pushups currently are, my body won't have a choice haha)(oh, and no, I'm not trying to get Shaun T. ripped through this workout, just want to be able to knockout some pushups and whatnot without dying by the end). And more than anything, my endurance needs some SERIOUS improvement. I think that probably puts me in the minority of people who start this workout - my main goal isn't to try to lose weight, or gain weight, or get cut, or improve my appearance in any way (though that will be super nice too haha), my main goal is to improve my cardio capabilities. 

Anyway, I'll quit rambling now. Just wanted to jump on here and introduce myself to the community. My fit test results are embarrassing as hell, but I'll be posting them in a day or two (did the first day at a friends house and left my notebook over there unfortunately - just finished day 2 today). And I'm sure you'll be hearing from me again in the coming weeks with questions, when I need that extra little push of motivation, and of course to share my results (to hopefully inspire some new potentials the way many of you helped inspire me to take on this insane challenge)

In my opinion, Month 1 is just a warm-up for Month 2. I absolutely *loooove* the Month 2 routines. Month 2 is what makes Insanity truly insane. It's where the program shines. The effectiveness of the program comes down to how hard you push in Month 2!

That having been said, I'm currently doing a P90X/Insanity hybrid (after having completed 1 round of Insanity); I'm doing 3 days of the P90X lifting stuff (bro) and 3 days of Insanity's cardio. I'm now in my second month of it and *finally* doing the Max routines from Insanity's Month 2. I've missed it so much. I mean, I like the Month 1 routines, but Month 2 is ***where it's at***. It feels so good to get back into it. I'm coming off of a rest week as well, so to finally bust out the hour-long, ass-kicking, super-fatiguing intervals, is a huge relief to me. I know rest weeks are important, but man was that ever testing my patience.

I suppose I feel this way because I recognize how effective Month 2 was for me the first time around. I'm so close to my goal and I just know I'll hit it in a couple of months (this hybrid is 90 days, 1 month of mostly P90X, and 2 months of mostly Insanity (the max stuff)).

Also, today I did my favourite routine: Max Interval Circuit. I enjoy that one the most, likely because Tonya isn't in it. Hah!

I ate too much Taco Bell and McDonalds, and despite being in a fairly active job (I work in doggie day care and I bathe dogs) I gain about 10 lbs in pure fat in one place, my stomach.

These are my measurements as they stand:
Waist: 30""
Stomach: 38"" (I have a scar from a colostomy bag all the way across about 2-3 inches below my belly button, all my fat just kinda hangs out there.)
Hips: 37.5""

As you can see, my stomach is actually half an inch bigger than my hips. My goal? To lose enough that my stomach is slightly smaller than my hips. I came to conclusions while in high school that I'll never be able to have a flat stomach like everyone else, but I can be smaller, for sure. 

This is not to say that my only reason is my stomach, because it's not. I want to be healthier. Diabetes and high blood pressure both run like Forrest Gump in my family, so I need to work harder to prevent such things. Also, although I haven't had a colostomy bag for almost 23 years, I still have a hard time with such things when I don't eat healthy and exercise. So, that's a plus. :)

Well, when doing cardio abs the C-position really puts stress on that spot and it has been sore since last Wednesday when I did them. 

What would be a good alternative to the C-Position ab workouts in the cardio abs circuit if any? Because I really want to continue working my abs, its just I do not want to hurt my tailbone any more, because it makes sitting anywhere else painful (at work, driving, even on a soft couch.)

Pushing SO hard on this workout, I'm not following the nutrition guide, but I am eating proper calories for a 500 cal. deficit.

I dropped my recovery drink in favour of a protein shake, my recovery drink included sucrose, which I've been reading stops fat-burning after a workout. I thought maybe my drink was hindering my results, but I don't seem to be getting anywhere with a Protein Drink either.

My diet is vegetarian, and I do eat a lot of protein in the way of soy, including tons of veggies everyday. Whole grains, etc. I wasn't gaining any weight before I started the program with my current diet, so I thought adding insanity would help me shed some weight considering I'm burning about 650-750 cals a workout.

My fit tests have improved, and I have gotten stronger, however I was really hoping to see some physical changes by now. I do have some muscle tone in my legs, but no loss of inches in any measurements.

I feel stronger, my body feels more solid, but again no fat/weight loss whatsoever. On the plus, the workouts have been getting easier. The first week of Month 2 was hell, but now I can pretty much get through all workouts with very minimal breaks (resting for a couple seconds then jumping back into workouts, not pressing pause)

I'm starting to get really frustrated. I don't want to stop, but right now I feel like I'll finish killing myself through these workouts for another 2 weeks to just continue seeing no results.

Anyone else in this boat? Does the magic just never happen for some people?

If I was slacking off through the workouts or eating lousy, I feel like I could blame it on that, but I've really been trying... what gives??

YAAAY! I had meant to start it early in summer, but because my LDR bf was staying with me for a month I wasn't very motivated (excuses, excuses). I was worried that 2nd year med school would be too demanding to allow me to workout, but I'm finding that working out helps me with time management. Instead of using 2 hrs of reddit as a break, I use Insanity.

However, this month has been rough with school work and my bf being so far away. I have been finding the workouts difficult and felt I wasn't pushing as much as I could and my quads have been killing me (squats, lunges and then more squats and lunges?!)

BUT TODAY WAS GREAT! My thighs didn't want to collapse after doing the sprint then lunge thing. I think they're called pedal pushers. I hated those in month 1. But today I did all 3 sets of those with no break/stopping. I was super proud of that. Also I did the high hook, low hook, 4 jumps thing with no break for all 3 sets. And then managed to go right into the high knees (though I had to take breaks). But I kinda feel pumped going straight into the next workout without needing a break. Just like Hannah! 

I wanted to tell someone, but no one really knows I'm doing Insanity (mostly b/c I believe in the whole keeping your goals a secret thing) and I don't know anyone ILR that would understand what workouts I was talking about anyway. So I thought why not post here.

I'm thinking it may also have to do with the fact that I'm working 2 jobs at the moment, but wanted to check with you guys if I'm eating enough, or if it might be just general over-exertion. 

I generally have a light breakfast, either cereal or yogurt with some chopped fruit, a turkey sandwich and more fruit for lunch sometimes with 2 or 3 pretzel rods, and then whatever my family cooks for dinner, with an occasional snack inbetween (trying to keep it healthy so this is only occasional but sometimes something slips in). I'm not following the diet plan completely, but I've been gradually altering my diet for months now to cut out soda, junk food, minimize carbs, and generally make better choices.
Most of this isn't packaged, so I'm not certain on what my calorie intake is, but according to the diet plan's calculations, I SHOULD be aiming for 2110 for weight-loss, and I don't think I'm TOO far off either direction.

Additionally, my knees aren't always the best and the past few days, my left ankle has started to hurt. Should I take it easy or is there anything I can do to help this? I don't want to fully pause, but I don't want to hurt myself either.

* DIET PEOPLE! Look at the photos: I started to follow diet after fit test 2 and the result is immediate! DO NOT EVER UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF DIET!

* I was pushing too much at the beginning of the fit test. Last one I didn't push that much at the start, which allowed me to finish it better.

My goal is really to just burn some fat in my trouble areas (arms, neck, stomach). I'm not really bothering to weigh myself at all since it never changes, and really it doesn't matter.

I'm bummed my thighs never seem to get any smaller, but I'm starting to come to terms with my thunder thighs =\ They're definitely MUCH more muscular rather than fatty at this point.

My peak fitness level was around two years ago and I was around 150, I was wondering if this workout/meal plan would be good for the my weight/height, and if not what I could do better. I work out whenever I wake up and I'm thinking about maybe adding another session later in the day every other day.

Meal 1: Protein shake with 2% milk
2 hard boiled egg whites
one banana

Meal 2: 2 Cups of spinach 
8 oz. grilled chicken
1 cup baby carrots

Meal 3: 3 clementines
1 kiwi
1 small cheese wheel with 5 crackers

Meal 4: Protein shake with 2% milk

Meal 5: 2 small tortillas
8 oz. ground turkey meat
1 cheese stick

It all ends up being around 1900-2000 calories.
I'd be switching the ground turkey and chicken up with talapia every once in awhile and the fruits will change slightly. I'm also taking creatine monohydrate and taking vitamin packs.

Well, I am going to try and keep this short, so here I go. I just finished month 1, and I didn't lose any weight at all. I am feeling discouraged now. I am currently 197lbs, and you would think... I would have lost a little something by now. I have done some Insanity before... Back when I was 239lbs (In the not too distant past). I lost my weight by only doing 43 days worth of Insanity my first go about. (Something came up, and I missed out on too many days). Now I restarted Insanity, and I am not getting anywhere like I did my first time. At first, the weight just melting off of my body really quickly. I mean 40lbs in 43 days? Cmon. I am not doing anything different this time around. My eating habit is the same, and it isn't horrible either. At least I don't think it is. I would say, I am probably eating about 1500 calories a day. I don't think that is too bad... Is it? I barely eat that much junk food. And everything that I do eat, is usually low fat, or low calorie. Like, when I pack lunches for work or something.. I would have a turkey sandwich with a yoplait light yogurt. 

Anyways, am I doing something wrong?

I've planning on starting the Insanity workout - in conjunction with beginning a Keto diet. I want to shed a couple of Stone (30ish lbs), generally get fitter, and as an added bonus tone up a bit.

One thing that's been playing on my mind though is when best to do my workout. I've heard in the past the line ""Not before 11, not after 11"" in terms of when you should exercise. I thought if I wrote down what my average daily schedule is you might be able to help me pin point the best time to workout.

So, at the moment I wake up about 7am - I shower, have breakfast, spend time with the kids and leave about 8 to get into work for 8:30am. I have an hour for lunch but most days I work through as I'm pretty busy with what I do. I leave work about 6:30, getting home around 7pm. I help bath the sprogs and read their bed time stories and once done it's knocking on 8pm. I then reheat the dinner my wife has made earlier and finish eating about 8:30 - a bit later if I get roped into helping with the washing up! :-)

So given all that do you think I should be getting up earlier to do my workout? Or doing it after I've sorted the kids out, before I eat? Or wait an hour or so after eating and then exercising - am I right in saying that you need to leave it a couple of hours after eating to exercise (or is that swimming?! :-P).

This is my second time doing insanity - however I have not done it since last April. I was about 2 weeks from finishing and I sprained my ankle stepping off a curb in Vegas. Totally sober!

Anyways - back at it again. Goal #1 - Mexico on January 26th, weight loss goal 15lbs. (140 down to 125) My 3 month plan before Mexico is to do 1 round of Insanity (2 months) and then 1 round of Asylum (1 month).
 
After that I'll switch to p90x or something - or maybe a hybrid. Where I hope to lose another 5lbs before end of May. (goal 120lbs)


Meal Plan:
5:00 am: Wake up

5:20 am: Workout

6:05 am: Small glass of chocolate milk

7:00 am: Unsweetened Almond Milk, Chocolate protein powder, Small banana, Table spoon of natural peanut butter all mixed up.

7:30am: green tea

10:00 am: Greek Yogurt Fat Free, fruit

12:00 pm: Green Salad with lots of veggies, Free-range hard boiled egg, Avocado, balsamic vinaigrette

2:00 pm: Apple, Raw almonds

5:30-6:00 pm:This will vary from day to day - but essentially a meal will consist of protein, steamed veggies and a carb. So for example 4oz baked salmon, pile of steamed broccoli 1/2 cup rice. Cup of peppermint tea.

8:00pm - Almond Milk, I scoop protein powder


On Day 3 today - hamstrings are tight as all hell ( so are my calves and glutes but not nearly as much) - any suggestions?

Also do we count rest days as a day on here - like will my rest day be day 7 or will the first day of my second week be day 7?

thanks for reading! :)

A couple months ago I was two weeks from completing Insanity, 39lbs down from my start weight, P90X under my belt and felt like a machine.  I let life get in the way and I slowly fell back into laziness and bad eating habits.



Finally yesterday I rediscovered my motivation when I stepped on the scale for the first time.  I have regained 8 of those 39lbs.  It may not seem like a lot to some, but I worked so damn hard for my progress and that's enough to kick my ass back into gear.


So last night I did my Insanity workout.  It was HARD.  Harder than it ever was before and I wanted to give up so badly but I didn't and I'm pretty proud of that.  Today I got my eating habits back on board and I've actually felt so much better health wise already.  I'm going for a run tonight with a friend and I've never run before (well, never run for exercise anyway) and I'm excited.  We're going to make a habit of this and do it a few evenings a week.  



So with Insanity and a friend to help motivate me, I think I will be able to get back into it without too much of a problem.

Out of breath by the time the warmup is done. 

Sweat. Buckets. Wipe your face with a towel and drip sweat seconds later. 

Dizziness and head rush. That is how you know you are digging deep, not when you are tired - when you feel like you are about to faint. Unless you have a heartbeat monitor, maybe then you will have a better indication. 

You will have to take breaks. Be proud when you can't go further without a break. Just don't stop the tape, take a couple of breaths and try to do a couple more reps. 

Now what you get in return: 

It is not all about the weight, although if you are really heavy you will lose some. 

You will feel better about yourself. Not the first week, but later you will.

You will be able to run faster and longer, do things that you couldn't do, run up the stairs. 

You will want to eat better. Smaller meals less alcohol - you will know what you need to do in order to survive tomorrow's workout. 

Asylum is not much different from month two. I did Max Cardio in between, and it still kicked my ass,so be proud if you are surviving those.

3) I love seeing progress but HATE weighing and measuring myself, I always end up making goals that seems more important then the toned muscles and great feeling of being fit SO I figured out a way to have both... take some string and ""measure"" yourself with it, cut it at the exact size of each of the areas you want to watch change, then label them on a piece of paper that you tape them on, that way after each week you can see how many inches you lost without ever being caught up in your own measurements!

I will list all the workouts I have, and redditors HAVE AT IT. I will choose the one with the most upvotes =)

PS: I am going to stick with first month Insanity workouts, so no Max in this one.

I just completed my first week of Insanity and feel so great about that! I am starting to notice that i'm able to do more along with the dvds already and its only day 6. Im not out of breath as quickly, don't tire out as quickly, ect.  

The reason i would like advice is this:
I am doing my workout on a carpet...that makes some of the stuff like switching feet and butt kicks difficult...so i end up jogging in place instead... any of you know something i can do to help? I have a yoga mat to assist with the pushups, and anything that requires the floor. 

Also, I'm not noticing any changes in my energy levels throughout the day. I'm having to take a b12 supplement on my lunch to help me finish out my work day (i work at a daycare with 2 year olds from 830-530). Will my energy levels start picking up as i get farther in? or is it just because of my weight?

1. It seems like I haven't lost any weight since I've started, only half an inch all over my body. Is there anyway I could improve my weight loss, etc? I mean, I do feel much fitter and much better, but the scale and the measurements aren't going down.

2. How do you guys go about motivating yourselves when you feel down or too tired? I haven't completely skipped any workouts yet (I usually just swap it with my off day) but I'm just asking for future reference.

3. I'm going to have to miss 2 days out of my recovery week. Do people recommend that I shift my schedule, or just completely skip them?

4. For those who did this during college. How did you schedule your day, when did you do your workouts, etc? How do you force yourself to do it rather than sleep or study or hang out with people?

5. I can't do pushups as of right now, so I usually replace it with lady pushups. Is that sufficient? Is there a better way I can slowly progress into real pushups? Any advice on this?

6. Last but not least, do you guys actually never take breaks unless he says we should take a break? Does ANYONE actually do that?

7. Before starting Insanity, I used to do a mixture of Cardio/Aerobics classes for almost 2-3 hours a day. I feel like I probably burned more calories doing those than Insanity. Should I still stick with Insanity? Any insight?

1) We're known to the community for quite some time, so there might be some biases about who wins based on our personalities and not our physical development.
2) The forum is small as shit. I wouldn't be surprised if only about 3 people would vote.

Ankles burning, shin splints making it hard to walk (that half-mile walk from parking to my office suuuucked this week), so I did some thinking: a year ago, when I was running (and much more fit), I ran in Vibram fivefingers. Love/hate relationship with them--legs always felt great, not *nearly* as bad a problem with shin splints compared to my regular running shoes once I switched, but I didn't stretch enough one day and suffered a partial Achilles tear, which knocked me out for months. 

I don't recommend doing that. Never, *ever* skip your stretches. **ಠ_ಠ**

I packed the shoes away while I rehabbed and now it's a year later. I started Insanity in my regular shoes, but I'm having shin pain. In thinking back to how these shoes honestly helped so much with shin splints when I ran, I gave them a try for my next workout...and had 0 pain in my shins and ankles. None. My second day doing plyo cardio, and I was flabbergasted. 

My question is this--has anyone else used fivefingers for their workouts, and how were your results? I'm throwing in extra pauses for stretching during warmup and cooldown, and I'm just amazed. I'll be doing my second day with them tonight, and I'm kind of excited. Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2ua71,False,,,True,t3_v8pr7,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/v8pr7/shoe_thoughts/,

About 5 years ago I was almost 100 lbs heavier, inactive and had a terrible diet. Decided one day that enough was enough, started learning all about clean eating and the importance of being active, then put that knowledge into action. I've been lifting weights daily for years now and have added a decent amount of muscle but still have some fat covering it up. That's where Insanity came in. I've decided that its time to focus on my cardio as well as lifting to maintain muscle. So far so good...

Day 15. Just finished my second fit test. I'm very happy with the results. Here they are, day 1 vs Day 15:

Switch Kicks - 80 --&gt;91
Power Jacks - 37 --&gt;48
Power Knees- 70 --&gt;88
Power Jumps - 24 --&gt;32
Globe Jumps- 8 --&gt;10
Suicide Jumps - 14 --&gt;16
Push-Up Jacks - 23 --&gt;28
Low Plank Oblique- 48 --&gt;56

This time around I felt like I had way more stamina throughout the fit test. Still drenched in sweat by the end of it like Day 1 though.

- I play rec league soccer once a week and have found that since I started Insanity my recover time after a sprint has dropped significantly. 

- Since I started Insanity my appetite has increased significantly. Before I started I would have trouble hitting my 2600 cals a day. Now I 'm hungry again an hour after I've eaten. Still hitting my macros and staying at my deficit though. 

-I love that I'm dripping sweat by the end of each workout. Every day I feel a good sense of accomplishment when I finish the workout, and I usually do it in the morning so its a great way to start the day. I'll often hit the gym later in the day, or get some other kind of workout in later on.

So I decided to take a rest day yesterday and to start a five days ""recovery week"" of my own before doing anything else (I alternate the Max interval sports training and the cardio &amp; balance for 5 days).

Anyway, I'm thinking about starting the Asylum after those two weeks.

I have flat feet, so I decided to buy special insoles so my feet wouldn't hurt that much. I bought some anti-shock insoles made from gel. The problem is that with insoles the pain is even worse than without them. With all the jumping it starts to hurt through the warm-up.

Is it some kind of adaptation period and do I need to just suck it up for some time until my feet get used to it? Any specific advice on choosing insoles? How long does it take to adapt?

Please, share your experience.

Fit Test is still hard, while doing low plank obliques I was just laying on the floor for at least half of the time. It feels great to see the numbers progress.

**What was done right:**

* first week - lots of enthusiasm and ""push through"" spirit

* finally understood the form of some excercises that were hard for me

* excercising barefoot is great, but got blisters -&gt; bought the best shoes I've had up to date(Nike Free Run) - suitable for running too, they are really awesome!

* bought heart-rate monitor - nice to see how many calories you've burnt through the workout

* stretches - I'm really bad at being flexible, but I think I got a bit better. It's still bad, but better than it was before

* feeling great(until you get to work out again, heh)

**What will be done better:**

* **DIET** - I've been eating crap, and then, to compensate, refused to have other food through the day - double fail! Since today I'm following Insanity guide. Proatmeal tastes like vomit even with berries, and Insanity Special Sandwich is disgusting too(I hate bread), but I'm looking forward to try other recipies. I print out the journal page in the evening, choose what I want to eat tomorrow, then check the fridge if I have all groceries I need and go to the store. Protocoling my diet makes me feel more responsible.

* motivation - week 2 was kinda down, I've got problems with energy(see DIET point) and felt like crap; hopefully my body is more or less adjusted(according to fit test results it is) and I will be able to push more

* schedule - I definitely need to sort out my schedule to work-out at the same time(more or less) every day. This one is tough, I have so much shit going on.

* better warm-ups - got some knee pain for a day or two, it didn't last long, but it's a good reminder to warm-up better!

Notes:

* I still want to continue working out barefoot, I have flat feet and it feels much better than having shoes on. Though new shoes are really comfortable!

* heart-rate is going down constantly - am I slacking or is that the way body adjusts?

I just started a new bout this week.  I've done a full round before, and got OK results, but I didn't focus very heavily on diet.  This time around I'm trying to keep track of how many calories I'm eating and burning.  

My question is, do any of y'all have a solid method for calculating the number of calories burned during the workouts?  Myfitnesspal tells me that at my weight I'm burning about 400-450 for a high impact workout during Plyo Circuit and Cardio Power and Resistance.  Beachbody says that the workouts burn 1000 calories an hour, but that seems high.  My heart rate monitor is terribly inaccurate, grossly overestimating the calories burned. And, finally, [this calculator](http://www.triathlontrainingblog.com/calculators/calories-burned-calculator-based-on-average-heart-rate/) tells me I'm burning 650-750 depending on how I estimate my VO2 max and average heart rate.

Does anyone have any recommendations for reconciling these vastly different numbers?  I want to be sure I'm netting the right goals.  Too high, and Ill obviously have poor results, but I'm leery about injury if I'm not giving my body enough fuel.

After about 30 minutes of lying in agony, I finally stand up, then run into the bathroom and puke a grand total of five times in 20 minutes. I was literally hating myself for attempting insanity. After I threw up for the fifth and final time, I felt better and eventually went to bed. The next day Insanity was just taunting me. I thought to myself, ""Well today maybe won't be as bad, and I'll pace myself better,"" to which I did and I didn't puke!

I'm 20, and for the past week and a half, I haven't had an erection unless my girlfriend stimulated me to do so and we've both been busy so that's been few and far between. So, today I was showering and the lo-and-behold my member is standing at attention and it tacked on about .20inch girth and length.

I do have one concern. My lower back is still aching a little bit during and briefly after the exercise. I know there was a post earlier in the week, but I thought it was different enough to warrant discussion in my post. I have been trained for years to sing in the operatic style with ""engaged"" abs to help with airflow and to support properly. I was trained to do this in a very particular way. We activate our muscles by lightly engaging them immediately after we start singing, but are never to clinch (over-engage/over tighten) the abdominal muscles. Also, when singing is not occurring, you relax the muscles...basically to re-energize and recover. Do these things hold true in exercise as welll? Do I tighten my core as much as I can, or just enough to know they are engaged? And during the short breaks, do I relax my abs or keep them light to prepare?

Before I ask my question, let me tell you a little bit more about me (unsure if that will even matter for the question.) 

 So about a year ago I decided to change, not really sure why, guess I just got sick of how I looked.  I was 6'2"", 375 pounds, unhealthy as hell, and had bigger breasts than most women did (I'm a dude). Since early January of last year, I managed to drop my weight down to 265, on nothing other than running and doing some weight training, and eating smaller portions and limiting myself to a 2,000 calorie diet~ and not engorging on pasta/pizza every meal. Still though, I am completely ignorant on the facts of nutrition, I just try to watch what I eat.

That being said, two weeks ago (I have one day left of week 2) I started Insanity, and mother of god, my ass has never been kicked so hard. To my surprise, I've been able actually make it through the majority of the workouts, maybe not at the pace of most, but I am able.  I dig deep and push through.  I've also dropped my weight to 262 since I started, and I can see the changes in the mirror, my body is getting more toned and my fat is starting to shift to different places, as a matter of fact, I have ankles now!

Part of my problem in life is that I am a insanely picky eater, I mean to the extreme.  The Insanity diet recommendations do not really work for my food palette.  I eat rather well though (I think), small portions of ham and eggs, protein shakes, and on rare occasions I like to cook a small sirloin.  With that in mind, I am human, and if I do not cheat on my diet I'll literally go insane, no pun intended.  I LOVE pizza, I LOVE pasta, and sadly most of those foods are horrendous for someone trying to drop weight.

Now onto my question.  Since i'm completely ignorant when it comes to nutrition, my question pertains to fat consumption.  Do I need to burn more fat than I consume to actually lose weight? This pertains to my cheat day, as on a normal day I burn more fat than I consume.  For example if I cheat, and consume a a total of 60 grams of fat (large amount, just example) but I only burn 40 grams, will my weight not change?  I know you have to burn more calories than you consume to lose weight, but I don't understand how fat works into the equation.  Could someone shed some light onto this for me, preferably in a way an nutrition ignorant person can understand?

Sorry if this isn't the place to turn, I just don't know many subreddits pertaining to weight loss.

First off I'd like to say thank you for posting in this sub. Seeing everyone's before and after pictures is incredibly motivating!!!

I am technically in my fifth week of Insanity, however, I got sick in week 4 and missed Thursday, Friday, and Saturday so I'm re-starting week 4. I am feeling super bummed out right now because I don't understand why these videos aren't getting any easier for me. I've essentially been doing the same workout videos for a month, yet every time I fire it up I'm feeling the exact same amount of exhaustion every time. After a month shouldn't I be breezing through the videos? Yesterday I was doing cardio power and resistance and could not even get through the warm up without taking a few breathers. 

Is this normal? Is anyone else experiencing the same frustration? Am i doing something wrong? Are my expectations way too high? 

This is something that's really bothering me and I'm worried it will start to affect my morale. I can definitely see results on my body already. My quads, biceps, triceps, and obliques are WAY more developed and I'm seeing more muscle on myself. I'm not seeing much weight loss/fat loss...probably cause I'm not following the diet program but I might change that in month 2. Ill post the results of my fit test below. Thanks for reading this, I know it was a lot but I really need to blow off some steam to someone who knows what I'm facing here.

Insanity gives me what I need, and I'll explain further:

1 - The warmups get you going right away.  I've never been a guy to ""stretch"" ...I know it's terrible to not stretch, but I've always been someone who's run 2 - 3 miles without even getting loose.  Insanity gets your blood flowing to start off, and when we finally do begin stretching in the workout it's nice to get loose while catching your breath.

2 - I need to workout non-stop with very little breaks.  In gyms with weight lifting I often found myself zoning out between sets.  This kills my rhythm or mood, and sometimes I left the gym mid workout out of boredom.  Due to this, I've never had a workout regimen I could complete.  Insanity creates a fast paced structured program, and even the 30 second breaks keep you from walking away and turning the TV off!

3 - I've always been in ""good"" shape, but never in GREAT shape.  I have a bit of body fat on me and always have based off the laziness explained above, but I could always run 3 miles flat no problem at all prior to doing insanity.  This workout should get me over the hump I've always restricted myself from passing due to my lack of structure.

The way almost everyone is taking them makes it difficult to convey an accurate image.

Step 1. Setup camera at a height and angle you can easily replicate (tripod, tabletop etc). The distance between you and the camera is very important. (You don't want to be larger in the after shot just because the camera was closer). Preferably don't use digital zoom. Find a wall and put your heels to it for the photo.

Step 2. Lighting, make sure to take the picture at night with the same light source for both before and after pictures. The light must be in the same exact position for both pictures. It's preferable to not use flash.

Step 3. Tips for posing.
Do not flex. (You can save it for glamour shots)
Keep your arms and legs close together.
Make sure to exhale and hold breath until pic is taken. (A normal exhale, do not exhale to much)
Doing these will insure a more accurate pose.

Reluctantly, I decided to take a break. Two weeks later and I finally felt confident enough that I could do Insanity without re-injuring it. Instead of starting over from Day 1, I just picked up where I left off (Pure Cardio and Cardio Abs).

While I'm not as good as I was after doing Insanity for 2 straight weeks, it feels great to be back doing it. I get such a rush of endorphins after each exercise!

Anyway, I just wanted to post this to people who are feeling discouraged because they missed a day or two, or perhaps were like me where they got hurt and had to miss even more, that it's okay.

1346048983.0,7,self.insanityworkout,yw5h8,Insanity Success Story - Lost 60lbs over 1 year - mainly thanks to 2 rounds of Insanity,7,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/yw5h8/insanity_success_story_lost_60lbs_over_1_year/,"Hello All, 
I just stumbled upon this subreddit from a link that made it to the top few pages of reddit. I felt compelled to share my story since I have had much success with Insanity and thought it might motivate some people, or convince them to give Insanity a try.

Backstory: 
Shortly after I got engaged I decided it was time to lose some weight. Not only did I want to do this for my wedding, but I also was the heaviest I had ever been and felt it was time to make a change. I started my loss in January of 2011, weighing in at 254lbs (I'm 27 and  5'11"") - I began to start eating differently and running - lost about 10lbs in 2 months -- however I developed some pretty bad shin splints and decided to take a different approach. After my shin splints healed I decided to give Insanity a try ..started of March 2011. I was addicted. Since I had been an athlete most of my life, I never really felt satisfied after a workout unless I was absolutely fatigued -- Insanity takes this satisfaction to an entire new level. 

Once I got into the first week, I made some more significant changes to my diet. I did not really follow any ""diet"" - I simply just made smarter choices. Eating lean meats, lots of veggies, cutting out sweets, beer, diet soda. I tried to maintain an intake of 1200-1500 calories per day. I also would make sure to eat something every few hours, generally snacking on a protein bar, or something in between meals. By the end of the 60 days - I weighed 218. So I dropped about 20lbs during insanity. Also, interestingly enough, the 2-3 weeks following the program, I dropped another 5lbs even though I had not been doing any exercising (I feel this is mainly due to my increased muscle mass from the program, plus I was still eating pretty healthy). 

I remained fairly inactive for the remainder of the summer, and near September I noticed I was slipping back into old habits and actually gained a couple lbs back. From this realization I told myself - ""I WILL NOT GAIN ALL THAT WEIGHT BACK!"" -- so what did I do? Insanity ROUND 2!

I started this round at the beginning of October, and I began eating really healthy again, just as I did before during the first round. However, once I got to the second month – I made another dramatic change to my diet – I decided to cut out all chicken and red meat / and almost all Fish – basically Vegetarian. My reasoning behind this is a whole other post in of itself.  I chose to do it right though – I bought a book called “transitioning to vegetarianism” and made sure that I was supplementing my diet with plenty of protein, and vitamins and minerals that you cannot get from just veggies. 

After I finished the second round of Insanity – I never felt better. I was down to about 203lbs. I continued in my Vegetarian diet through the holidays, and I was also doing 2-3 insanity workouts a week + a run here and there… By January I had reached the lightest I had been since Freshman year of High school --- 192lbs!! 
Since then I have actually done Insanity for a 3rd time – but did not really lose any weight as I was focused more on just maintaining – I did get much more toned though. In summary I would just like to offer some tips/advice/notes from my experience with Insanity. 

* I would recommend it to anyone – I have recommended it to many people already! (unless you have medical    issues with your back or knees – see your doc first) 
* The first week of each month is the hardest – STICK WITH IT
* I started to see the most dramatic results in the last week and a half of each month. – results will come! Stick with it! 
* My favorite thing about Insanity is that it really just makes you feel lighter on your feet, the core strengthening does wonders for overall structural support of your body – That combined with the increased energy makes you feel like you are back in your PRIME! 
If anyone has any questions for me regarding my experience, or questions regarding the workout itself, please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer. Thanks for reading!

Just finished my second fit test for Insanity. The first fit test was the day I started, two weeks ago. Improvements across the board, trackable through eight workouts. I used to play collegiate water polo so my legs are pretty good but my upper body is so weak. I'm actually thinking about doing some moderate weight lifting or some pushups on the side or something for my upper body strength. 

Been sticking with the plan, but more following just a calorie cutting plan with a focus on high protein/reduced carbs. I drink a glass of MRI Black Powder before my workout (friend gave me the container, I figured I'd use it) and then a mixture of powdered gatorade and L-glutamine during and after my workout. This has absolutely reduced my soreness, but not eliminated it. No biggie though, pain is weakness leaving the body!

I suck at pushups. Also for Switch Kicks I count every kick, is that the general counting idea?

A week from today I'll be an Insanity graduate ready to tackle a second round before I'm ready to move onto something else.

My primary thought is how absolutely beat to shit my body is right now.  I've got soreness all over my body, from my right ankle to my left wrist, to my shoulders, my legs, and my stomach.  Mentally I'm exhausted from the routine that Insanity puts me in: get home from work, quick snack and glass of water, wait 20 minutes, Insanity, cook dinner, eat dinner, an hour to relax, bed.  

However, I absolutely love it.

At the end of next week I'll be posting my fit test results for the entire circuit sans the first week's fit test: I was too out of shape to even keep count.  I'll then be taking an entire 7 days off with no Insanity or exercise whatsoever.  My body needs a solid week off to fully recover before I dive back in.  Right now I'm most excited to see how well I do on the first fit test of round 2.  

For everyone in month 1 or just starting out, enjoy the journey!  I'm sort of sad that it's almost over even though I have another 11 weeks until round 2 is finished, but knowing that it won't be completely fresh or daunting is making me a bit nostalgic for the first few weeks of the workout.

Warning: Long-ish and ""rant""-like

I love playing soccer, and all through high school, I played extensively. It was a passion and it wasn't unusual that I played for 2 teams at a time, and had lots of practice and 2 or 3 games a week. I was proud of my cardio and stamina and one of the only people that could play every minute of every game that was assigned to me.

Then, first year of college hit me. Bogged down with a heavy workload and bad eating habits, I naturally gained fat (not a whole lot, maybe 10 lbs) and with no cardio training, stamina went down. Also, since most people I knew just lifted weights and getting bigger seemed to be more aesthetically pleasing, I did that and gained some weight that way. But having cut out all cardio, combined with gained weight, my cardio, stamina etc. was steadily declining.

This summer, I went to play a simple pick up game of soccer at the school fields, and about 15-20 minutes into it, I was done. Physically, I was beat, yes, but the worst was mentally. Being able to control what my body does used to be a point of pride with me. 

I started Insanity a week later with gradual improvement. Today was supposed to be my second fit test, but I skipped it. I decided to join the guys at the school for another round of soccer. This time, I was able to hold my own and able to at least keep up for the 2 hour session. I know Shaun T (and everyone in this sub) stresses how important the fit test and keeping track of improvement is, but to me, today's pick up game tells me more and keeps me more motivated than any number on a sheet of paper will ever do for me.

I just started Insanity and am hoping to lose weight while toning.  I used to be thin but lost a lot of weight when I was sick and my metabolism just crashed!  I piled on weight in a few months and have been struggling to lose it for the last 3 years.  I lost 7 pounds in 6 months by logging in all my calories (1200 on average with some days going over but full of lots of nutrition).  I'm afraid that I will eat more calories and not lose weight with insanity.  I know lots of people that successfully lost weight but how many of those had real metabolic issues?  Currently I'm 5'4"" and 156 pounds.  I eat every few hours and good quality meals (lots of nutrition, veggies and lean protein).  Since starting Insanity, I upped my calories to 1450-1500 calories.  I feel really full after 1350 calories but force myself to eat another 100-150.  Also, I have to take like 6-7 mini  breaks during the workout so I am not burning the full amount of calories.

During and after the fit test I got a migraine and started to get nauseous for a bit: took a 20 minute lie-down with some tylenol, then ate lunch and took another hour break before beginning Max Interval. I was nervous about the fit-test because I took a week off inbetween Weeks 3 and 4 because of my ankle hurting, so I thought that threw me off, but I seem to have mostly improved, although exhaustion really took me at the end of the test.

When the work out was done I collapsed on the floor hysterically laughing from the exertion! However, I was pleased to see results forming, and after editing my progress pics side-by-side, I'm seeing some development that I hadn't thought was there yet!

But damn, month 2 is going to suck. Here's to hoping that I see FAR more progress this month.

Tomorrow will be day one for my wife and I.  I am beyond nervous for some reason!  Haha. Ive gone through and read most of what people have to say for tips and advice so I feel like I am somewhat prepared though.  Im just excited to start getting back in shape.  Little back story on me since I am bored at work.

I was a typical guy that found out how easy it was to just eat fast food all the time.  Even after getting married my wife and I kept up that disgusting habit.  Then december 6, 2012 came around and I was in the emergency room finding out I am diabetic.  It nearly tore my wife in pieces thinking that she was aiding me in literally killing myself and quite honestly, I didnt even care that the doctor said If we kept up the lifestyle it would probably kill me. Seeing how hard my wife took it though, really put it into perspective for me and that day I started to take stuff seriously.

On june 6th was my 6 month mark for my wife and I not having fast food.  Granted we still go to resteraunts and dont always get the low carb low calorie meals, but its a start! Our major rule is that if it has a drve through, we dont go there (with the exception of starbucks every once in a while.  Sugar free mocha frap is awesome btw)  I was 25 at 5'6 and last october I weighed 246lbs. 

The doctor said I would most likely be insulin dependant for the rest of my life and all that there was to do really was maintain.  I took that as a challenge.  After 1.5 months with diet alone I was taken off of insulin and 1 month after that taken off of oral medicine as well.  I have not had any sugar regulating medicine since febuary 14th.  

Now with that being said, I feel really accomplished already and proud as well.  Ive lost 45 pounds but have maintained at about 205ish for a couple months now and am feeling fatter each day.  So thats where my story comes to insanity.  My wife has been talking about doing it for months but I just kept blowing it off as a gimmick like everything else on tv.  Then I find this subreddit and immediately change my mind.

I am hoping that I can experience some of the same results you great people have and be able to submit some awesome before and after pics to you all in about 61 days.  

I do have one question though.  I work 12 hour rotating shifts of either 6 am to 6 pm or 6pm-6am.  Does anyone here work a similar schedule and have advice of how to make this system work with the tyoe of schedule I have, particularly when I have to switch from nights to days and only have 36 hours off, would I do 1 work out in that time or two?  Any advice is appreciated!

i have explained myself in [**this**](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1cllvi/anyone_know_what_these_mean/)  post at r/loseit. but i think i should post the same stuff here for comments. thank you.

i have been on a 1600cal diet for almost 2.5 months. i used to do some cardio earlier, nothing serious.

for the past 2 weeks i have been trying to do the insanity workouts, so far so good. i stuck with the exercised, tried to do them as best as i could. 
i have noticed that i lost some musclemass. :) not that i have any muscle definition or that the scale i was one accurate.

my first question is that how do you think i am doing so far?

second, could me eating 1600cals and doing insanity burning muscle more than fat? i dont know if thats possible.

i am a  1.82m, 32  year old male that used to do no exercise.

Breakfast - Cream of wheat with chopped apples and a little 'i can't believe its not butter'

Snacks - Usually cut apples with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter or a handful of mixed nuts, or a little packet of fruit snacks

Lunch - A quick, ready to make mac and cheese bowl (250 cal)

Dinner - Tuna (w/eggs, miracle whip, salt, pepper) spread on a leaf of lettuce (Think a sandwich but instead of bread, with lettuce)
