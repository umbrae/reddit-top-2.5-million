There's a one minute overview of the whole Kobe Situation too: http://bit.ly/kobescam

Last update: We need your support to help fully tell this story and to finish our documentary on crowdfunding. We want to educate, inform and inspire the world on what's happening with the crowdfunding revolution. 
Please consider backing and sharing our own Kickstarter project: http://bit.ly/KickKS

EDIT 1: WHOA! As a couple of minutes ago - Kobe Red's funding was suspended! Clearly this project wasn't straightforward at all. Would have been the biggest fraud in Kickstarter history. We're going after these guys for an explanation. Stay tuned! More updates on twitter @kickstartedfilm

For the last couple days, my business partner and I (both producers and directors on a crowdfunding documentary called Kickstarted) have been looking into a project called Kobe Red Beef Jerky.

We first contacted them to send us a video of themselves answering a few questions about their project. After a bunch of red flags and misleading info later, we started a major fraud investigation as something wasn't right with this project. 
Initially, they turned down an attempt on our end to film with them in person. Instead, they offered to send us video of an event they held (which is not what we asked for - we likely couldn't use that footage). They then  posted an update on their page that they were going to be in our film. We never promised that - and the way the posted everything was misleading. 
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kobered/kobe-red-100-japanese-beer-fed-kobe-beef-jerky/posts/507844

Soon after, a number of concerned backers messaged us about Kobe's potential illegitimacy - so we investigated even further. Here are some of our findings.

1) Magnus Fun Inc is not a California registered company. 
2) The email address used to register Magnus Fun's website is the same that was used to register a site called ""Uhadme.com"" - which, is now down. However, a cached version of the site shows that a person named Stanley Owens operated the site from an address in Chicago. This same Stanley Owens person was actively attacking people who questioned Kobe's legitimacy on the message boards - but without associating himself with the company (when clearly he was). At the very least - if this wasn't fraud - it was misleading.
3) Amazon Payments for this account is registered to a Desjon Allen - who has the EXACT same Chicago address as Stanley Owens.
4) The student filmmaker they referenced in their post about shooting video for us - someone named Aaron Gerber - is impossible to uncover online - at least in relation to the facts Magnus/Kobe shared.
5) There is NO evidence on any social media we searched or through Google that anyone has been or tasted Kobe Red at any of the taste tests they've reportedly held (One in Boston, LA, Long Beach, and Austin). It seems weird that not one person outside of the message board would make a post about how delicious this jerky is. 
6) All of the accounts defending Kobe - or associated with them - seem to be relatively new.
7) All the normal smell tests on this project come up bad: no names associated with the creators, no photos, odd video, no tract record, strange start up story with unique elements...take a look for yourselves
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kobered/kobe-red-100-japanese-beer-fed-kobe-beef-jerky

This project has about 90 minutes to go. Definitely something to keep an eye on - I hope it has Kickstarter's attention - as this is a potential major fraud!

tl;dr Some very fishy stuff going on with Kobe Red Beef Jerky!

We'll be looking into this more. Please check out our site as well - as we are also tell the stories of non-fraudulent project creators.
www.kickstartedmovie.com

EDIT 2: Magnus Fun, Inc - the Kickstarter profile of the Kobe Red project just cancelled a pledge they made to our project! Must have pissed them off by looking into them :)

EDIT 3: Just spoke with the administrators at the Ink &amp; Iron Fest where Kobe Red reportedly handed out samples on June 8th. They were not a vendor there at all (there was another jerky company called Jerky Jerks - but definitely no Kobe Red). It is also unlikely that they handed out the product in the parking lot as it was patrolled by the 60 security guards on staff at the time.

MAJOR UPDATE: Someone claiming to be Aaron Gerber - the student filmmaker Magnus referenced as having filmed with them - has reached out to me directly via Kickstarter. This person has yet to confirm their identity with us. I've made that request. I'd like to clear him of this situation if he is indeed not involved like he told me. He claims to be 17 yo and having been approached by someone named Todd Scott to film this past weekend. He says he was paid $40 to do it (although Magnus the services were supplied for free). Mr. Scott 1) did not have any jerky with him, 2) read from a script for about 30 minutes and 3) had the footage recorded to a memory card that he brought himself. Aaron doesn't have the footage.  
Clearly something is amiss here - we will update you when and if we get more concrete information.

FINAL UPDATE (6.16): These guys are at it again! They tried to sabotage our film project's Kickstarter these last two days as a form of retribution.

As you know this subreddit isn't as good as it could be. It's full of vague titles, few people voting, and lots of blog spam . Well it's time to change that and make this place more useful.

**Descriptive titles**  
  The first big change you can see is that the categories are gone. While it was a good idea in theory, it was just making the subreddit more cluttered. Instead, we will be putting much more emphasis on using descriptive titles. No more ""Help my friend!"", ""A new short film"", ""Save my local ___!"". The whole point of Kickstarter is to fund creative projects, so in your title describe why the project is unique! Why is it worth funding? What makes it different? These are the types of questions that your title should address.  

  **User Flair**  
Another thing we added is user flair. Project creators who have at least $100 dollars backed are eligible for the flair. Just send us a message with proof and we'll add it for you. The purpose of the flair is to give this place more of a community vibe. It should also make it easier to know who you're talking too, and if you should take their advice. 

 **Rule changes**  
As you can see in the sidebar, we added quite a few rules. The goal of these changes is try and improve the quality of posts on this sub, people should come here to find cool new projects and to discuss various aspects of kickstarter, not just to plug their own project. We'll be tweaking/adding rules as we get feedback so please make sure to read the rules before you post.   
**Feedback**

In our film, we will be profiling the best crowdfunding stories from the incredible period of entreprenuerial / creative independence. In fact, we are in the midst of a campaign to raise funds to finish the film (http://bit.ly/KickKS).

Last week, we helped (with the notable assistance of many suspicious backers) uncover what would have been one of the biggest outright frauds on Kickstater - the Kobe Red Beef Jerky project. There is a story about our investigation [here](http://bit.ly/kobescam) our original reddit thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1g9utn/likely_major_kickstarter_fraud_uncovered_kobe_red/) and stories in the [Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/14/kobe-beef-jerky-fraud-scam-kickstarter_n_3443157.html), [NY Post](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/real_jerky_fund_fest_KvkonuUAYf9NXBZM1QUqKP) and [more](http://qz.com/94597/kickstarter-almost-enabled-a-120000-fraud-and-its-not-the-first/). 

Now, as a form of retribution, we believe these scammers are actively trying to sabotage and undermine our own Kickstarter campaign for our documentary. 
**I'm hoping this community can help us firmly establish that it is indeed the same people and hopefully but an end to their crowdfunding abuse.  Here's a short rundown of what we know already. We're still investigating and will share every new development that we can.**

More on the Kobe Red scandal:
- The two main names we pulled from Kobe Red were Desjon Allen and Stanley Owens. We have some information on both but we can't publish them for legal reasons.
- They have tried to get us off the scent a couple of times - including recently pretending to be a student film maker and telling us the real person behind the scam was someone named ""Todd Alexander Scott."" There's more information on this in the original Reddit thread. 
- I discovered that Desjon Allen - who is a [musician](http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/star-wars/articles/29754/title/saturday-knights#reply) of [some kind](http://www.reverbnation.com/desjondeluxe) - also tried to scam people last year by setting up a phony ""George Zimmerman Defense Fund."" [Here's the original 4Chan discussion](http://pastebin.com/0sTPwKcn) where he was outted for his actions. That link includes contact information I won't/can't verify. I will say that we've seen that 818 phone number associated with Stanley Owens and the address with Allen. *Suspicious*

How they are trying to sabotage our Kickstarter campaign for [*Kickstarted*](http://bit.ly/KickKS) :
- Yesterday we got an out-of-nowhere $10,000 pledge from someone claiming to be someone named ""Quentin tto"" from Beverly Hills. We were suspicious given our Kobe Red involvement and messaged this person - who has never backed anything else before from that profile - to thank them. They replied with this [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Uqhtj4D), basically saying he'd bring in more money. We hesitated adding new tiers given our suspicions about this guy.
- This morning around 6am EST, we got two new backers - each for $10k. The emails from Kickstarter reported their names to be Ted Hutson and Bill Willard. However, by the time they showed up in our backer report, the names were changed to ""4q"" and ""Friend of q."" Around that same time, we got this message from Quentin tto (note: first message is after we asked him to clarify what we should set the $9k goal at). [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/0zQuO0B)
- At this point, our suspicions were through the roof. None of these profiles had ever backed a project. This was a lot of money coming from someone who didn't really seem to like us all that much - and were out of nowhere. We've had other big backers, but these guys very different. 
- We messaged Quentin back - still wanting to know his motives and more about him - with a really straightforward but polite request. This was that exchange. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ktmPmru). Seems odd that he'd turn on us that fast. He also didn't cancel all three pledges. Only two. The other two were reduced to $1 - seemingly so that could stay on our comment boards and updates. 
- Which is of course what they did next. ""4q"" posted on our comment board just a few minutes ago. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qfXt0mj)
- We're not the only people they've attacked. A user who was also instrumental in uncovering their fraud found out that these guys were trashing his business online.

These guys are trying to attack and spoil crowdfunding. Our film isn't about fraud - although we will likely tell this story in it - it's about the people who use crowdfunding to pursue their dreams. The beauty of crowdfunding is that we, ""the crowd,"" can be an instrument to do cool things together and vet out the good from the bad. I'm hoping you guys can help us stop these guys and put an end to this shit. In some cases, they've tried to steal your money and now they are trying to prevent our success by pledging phony money and trashing us publicly. 

Let's work together to nail these guys. Any information we can drum up will be shared here. We hope you'll do the same. 

**tl;dr - The dudes behind Kobe Red Beef Jerky are actively trying to sabotage our film project's Kickstarter campaign as a form of retribution. We want Reddit's help to stop them.**

EDIT 1: Here are the profiles created by these guys to make phony pledges (which have all since been limited to $1 as expected) and to troll us: [quentin tto](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/61044416), [4q](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/2021071606), [friend of q](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/546797782).

My lack of correct formatting on Reddit makes it look like it's more.  Skip to bottom for the PDF that's easier to read.

5 reasons why I will not be supporting the ""WORLD'S LARGEST CUP OF BOBA TEA"" on Kickstarter

1.	The 626 Night Market is the one that has created this.  We all know 626 Night Market has made enough money to create this themselves and has in fact already started the process (see point 2).  They will be making money hand over fist on this. 
a.	They are asking people to fund this cup AND the rewards (see point 5).  
b.	They will be charging people to come to the 626 Night Market to see the cup. “We will unveil the cup at our August 626 Night Market.”  
c.	They will be charging the vendors for a booth at the 626 Night Market. “We will unveil the cup at our August 626 Night Market.”  
2.	In the Kickstarter, they stated that ""To account for that manufacture time, we already started the manufacture process.""  “Sure, if you don't hop on, life will continue as usual. Nothing lost. But think about it. If you don't hop on, nothing will happen.”  
a.	Are they saying that the cup won’t be made or it you won’t be personally affected.  Since they have already started the manufacture process, I would assume they already will be doing this with or without the Kickstarter funds.  They are just doing the Kickstarter to get reimbursed.  
3.	This is a waste of food. ""It will hold 320 gallons of boba tea—that's over 2,500 cups of your standard boba drink”
a.	Where will they be getting this tea from?  What will happen to the tea after the record has been achieved?  Will it be kept on display for 2 days of night market or will it be drained and refilled the next day?  Assuming this is the most common type of boba tea, it will be boba milk tea?  Milk won’t be good if left out in the hot August heat all day.
b.	2500 cups of boba is a lot of drink to be wasted.   There are better things to do with that food/money.
4.	 It is really not all that big.  “The cup itself will be 6 feet tall situated on a 2.5 feet high platform. The straw will extend its height an additional 3.5' with a grand total height of 12 feet!”
a.	6 foot cup.  Really?  That’s it?  6 feet?  I’ve seen aquariums larger and this is essentially an aquarium.  
b.	What is the current record for “World’s largest cup of boba tea?” How is the record measured?  By gallons?  Total height?  Height of cup?  It shouldn’t be hard to top this.  Make the straw 4 feet and you got a new record.
5.	The financials don't make sense:  ""Boba Cup: $3600 (41%); Construction: $1560 (18%); Rewards: $1514 (17%); Transportation/Storage: $1000 (11%); Mandatory fees: $1151 (13%)""
a.	It doesn’t even add up to $9000.  It adds up to $8225.  Where is the extra $775 going?
b.	Boba cup: $3600 – Please break this down.
i.	The cost of the boba tea? 2500 cups (stated in the Kickstarter) that would be $1.44 a cup.
ii.	Cost to make the cup – From working with aquariums, a custom aquarium would be more than $3000.
iii.	Cost of cup and tea – doubtful
c.	Construction: $1560 - Please break this down.
i.	I assume this is the costs of the platform to hold the cup?  Knowing nothing of platform costs I would leave this up to you:
1.	8.33 lbs for a gallon of water.  I assume boba will be similar, and will round down to 8 lbs.  For 320 gallons, this would be 2,560 lbs or 1.28 tons.
d.	Rewards: $1514 – These don’t even make sense… We have to pay for the rewards?  Shouldn’t the rewards be… you know… rewards?  
i.	$15 for name on cup
ii.	$20 for a tshirt &amp; sticker - 100 available &amp; $25 for shirt &amp; sticker shipped -100 available
1.	As someone who has done screen printing, the cost to make a tshirt is about $10.  A sticker can’t be as much.
2.	Assuming the basic, only 200 tshirts, that’s already $4000.  Granted they could be taking a loss on this, but they should state this.  Even assuming $10 a tshirt that’ll be $2000.  That’s not even taking the other rewards into consideration.  Just another in the series of bad financials.
iii.	$600 for 4 inch x 4 inch logo + 3 of previous awards 
1.	$600 for 16 sq in for 2 days of advertising?  Doesn't make good business sense.  Check out the current advertising costs for real advertisement: http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/how-to-buy/rates/.  For comparison $600 you could 2 weeks on a mall display.  Granted that it won’t be on a world record cup, but you get 2 weeks with a lot more space.
iv.	$3000 for 12 inch x 12 inch logo &amp; 10 of previous awards - 3 available.  
1.	With a diameter of 3.5 feet diameter, the circumference should be around 9.5 feet around.  What is going to happen with the rest of the space (approximately 6 feet) of space?  I would assume they will be putting their own logo and possibly other logos there?  Why should we pay for their free advertising or possibly advertising that other people/companies already paid for?  
2.	Doesn't make good business sense.  1 sq foot of advertising for 2 days.  Check out the current advertising costs for real advertisement: http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/how-to-buy/rates/.  For comparison $3000 you could 3 months on a mall display.  Granted that it won’t be on a world record cup, but you get 3 months with a lot more space.
e.	Transportation/Storage: $1000 – I assume this is mostly Transportation fee?  Getting a public storage would be less than $100 a month.
f.	Mandatory fees: $1151 – Ummm… What are Mandatory fees?  I don’t believe that there are permits or taxes needed for this?  Kickstarter fees?  What is this referring to?

this subreddit uses CSS to hide downvote arrows. While I do understand the good intention behind this, I find it problematic for the following reasons:

* Some posts, e.g. obvious scams, just deserve a downvote
* The vote system is how reddit works, and judging from reddit's success, it works quite well. Removing the downvote button reduces it to facebook's ""like"" system.
* Downvoting is still possible by manipulating or deactivating the CSS, e.g. using firebug or chrome's built-in ""examine element"" feature. This is the most serious problem as users who know that have more weight in this subreddit than users who don't. 

I therefore suggest that downvote arrows should be visible by default.

Thanks for listening! If you don't like my proposal, you do now know how to downvote it ;)",,False,self,t5_2rquu,False,,Backer,True,t3_1ihelg,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1ihelg/meta_stop_hiding_downvote_arrows/,

* **RFID, Money Clip, Card Holding Wallets** Haven't we seen the same take on a mostly original design all through 2012?
* **Products available online already** Kickstarter is about being part of a project and not about catching you out scamming us on a $100 dollar watch that sells for 20.
* **Apple Anything** By now I am pretty sure that most people have an iphone holder, case speaker etc. How about the other products people use?
* **Bamboo** I am all for sustainable products but can we get more than just bamboo?
* **Food carts in your home town** Are food carts the new Starbucks?
* **People that cry** the minute they don't get a product on the very day the project originally set forward to achieve and then spam the comments section.
* **Please fund my trip around 'Enter country name here'** At least give us a decent project you are working on. A photo montage of takeaway food is not good enough.

1370624900.0,30,self.kickstarter,1fvf8j,I'm regretting using Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter...,64,34,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1fvf8j/im_regretting_using_indiegogo_instead_of/," As the title says, I'm regretting it for several reasons now and being a first time crowd funding project creator I thought I did my homework.  One thing I didn't count on was just the name of each site. Kickstarter carry's more credibility because its more popular and you hear them mentioned on TV and the news. When I tell people my campaign is at ''indiegogo'' their like ''indie..what? is it safe?'' and ''Never heard of them''.

 The main reason I picked indiegogo over kickstarter was it seems at kickstarter only big projects get attention and it also seemed like there were a Lot of projects there that didn't need crowd funding and were just big company's getting others to ''foot the bill''. I am most likely wrong but that whole Veronica Mars campaign gave me a bad vibe. Not only did Warner Bros basically get a free movie but it stole thunder from small business/projects like mine. Of course the very obvious part that Warner Bros Did NOT need help making a movie.  

 I'm running my campaign on a paper thin budget. I don't have funds to have professional videos or photography and I literally have done Everything (Patents, 3D CAD and blue prints, prototype design and manufacture, silicone molds and everything else) all by myself to maximize every penny that went into making it this far. 

 With all of that work I've also had my small business and product recognized and granted membership in Startup America Which is a Presidential ordered group to promote small business and inventions. I had to jump through many rings of fire showing hundreds of documents and business plan/financials to become a sponsored member. My company Zynko is also a proud donor to the ''No Kid hungry'' school lunch program.

 I felt if I used kickstarter that all my hard work would go unnoticed when big company's ran campaigns there because of their productions and budget. But... It all came down to the name of the crowd funding site that seems to be crushing my campaign.  

 Advice to anyone considering on starting a campaign, Be ready to compete with the big boys who have lots of money to begin with and you've got to really dig in and be creative. I hope you'll have better luck then me.      

 If anyone would like to see my campaign, here's the indiegogo link

1362948308.0,37,self.kickstarter,1a1h9f,Something I've noticed - Mysterious high-roller backers. Scam?,43,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1a1h9f/something_ive_noticed_mysterious_highroller/,"I don't know if I'd call this a *trend*, but it's something I've noticed recently that makes me wonder. You'll see a kickstarter that looks like its not going to meet its projected goals, fumbling along to the end. Just when it seems bleak, a few days before it closes, suddenly **a saviour appears**. There's two explanations for this I can think of.

1. Philanthropist millionaires browsing the ""ending soon"" tab.
2. Scammy pledges, either completely fake with no intention of paying, or a pseudonym of the creator effectively ""covering"" the rest.

Does Kickstarter have anything in place to prevent the second thing? If a certain %-age of the funding doesn't go through, it would make sense to cancel all payments, since the funding goals aren't met. Otherwise, it seems like a ""clever"" way to get around the ""protection"" of donating to a kickstarter.

Want to know what I'm talking about? Here are two recent examples:

**Scandock**

When I first noticed this project (via tumblr), it was lumbering along at about $20k of its goal. But the project ended successfully raising it's $100k goal. But there's something not quite right, if you take a look at its [Kicktraq](http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/1908696970/scandock-the-post-pc-scanner/) data... On January 28th, 4 backers managed to pledge $17k between them (along with 'bumped' pledges from others). Even more interesting is that on Feb 8th, the project managed to make $2500 while *losing* a backer. And even *more* interesting than that is Feb 4th, where they made $9000 without gaining a single backer - ie completely from other backers raising their pledge. The project made $106,683 from 79 backers. That's an average pledge of about $1350 per backer.

However, if you look at the [project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1908696970/scandock-the-post-pc-scanner/?ref=kicktraq) page you see 16 backers at pledges below $100, for a total of $338 between them. In fact, if you remove all but the highest pledges (assuming that if someone is going to sink thousands into a project they'll want the highest reward tier) you end up with those top 7 backers pledging a whopping **$12591** each.

**""Encounter"" in Bronze**

This is a much smaller-scale project, but it seems to have the same sort of shenanigans following it. A modest $14,000 goal with 69 backers. Once again we look at the [Kicktraq](http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/521982621/encounter-in-bronze/) data to see what happened. On March 1st we see the obvious hump - $5075 from 3 backers. This is a huge number and represents more than a third of the project's goal. And, by looking at the [project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/521982621/encounter-in-bronze) page, we see that the highest-tier, $5000, has been filled, we assume by that one benevolent backer. Also interesting to note is that on March 6th, 4 backers contributed $3000 between them - despite the fact that *none* of the project's reward tiers higher than $225 have been filled (with the exception of the single $5000 reward). 

What's going on? 

Has anyone else noticed projects with ""mysterious successes"" like this?

Does Kickstarter have any way to control for this kind of abuse?

Immediately, it triggered some alert bells in our heads - we already had the products of this project!  RGB LED strips are everywhere now for cheap - even Ikea.  However, this Kickstarter seemed to be the same exact product. Note that the project creators claim they designed this project themselves, yet show no part of the development process.
 
We did a bunch of research (see below) to find that this Kickstarter is using commercially available products without any innovation from the project creators.  How is this a valid Kickstarter project?  This violates the number 1 guideline (see: http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines ) Kickstarter has, but they haven't done anything about this project even though multiple people have reported it.

This is a link to the Kickstarter: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bc26/ambiolight-a-one-touch-room-makeover .

Kickstarter seems to be getting even worse - not just pre-orders anymore, but now sales of products that have been available for years at much cheaper prices.  Don't get me wrong - I am fine with these guys operating a business reselling this equipment.  However, it DOES NOT belong on Kickstarter.

Cue research to confirm our initial thoughts...

Exhibit A:  The blacked-out ELCO Lighting LED strip.

Image from their Kickstarter: http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/094/160/3640009c97b2aa7a1a8abd0ef898dc6a_large.jpg?1343800796

Note a few things:  The strip design, the LED type, the positioning of components.  The curiously blacked-out ""---- Lighting"" text?

Compare with http://www.antlisting.com/FreeImages//2011/08/28/_0633548.jpg from many of the eBay posts that come up with a search for ""RGB LED strip"".

The design is the *same*.  The eBay strip has only 3 LEDs per cuttable segment rather than 6, but that is the *only* difference in the design.  Let's skip a bit past some research into wattage.  

Note how there are two black marks on the strip.  This was done in photoshop to obscure the text ""ELCO LIGHTING"".  Here, we find the exact same LED strip they are selling at the bottom (EWP1460-24M) of this page: http://www.elcolighting.com/products/waterproof-led-tape-light .  Same specifications as well...

This masking of the ""ELCO LIGHTING"" text strongly suggests blatant deception on the creators' part.

Exhibit B: The ""ballast"".

I don't know why they call it a ballast, but what they really mean is the LED controller.  They don't show any pictures of the full setup, but they do have this image on their Kickstarter of a corner of the controller: http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/096/357/63dd0e7c4cd99e7368060b8aa9a5b0ac_large.jpg?1343931381 .

Going back to the ELCO Lighting page, we find this: http://www.elcolighting.com/products/ontroller-unit-for-rgb-tapes .  Again - SAME UNIT.

Exhibit C: The comments.

""We are working to start a business just like anybody else on kickstarter"" http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bc26/ambiolight-a-one-touch-room-makeover/comments
""... Starting a business, for example, does not qualify as a project."" - http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines

This link details more of our research and how the ""creators"" have responded.

TL;DR: Kickstarter is now about purchasing commercially available products from people who claim to be the designers.  So much for innovation...




UPDATE:
They have posted a picture with the ""full setup"" in a new backer-only update.  The LED controller is a perfect match for the one from ELCO Lighting...

My name is Sam Ellis, I am the original character designer for Archer on FX. My kids and I love playing games together, so we came up with a game that will grow with the kids. It started as a card game that we used to play it on index cards for a year or two and during that time we were able to refine and expand it. I got tired of shuffling thin index cards so I made a proto-type of the game with an actual company that prints cards, we love them and wanted to share them with other people so decided to do a kickstarter. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2124589346/throwdown-card-game-robot-cowboy-samurai?ref=home_location
It has the things that me and my kids are interested in Robots, Cowboys, and Samurais. We love it, it helps kids with their early math skills, and if we hit our stretch goals we will unlock the Co-Op expansion ""Boss Fight"" which is also a blast.

I hope you can share this with others, me and the kids have put a lot into it.

1356165312.0,27,self.kickstarter,159vmm,Practical lessons learned from my first Kickstarter ($28k raised / 700%) - focusing on the mistakes!,33,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/159vmm/practical_lessons_learned_from_my_first/,"(x-post from r/WeAreTheMusicMakers) A few months ago I ran a Kickstarter to help fund the physical production of my tenth album. It was an unexpectedly huge success, and now that the album is out and rewards have been fulfilled, I wanted to share some lessons I've learned.

The Kickstarter I ran: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1363989456/zircon-identity-sequence-a-cyberpunk-inspired-jour

The album: http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/album/identity-sequence

Rather than focus on the stuff that went right, here's the stuff that was more problematic. Might be helpful to some of you :-)

1. Think about your most reasonable conservative deadline and add 2-4 weeks to that. In my case, my original deadline was to ship so that people would get stuff before Christmas. However, it took longer than anticipated to finalize mastering and artwork. I had to pay a fairly high sum to overnight artbooks + CDs... about 5x more than I would have paid normally.

2. If you need to do artwork, get the ball rolling EARLY and make sure your artist has the right templates. Nuff said. (Applies mainly to music.)

3. Check your liner notes / credit materials and any other printed text. Check them again. Have a friend check. Then check them again. I thought I was thorough but I misspelled the name of a performer and left off one of the KS backers in the special thanks. Not the end of the world, but I should have been more careful. Changing a website is one thing, but messing someone's name up on a physical product sucks.

4. THINK VERY HARD BEFORE OFFERING T-SHIRTS AS REWARDS. T-shirts are not cheap to make or ship. I ordered 400+ and they still came out to ~$7.50 a shirt. Furthermore, it is EXTREMELY time-consuming to parse through what each backer wants. It adds to the packing time immensely, and you run the risk of running out of a specific size, unless you wait for all backer surveys to be in before ordering shirts (this can take awhile and delay things further). Shirts also add a lot of weight (+ shipping cost). If you're going to do them, do them at $50+ not $30, like I did.

5. Try your very hardest to fit rewards in an envelope, not a package. Envelopes are cheaper to mail. For my $30+ backers I decided on boxes (18x12x2) from Uline to fit the poster, CD + tshirt. Bad idea. The boxes had to be assembled one by one, packing takes longer, and they have to be taped. The supplies for this cost several times more than envelopes would have. Don't do boxes unless you have a lot of stuff for high-end backers ($100-250+)

6. Think very hard before offering physical rewards to international backers w/o additional shipping cost. International shipping is abysmal. To ship a 1.5 lb box with a CD, t-shirt, and poster to the UK, it cost me $14 from the very cheapest USPS service. I basically ended up breaking even on that pledge level. Not to mention, I had to do ALL of them by hand - hand-labeling, customs forms, etc. The post office also gave me a very hard time since I had to ship them all manually. If you MUST do international shipping of physical rewards, stick to envelopes &lt;13 ounces. Above that and you WILL have a bad time. 

7. If you are anticipating (or are already getting) more than ~100 orders, look into a label printing / prepaid postage service like stamps.com, USPS click and ship, or PayPal and actually TEST them. I was relying on Stamps.com but I ran into a lot of trouble at the 11th hour and had to switch to PayPal. I lost time and money needlessly. I should have thoroughly tested my service of choice a good week before I actually needed to use it. Furthermore, I found that I couldn't do international batches through PayPal OR Stamps.com, which added days of manual labor time.

8. If you end up with a large quantity of packages to mail manually, and you can't pre-pay them, you will need to use your local post office - CALL THEM IN ADVANCE. Do not show up with 120 packages. Despite my best efforts this was a big problem for me and too many things can go wrong. This is something that needs to be worked out days in advance... they will need to make special arrangements for you.

9. Consider using 3rd party fulfillment like Whiplash Merch or Amazon FBA. Looking back, I wish I had done this instead of trying to do it myself. Handling envelopes with uniform rewards are easy enough, but anything with customized rewards, anything with large boxes, international, over 13 ounces (etc) is just really difficult to deal with.",Music,False,self,t5_2rquu,False,Music,,True,t3_159vmm,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/159vmm/practical_lessons_learned_from_my_first/,

Well, to cut it short, I found out where you can buy these watches in bulk for $15 a pop, and would like to alert Kickstarter to it.

How do I do this?

**Things we need.**

1. A cool (non US based ) domain. I am feeling something like ""MrAwesome@Ghostmail.sx[1] "" .sx is what The pirate bay uses, I figure if it's good enough for them its good enough for us It's out of 'Merica's hands so that's something.

2. Make it compatible with TOR.

3. Make it functional and good nice to look at. Why do all encrypted email services have to look like 1995?

4. Features, I think it should have features comparable to G-mail or Outlook

5. End to end encryption.

6. Self Destruct feature. All email sent to unsecured email addresses like Gmail, Yahoo, outlook etc. can get a self destruct feature so it deletes itself within a certain amount of time or after the email is read. It must also contain the words ""This message will self destruct""

7. Temporary accounts and/or aliases for those one time emails.

8. The company has no owner. It is owned by the people. I am not sure exactly how to do this, but I think it would be awesome. That way there is no one for FeeBeeI or NeeSeeA or DoHoSsa can come after any one person because there is no one owner or provider. WE pay for the hosting/server/domain with the kickstarter funding.

9. Developer(s) to take our hard earned Kickstarter loot.

10. Someone to make a nifty, video to put on Kickstarter to sell the idea.

11. IOS and Android support.

12... Public elections to pick the caretakers. The potential caretakers should submit an application and a Resume to say the top backers who will then go through them all and choose say 5 - 10 people who will sign an agreement to take care of the website, that they represent the users etc. Imagine it, a democratically owned and operated email service completely out of the hands of any and all governments. Built for the user and owned by the users.

What do you guys think? I think we can do all this for under 20K and do it in a really professional way. If we can get 5K backers that runs USD $4.00 each.

There are comments from people this month (in fact almost every comment even is the same) stating that people aren't receiving any products.  A year after raising $200k over their initial $10k.  You're telling me with an extra $190 THOUSAND DOLLARS these people couldn't get a run of their wallet finished and shipped?  They could have done everything the LEAST efficient way possible, paying out the ass for their sloppiness and still they should get better-than-advertised products to people, probably faster than they ever promised.

So where is the accountability in this process?  Am I wrong in imagining these wallet creators getting lazy and just pocketing the money?  How can they possibly get away with this?

That way people will be able to ask questions about projects they're interested in, but maybe also skeptical about. Any project creator whose project has **$1,000+ funded** can create an IAma/AMA. Although we'll be tweaking that number as we go along, so make sure to check the sidebar before posting!  

Also when creating an IAmA you must provide proof in the body of your post or in the comments, or it will be removed. 

**Recommended forms of proof:**  
  
* Note or Update on the kickstarter page about the IAma  
* Tweet confirming the IAma on your official account
* Picture of you holding a piece of paper with your username (only works if there's a picture of you on the kickstarter page or video)

Any of the above will be sufficient proof. And please report any IAma's that don't have proof. So what are you waiting for? Create an IAma, you have a goal to reach!

Help Kickstart Vagabond Brewing.,25,8,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/12r3rj/disabled_veterans_opening_a_brewery_help/,"We are a group of three Marines Corps Veterans, serial travelers and adventurers from the West Coast looking to open a microbrewery in Salem, Oregon. We have some of the funding we need lined up through SBA but need some start-up capital to help us get going while the loan is in process.

Feel free to ask anything relating to starting a brewery/business, our beers, the war and being a Vet these days, our travels and adventures in CentralSouthAmerica/MiddleEast/Europe/Africa. We'll do our best to answer.

Our focus is on excellent quality, hand crafted beers that are not designed for the mass market but for discerning beer drinkers that like their IPAs bold and their Stouts dark and smokey. We hope to instill the sort of community and adventurous spirit in our company that we have enjoyed so much on our world travels. 

* We are very active in the Couchsurfing community and would like to have a bigger role in supporting that regionally through events and meet-ups. 

* We are also big Portland Timbers fans and season ticket holders and would like to be the go to stop in Salem for Timbers fans and matches.

* We have plans for a big Salem beer festival that could help draw more attention regionally to our humble city while also encoraging interest in craft beer.


Support online and through our Kickstarter is very important as we try to get this company off the ground. We are also looking for graphic and web designers to revamp our web presence/store and merch designs (info@vagabondbrewing.com if interested). We are hoping to run a t-shirt design contest 99Designs-style very soon.

This is what I thought they did right -
1)  Great pictures
2)  Good presentation of technical features and specs
3)  Team looks organized like they know what they are doing

This is what I thought they could have done better -
1)  Goal was too high
2)  No video?
3)  Too many features - unclear presentation of key features / unclear value proposition?
4)  People aren't comfortable plugging something into their cars?
5)  Is $69 too high for the product?

Ever since the inception of Kickstarter, I've marveled at how people have crowdsourced their dreams and aspirations, their projects and passions. Obviously, I would love to be able to do the same, but I don't know if my projects would fit Kickstarter or be worth it.

I was recently laid off and that is when I decided to finally pursue my passion. I have paid off all of my bills for March and April with the money I had saved Everything else I have gotten from my last check, selling my stock in my employer, selling my college textbooks, that money has gone into buying as much supplies as I can. I am finally at a spot where I can make anything I need to, but these supplies are going to run out quickly.

Here are my ideas..

My major project: Themed jackets/hoodies for fans of certain historical warriors. I'd love to crowdsource my first line, which would be two different warrior themes, with different color variants. These jackets/hoodies would be multipurpose and year-round, so obviously a lot of my funding would go into finding and acquiring that perfect material that would allow for warming in the cooler months and allow the wearer to remain cool in the warmer months. My drawings and sketches aren't too good, so I'm concerned people might see my designs and shrug me off because of that.

After that, I would like to do tie-in and/or separate multipurpose masks based on the same historical warriors. These could be used for general costuming, LARPing, paintball/Airsoft, performing arts or anything else people might use masks for.

So, should I look into Kickstarter or just continue to fund my own project as I have?",Meta,False,self,t5_2rquu,False,Meta,,True,t3_1b3yrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1b3yrw/should_i_try_to_kickstart/,

Our kickstarter is: http://kck.st/159AZE1

We're film professionals doing a movie and raising our funds via kickstarter, why kickstarter? So we can release our movie the way we want it and distribute it for as cheaply as possible.
We love browsing reddit but have only posted a few times. We even included a few reddit easter eggs in our kickstarter video for good karma. If you can check this out and spread the word if you think its worthy. 

The success of this film relies on word of mouth and being somewhat viral which is why we're humbly trying to bring this to your attention.. We are not backyard film makers. We work at Industrial, Light &amp; Magic, MK-V, and have done projects for FX, MTV and etc.
If you're wondering why we aren't trying to find investors with our resumes, read this angering article on Joe Lynch's Movie:
http://www.aintitcool.com/node/61267

Here is a few articles on our movie:

http://www.horror-movies.ca/2013/02/official-poster-details-for-the-devils-tree/

Our big reward and selling point is this:
""Buy an HD copy of this awesome film on kickstarter for only $9 &amp; it will have YOUR NAME in the credits as a backer when its released. Time is running out! If you love horror, we need you. Be a part of something great.""

I'm talking about projects that have been successfully funded and the creator basically takes the money and runs away with it.


I have backed about 20 projects, several of which I've received. Many more that continue to update and 2 that have completely failed.


Some backers have messaged, commented and replied to updates for these projects. I have messaged Kickstarter and basically they said:
&gt;Kickstarter itself cannot force the creator to fulfill rewards, offer refunds, or communicate with backers (though we encourage them to do so)

However in their Terms &amp; Conditions it says:
&gt;Kickstarter does not offer refunds. A Project Creator is not required to grant a Backer’s request for a refund unless the Project Creator is unable or unwilling to fulfill the reward.


These projects have not been able to fulfill their rewards.

[Mike &amp; Cookies](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeandcookies/delivery-van-for-mike-and-cookies) had 70 backers; the guy sent two updates explaining that he hired people to make cookies, but didn't plan his budget well enough to support himself. He told us that sending us rewards would not help his company grow--essentially stealing our money and not even trying to compromise with backers.


[Who's For Dinner?](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mrwgames/whos-for-dinner-the-card-game) has 90 backers; the creator disappeared after his last update in July, in which he said:
&gt;The schedule: More printing, and then varnishing and cutting. 


So, have you faced issues with this? What have you done to try to get your money back? 


**TLDR**: When a project is successfully funded and the creator either disappears or tells you that they're not giving you rewards, what do you do? Have you done anything, and if so, did it solve anything?

**EDIT**: I am fully aware that Kickstarter is not responsible for refunds. I even quoted them where they said that they are not. But I'm explicitly talking about the relationship between the Creator and the Backer and asking that in such circumstances as described above, what a Backer should do.

Here is why.",17,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/12ha4m/the_game_creators_have_just_debuted_a_kickstarter/,"TGC, or the game creators, have a certain notoriety within the for fun game development community for their crapware products.

It started initially with the release of FPS Creator, and continued with FPS Creator x10 (a DirectX 10 port that was even more broken than its predecessor).  At several points in its post-release development FPSC was literally so broken it could not actually create the game files it was engineered to create.  Development crawled along at a snail's pace, with the devs focusing on new features and neglecting to address the staggering amount of usability issues.  A volunteer moderator team crushed any sort of dissent that showed up on FPSC's official forums, causing a plethora of alternate fan-created sites to pop up and die repeatedly as the users realised the pointlessness of their endeavors.

None of this really phased TGC though, since they were making bank off of $20 DLC model packs so that users could import more models into the broken program.  Keep in mind that this was before CoD4 and DLC didn't really phase people like it does now.  The whole thing culminated into the release of a micro-transaction ""store"" where users could buy individual models to use instead, all for a program that barely worked.  That's right, TGC was making bank off of sleazy crap before it was cool for the big game companies to do so.


How do I know this?  Because I fell for their song, basically.  I wasted three years and $250 dollars of software and model packs before I gave myself a slap on the head and came to the realization that under TGC, this program would never work.",,False,self,t5_2rquu,1351808159.0,,,True,t3_12ha4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/12ha4m/the_game_creators_have_just_debuted_a_kickstarter/,

This really sucks for me and my possible customers. I'm an author. I help students to raise or maintain their grades while (sometimes drastically) lowering their study time.

I recently finished my book, and am working on a series of instructional videos. It's slow going. My biggest obstacle is I'm still working my day job, out of necessity.

I had an idea to use kickstarter -- if I could fund two months of living expenses, I could finish the videos in a few weeks. For a fraction of what I'll eventually charge , contributors would get the book immediately, and the videos when they finish. Instead, it may take me over three months.

I'm really disappointed. Any suggestions? I could email the kickstarter team and ask for an exception?

&gt;The Omni is the first virtual reality interface for moving freely and naturally in your favorite game.
&gt;
&gt;The Omni takes virtual reality to the next level— allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion that cannot be experienced sitting down.
&gt;
&gt;Applications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, fitness and exercising, virtual tourism, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, physical therapy, VR architecture, VR concerts… The possibilities are limitless. Virtual reality is the future.
&gt;
&gt;Virtuix is currently preparing a Kickstarter campaign to launch the Omni on June 4th.

This has been more than a struggle but it is what I expected.  I am not an artist nor am I a writer or marketer. I am a programmer and it shows. I come with the same flaws that many of us programmers share including shyness. Though, one thing I do have is confidence in my own work and my ability to create great games that people can enjoy.

My fist error was assuming people would look past my art assets and view my game though the eyes of a programmer but I was wrong (now it seems to obvious). I wanted people to see that the mechanics of my game were smooth and simple. Instead they seemed to get stuck on the horribly ugly images I had on my page and in my game. 

Before day one I had my bucket ready and now I'm trying scoop out the water that's sinking this project.

**Updates:**

1. Added [Promotion Image](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#6) to top of page to clarify platform availability
2. I replaced this terrible custom field sketch with a cleaner version. Now that I look back I don't know what I was thinking to have this as the first image on my page. 
  * Fields - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#2) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#3)
3. Redesigned rewards and then redesigned again after getting advice from a graphics designer.

  * Headers - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#0) | [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#1)
5. Changed my profile image to a picture of myself to make it more personal.
  * Profile Image - [Ver1](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#4) [Ver2](http://imgur.com/a/LkHNW#5)
6. Placed [listing for artist](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/182x1o/lfartist_to_create_spritesheet_for_top_down/) to design in game sprites. Two promising applicants thus far. 
7. Lastly, I am working on a new video to introduce the rest of the team.

**Paid Advertising Overview:**

Another major decision I have made is to stop all paid advertising and focus on social networking more and more. I wish I had figured this one out years ago but I will go ahead and learn my lesson now. 

For the project I ran three ad campaigns:

[$10/day x 2 StumbleUpon Ad](https://www.stumbleupon.com/content/32nGlW)

* Initially I just had a single Stumble Upon ad set at average priority ($10 for 100 views) then added a second with highest priority ($10 for 40 views from more active users). This lead to 3 likes rather than 0 but still far from effective.

**Social Advertising Overview:**

A few notes on my experience and what I did to spread the word via Websites, Blogs, and Social Media.

* I created a [press release](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=13c86c38468ff8e3&amp;mt=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Da595dcdabe%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13c86c38468ff8e3%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_hcj5pez20%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbTPhoK8VwXb-xdDDLQMkMi7FOOkTQ) and sent it to as many related gaming sites a possible. 
* I sent out requests to my personal Facebook friends, email contacts, and LinkedIn connections. 
* I created a Website, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and Reddit Account dedicated to my project. 
  * Twitter - 52 followers, Tweets from Others with a combined following of over 300,000.
  * Facebook - 77 Page likes (26 are Personal Friends)
  * Youtube - 1300 Views
  * Reddit - 60 Link Karma, 12 Posts
* I was featured on the [IGDA Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/igda)
* After meeting some of the guys at TecmoBowl.org through [a post](http://tecmobowl.org/topic/53094-tecmo-super-bowl-like-mobile-games/) they were kind enough to post my Kickstarter on the [Tecmo Super Bowl Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TecmoSuperBowl?fref=ts) page on Super Bowl Sunday

**Kickstarter Statistics:** 

After all this I would have hoped for a better response but here are our statistics as of today:

* [Project Overview](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#3) - 9% Funded
* [Graph of Progress](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#2) - Flat
* [Total Video Views](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#6) - 1,389
* [Traffic Breakdown](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#4) - Facebook $160, Stumble Upon $0. (Facebook is more than likely from friends and not ads)
* [Reward Popularity](http://imgur.com/a/2FLTO#5)

Hopefully with my updates I see a change but if not I will continue scooping water over the side.

If nothing else I hope this post helps others to understand that artistic assets are not to be overlooked. Had I done a better job preparing my Kickstarter initially I believe I would have had a much more positive response.

But here we are in the middle of ours and it's a steady up slope. 

Could it be due to lack of press at the start ? Should we still expect a surge of backers near the end? and most importantly could it just be our content? I'm trying to understand the figures here. I'm almost convinced it just comes down to getting an article on a big name site and that's it.

i bet some project which did not get founded would be happy to get what they gathered so far. So why not change the structure and do a 1$ kickstarter and everything else with stretch goals. 


this would secure the founding and define the product with stretchgoals at the go. 


i know that is not possible with every project where fix costs are involved but for other products where modular projects are possible i think it has many benefits. 


what do you think?

Our Kickstarter project, Papier Adventure was launched recently and with two weeks remaining to meet our target, there are definitely lessons that you learn by ""doing"" this rather than speculating about it.

I'm a first time poster, though I've lurked here and on many other subreddits for a while now. I thought now might be a good time, and that reddit might be a good place to post my current Kickstarter as it might be appreciated here!

I know there's definitely some concern with Kickstarters getting backed, and then not fulfilling their obligations to backers. I want to say that regardless of the Kickstarter failing or not, the game will still be finished! But, with the Kickstarter I'm hoping to make the game even better than I could do myself. 

Right now I'm working on a top down adventure game called Sword 'N' Board. You play as a kid going on an imaginary adventure to retrieve your missing video game console.

I really wanted to take it back to a time when I was a kid and had to actually go outside and use my imagination and play pretend.

I'm having a hard time getting the word out about the game and the Kickstarter right now (I'm literally one guy working on it right now) so any help you guys could give me to help get the Kickstarter seen is greatly appreciated! Even if you don't back it, just taking the time to check it out is great.

There is also a downloadable PC demo on the Kickstarter page under the updates section. There is a Mac build available but I've yet to test it.

You can check the Kickstarter out here:

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/817647846/sword-n-board-your-adventure-is-his-imagination

And you can find the PC demo here:

So, instead of just a few heavyweight companies making wearable computing devices, people like you &amp; I can design &amp; build modular parts which are compatible with each other, so we can easily mix &amp; match the components. This allows the wearable computer to evolve very rapidly, as well as absorb the latest computer tech (like GoogleGlass and the Vuzix M-100). 

The project is about 90% done (I finished the working prototype on Thursday) but the video about the project is still really ""rough-draft"". I definitely will be re-recording the video's intro, though it might still follow the same basic format.

For those of you unfamiliar with this website it is akin to that of kickstarter.com. Anyway, this is the homepage of their project. http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/todd-the-book-of-pure-evil-the-end-of-the-end

Watch their video, share with others and contribute whatever you can to assist in the production of this epic finale. They have several tiers to what you contribute-- The lower ones for example you get a free downloadable HD copy of the movie when its done, and the highest tier you get to attend the premier of the movie, have an animated version of yourself included in the movie, along with many other heavy metal perks. 

Give whatever you can or will, and more importantly spread the word.

My name is Joseph Nix and I am the lead dev here at Gentlemen Studios, a small independent game company.  We are currently working on a game that will do for classic 32-Bit RPGs what Super Meat Boy did for platformers, bringing the genre in the spotlight so that it experiences a developmental revival.  We are trying to make developers step away from their comfort zone to revisit this exceptional genre that lies at the heart of our most amazing gaming experiences.  Talk is cheap, so we decided to put it all out there and be one of the first developers to revisit the classic RPG genre that many of you remember and love dearly.

RaiN is a 32-Bit Action RPG with a player centered approach.  You take control as you develop each of the three playable character's personalities and behavior!  Everything a character says and does changes they way they act and the pacing, direction, and message of the storyline.  Additionally, players will have to utilize quick, on-the-fly thinking and lightning fast reflexes to master the monstrous inhabitants of Ara.  Switch between characters and utilize their strengths to overcome complex and ever-changing enemy attack patterns in fast paced, real-time action combat!

The project is currently in its final week of raising funds via Kickstarter and we need your help Reddit!  We were able to raise 50% of the funds so far and need a little nudge from you guys (and gals!) to make it to the finish line!  But hey, we aren't just asking for money here, we're giving you something for it to!  By donating 10 bucks, you get a copy of the game the moment  it is released, as well as invites into the game's various beta phases.  As you donate more the rewards get even more awesome.  We're giving out art books, shirts, and the ability to actually have your ideas represented in the game.


[To find out more about the game and to donate, click here!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gentlemenstudios/rain-0)

We are not like most Kickstarters, which consist only of concepts.  We actually have a gameplay video of an alpha build.  Enough talk!  It is time to make a game that reminds everyone why they fell in love with gaming in the first place, without DRM or priced DLC!


I will be here to answer any questions you may have about the game or studio.

Thank you for your time Reddit!

And whenever we show it to people, there's a lot of interest. But I just cannot get press or blogger traction going - what am I doing wrong?

*Context:* My project is piq - a jukebox for social spaces. It's a fun idea, everyone gets to choose what plays around them with their phone/tablet/pc.

We did all the ground-work, built a quick share site (www.piq.fm) and reached out to our friends and family. However, there isn't a single press mention about it and I'm concerned that we're doing something terribly wrong.

Which is why we're here - how do we score a little more awareness, and separate ourselves from other Kickstarters? We're looking to learn and apply your findings, and we appreciate your time reading this.

Our key differentiators are:

1. The Idea - We believe in a music democracy - one where everyone can choose what plays next, and does so.

2. Open-Source - For a dollar (and soon, just a Tweet) - we're giving away the prototype code and instructions to build a basic jukebox

Thanks, Team piq!

PS: If you could do the 3 click share at www.piq.fm we would appreciate it very much.

Assuming I haven't already botched it, when should I be posting to reddit about it (when the campaign is viewable or before), and how should I go about letting people know (dry and direct link or a longer story). How many reddit lists should I use, etc. I appreciate any info on the proper crowdfunding dating ritual. It may be that there's no right way, or that it's always awkward and that's fine too.

[The Facebook page for the project](http://www.facebook.com/rockothechristmasbat) has some likes--not as many as I would prefer, though. I have a few very enthusiastic friends who share the pages like crazy. The Facebook Insights shows my weekly reach at 855, but only 5 backers from that.

It just seems like most of my friends and family have basically said, ""good luck"" after liking the page and seem to have no intention of backing the project. Other friends have told me that if this is successful, they'll buy the book in a store when it becomes available.

The church I attend has told me that I can't share the project there (even though the book is religious) because that would be solicitation.

I feel like I'm being stopped at every pathway to promote or market this without spending (nonexistent) money, which is starting to get me down.

I deliberately made my fundraising a long one because I wanted to give the project time to become viral through friends and family sharing if it was going to, since I don't have any marketing budget. But the project hasn't even been through a week and I'm not nearly where I'd hoped I'd be. Friends that I thought would back the project haven't yet, but even more important is getting people outside my group of friends to think that the project's worth a couple of backing bucks.

What can I do to improve the exposure and backing rate beyond what I've already done? (sent press releases, called radio stations (no response), have an active Facebook page for the project, printed up flyers to put up around the community, posted to Reddit in several appropriate places--some with my profile, some with an alias profile using the name of the project)

TL;DR - Researcher has found a cheap way to cure a certain type of cancer (the kind that terk our Jobs), but can't get funding becausae of big pharma. He says he needs $1.5 Million to make his research a reality for patients.   

 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9508895/A-virus-that-kills-cancer-the-cure-thats-waiting-in-the-coldc.html 

I thought someone needs to make this happen! Well...why not me? Or at least, why not find someone who can? That's when draggonreddit answered my request for someone to start a fundraiser page to raise the money for this research :

Request: http://www.reddit.com/r/fundraiser/comments/zbz7x/request_someone_needs_to_set_up_an_indiegogo/

Fundraiser page : 
http://www.fundingjar.com/projects/130/project-info/

Facebook page:
 http://www.facebook.com/UppsalaCancerCampaign?ref=logo&amp;__user=510307831 

So Reddit, internet, general population, if we can raise $1 Million to put towards a wicked cool Tesla Museum we can at least collectively try and be part of a cure.

Any donations will help!

I have a Kickstarter that I'm running now that started off really well, but kind of tapered off.  I'm not expecting it to succeed (although I would be happy if it did).

My question is this.  If my Kickstarter failed, and it was mostly about funding the project, would it be unethical to launch another Kickstarter about a week later to preorder the finished project?  I want to put options out there for the folks that were interested in the Kickstarter, by launching a new campaign if this one fails, with a goal of $1 (instead of the current one at $2000).

A few demos built on top of it - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31tkQ4tp_2c (Diablo 2 remake, partial) and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2jO204CH9M (trailer showcasing the platform's capabilities)

To give you an idea of how the maps are made, have a look at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9cA95Fo32g. The video is a few months old and many things have been improved, but the core functionality is the same.
The overall idea is to have everything built visually, online, using a browser. You can download the platform's virtual machine running a MMORPG server, and publish the content from the cloud onto the system with a single click.

In many ways, from administration, to publishing and even monetizing, this is ""WordPress for game creators""
Furthermore, this is Open Source. The realm itself is open source and we want to release an API to integrate with the editor, to add your own functionality and features to it.

If you're thinking the games can run just in the browser, we have some nice experiments on the pipeline aimed at exporting native apps for iOS and Android. Will update soon.

We will start the public beta in a few days and you can find out all about us at www.gameleon.co and at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/341483420/gameleon-sandbox-game-making-for-everyone (if you like it, a pledge or spreading the word would be greatly appreciated and we'll call you awesome forever!)

There is also an asset market and there are built-in methods to monetize resulting games - http://www.gameleon.co/platform/monetizing

The main reason i've started this thread is to ask you guys what you think about it, would you see yourselves building, or what would you would contribute to the source code, to make even greater games!

For me, I pledge if I think the product is cool and I want the rewards offered. I never watch the video - I hate videos - and most of the time I don't even read all of the text. Cheaper things require less thought to get me to pledge. Large, colorful pictures help a lot.

Hiya, Reddit! 
 
We’re Magic Pixel Games, and we love Kickstarter! 
 
At the office, we spend way too much time surfing Kickstarter and sharing links to projects that we want to play.  So we came up with the idea to turn that addiction into something a bit more productive - we’ll pick a few projects we find interesting and let the public help us decide who to back! You can check out the projects and vote on a website we're calling KickAssist:


URL: [http://www.mpgkickassist.com](http://www.mpgkickassist.com)
 

We provide free publicity for independent games on Kickstarter. Hopefully you’ll find a cool project through this website and become a backer yourself. And to top it off, we’ll give money to the project with the most votes every two weeks. You find out about new games, the games get money, we get to interact more with the indie community, and everybody wins! 
 
We’re doing this not only because we love indie games, but because we’re cheering for the little guys - the ones who really need your help to pursue their passions. We’ve been there ourselves, and we know how helpful a lucky break of exposure and funding can be - so this is our way to help out.

To be brief, I've never used kickstarter before but wanted to help some talented musicians jumpstart a career by shooting a music video for them. With a great music video to go with an amazing upcoming track; I was hoping to help them gain exposure so they can boost their fanbase. Someone recommended starting a kickstarter to help alleviate the production costs, the problem is, I've never made one before.

The funding goal is quite small (I think). I already have a lot of friends willing to work on this for free with me; so really I was just hoping to raise a very low budget to cover some of my equipment expenses and to pay the talent (models, hairstylists, makeupartists).

I read the kickstarter tips and we used a few test shots on a dslr to stitch together a video to give people a glimpse of the song and visuals. **What strategies are best for appealing to people who have no attachment to the band?** As I said, they don't really have an established fanbase yet. I was thinking to post on reddit, but unsure about what subreddit **Does anyone have a suggestion for a friendly subreddit with a community that may be supportive, rather than cynical?**

We want to submit our film to local festivals and see where it goes (we are north of NYC, in Westchester County). 

The story is powerful, and portrays common yet sensitive social issues, including rape culture, class separation, and taboo homosexuality of the rural 50s culture.

The film takes place in a small town in 1956, and is about a young girl Penny, 17, who discovers her sexuality and self-worth. Her best friend, Mary-Alice, is a self-absorbed teen who is more concerned about her appearance and material objects than the well being of her friend Penny. Hinging on the football season, Penny discovers her sexuality after being taken advantage of by Mary-Alice's brother, Glenn. For the remainder of the 25 minute film, Penny is tried by a series of life-changing events which expose the raw nature of these social issues.

We have our entire film cast, and have a promotional video on our Kickstarter. We almost reached 10% of our goal, and have about two weeks to go. What I am looking for by posting here is advice on how to make a successful Kickstarter, and hints/tips on how to promote our project.

TL;DR - I need advice on how we can reach our goal for our 1950s coming of age film.

Fortunately, someone else upvoted it or it would have remain buried below the front page.  Once it started getting visibility, other people saw the info and added their upvotes.

Right now I see a large number of submissions within the past 24-hours that are buried in the second or third page due to a single downvote.  It's sad when a single downvoter causes this to happen but it will happen on smaller subreddits until they get a larger number of subscribers.  


Dear downvoters, if you don't like a posted project then stop being a jerk and downvoting it.  It's not a ""disagree"" or a ""don't like"" button.  If you need a refresher on basic [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), then here is the rule:

* **Please don't** Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

Until a certain few people learn how to browse reddit correctly, a good tip to find the buried submissions is to click the [""New"" tab](http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/new/) up above.  That way you won't see brand new posts disappear off the front page due to a single downvote.",,False,self,t5_2rquu,False,,,True,t3_1ignsy,http://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1ignsy/downvoters_stop_hurting_this_subreddit/,
