Minding my own business, peepin some Arnold Palmer half and half. I get a notification, reach into my pocket to pull out my sexy 920, black matte finish (important to note). 

I went into the pocket deep with two fingers like a nervous prom date. BIG MISTAKE. If you have a matte finish, you gotta fist that fucking thing. 4 fingers and a thumb, no less. As my vice grip latched on like a claw machine the matte finish slipped out of my grip. Magically, I started juggling my phone with one hand as it rotated every direction like a fucking NASA G-force test. Palmer is looking at me through that cold aluminum casing all like ""NOOOOOOOOOO"". fuck you arnold palmer i got this

I must have looked like Michael J Fox trying to juggle aids covered razor blades. In a slow motion, matrix moment of ""no-fucking-around-now"" I went to make a midair stab with my spiderman like grip, and failed miserably. I may as well falcon-punched the fucking thing, as it flew 12 feet away from me after the impact, hit a few corners as it rotated, landed FACE-DOWN (fuckmylifeomg) and slid another 8 feet across the linoleum floor. goddammit

I picked up the phone and amazingly, other than my super clinched butthole everything worked out better than expected. The screen shows no visable scratches under normal light. The edges look absolutely untouched, and corners look perfect too! 

Just be aware, the matte finish is really slippery. I thought the gloss finish would be so, hence why I went with the matte finish. The gen 2 gorilla glass is super strong and scratch resistant. Considering the circumstances, things could have been a lot worse for me and my new 920.

Alright, so.

Sometime yesterday, goldegl made a post about getting the Lumia 1020 at work. It clearly stated in his flair that he worked at AT&amp;T. No problem, whatever. It's great that we have someone at AT&amp;T who's enthusiastic about Windows Phone.

Anyway, he posted a box shot and some pictures he took with the phone. Somewhere in the comments, a redditor posted a link to a Bing Map that had his exact store location on it. This isn't cool. This is BEYOND not cool. goldegl contacted the mod team and asked that we remove that comment as it got a little too personal for his liking. We complied and removed it.

This morning, we got another message from goldegl (who ended up having to delete his account) because some people on reddit managed to get his information and call/visit the AT&amp;T store at which he worked. His superiors were not happy with him from the sound of it, and for all we know his job could be on the line thanks to some redditor posting his personal information out in the open.

I'm going to do my best John Legere impression and say this is fucking bullshit. This should NOT have happened. This guy was kind enough to show you a real, in-the-flesh Lumia 1020 before it even releases, and you go and do that to him? That's not cool at all, and whoever is responsible should feel ashamed of themselves.

I thought it was a common sense rule among all of reddit, but obviously it is not, so I'm going to state it here:

**Posting personal information about another redditor WILL get you banned. No exceptions.**

EDIT: Some other things that are coming to light, and general good practices:

1. goldegl posted the actual photos on Flickr, which can be linked back to him and flickr doesn't strip out the geo data. So the blame falls on goldegl just as much as it did the redditor who has since deleted his account. However, that doesn't make what happened okay.

2. Imgur strips out the EXIF data when you upload, so if you're uploading sensitive info like this, I'd heavily recommend Imgur or stripping out the EXIF yourself.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,1374187404.0,,phone,True,t3_1il7ft,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1il7ft/modpost_what_happened_with_the_lumia_1020_thread/,moderator

1369064273.0,298,self.windowsphone,1ep5uv,"An explanation why WP is ""slow at multitasking"" (spoiler: its not)",314,16,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1ep5uv/an_explanation_why_wp_is_slow_at_multitasking/,"I see many people mention that they want to see ""improved multitasking"" in Windows Phone, and attribute the ""Resuming..."" and ""Loading..."" screens to a fault with the operating system being ""slow at multitasking"".

I want to explain how multitasking works on WP, but first I will apologise in advance for any mistakes as I am sure I will get something wrong.

**Internals**

To understand how this works, you need to know some of the internals. An app has a number of states it can be in, such `Active`, `Deactivated` and `Tombstoned`.

* `Active` means that the app is in the foreground and is the current in use app.

* `Deactivated` means that the app is in the background but the OS has not killed it. It is still in memory.

* `Tombstoned` means the deactivated app has been released from memory. A deactivated app is tombstoned when the OS decides it wants the memory the app is using.

I see many people use ""Tombstoned"" to describe apps that are merely deactivated. This makes sense as there is really no way to tell the difference. Tombstoned apps appear in the back-stack, along with apps that are deactivated, and can be navigated back to, just like deactivated apps. However, internally there is a big difference between the two states.

**Events**

Apps have a number of events, and developers can have the app run certain actions when that event happens. Four such events are `Application_Launching`, `Application_Deactivated`, `Application_Activated`, `Application_Closing`.

* `Launching` is when the app is started from scratch

* `Deactivated` is when the app is sent to the background (deactivated)

* `Activated` is when a deactivated *or* tombstoned app is activated, eg. navigated to using the back button or the back-stack

* `Closing` is when the app is closed by pressing the back button only page in the history to exit the app

Code that is run in the Launching event delays the main page being loaded, and the ""Loading..."" screen is displayed. Most apps avoid doing anything time-consuming in the Launching event and instead show a splash screen or their own custom loading screen while preparing the app.

Just as with Launching, any code in the Activated event delays resuming, and the ""Resuming..."" screen is shown. For example, an app may want to log a user in to a remote service during the Activated event, which may take a while over a slow connection. In this instance, the resuming screen will be displayed until that completes.

It is not the OS being ""slow at multitasking"", that is the perception given by the app running code while it resumes. The OS resumes the app almost instantly, it's the app that is slow. From the OS perspective, resuming an app that is tombstoned takes roughly the same time as launching the app to begin with.

The Activated event is run if the app is deactivated or tombstoned. If a deactivated app is resumed, there is very little initialisation that needs to be done, as it still mostly functions as if the app was never closed. An app that is being resumed after being tombstoned has more work to do to reinitialise.

**Reason**

Therefore, in theory, the resuming screen should only appear if the app was tombstoned, however many app developers perform no checks in the Activated event to see if the app needs to be reinitialised or not, and run the code no matter if the app was deactivated or tombstoned. Having the ""resuming"" screen appear every time for some apps, again, creates a perception that Windows Phone is slow at multitasking, when it is actually the app. (Developers can check the value of `ActivatedEventArgs.IsApplicationInstancePreserved` in the Activated event to determine if the app was tombstoned or deactivated).

**Competition**

Now, the question everyone is thinking: Why does iOS not have this problem?

Because iOS does not tombstone apps; it only deactivates them and then kills them. Therefore, iOS apps have barely any use for an equivalent of an Application_Activated event, and iOS apps resume instantly, exactly like Windows Phone apps that run no excess code in their Activated event.

When an application is sent to the background on iOS (eg. when the home button is pressed), it is preserved in memory, exactly like on Windows Phone. When iOS decides it wants the memory, it kills the app. The app does not preserve its state and cannot resume from where it left off. The next time the app is run -- even if it is accessed from the multitasking bar -- it starts from scratch (eg. shows a splash screen). If iOS worked like Windows Phone, that app would be tombstoned, and the next time it was started from the multitasking bar, it would recover its state (which takes time) and start from where you left off.

**Conjecture**

Now conjecture: which way is better, iOS or WP?

iOS' way is cleaner and easier on developers. It also avoids developers running unnecessary code every time the app is navigated back to. However, it also creates a situation where sometimes an app will start from where you left off and sometimes it will start from scratch.

WP's way is a bit messy and harder on developers to implement and get right, but it creates a somewhat consistent experience where, if you access the app from the navigation stack, the app should always resume from where you left off. Microsoft have tried to create the same sort of experience as on a PC, where when you open a minimized application from the taskbar it starts from where you were, but on a PC the application is maintained in memory the whole time, on lower memory devices like phones, this is not possible, hence the trickery in trying to emulate that experience.

**Fix?**

Can Microsoft ""fix"" the perception of multitasking in WP? Maybe. There are a number of tricks they could do to cover up what is actually happening. Such as, silently screenshotting each app as it is deactivated and showing that screenshot in place of the Resuming screen, is one possible solution.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,1369066427.0,,phone,True,t3_1ep5uv,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1ep5uv/an_explanation_why_wp_is_slow_at_multitasking/,

Until Windows Phone 8 gets an app with detailed stats, your screenshots are meaningless.

Okay, so your phone is at 50% battery after 30 hours. Great. How long did you use the screen for? How many calls did you make? How often did the phone enter and exit deep sleep (important factor in batter life)? Did you play any games? Knowing that you're at X% after Y time means nothing.

**Thank you**

We would like to thank everyone that took time to fill-in in the [questions] (http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1j5ewt/mod_request_why_did_you_choose_a_windows_phone/). It is really great to see the community, including some lurkers and first time posters to participate.

We have read your requests and are working on things that where most commonly requested. We cannot do everything and some of the things that we can do take time. 

The sidebar has been changed. There have been some visual improvement and we have also updated some of the content.


**Weekly threads**

There are some new rules added and there will be weekly threads.

* **[Sunday: Show us your pictures thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1j7gr9/sunday_28th_of_july_2013_show_us_your_pictures/)**
* Monday: Weekly app appreciation thread
* Tuesday: Show us your home screen thread
* Wednesday: Weekly beginners question thread

Because there are users from around the globe the exact date might be different to yours in some rare cases. Dates are based on GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).

These weekly posts will result in a central area for discussion. Posting pictures you have taken or home screen images will not be permitted outside these weekly topics. There may be some rare occasions when this is allowed. But in general, we will delete ""Look at the picture I took"" and ""Look at my home screen"" posts.

Imgur and Youtube are the most popular for images and video. But please keep in mind that they both heavily reduce the quality and are not the best option to show your picture or video quality.

If you have other images. Please post them as a self-post and add some content.


**Community**

We are here to moderate the community, but we cannot do everything alone. 

Contributions such as this one, is heavily appreciated.
http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1it885/list_of_my_favorite_free_games_on_wp8/

Please help out beginners in our weekly beginners question thread.

Please keep in mind that users of this subreddit are not solely US users. US carriers and the lack of freedom that come with them are a US problem. Please don’t downvote people who don’t understand this or are not aware of it.

Please don’t use the comment downvote and upvote button as ""I agree / I disagree"" or ""I like / I dislike"". If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute or is off-topic, downvote it.

Please don’t target individuals who do not share your passion for Windows Phone. Some people prefer one OS over the other. In some areas there are features that people are going to miss. No one OS is perfect. 

Please link to the original source, unless the website that used the source has added value. For example. Time.com posts an article about a survey they did that shows that 86% of Windows Phone users are satisfied with the OS. Wmpoweruser copies and pasts the article. In this case, please don’t link to Wmpoweruser, but link to Time.
Let’s say wmpoweruser does some research, finds more data and that this is a monthly survey. Writes about the article, adds the results of the last 12 months in a graph and writes about how WP user satisfaction has grown since the launch of WP8. Then the source for the data was Time, but wmpoweruser has added value and you can link to them.

Please read the **[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)** and be aware of it.

Thank you for making this subreddit a great place for all things related to Windows Phone.

This is my opinion, speaking as a member of the community. I am not asking anyone to quit posting these articles. Not at all.)

It just feels to me like this is the flavor of the week with the tech press and it's getting really annoying. Much like they call out Apple for not meeting lofty demands that some pie-in-the-sky analysts made out (that also have nothing to do with the company), the insatiable tech press seems fixated on this notion that suddenly, Nokia has to switch to Android, or they're doomed.

I honestly think that switching to Android would doom Nokia harder, if not give them no more marketshare than they have now. If you look over at the Android side, even HTC is having problems staying afloat. The only company that's even *making money off of Android* is Samsung. As it stands now, no one has really been able to compete with them.

At least in the WP market, Nokia has control for the most part. In the Android market, Samsung does. And if Nokia entered the Android market, Samsung would wipe them off the face of the earth.

Nokia may not be doing so hot on the WP side, but all these stupid articles insinuate that switching to Android will ""save"" Nokia when it will, at best, only sustain them just as well as staying on WP would.

It just makes me rage because it sounds to me like the pundits crying that Nokia needs to switch to Android are probably the same ones that called for Apple to license Mac OS. Or iOS, even.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,phone,True,t3_1ihuh7,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1ihuh7/can_we_stop_with_the_nokia_needs_to_switch_to/,

Hey guys, I recently mentioned that I was gonna port PuTTY to windowsphone and was surprised that a lot of you were actually interesting in this!

Well, a lot of developers with good intentions (myself including) will often say they have an idea for something and will do it, but never actually get around to it.

So some good news for you, this wasn't one of those times! I've successfully porting the base code for PuTTY to WP8 (sorry, can't do it for WP7). It's connecting to my server doing all of the SSH handshaking that you would expect and logging in perfectly fine!

The keyboard in the screenshot is something that I knocked together taking inspiration from Hacker's Keyboard for Android. The keys are smaller than on the standard keyboard, but it is still usable once you get used to it. I'm not sure if a custom keyboard will pass Microsoft's scrutiny. I hope that they see it as required functionality.

Beta testing it still a little way off, but drop me an email at (putty at nogsnet.com) with your Microsoft email and I'll let you know when the beta is ready.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,phone-yellow,True,t3_1k5h8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1k5h8h/putty_on_wp8_a_teaser_for_you_all/,

1354143437.0,160,self.windowsphone,13yksu,YOU DON'T NEED TO CLOSE APPS ON WINDOWS PHONE. Let's put an end to this myth once and for all.,188,28,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/13yksu/you_dont_need_to_close_apps_on_windows_phone_lets/,"With the influx of new Windows Phone users, I keep seeing the ""tip"" that pressing the back button repeatedly ""closes"" an app float to the top in comments on this sub.  But Windows Phone doesn't work that way.  

**""CLOSING"" WINDOWS PHONE APPS IS UNNECESSARY, SAVES YOU NO BATTERY, AND DOESN'T ACTUALLY STOP BACKGROUND PROCESSES**

Here's why:

Windows Phone is a very managed platform, and apps are sandboxed and given very little free reign over the system.  This is the same way iOS works on Apple devices, and the new Windows RT environment (Metro), and in contrast to how Windows desktop and Android work.  A Windows Phone app is only *running* when it's running, as in, active and displayed on-screen.

Windows Phone *does not* have true multitasking. In fact, that's why the ""task switcher"" is actually referred to as the ""Fast switcher"" menu, because that's all it is.  When Windows Phone apps are moved off-screen, they're ""tombstoned,"" which means they're suspended to memory. In a tombstoned state, the app uses no processor, data, or power resources. And if another active app needs to use the memory the tombstoned app is using, WP will silently kill the tombstoned app to free up the memory.

**What *does* use up your battery are background processes**.  This is the method WP uses to allow apps to do things without actually being active and open. Things like downloading live tile data, playing music, GPS navigation.  Background processes can be turned on and off in the settings menu. This is where you'll see battery improvement.

iOS works the same way, but the confusion is because Apple added a way to ""kill"" apps in their fast switching menu in, what was it, iOS 4?  All hitting the red X in the iOS switching menu does is clear the tombstoned app from memory and force it to restart when you launch it from the home screen.  This is admittedly handy when you have a misbehaving or crashed app, but it doesn't ""close"" the app in a traditional desktop sense.

**TL;DR: Stop telling people to close their apps by hitting the back button, you're not actually doing anything. Turn off unnecessary background processes in settings instead.**

I've been coming to this sub-Reddit for a long time and have been using Windows Phone since I got my old Samsung Focus. One thing that always frustrated me was the lack of one app or another that I'd see my friends using on iPhone and Android.

I experienced this recently with [Splitwise](http://www.splitwise.com) when my friends started using it to keep track of expenses amongst our group. Seeing other Redditors building apps and urging others to ask for apps to be built inspired me--if the Splitwise guys didn't have the resources to do it, I would write the app myself.

It took a bit of work but I finally [released the app](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=d2307de6-10c0-4b5c-9527-7c549370a447) for WP8 earlier this month (and WP7 today!) and the response has been amazing! Hundreds of people are using the app and writing great reviews. My favorite review has been: ""Awesome app. It is comparable to 1st party app on other platforms."" The buzz even got the founders of Splitwise to buy a Windows Phone to check out the app. Mission accomplished!

I guess I just wanted to say thank you to this community for motivating me to make a positive impact on the app ecosystem. I definitely plan to build more apps in the future!

**tl;dr - If you feel like an app is missing from the store, contact the company and show them there is demand. If there's a 3rd party API available, try and build your own app or find someone who is willing to do so. You never know, you might end up making a useful app for everyone to use!**",,False,self,t5_2r71o,1364354238.0,,phone-cyan,True,t3_1b2zjw,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1b2zjw/thanks_reddit_for_the_motivation_my_first_app_is/,

I went to 2 separate ATT stores yesterday with the intent on getting a L920 for my wife.  At the first store, not only was the display in the back and off to the side, but the employees proceed to to heckle her when she stated that she was looking to purchase one.  I felt like we were on trial and had to defend our decision.  I ended up having to tell him that as a software developer and tech enthusiast, I have already done the research.  He then proceeded to tell us that he didn't have any in stock.  Zero.  No Lumias, no HTCs or anything.  I was obviously skeptical so I asked him how they can't have a single WP in stock.  He got a smirk on his face and said something along the lines of MS is ""restructuring"" their lineup and he said he is being nice by saying that.  Huh?!  At this point I had enough and we left.

The next store we go into, similar story.  WP were tucked away in the back and the minute we mentioned our interest in them we were mocked by not only the rep we were dealing with, but additionally other reps that were eavesdropping like it was a big joke we said we wanted a WP.  I am just disgusted.

1360758325.0,144,self.windowsphone,18fwfw,"iPhone User Since 2007, Made The Switch To WP8 ( L920 ) 3 Weeks in. Here Are My Thoughts.",166,22,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/18fwfw/iphone_user_since_2007_made_the_switch_to_wp8/,"Morning all,

I have been an iPhone user since 2007. I was the guy who queued up at 6pm to get the first ever iPhone. Since then I have been hooked. Getting every single iPhone, even the iPhone 5. 

I bought the iPhone 5 ( on release day of course ) and after about 4 hours I was bored! Its just the same OS with a bigger screen. So I started looking around for another phone. Finally made my decision 3 weeks back and went for the Lumia 920.

I will give my thoughts and experience; I hope this helps people who are not sure what route to take next with their smartphone.

Hardware:

This was the biggest shock. In-between my iPhone moment I gave the Nokia N900 a go. I took it back the next day. The hardware was shocking. Just felt like cheap plastic. Ok granted, the iPhone 3g was also plastic but it felt better in the hand. Nokia was lacking behind with innovation. I'm not sure if it was because I was in my apple bubble but 2010 really was dominated by Apple.

You will not be disappointed with the Lumia 920 hardware. As soon as I got it out of the box and held it I was very pleased. The size and weight was a shock at first, especially coming from the iPhone 5. But, the phone is very well built, very solid &amp; the slight curved glass is beautiful. I don't have a case yet but I have dropped my phone several times already and it has survived.

The screen is bright and clear. The auto brightness also works very well too.

Camera quality cannot be faulted. 1080p video looks professional &amp; low light pictures also come out much better than iPhone5. The phone is also fitted with a dual LED flash. This makes a surprising difference and gave really clear and rich pictures in low light environments.

Speech is very clear, both on normal and loud speaker.

Built in speakers are decent. Of course they are very high at the treble end but what do you expect from small speakers. The volume is great for incoming calls and messages.

Power cable, I thought it was just Apple who provided short cables. But Nokia also do too. It must be something to do with power lose over a certain length. Only a small issue. I'm over it.

Battery, I will be honest. But I don't think it’s fair. I'm a very heavy user &amp; the fact it’s a new toy I can’t put it down. The battery isn't lasting the whole day. I think when the novelty wears off then It will last the day. There is a nice feature though called Battery saver. This will stop your emails checking for mail automatically + other behind the scene stuff.

Speed, This phone is very snappy. Dual core CPU and 1Gb RAM, it is speedy. Cannot fault that. I think this phone will last a few years before it starts to slow down.



Software - WP8

I'm a massive Microsoft fan, My job is entirely based around Microsoft. I'm a Desktop / Server and network engineer. I have several Microsoft and Cisco exams under my belt and love technology.

So the jump from iOS to WP8 was massive.

I give it to Apple; iOS is a very solid OS. It just works. They must of spent hundreds of hours just on the settings layout. But, Apple's iOS was just starting to get bland. I saw a couple of adverts on TV for WP, a friend of mine had WP7. I used WP7 and was not impressed. just felt clunky and not very fluid. This could have been down to the phone specs but my first impressions were not great.

Then I found this subreddit. Spent about 2 weeks on here reading reviews and speaking to colleagues. I finally took the gamble and sold my iPhone 5 and bought the Nokia Lumia 920.

OS: Elegant, Slick, Responsive, intuitive, sexy, interactive and beautiful.

What a big difference to iOS, I love playing with new technology and this OS just makes me want it more. I cant put the phone down.

The tiles ecosystem is 100% the way to go with smartphones. It just makes perfect sense. Its colourful and useful at the same time.

Live tiles are a brilliant idea, makes the phone look and feel alive. I can unlock my phone and straight away I get headlines, weather &amp; train delays.

Colour system - there are 20 colour themes to choose from and then the option to switch from dark to light. So giving you 40 options for themes.

Customize, The amount of options you can choose for your layout is unlimited. changing positions and sizes for your apps are great. You can spend hours getting it how you want and then changing it the week after. 

Menu layout. The setting page needs to be looked at. I don't know why they didn't put flight mode at the top. I use that option every night. An option to customize the layout would be nice.

Spell checker / predictive text – Hats off to Microsoft there. It’s very clever. Type the name Arnold and the name “Schwarzenegger” will appear for you to select. Even when typing normal sentences it will get it right most of the time. 

Disk mode – I hated that I had to use itunes to sync my music, pictures and videos. Now I can plug it into any PC and transfer everything using drag and drop. 

In my line of work I use Wi-Fi all the time. The great thing about this phone is that it connect to access points very quickly &amp; supports the use of proxy which not all phones do.

App Store – I know this is a big talking point when it comes to WP8, but we need to be patient. Microsoft is sitting on a gold mine here. It’s going to take a while to take off. But I can see the direction they are taking and I think it will work. Presently the app store is weak when you compare it to Apple and Google but, it’s getting better. I personally find the store acceptable. I have all the apps I need and haven’t lost any moving from iOS. Most apps in these stores are gimmicks. I’d hate to think the amount of money I have spent on apps in the last 4-5 years that I only used once. Microsoft is giving away all the tools and tuition for free to make apps for the store. I think 2013 will be an exciting year for WP8
I could seriously go on for hours but you might get bored. Please, if you have any questions just ask. I’m more than happy to help.

Thanks,

So goldegl contacted us anonymously and gave us some more details on what happened, and we felt this post was needed to tie up some loose ends from the last post. So here we go, in list form.

**It was not a redditor that caused trouble.** While posting goldegl's location was definitely not okay, it was revealed that a redditor, did not, in fact call in or visit or make a complaint. It was a post on MyNokiaBlog, which his superiors saw, and they were able to use the EXIF data to trace it back to goldegl. 

What remains unknown, however, is if someone tipped AT&amp;T off to MNB, or if AT&amp;T scans MNB regularly for leaks. If someone in the know has an answer for this (like, AT&amp;T IPs in the server logs), please do post it in the thread.

**goldegl definitely lost his job over this.** Thankfully, he's handling it quite well and has more work lined up, so he'll be okay. It still sucks major, but he seemed quite happy about the whole thing in post.

**He knows that not stripping the EXIF was a bad idea.** If you're going to comment on this post basically calling him an idiot for not stripping the EXIF, don't. He knows and he admitted that he had a lapse of judgement on that one.

That's all I've got right now. As for if you have questions for him, he wanted to remain anonymous as he currently has a lot going on and can't really answer questions.

I had been somewhat on the fence about getting the phone, and trying to find an unbiased review on the web has been damn near impossible. I found this sub to be the best place for people looking at the phone and WP8 with unbiased eyes and giving their honest opinions.

After 4.5 years of having iPhones, I jumped ship yesterday (thanks in part to a lot of your guys' comments) and picked up my Black Lumia 920. After a mere 24 hours with the phone, I absolutely love it and WP8. iOS feels so dated and cumbersome compared to WP8 IMO.

My thoughts/experiences so far:

*   This thing is FAST. Love the quickness of switching between apps, scrolling, downloads, etc.
* People complaining about the weight are crazy. If you can honestly notice the difference between 6 ounces and 4 ounces, hit the gym. I feel no noticeable difference between the weight of the Lumia and my previous iPhone 4 with a case.
* Live tiles are badass. Having things update on the start screen is just too cool. I just wish more apps had this function. I'm sure as app developers continue to update their apps they will integrate the live tile functions.
* No Spotify yet :( I'm a big Spotify user with a premium account, so I am disappointed that is not yet available. I know the Xbox Music is really good, but I don't want to start over again making new playlists, starred songs, etc.
* Canned Nokia Apps are really good. Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive+ are absolute standouts. A GPS program as good as Nokia Drive+ on iOS would cost a pretty penny, yet it is free on Lumia's.
* I was concerned about a lack of Apps initially, but I have found that there are plenty of Apps, and most the major ones I used on iOS are either available, or I have found a comparable alternative.
* After heavy use yesterday, I, like everybody else, had some concerns about the battery life. However today the battery seems to be performing much better after a full night of charge. I've been playing on the phone for 2-3 hours and have only lost about 15% of my charge. Things are looking up in regards to this issue.
* As somebody who hasn't used IE in years, I can honestly say that the IE for WP8 is so far, really good. It is extremely fast and responsive. MS has come a long way since IE6 haha.

1374788978.0,131,self.windowsphone,1j21ao,One month with a Lumia 920 from Android,149,18,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1j21ao/one_month_with_a_lumia_920_from_android/,"So its been a month.  I still haven't killed my Verizon line and have my Droid DNA, a highly underrated phone which is on par in my opinion with the HTC One and Samsung S4, in hand.  I find myself torn between two things which have really dominated my opinion on Android vs WP8:

1) The Android FEELS more complete.  Hardware wise, the specs are much higher, and the higher quality 1080p screen coupled with lighter weight, 5"" size, and better battery life feels like a AAA phone. The 920 feels REALLY solid and heavy, and in other areas it wins on hardware (camera is much better).  Android software vs WP feels more feature rich: there are key things like podcast management, maintenance, screen rotation lock, and available apps that feel more complete - the last point is especially important.  It's not that I feel starved for apps on wP8, I don't game on my phone really, but I often want a capability that either doesn't exist or the API on WP doesn't allow it. Id say 90% of core features are there, and a little polish is all that is needed. I was an early adopter of Android and the WP app ecosystem FEELS about like Android in 2009 - back then it was just slightly behind iPhone, but saw growth and a huge explosion of apps.  If WindowsPhone caught on just a little more, that appsplosion could bring us parity of appstores; I think the cheap lumias in the 520 series could bring us that edge. 

2) The Windowsphone, while outclassed in hardware and with fewer available Apps just FEELs more useful.  With a much less powerful cpu and memory it is more responsive and reliable.  While sometimes I think my android is a better overall experience, I cant deny that specific tasks and use cases are dramatically better on the Windowsphone:  Here's my experience so far:

Reading Reddit:  Windowsphone by a lot

Browsing Web:    Android for features (Dolphin with Lastpass), Windows phone for Smoothness and reliability by a lot

Taking photos and quality: Windowsphone by a lot

Calls and messaging: Android by a hair, just because of the voice dictation being universially built into the keyboard

Local search/yelping: Close call between bing local and google now

Podcast playback: Android (Beyondpod) by a mile

Driving directions: Android by a bit, DRIVE+ is better, but with Android you can just voice command (Navigate to XX) in one step

Youtube: Metrotube spanks anything on any other platform

Facebook/Twitter: I love that the built in people hub is all I need. WP by a lot.. I generally love that I need very few 3rd party apps to make the phone feel fully functional. (Android 80+, WP8: 9 installed. NINE.)


One last thought on Ecosystem: Microsoft needs to finally merge the Windows Store on Windows 8 and phone so one purchase is the same across all on the same account.  Skydrive is better for photo management in my opinion than the equivalent Picasa setup, but Google Music currently beats XBOX music because Scan and Match songs don't appear on the Phone, and music added to the cloud collection doesn't stream to anything if Microsoft doesn't have it in their collection; you should be able to add Mp3s to skydrive in a dedicated folder which would make them appear virtually in your cloud collection.  Movies purchased on XBOX video don't sync or anything to the phone why?  Again, give us a skydrive folder to put mp4s in that will appear in xbox video on all platforms along with purchases.

All in all though, I  find myself reaching for my Nokia more often than my HTC which is feeling a bit lonely these days.  I'll probably craigslist it next month.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,,True,t3_1j21ao,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1j21ao/one_month_with_a_lumia_920_from_android/,

1. Let companies know you would like an App for Windows Phone, but make it clear that you will seek an alternative and encourage others to do the same. 


2. If you have a bad experience at a store, it is on you personally go get the rep's info, their District Manager's info, and make the call.  Be clear you were interested in Windows Phone, and the rep didn't care to listen to your needs.  Make it about the rep's bad skills, and that Windows Phone users have a voice.

This wasn't our first meeting, so we were both relaxed and chatty, and after a couple of grimaces and ""tsk""s while typing, he mentioned how frustrating the iPhone's keyboard is. He spent a minute or so telling me about how he's used an iPhone for a while, and an Android device as well (one of the Samsung ones, I forget which) as well, and that both keyboards have been a constant source of frustration for him.

He concluded this short tirade with the sentence, ""I tell you there's nothing to beat Blackberry.""

I felt like an actor receiving his cue, and said, ""Well, actually..."" and pulled out my Lumia. I started up OneNote and handed it to him, asking him to try out the keyboard.

He took it and started typing away, and I could see by his frown of concentration that he was trying to type as fast as he could. I saw later that this is what he typed: *""Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. The war is raging wild and men are dying like flies. So come join your comrades and die like a fly.""*

After typing, he stops to read what he'd typed, and I got to see the comical sight of his eyebrows exploding upwards as he exclaimed, ""It's actually perfect! It got every word!"".

The next few minutes were spent discussing what apps were available, and what other Windows Phones were available. :D His only complaint about the Lumia was about the size of the device.

Winsource.com has been discovered to have many accounts as shill to promote their website over the past year. Over 9 accounts have been banned, and any links to this site will be spammed and removed as well. It will also be suggested to Reddit admin to ban this domain.

I want to take this time to remind you that /r/windowsphone does not tolerate blatant spamming of your website. I am a relatively new moderator for this subreddit, but I will continue to dig and find shill accounts for any other site.

If you wish to promote your site, sponsored links and sidebar banner ads are the only way to go, not by gaming the community for your benefit. If someone likes your site's content, they will post it on their own. As we recently saw with the Quickmeme scandal on /r/adviceanimals, this behavior is not to be tolerated.

If you suspect someone of spamming, especially if their user page is majority links and conversation pertaining to a particular site or sites, report the link and send a message to the moderators immediately.

Serious claims can also be submitted to /r/reportthespammers for a site-wide ban.

We will be passing this information on to moderators of other subreddits, but here is a short list of the accounts banned today per this decision, for transparency. Note that a few of them have already been deleted by the user or by Reddit for spamming. We will be watching to make sure new ones don't pop up.

There is only one discussion thread being allowed right now, [and that is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1g2eao/what_does_everyone_think_about_ios_7/) Why? Because everyone is reposting the same thing: iOS RIPPED OFF WINDOWS PHONE! iOS RIPPED OFF WINDOWS PHONE! 

One, there are sites already covering this feverishly. If you want to go circlejerk about how Apple screwed us over, then please do it elsewhere. This subreddit is for **Windows Phone**, not Apple or the iPhone. So don't post about how Apple's switching to Bing, or how iPhone users are hypocrites. These have zero to do with Windows Phone.

Two, fanboyism is explicitly outlined in the posting guidelines as verboten, and so far, all I've seen are threads and links that encourage a massive circlejerk. We are not /r/android. We are better than that. We can talk about iOS, it's similarities, and how it affects Windows phone without resorting to whining like a 12 year old collective.

Please. Keep it civil. That's all I ask.

WP has it's shortcomings, but they are greatly exaggerated and usually caused by bad hardware (like the 8x issues) or bad Carrier support (like delayed OS updates).

Well I'm here to say that your devs aren't going to abandon you, just like Nokia and Microsoft aren't going to abandon you. You already know I'm here to stay, and I just got here haha. But I think I speak for the rest of WP devs when I say: We wont abandon you. We know you love your phones, and we want to help you keep loving your phones. 

I hear the new instagram app by Rudy is going to be amazing. I wish I was as talented as him. Sadly, the only good thing I have going for me is a League of Legends app. But by God I will keep updating it til my hands bleed to make you guys happy. 

GDR1 has been out for a good while. GDR2 is rolling out right now. GDR3 is in the wings and WP 8.1 is on the Horizon!

I love you guys, I love this community, have a great day :) 

**edit** phew what a morning haha I feel like I've been replying nonstop to messages all day so far! You all have good points and I'm glad to see a lot of you are still in the optimistic spirit like myself :) I hope I haven't personally offended anyone, as that was not my intention. I just think too much negativity will hurt our community more than help it. I mean, look what happened to /r/atheism..... I just don't want this to become /r/WeHateWindowsPhoneBecause....

**edit edit** I'm also very sorry to those of you who thought this was some underhanded attempt to promote my app or cover up the shortcomings of windows phone. I in no way think windows phone is perfect. But the negaitivity and blatant ignorance of how updates on other OSes work put me in a tizzy. iOS gets an update maybe once a year. iOS 6 was barely different from iOS 5 except for the change to apple centered apps instead of Google. And most users hated that. The rest of the update were just refreshes of their already baked in apps, which Microsoft and Nokia update those pretty regularly for us (minus Xbox Music of course), but technically they still have a few months left to release WP 8.1 in the same update timeframe as iOS and do an Xbox Music refresh for their phones JUST like Windows 8.1 has an Xbox Music refresh that greatly improves it. Just don't raise your pitchforks and hate Microsoft just because didn't get the latest and greatest update two weeks ago on the spot. It's coming, I personally promise.

Also, everyone hates MS Xbox Music app, but does iOS or Android let your tap to send or message or share your songs no questions asked to any other device? (Honestly, do they? I don't know hahah) Because if they don't, then that is a huge plus for Xbox Music.

I know that something which looks simple, like getting an app to be 100% buttery-smooth, takes effort. You guys do a great job.

I also love to bash Microsoft's PR, but the truth is that their PR does a great job with what they're given. I realize you can't do anything about the lack of VPN, or the state of xbox music. You work around that, thanks for putting up with my whining.

To whomever is in charge of updates, please do a better job coordinating them. To everyone else at Microsoft, thank you.

In 6 minutes with the S4, the world's most crazy phone in terms of specs, a fucking 8 core CPU god knows how much clocked at, and twice the RAM on the Lmuia, I managed, again in only 5-6 minutes, I managed to:

1- Notice scrolling lag in many apps and even in contact list

2- See how cluttered the phone is

3- Scrolling lag if abusing the home screen.

4- I was browsing Gamespot and IGN on desktop mode, and while the S4 has most of the time smoother scrolling than the 920, it does skip on heavy parts of a website, so for me a controlled purposefully slower scroll of the 920 has the better results. At the top of IGN.COM the S4 would stutter like a bitch after coming there top speed from the bottom.

5- After I closed the Android browser I pressed camera app and the phone froze for 2-3 seconds COMPLETELY before the camera launched.

6- Typing lag, typing lag everywhere.

Those 6 minutes just sum up Android for me, it's fucked beyond fixing.  Every version we hear promises of it becoming lag free and we start to worry about WP falling behind again but Android just becomes worse.

Oh, he is returning his S4 (bought 4 days ago) and getting a Lumia 925 or whatever comes next here. He was absolutely astonished how quick and smooth the phone was. I have it for half a year, and its loaded full of apps, videos and music.

That's always been my opinion on Android, and I think the 5 minutes really made me sure that I'm right. I won't recommend an Android to anybody, at any price. 

I'll take some shit from Microsoft, I'll take it if that means my phone won't give me daily episodes of rage. I'm impressed all over again with my phone on a daily basis because it's just so consistent at not disappointing me. No little freezes / lags / slowness which you come not only to expect from a phone, but to accept from a phone. They just do not exist, and this alone is a gigantic advantage. It's butter smooth, and insanely consistent.



EDIT: Seeing that this thread has quite a few replies, I am obliged to point out that I am not ignorant. I KNOW that BECAUSE of Android's customizability performance could suffer, terribly. But I still think Android is broken. Take my mom for example, first time smartphone user, I got her a Lumia 620 and she loves it, the thing flies. If she had gotten an S4 it would slow down to a halt after 2-3 months because Android lacks robust controls and the OS is overrun with unnecessary shit. 

I think the Android approach is more suitable for PCs, like the difference between a Mac and Windows. But I do not think the ""PC-way"" is the way to go on mobile, I think Microsoft ABSOLUTELY nailed it by starting over and closing down the OS. A phone should just work, something everyone learned from Apple. We do get some shit from this with restricted APIs and what not, but as the OS proves itself I reckon some restrictions will go, until Microsoft sees how much it can push things without breaking the OS, just like Apple.

As for an ""untouched Google experience"", I did try a my friend's Nexus which he had for a year or something. He's a very hands on kind of person and I am sure that his phone, as he claimed, is optimized to the limits. I still found it well, let's say clumsy. I always expected the phone to disappoint me, and it often did. I know it's not the newest nor the greatest Android, but when a Lumia 620, heck even 520! Feels smoother, you got problems in Android; stock or TouchWiz or LagInterface or whatever.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,1372895420.0,,phone-yellow,True,t3_1hd28q,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1hd28q/why_i_wont_ever_get_tempted_by_flashy_androids/,

1369303331.0,99,self.windowsphone,1ew8mc,[Modpost] Linkbait and Fanboyism,110,11,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1ew8mc/modpost_linkbait_and_fanboyism/,"This is something I meant to address at one point or another, and a fellow redditor actually reminded me of this today. Basically we've got two topics that I feel may or may not go hand in hand with eachother: **Linkbait** and **Fanboyism**.

Now, allow me to define what I think constitutes **linkbait**: An article or post that is written with an intent to provoke or from a sensationalist angle to attract attention to said article, be it good or bad attention. General examples of this are putting words in a company's mouth (trying to point the finger at them and assume they have ulterior motives without actually having any sources on the situation, a la the hate that was slung at Apple for ""banning gay sex"", when in fact it was revealed that there was never a ban in the first place), or saying something that is *very* obviously biased. 

If you're going to link an article or even your own article: Please link articles that are bias-free in their reporting and are well sourced. Do not link sensationalist garbage that is written to rile people up and/or generate page views. That stuff doesn't belong here. It reflects poorly on the community.

The second thing I want to talk about is **fanboyism**. This is something I've been against since day one here, and I feel that we can definitely do without it. Thankfully it hasn't gotten too bad here (okay, it got crazy bad during the iPhone 5 release), but I'd like to make sure it stays that way. Sure, *you* (and everyone else here, because that's why we're here, right?) may think that WP8 is superior, but by no means is it for everyone. There's a reason that WP8, Android, and iOS exist in the same market--they serve different people's needs, and we need to respect that.

If you hate the iPhone, or if you hate Google, feel free to take your hate to another subreddit and circlejerk about it all you like. But don't bring it here. We're here to talk about Windows Phone, not about the other platforms and how *they're* doing. If you're going to link something or start a selfpost with the sole intention to circlejerk about how Microsoft rules and everyone else sucks, your post is probably getting removed. We can be passionate about Windows Phone without stooping to that level. We're awesome like that. Let's keep it that way.

Lastly, as far as enforcement goes, please don't fret if you notice any inconsistencies at the moment. It's purely because we're a bit understaffed (and we're working on bringing more people onto the staff as we speak). However, I do pay attention to the queue, so if you notice anything that needs my attention, report it or mark it as spam and I'll go right over to it. Or just message me with a link to the offending thread. Either way will work.

Thanks for your guys' patience thus far. I'm trying to work on things as quickly as I can (and not die of illness, too. It's been a bad week.)

The big beautiful screen, the unified UI, it's indestructibility, Just everything about it. So my parents bought it for me after 3 weeks of research and mental warfare. I was SO EXCITED...Till I walked out of the store.

The took my Lumia and told me that I can't use it until Christmas. Awesome.

Without Nokia exclusive apps, their hardware, their superior marketing, their spectacular camera innovations, their inbuilt map capabilities and continuous/rapid frame of tweaks/upgrades to better their overall package... I can't imagine WP surviving long at all. 

MSFT has only a few aces up their sleeves before competition catches up and they have continued to bungle their way forward. Let's take these one by one. 

1) Skype - It may help to know that Skype was purchased in 2011 and yet they have been unable to integrate it properly into the WP framework. Deep integration into the ""People"" hub is but one of the discontinuous experiences they could have created but yet it's nowhere near completion. 

2) Xbox - One would imagine MSFT could have pushed hard to bring ""first to the world"" play on any device and have a seamless experience across PCs, xbox, tablets and phone. But save for 1 game, this has not happened. Aside from achievements and gamer score, I'm still not sure what's the point of Xbox live status games. And don't get me started on xbox video and xbox music both of which are disasters on WP right now. 

3) Enterprise support - This is mindboggling really as this should be an easy win for MSFT with the IT professionals who matter. Instead, the excruciatingly slow pace of innovation and completion of feature set (No VPN?) is allowing iOS and Android to make inroads into the BYOD future and once again MSFT will be super late to the table. 


Not only is the pace of news and innovation extraordinarily slow on MSFT's end, they continue to wreck what has been working fine like removal of Zune support and replacing with Xbox music with no fix in sight. Heck they even wrecked the live tile feature!! They removed features like FM radio for no reason whatsoever (I mean how do you go about removing features?!) and are touting this in the next upgrade. And yes, no one needs octa-core WP devices but let that be a hardware maker's decision. The OS needs to be capable to support whatever boundaries hardware makers are pushing. Why give other platforms opportunities easy competitive wins? In fact, Nokia is already pushing the upper level of specs on their phones and are now fast becoming constrained by MSFT. 


IMO, MSFT really really needs to up the game here. Nokia cannot continue to push this platform all by their selves. ",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,phone-orange,True,t3_1f2a9t,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1f2a9t/does_anyone_here_agree_that_without_nokia_wp/,

1369020042.0,88,self.windowsphone,1eo88x,Any Spotify users not satisfied with the current app?,91,3,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1eo88x/any_spotify_users_not_satisfied_with_the_current/,"I emailed Spotify to pass along issues that I was having and express my overall dissatisfaction with it's current state and stability.  The response I got is that they have not received complaints about the issues so it must be my installation that was not working correctly.As Spotify is my most used app, I feel that I might being seeing more issues because I'm using it constantly.Are you guys seeing any of the issues (or any others) below?The issues and functionality problems I submitted are:1. Radio is not available.2. Frequently gets stuck on the green Spotify loading or resuming screen until the phone force quits the app.3. Does not keep track of the last song you were listening to if the music is paused for greater than 5 seconds.4. Cannot search for or add shared playlists from the search function.5. There is no option to scrub to a time position in the currently playing song. The user has to select previous to return to the beginning of the song which will sometimes actually skip to the next song.6. Takes a long time to recognize that a playlist is saved to the phone and will actually tell you that you don’t have the right to play the song as the app is stuck in offline mode. Requires the user to back out of the app to fix.7. Does not always play the first song selected from a playlist. The user has to select a song, back out to the top menu and select a different song just to get the app to start playing any sounds.8. Unable to sort tracks inside playlists or even search for songs in playlist. The size of the text in the app makes finding music in large playlists a chore.9. Does not scrobble music played to either the Spotify servers or Last.fm. iOS version shows what people are listening to on their phones.10. Unable to share music to Spotify friends from the app. There is a share function, but it is literally every possible way to share except across the Spotify network.11. Frequently starts music paused when skipping through tracks or just playing the next song in a list so the user has to select play after selecting the song.12. App will delete the play queue and stop music playback if a Bluetooth device is disconnected from the phone. This is different behavior from when an earphone is unplugged which usually causes the app to simply pause the music. This is incredibly annoying.13. Skipping to the next song will produce an audio pause/delay that is great enough to make the app seem as though it has crashed (~5-8 seconds).14. Pushing songs from computer over wi-fi is not supported.15. The algorithm used for shuffle is atrocious. Will frequently shuffle artists then play the entirety of album.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,phone-red,True,t3_1eo88x,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1eo88x/any_spotify_users_not_satisfied_with_the_current/,

Soon enough, a Verizon customer service rep was assigned to us.  He saw us hanging out around the Nokia section, then he saw us wander over the Samsung section, and what he said initially was what was expected, that the S4 had more options, that Nokia was a newer system, that WP8 did not have a lot of apps, etc.

Funny how he did not mention the offline capabilities of Nokia maps, the awesone City Lens app, or the fact that it is the BEST camera on a smartphone in the market, period.  It's also funny how the manager tried to dissuade us from making the purchase, and when she saw how we were intent on getting it, tried to throw in all this unnecessary gear, like a case, insurance, and what other used car salesman-equivalent bs add-ons she could think of.  

Finally, when the rep tried to transfer information from my wife's phone over to her new 928, he failed.  I told him I would do it and we walked out of that store.  I ended up doing what he couldn't do 10 seconds walking out of that store.

If this is the typical experience for a prospective customer going into Verizon, Nokia is in for an uphill fight.  The customer service reps are completely uninformed about these phones.  I could sell these phones better than these buggers.

UPDATE:  wow, my trust in Verizon has just plummeted.  I was getting ready to fill out the forms on the rebate when I looked at the receipt and it said ""REB80917EN (Rebate Not Eligible)"".  Guess I will have to go back to the store to take care of this.  And this time I will give them a piece of my mind.

EPILOGUE:  I didn't have to go to the store.  A very helpful Verizon phone rep cleared through that issue.  Apparently, a lot of VZ receipts says ""rebate not eligible"" but that does not necessarily make it so.  He was infinitely more helpful than the actual physical reps from yesterday.  This does make up for the substandard purchasing experience yesterday.  My wife LOVES the phone.

1373323444.0,80,self.windowsphone,1hw8yv,Some tips for assimilating to the Microsoft Ecosystem,87,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1hw8yv/some_tips_for_assimilating_to_the_microsoft/,"So I got my Lumia 920 and I like it, but I had an obsessive-compulsive itch about the fact that I was using a Windows 8 Workstation as my business driver, a Windows 8 Laptop/Tablet hybrid (the awesome Lenovo Yoga 13) as my recreational/couch surfer, and Windows 8 phone:

BUT still tied to Google searches, Google Drive, Gmail, Gtalk, Picasa/Plus+, Chrome, and Google Music.

So here is what I did:

**Email**: visit outlook.com and connect in your gmail account as a 'send and receive' account.  This appears to be a new feature - it lets outlook.com and your W8 desktop mail client work with gmail seamlessly and download your message history too.  

**Messaging:**  When outlook.com and the desktop messaging app are connected to Google, you can message Gtalk contacts directly!

**Contacts:** goto contacts.google.com, select all contacts, and export to outlook .csv format.  Goto outlook.com, click the down arrow at the top left and select people, then import from file.

**Music:**  Download google play music manager and download your library.  Then load XBOX music desktop client and load those files for the matching service.  This can be very manually intensive, but once matched, the albums are available everywhere on all your microsoft devices.

**Chrome:** I found that the main features i needed with chrome were in IE10 which has made leaps in improvements over old IE7.  I found myself enjoying its simplicity as a built-in feature to windows.  I needed tracking lists to simulate adblock, lastpass for desktop instead of lastpass extension, and since IE doesnt support scripts and i missed Reddit Enhancement Suite, i just started using Reddit on Redhub Metro app instead.

**Google Drive:**  I moved everything in Google Drive over to Skydrive using the cloud migration service at mover.io.  I didnt have to download and reupload, I just set the batch job and 24 hours later everything was copied 1-1 - which was useful for the next step!

**Pictures!** - I had a lot of these.  Skydrive $10 / 20gb yearly covered it though, even though it was a little more than my Google drive legacy plan.  The biggest pain was that mover.io didnt support Picasa! So i had to do this in two stages: first i used pi.pe which is another cloud migration service which supports Picasa, but not Skydrive (Grr).  Once I migrated picasa's content to Google Drive, it was cloud copied to skydrive in the previous step.

**Google Search:**  Surprisingly easy to give up.  I googled so much for the past 8 years I thought i could never live with bing but it kinda felt cool to be on one ecosystem and i found the quality of the searches absolutely on par with google, especially for Microsoft product related stuff.

**Google Voice:**  I CANT QUIT YOU.  Microsoft, are you still bringing us Bing Ring to compete?

**Added note:**  As google is deprecating the awesome iGoogle home page next fall, I found my MSN to be highly competent as an alternative and have moved over to using it. 

Microsoft, this wasnt obvious stuff.  I mean it wasnt hard stuff, but If i were microsoft i would be advertising this kind of migration guide packaged with every new PC and phone you sell.  Ecosystem loyalty is big money in the long run!

I use it full time. I'd love to use WP, but I'm waiting for the WP8 devices to come out (and get some use and reviews), and I'm waiting for Sprint's WP8 devices. I like Android, and I think it's come a long way. One thing I don't like about Android is it's community: It's full of people who are deeply entrenched in the belief that for one platform to win, everyone else must meet a horrible demise. Deep in the trenches of /r/android, this happens damn near 24/7; they put down other platforms moreso than they talk about their own.

This is one of the reasons I frequent /r/windowsphone. This place rarely, *if ever*, contains posts that are fanboy tripe putting down another platform needlessly, or trying to ignite fanboy wars between platforms. This subreddit has always been about making Windows Phone a better platform, not tearing down and complaining about other platforms and how much they suck. And I'd much prefer it stayed that way.

Yes, I get it: The iPhone 5 was disappointing to you, or the Lumia 920 is better than it in every other way. We all have our personal preferences. But for chrissakes, can we continue on without trying to put down other platforms/igniting platform wars?

I upgraded from my trusty Samsung Focus, and I've been in love with the phone since, and never looked back. The one thing I didn't do, however, is get a screen protector or case for the phone.

About three weeks ago I dropped my phone on the street.

Most of us will drop our phones at one point or another. iPhones tend to have their screens break mid-air due to the panic attacks the phones have before they even hit the ground. They're just that fragile. Androids do anything from tell the ground to go **** itself and bounce away harmlessly to shattering into a thousand pieces. Such is the way of the Great Google™. The screen on a Lumia 920s? They're slippy. Real slippery. So slippery, in fact, that if I were to describe them as any scene from a movie I'd have to choose Christmas Vacation be where Clark Griswold applies the experimental wax to the bottom of the sled. NOT an exaggeration. Google ""lumia 920 moving on its own"" and there's quite a few results. Put it down face, and the damn phone has the potential to move on its own due to the sheer brilliance of its LCD coating. It's actually rather scary at times.

That established, you now know why my phone shot out of my hand like a greased banana in a hurricane. When my phone hit the street, then proceeded to slide damn near ten feet away, I bit my lip. THE HORROR!

I hesitantly picked up my phone, fearing the worst.. and there they were. Black marks on the side of the once-shiny red plastic, micro-scratches dotted the screen. MY BABY! SOMEBODY HURT MY BABY!

Years ago, my parents were murdered in a tragic accident involving a failed magician and a magic trick gone horribly, HORRIBLY wrong. Long story short, my parents got better. Last night, when I picked up my phone, the black scuff marks on the phone fell off. That's right. The dark black marks the phone picked up when it smashed into the street just peeled off on their own. My only assumption is that the phone itself rejected the sheer concept of being damaged. And the screen? The scratches are nearly gone. From where I could feel them before, now they're barely visible, like they outright healed themselves. 

Not sure how, not sure why, I didn't think it was even possible, but at this point, I'm pretty sure that Nokia's phones are protected by Ukko, the Finnish lord of thunder. Whatever the case may be, Nokia phones obviously continue their legendary status even today.

I love my Windows Phone now more than ever.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,,True,t3_15wxpb,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/15wxpb/a_tale_of_the_lumia_920s_durability/,

You think, ""Damn, this camera is horrible with details"". Well don't be shocked when I tell you, The photo is much sharper then you think.

After a photo is taken, Windows Phone downsamples the PREVIEW of the image so that when you pinch and zoom and move around the image it is all smooth and buttery.

Don't believe me? Download ""HD Photo Viewer"" on the store (I'm not the developer) and see for yourself...

I love my Lumia 920, and I try to convince everyone with a POS iPhone to try it out, but I think there's a major, major issue with the lack of live tile apps.

1353317157.0,77,self.windowsphone,13fzxk,This time last week my Windows Phone was MORE useful.,97,20,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/13fzxk/this_time_last_week_my_windows_phone_was_more/,"This time last week I had a Samsung Focus I bought at launch and a long-time Zune Pass subscription. I had 2 auto playlists, one for 'favorites' and another for 'not heard' that would wirelessly sync to my phone when I plugged it in an went to bed. I had several podcasts that I listened to on my way to work as well that would also sync while I slept. 

Then I 'upgraded' to a Lumia 920, WP8, and XB Music. I LOVE the phone, I'm excited for the potential of the OS, and I was under the impression that XBM was just a facelift, but the loss of the Zune software to sync (I'm on Win7) has been a total letdown.

The WP8 sync software for Win7 is, to be blunt, an embarrassment. It looks like it was ""designed"" in about 10 minutes. If I was a MS employee who worked on the Zune software, I would be HUMILIATED to even be associated with it. The level of functionality when compared to Zune is, wait, there is no comparison. MS themselves recommend using iTunes (!!!!!!!!!) to manage podcasts! Unreal. Wireless sync is a distant memory. 

I personally have reverted to Windows Fucking Media Player just to sync a playlist with the device. However, the Zune Pass content I synced as part of the playlist will not play, as it says I don't have the rights to it. Regardless of the fact that my phone is connected to the goddamn internet and I have aligned the goddamn stars with a thousand accounts and whatnot as part of my MS ID/Gamertag/Live blah blah fucking blah. All I want to do is listen to a song that I pay you money to play.

I think what really blows my mind is that here is a company who spends hundreds of millions of dollars on development, manufacturing, sales, advertising etc. etc. just to get a phone in my hand and at the end of the day, I can't listen to my downloaded copy of Akon's 'Smack That.' C'mon Ballmer, c'mon Belfiore, c'mon Elop give me the goddamn 'Smack That.'

I should go to bed...

* Improve the chat/messaging sync with Facebook (this is a dead horse i know, but needs to be done). They should also make the messages sync across w8 and x1. Seamless chatting across all platforms should be a key feature.

* I've said this before in a previous comment but allow other apps to link with the messaging hub (eg whatsapp, skype etc). Similar to lens integration, and Facebook app where you can use both the messaging hub and the app itself. Notifications could be set to default to either, but they need to show up in both.

* Allow sms sending/receiving to/from windows 8 pcs, xbox one, and possibly from outlook online. This could be done either via Bluetooth or the same thing they do to send apps to your phone. Either way, they could make this a big selling point.

* Semi-unrelated but they should also allow you to select multiple messages to delete (like you can threads using tick boxes). Again, this needs to sync across all devices.

Basically, I'm just tired of seeing MS come out with all this 'unified ecosystem' 'three screens and a cloud' stuff and then not actually *doing* anything about it, and for me this is most obvious in messaging (and store purchases but i am less bothered by this - being poor means i rarely if ever buy apps). 

I hope this is addresed in a near future version of windows.

1352569654.0,77,self.windowsphone,12yy4g,The Truth about the Nokia Lumia 920 - My User Review,98,21,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/12yy4g/the_truth_about_the_nokia_lumia_920_my_user_review/,"Hey everyone! As you know I was answering a lot of questions about the Lumia 920 these past few days since I was fortunate enough to pick on up in Canada on Tuesday. After having the device for half a week I'd like to outline all aspects of the device and what I've come to know it by. I will touch the good aspects which make me love the phone, the bad aspects which make me hate it, and a few other random things. I'm going to start with the bad however, that we at least it ends on a positive note.

As a quick introduction of myself, I'm 22 years old, live in Canada and recently graduated with a BBA Marketing, and BBA Finance. I'm now working as a Marketing Manager for a SharePoint software solutions company in Seattle/Dubai. I've been looking forward to this phone ever since they announced WP8 (Apollo), and even more so once Nokia unveiled it in early September. For the past two years I've been using a Samsung Focus which I purchased on released day back in 2010--so I'm one of the original WP users, and even had my fair share of WinMobile devices before that such as an HP iPaq.

The not so great:

(1) Cable Placement. 
Compared to the focus, it's annoying to have the AUX at the top an micro-USB at the bottom. I tend to travel a lot and always play music off my phone in the car. I use both AUX/USB to play the music and charge it at the same time. This is really annoying to have cables coming out of both sides of the device and extremely difficult to try and play anywhere a car nicely without it flopping around because it's sitting on a cable.

(2) Volume. 
I know everyone was asking about this, and now I finally get it! At the place I'm staying at right now I've been having to use the alarm on my phone to wake me up. On the Focus, I would set the audio to '5' and it would most definitely wake me up! Last night I had my Lumia 920 set to '10' and I managed to sleep right through it and miss an important company meeting this morning. Not impressed by the least. When listening to music its between 15-30. Although this was normal for me on the Focus as well.

(3) Speaker Placement.
When watching videos on the device and using external speakers it just doesn't feel right. Both speakers are at the bottom of the device and produce one-sided sound. I actually find this distracting to listen to at times.

(4) Speaker Quality.
I tend to like high-end audio devices--such as this amp and Tannoy speaker set just for my desktop computer. The speakers on the Lumia 920 produce little to no bass which produces an unbalanced sound. Although I would never expect a small, portable device to perform well in this aspect, when comparing to the Focus, or various other mobile devices it comes up short. The result is a slightly 'tin' sound.

(5) Device size.
It's quite large. Even in comparison to the 4.1"" Samsung Focus, which is already a nicely-sized phone, the Lumia 920 feels almost like a mini tablet instead. Although this isn't all bad here, I'm including it in this section because sometimes it is just hard to pick up or hold with one hard. Sometimes it even hard just to get it out of my pocket, then fear dropping it once I do get it out. 

The 'I don't really care about':

(1) Device weight.
This is the one aspect everyone has been talking about with this phone. But you know what? I actually couldn't care less. It's not like I'm not worried that I can't walk as far as I could with a lighter phone because its weighing me down. Phone weight is something that one company (*cough*, Apple) seems to make important to their users. To me, the weight of the phone isn't important because that's not its core function. Unless it does actually have the same weight as a brick, then I won't ever care. And remember, I went from the Focus to the 920. And the Focus was the lightest WP.

(2) Top of the device flexes.
Most of you will not have known this, and it actually took me three days to finally confirm this. But if you hold the device at both the top and bottom and squeeze a bit the top of the device, just about the front-facing camera will flex a bit. Why don't I care? Because it took me three days of trying this on and off to finally actually notice it, and the fact I have to hold the phone in such a specific way to even see this effect. By no means does it take away from the solid feel of the phone, and it doesn't feel any cheaper because no one will ever know unless you tell them.

(3) Vibrate.
Its very quiet, and doesn't seem very powerful to say the least. I will say that if you're in university and your phone vibrates in class someone on the other side of the room of 100 people won't be able to hear the 920, so that's good at least. Even in a small room I don't think someone will hear it very far, and I'd actually rate it as the quietest vibrate out of any phone I've used anyway.

What works well:

(1) Aesthetics.
The phone is gorgeous. It's simple yet elegant. Similar to the look of the 800 and 900 the 920 maintains a really simplistic, minimal look that is of high-quality and class. I have the matte-black model of the phone and I can say the brushed poly-carbonate exterior is soft, smooth, and isn't cold to the touch like an iPhone. The front of the device has a very professional glossy screen.

(2) Screen.
The screen on this phone is truly amazing. With the resolution of a 15.6"" laptop in a 4.5"" screen the pixel density (332ppi) creates an awesome user-experience. Web pages are amazing to browse on this phone because you can see everything without having to zoom in much, if any. The color representation isn't as good as the Focus, although this is just differences in screen technologies. With that said, the AMOLED screens tend to have way higher contrast as well. For a high-end IPS panel the Lumia 920 seems to pull it off. The colors are quite rich, and the 'black' portions of the screen doesn't have insane backlight leak like a cheap HP laptop. When viewed directly on actually you can't even notice the edges of the screen--similar to AMOLED. The refresh rate is also noticeable! at 60hz with the 1.5 dual-core processor scrolling is a bit more fluid. Sometimes refresh rates are hard to nice if you've never seen the difference. As I actually use both 60hz and 120hz monitors when working my eye has been taught to see the difference (and yes, 120hz is truly the most epic computer experience you can get).

(3) Camera.
Outstanding. I've always been a skeptic of mobile cameras, and I probably always will be. To me, the sensor size is too small to capture enough light to make a decent picture decent. To that, full frame DSLR's all the way! Or at least a point &amp; shoot camera over a phone right? Well, maybe not anymore. Although I would not replace any of my actual cameras for the one on the Nokia, I can certainly say the 920 is the first mobile devices that its been close enough for me to consider that. And in many situations, I probably will give up taking a small point &amp; shoot where I don't need an DSLR. The quality of photos the 920 takes is truly amazing. They are crip, clean, and mostly-importantly: sharp. To really show you what I'm talking about. [check out this picture](http://i.imgur.com/3UuwU.jpg) that was taken in a 100% black room around 2AM last night. This was using the flash and flash-focus assist. It looks like daytime, that is all I really have to say. And even when taking pictures of dark places in low light, the finish picture is about 60% brighter than when it shows on the screen right before you take it. Most mobile devices produce a darker pictures lol.

(4) Call quality.
Actually really good! And its easy to hear in loud places as well. I made lots of call in public the last few days and had phenomenal results. Way better than the focus for sure.

(5) Front-facing camera.
Amazing to have finally! By no means is this camera the quality of the rear one though.

(6) Flashlight.
For all of those out there that use flashlight apps, be prepared to be blinded. The dual-lumen LEDs on the back of this thing will even burn through sunlight I'm sure. I'll say they are somewhere near the 50-70 lumen mark, which is insane for a phone.

(6) Hardware performance.
This one is hard to report on without bringing the aspect of software in, and I'd like to just focus on the device itself here. I can say that it is even more responsive than the previous WPs and responds well.

(7) Nokia Apps.
As with the 800/900 Nokia has included a bunch of applications on the phone, all of which I have found useful. Specifically: Cinemagraph, Creative Studio, Nokia Maps, Nokia City Lens, Nokia Drive, Nokia Transport, Panorama, and Smart Shoot. Of these, Nokia Maps, drive, and city lens are the most useful.

(8) Signal Strength.
In comparison to other phones and devices, the Lumia 920 gets better signal strength. We compared the 920 to both the 900 and a hotspot I have and the 920 score 1-2 bars more on average with LTE.

(9) Battery Life.
This question is going to be extremely difficult to answer. As I've mentioned above I travel a lot, and work from many, many places. During this time I have always had time to recharge my phone on the way to ensure it's always topped off. So as someone that isn't away from the charger all day like most, it's hard to express. The best test for this is going to be this upcoming week as I'll be down in Las Vegas for a conference and WILL be away from chargers most of the day.

What I've noticed: the battery life is 'reasonable' for everything that the phone has it in. I mean, I'm running it on LTE with almost all features turned on except Blutooth and WiFi. That's a lot for a phone to go through all day, and I have a lot of background apps pushing content, and have seven email addresses set to sync 'as items arrive'. I'm also always on it sending/receiving calls, and its always in front of me helping me work. 

With all this said, I have only had one instance where I was actually really low on battery. On Thursday I took my laptop and went to starbucks for a fairly long period of time after running a bunch of errands in the area. The phone was off the charger from around 2:30PM until 11:30PM and had run down to around 18% or so. During this time I probably talked for about an hour on the phone, sent/received many, many text messages, answered emails, browsed the web, and read updates on various stock/investing applications. I didn't play any games, and had WiFi off the entire time. For me, this is pretty normal of a phone, and the Focus was no different. I don't expect smartphones to last the entire day perfectly, I would expect them to start at 100% when you leave in the morning and grasp on to their life in the last 10% when you get back home. This is one of those phones I think. It will get you through the day just fine, but not much more then that.

I'll update this battery section again throughout next week while I'm in the states.


(10) Although this is software related, I feel this need to be posted. WP8 Music services are absolutely astonishing. I use Zune pass, and have now for the past year and a half (ever since it was available in Canada). With WP8 however, Zunepass just got a bit more epic with cloud-synchronization of music. What does this mean exactly? I can download music on either my Win8 desktop, Win8 laptop, or WP8 and automatically have it download and sync to all of my devices. I pay only $10/mo and have access to millions of songs of which I can download as many as I'd like. I can stream music to any of these devices from the cloud, or download them for offline use and saving data. Not many people know about Zune Pass (XBOX music) these days in comparison to say, iTunes method of music. The fact is though, this is the only affordable way consumers can have music, and the only true easy way to do it. I was first impressed with Zunepass as a service to begin with, and now I'm blown away by the ability to share unlimited music. --and keep in mind too, you can easily transfer songs to your friends with tap-n-send, and as long as they have Zunepass as well, they are good to go.

The Verdict:

I really don't like reviews because they always push their views onto consumers. I hope what I've done in simply provide a perspective on the device which you can take and form your own opinion. And again, if anyone has any questions about the device I'll do my best to answer them below. And is any of you would like, I can do another review on the actual software of Windows Phone 8 in comparison to 7.0 and 7.5 in another post.

EDIT: Holy crap I wrote a lot.

Instead of having all of these posts around I thought it'd be pleasant to have them all nicely listed in one place, so you as a reader will have an easier time finding them.

Sadly it seems to be lacking full reviews of the ATIV S currently. 

Feel free to post if there's something missing though! I'll gladly add them.

Please forgive me if I commit any cardinal sins in creating this post; it's my first time submitting anything besides a simple link on reddit.

I've been a Windows Phone user for almost a year now, and I really have to say, I love the platform. It's way different from anything else out there. Yet, I see a lot of people complaining about features that turn it into a copy of android. Sure, there are some functionality things that I understand (such as VPN or orientation lock) and hope will be addressed in an update. Then there are other suggestions (like a notification center) that undermine the principle of the OS. The live tiles are there so you can unlock your phone and immediately see ""Oh, I have two missed calls, a text, and 3 emails."" There are 5 basic notification spots and one detailed spot on the WP8 lockscreen, and you're free to arrange your live tiles however you wish. I'm sure that if there are things that you need immediate notifications about, you can find a way.

The fact that other programs can't have access to much except for their own live tiles is probably why WP8 is a really secure platform. Developers having access to a central part of the operating system could be one of the reasons Andriod is having problems with security holes.

Again, this is just my two cents. If you like the way Windows Phone functions, great. If you don't, please don't try to turn it into Android with a bunch of features the rest of us don't really want.

Thanks!

Edit: Several of the comments below have indicated that this post comes across as a cultish mindset, and that was definitely not what I was going for. Maybe singling out the notification center wasn't the best example, but my main point is this: When I hear a lot of people complaining about features on WP8 (not here specifically, but on all the other websites as well), they seem to want the Android experience on a Windows Phone. For example, when suggesting a way to implement a notification center, I hear so many people wanting to swipe down from the top of the screen and have the center, exactly the way Android does. When Windows does have a notification center, I hope that it will be an original concept that blends in with the rest of the theme of WP8. That's all I'm trying to say.",,False,self,t5_2r71o,1353014715.0,,phone,True,t3_138ucp,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/138ucp/windows_phone_android/,

1376113357.0,75,self.windowsphone,1k2quk,[Sticky] Posting guidelines and resource links. PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING!,100,25,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1k2quk/sticky_posting_guidelines_and_resource_links/,"(To existing members: We are not introducing new rules or anything, this is just a post made to use reddit's new sticky function, so that people even on mobile clients can see the rules and such.)

Hello, and welcome to /r/WindowsPhone, the subreddit for, well, Windows Phone! We're a pretty friendly environment of Windows Phone users and enthusiasts. This post is a crash course on what you need to know to post here.

**Rules**

-**Images must be in a selfpost**. Photography with your Windows Phones should either be redirected to /r/lumialens (despite the name, it's a community for ALL Windows Phone pictures), or you can wait for the weekly thread. ""I took a picture with my WP"" threads will be removed. As a sub-rule to this, **memes and image macros will be removed.**

-**Blogspam is not allowed.** We don't care that you want to promote your site, but we ask that you be reasonable in doing so. Maintain a good comment-to-link ratio, and link to sites other than your own just as often as you link yourself.

-**Refrain from fanboyism/circlejerking**. If the purpose of an article is simply to stir the pot or to crap upon another platform, it's going to be removed. Discussing other platforms is okay, but circlejerking about our own is not. Keep things civil.

-**Please follow reddiquette.** Downvote only because someone is adding nothing to the conversation, not because they're playing devil's advocate and going with an unpopular opinion.

**Guidelines**  
(Note, these can go either way as far as mod enforcement goes, but we won't generally remove posts that violate the aforementioned guidelines. The community, however, may not be so merciful.)

-**Please link the source.** This means that if The Verge is reporting a story that WPCentral first reported, you should go back to WPCentral and post that link, as they broke the news, and therefore, deserve the traffic and exposure. Please don't post links to your own site that simply regurgitate what others have said prior. If you want to link to something that's NOT the source, it should add something.

-**Participate in the comments before submitting links.** When you make a new account and try to submit a link from the get-go, it doesn't make you look good. You look like you might be spamming, and your posts will get flagged in the spam filter. Hang back, comment on some other posts a little, and *then* submit links.


**Weekly Threads**

We have some weekly threads to round up some of the common things that people post here. The schedule is as follows (and links can be found in the sidebar)

**Sunday**: Show us your pictures thread  
**Monday**: App Appreciation Thread  
**Tuesday**: Show us your home screen thread  
**Wednesday**: Beginners' question thread  

**More**

The phone is sleek comfortable and cool looking. I get compliments on it all the time also because nobody really has it.

 I generally get through a fairly heavy use business day on one charge. Metrotube is better than the YouTube app. Metroradio is better than Pandora. Spotify integrates incredibly well. The Facebook app sucks but go ask r/android or r/ios how there Facebook app is. At least with windows phone I can get basic Facebook tasks integrated into the platform. That covers 90% of my facebook use anyways. SkyDrive is better than google drive imo. And I use the office apps all the time at work.

Gaming? It lacks right now. But I think it has more gaming potential than any other platform. If you are a heavy gamer on your phone. Maybe this isn't the platform for you.

are there design elements I wish were a bit different or UI elements that I wish were a bit different? Sure.. But I had issues with android too. And I hate IOS. The point is that there are flaws with the UI of every platform. Must we spend all of our time and energy finding ways WP8 is inferior? Why did you all choose this platform anyways?

One of the tech assistants came over to me and asked if I had any questions.

""Let me tell you a story.""

I had gotten my Lumia 920 in November, and 3 weeks later [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1483lb/dropped_my_lumia_920_on_tile_yesterday_ive_had_it/) happened (dropped it on tile and screen shattered). I replaced the screen myself, and American Express refunded the price of the phone ($100).

Fast forward to May, when the Volume Up, Power, and Camera buttons stop working. I follow some troubleshooting steps on AT&amp;T's site, they say factory reset. I do so. The phone wouldn't finish resetting, just the gears spinning on the screen. And it stayed this way until the battery ran down. I charged it, and got nothing but spinning gears.

So I call up AT&amp;T, get a replacement shipped to me, swap the phone, send the problem child back, done.

Or so I thought.

Now the replacement phone would ""charge"" but WP8 wouldn't tell me it retained or gained any new charge %. I reset the phone (Hello, IT, have you tried turning it off and on again?). Nada. I soft reset the phone (volume down + power), and voila, the battery is magically charged to 100%.

So now she's like ""okay well are there any other problems with the phone? Do you enjoy using it?"" Etc. My only complaint has been the mail app (I use gmail and it just doesn't stack up to the android gmail app :/).

She then tells me ""You know what, I'm gonna swap the phone out for ya.""

What.

She brought out a brand new replacement, swapped the sim card in, and I'm off with a new phone and no money out of pocket.

**TL:DR-** *Lemon replacement from AT&amp;T, go to MS store, they swap phone for free instead of me having to drive an hour north to AT&amp;T Service Center. Awwyiss.*",,False,self,t5_2r71o,False,,phone,True,t3_1go89o,http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/1go89o/let_me_tell_you_a_story/,

This has come up a few times in the past, and I want to address it. Currently, swaps and sales are heavily discouraged and usually removed in this subreddit. However, I also know from experience (and I also live in Silicon Valley) that selling and or trading Windows Phones is immensely difficult. I've seen ads on Craigslist go for weeks without a potential buyer because it seems like no one wants to buy them.

Hence, another subreddit for swaps and sales. Put your device up for sale where like-minded people would want to buy it or trade it for something else.

It would not matter what you are trading or selling for what as long as a Windows Phone is somewhere in the equation. Do you want to trade your 920 for a Galaxy S3 or vice versa? No problem, just so long as one party is trading a Windows Phone. 

Would anyone be interested in such a thing? Please let me know in the comments!
