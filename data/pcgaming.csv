**Some perspective on making this worth it for Ubisoft**  
I just looked up and found that Halo3: ODST sole over 2.5 million copies in the first week. I just want to use that as some kind of standard for a goal of game sales. And This isn't accurate at all but there is a general rule the FCC follows (as well as many other places) that when one person complains about something, that in effect 1k people feel the same (thinking that only 1 person voiced something about it. Because we are dealing with money and not just an opinion.. for guessing purposes ill use 1:100 instead of 1:1k
So.. if we had 25 thousand signatures I would guess this game would do as well as or better than Halo 3: ODST on JUST PC.
  
If we could do 5k more signatures.. That would be truly amazing
**10,000 signatures could in a sense be equated to a possibility of 1m PC copies sold** on top of w/e console sales they do.
  
Currently: 3k signatures. Is it possible to make it to 5? or 10?  
  
**If HALF of this subreddit clicked sign, this game would show to do amazing in sales.**",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,1371073260.0,,,True,t3_1g4hqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1g4hqe/ask_ubisoft_to_bring_the_division_to_pc/,

I consider myself a perfectionist when it comes to gaming on my PC. If it doesn't run well, I keep looking for solutions. With emulation this can be quite a chore. I hope to save you all some of that work and trouble by writing this guide. 
Here goes! 

I will only list emulators that I have used and/or ones that I have tried. I will also only list the absolute best emulators out there. 

This is my rig (for reference sake only): 64bit Windows 7 // i7@3.7ghz // nvidia GTX670 // 8gb ram // Logitech Dual Action (best for emulation IMO) 

= Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) =

- Emulator name: Jnes
- Download link: http://www.jabosoft.com/categories/3
- Opinion: Perfect emulation. Including the oldschool flickering sprite glitches and slowdown. It'll feel just like playing on a real NES. 
- Extra info: Upon loading go to Options&gt;Video. Under drawing method select (s-video) for realistic display. 

= Super Nintendo =

- Emulator name: Snes9x
- Download link: http://www.snes9x.com/downloads.php
- Opinion: Another solid and highly accurate emulator. Easy to setup and use. Includes Netplay if you want to play with your old gaming buddies. 
- Extra info: If you experience slowdown. Hit ALT+F5 and change around some of the display settings. This will resolve any problems you may experience. 

= Nintendo 64 =

- Emulator name: Project64
- Download link: http://www.pj64-emu.com/downloads/ 
- Opinion: Not bad. Most popular games work flawlessly. Extremely infrequent crashes, but they can happen.. So remember to save often. 
- Extra info: Unless you're somehow using an original N64 controller with converter... You probably need to create 2 controller profiles. One for most games. The second for FPS games like Goldeneye, Turok and Perfect Dark. For normal games I map the C buttons to my right analog stick. For FPS games I map the C buttons to my 4 face buttons which works well. 

= Gameboy and Gameboy Advance =

- Emulator name: Visual Boy Advance
- Download link: http://vba.ngemu.com/downloads.shtml
- Opinion: An old but amazing emulator. Still the best GBA one out there. No complaints. Also supports every Gameboy game. 

= Gamecube and Wii =

- Emulator name: Dolphin
- Download link: http://dolphin-emulator.com/download.html
- Opinion: Absolutely amazing emulator. One of my favourites. This will make your Wii and Gamecube games look even better since you can display them in true 1080p with high AA. 
- Extra info: !!!WARNING!!! this emulator has very high system requirements. Every game (that is 100% compatible) runs perfectly on my rig so please see my specs at the top to see if yours can run this beast of an emulator. Compatibility list is here: Wii: http://wiki.dolphin-emulator.com/index.php?title=Wii /// Gamecube: http://wiki.dolphin-emulator.com/index.php?title=Nintendo_GameCube /// Some games with a 4 star compatibility rating still work quite well. So read the errors carefully before dismissing them. This emulator will require some effort in terms of setting up. You will need to create several different controller profiles to suit each Wii game. With my controller I have no issues controlling most. Head to their forums for more in depth help as you'll no doubt fall in love with this emulator. 

= Sega Master System / Gamegear / Genesis / MegaCD / 32X =

- Emulator name: Fusion
- Download link: http://www.eidolons-inn.net/tiki-index.php?page=Kega
- Opinion: Insane emulator. Perfect support for all the consoles listed above. Filled to the brim with features and general good stuff. No problems. 
- Extra info: Make sure you dump your games in separate folders and use the hotkeys to load your desired console roms. This avoids confusion and keeps things nice and neat. 

= Sega Dreamcast =

- Emulator name: NullDC
- Download link: http://code.google.com/p/nulldc/downloads/list (bottom link) 
- Opinion: Not bad. I would prefer something a little better since the Dreamcast is one of my favourite consoles of all time. Most of my favourite games work quite well though with a few minor hickups. 
- Extra info: This emulator only supports .CDI files. So make sure you dump your games correctly. 

= Sony Playstation =

- Emulator name: ePSXe
- Download link: http://www.epsxe.com/download.php
- Opinion: Good! It's pretty bare bones but it does the job. Sadly games will not play some music (PS1 games often had music as CD tracks, not compressed files like today). That would be my main and only complaint. 
- Extra info: Compatibility list: http://www.epforums.org/showthread.php?73805-New-ePSXe-v-1-7-0-compatibility-list-thread

= Sony Playstation 2 =

- Emulator name: pcsx2
- Download link: http://pcsx2.net/download.html
- Opinion: Love this emulator. While it isn't perfect, it's amazing what they've achieved already. I'm playing lots of my old favourites in 1080p without any glitches or problems. Some games require specific settings (ones you change in the graphics plugins or general options) but for the most part this isn't required. 
- Extra info: !!!WARNING!!! Also has very high system requirements. If your game looks glitchy or just plain wrong, hit F9! This switches off any GPU enhancements and runs the game in its native resolution. This tends to fix most if not all graphical glitches. And here is your compatibility list: http://wiki.pcsx2.net/index.php?title=Category:Playable_games&amp;pageuntil=Monochrome#mw-pages

= Arcade =

- Emulator name: MameUIFX32
- Download link: http://mame32fx.altervista.org/download.htm
- Opinion: Another one of my absolute favourite emulators out there. The Mame crew have been developing this beast for years and years. Slowly unlocking more and more arcade boards. (My brother works on this emulator!!). 
- Extra info: Hardcore emulator lovers will scold me for listing the Frontend version of Mame, but it's simply easier to use with the same results. This emulator will play games from as early as 1971 to 2008. It'll play all your old favourite SNK, Sega, Capcom, Namco and Konami games. A must have for anyone who loves video games. This emulator has high customizability.. so tinker away. This is one of the more complicated emulators out there, but thankfully there are plenty of guides and help if one gets stuck. 

= MY FAVOURITE CONSOLE WAS NOT LISTED !? =

- Tell me what you're after and I should be able to help you. I only listed my personal favourites and ones I would consider sought after. 



I hope this guide is what people were after!!

It's symptoms are tingling, numbness or loss of sensation in your hands. 

**Carpal Tunnel damage can become permanent, stealing away your ability to remain being a gamer**

I know a lot of gamers completely ignore Carpal Tunnel. You see them all the time shaking their hands. What they are doing is temporarily alleviating the pressure on the affected nerve by jiggling their hands.This is a good sign you need to get help, as carpal tunnel doesn't just go away. You have to make lifelong changes to how you play.

After 25 years of gaming, I had to give up competitive play. I now use special mice and need surgery. I can't even get through a single online round as my hand goes numb. Professional gaming as an industry has just started taking off, and some high level players have started to suffer from Carpal Tunnel. (MC, starcraft player). This post will hopefully let you know what to do to avoid carpal tunnel's permanent damage.

**You can reduce chances you will encounter Carpal Tunnel by taking precautions. However, some people are susceptible no matter the precautions**

* Let's examine the natural resting position of the wrist and hand.
http://i.imgur.com/IJMEmCh.jpg
Think of a handshake posture.
* Now let's see how a mouse twists the arm.
http://i.imgur.com/YbVQR0C.jpg
A standard mouse twists the entire arm and causes strain. It's probably one of the least ergonomic designs we use daily.
* Let's see how a controller twists the arms.
http://i.imgur.com/bBQWba5.jpg
Much less stress, but it still puts strain on the wrist, especially the thumb. It is far better than the mouse.

**Carpal tunnel prevention basics**

* Don't ignore pain, especially numbness or tingling. It can become permanent. You won't be able to feel what you are holding once the damage is permanent.
* Be sure to have good wrist posture and good peripherals. When not gaming you can use a less responsive but more ergonomic RSI mouse. ( A sideways mouse that reduces wrist stress)
* If you use a controller, pad out and tweak your controller so it fits well. You should not have cramping or joint pain. If you are going to be a lifelong gamer, adjust your setup so your hands don't get injured. 
* Ice your wrists and hands. Get a colpac made for wrists, 3""x11"". Get a Nylatex wrap for it. If you play hard, or are trying to play like a pro, treat your hands like an athlete treats his body. Prevent damage to your hands. Doctor's recommend icing for 15 minutes every 2 hours. This might not be possible or practical, but icing is great for your hands and wrists.
* Take breaks so you don't overstress your hands.

**What to do if you have Carpal Tunnel already**

* Resting / Not playing for a time. Some people can get away with resting the hand and letting the swelling go down. This however can take weeks to months. 
* Reduce use and switch to RSI (Repetitive stress disorder) peripherals. They can be expensive and are not good gaming devices. Sadly no company has made a true ergonomic mouse that is for gaming.
* Get surgery

**Holy hell did you say surgery?**

There is a procedure for carpal tunnel that is fast and works almost
immediately. It's call Carpal Release surgery.

* Same day surgery
* Cuts a tendon over the nerve and releases all stress on it
* Minor grip strength loss as a result
* Permanent cure to carpal tunnel as long as you don't have nerve damage.
* Costs appx $2000
* 30 days heal time (no gaming)

Let's look at a picture of the surgery:

and a video (not for the squeamish)
http://youtu.be/YVPe5WTl5yg

Carpal tunnel is something that will become a generation specific / niche occupational issue. As people change to tablets and other new types of hardware, the hand has a more natural posture. But for those who are at risk, it's serious enough that you should be aware and prevent this from stealing gaming from you like it did for me.

If you suffer from carpal tunnel, post your stories about how you dealt with it as a gamer.

Please note I make no money off the links, and they are by cheapest place to buy.
Sometimes amazon, sometimes ebay.

It's simple thermodynamics that small pack vs hot body warms fast. This pack stays coldest longest in light of that fact. Get 2x per wrist so you can swap. Nearly indestructible.

I wish I could get everyone the games they wanted, but I've run out of money in my Steam give away fund.  I plan to do this again next year, as I really enjoyed giving out games for my fellow gamers, so be on the look out for another drunk Christmas eve post next year!  Merry Christmas everyone and have a great year gaming!

SPECIAL CHRISTMAS DAY EDIT: Hey everyone, I'm back up from having slept off the Christmas eve drinking and am back to finishing up getting you guys the games you wanted.  If I've added you as a friend on Steam (or sent a request) and you haven't gotten any games from me, please message me through Steam reminding me what game you wanted and I'll do my best to get it to you!

ANOTHER DAMN EDIT!: I've given away a bunch of games, but I gotta hit the sack!  Anyone who missed out can try to message me, but I guarantee nothing!  I hope everyone has a great Christmas!

NOTICE: PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR STEAM ID WITH YOUR REQUEST.  I WANNA GIVE YOU SOME GAMES, BUT I NEEDS TO KNOW WHO YOU IS!!!!  ALSO, BE ONLINE TO ACCEPT MY STEAM FRIEND REQUEST PLEASE!

I've got some extra cash burning a hole in my pocket after not having to buy presents for anyone this year, so if there's a game you want from Steam just let me know and I'll get it for you.

Only the first few PM's with their steam info can get anything, since I obviously can't do this forever.  

I'm happy and drunk and will be waiting for responses until about 9 pm EST (Dec 24th), so let me know what game you want before that.

EDIT: Okay, everyone who has replied or PM'ed me will get what they asked for, but I can't do any more!  Sorry if it takes a bit to get back to you all, but I will get to everyone who replied.

EDIT 2: If I haven't gotten back to you, it's because I didn't see your PM yet or I somehow lost your info.  I've sent several friend requests with no reply to a few people, so check your steam accounts people!

EDIT 3: I got a bit distracted with friends coming by, but I want to honour my prior commitments, so anyone who I've added as a friend on Steam who I haven't sent their game can send me a message through steam and I will send you your game.  Sorry for the delay.

To counter this, we (I and DOSBrony) have made a separate subreddit - a subreddit for all of the questions that PC users may have, and we named it /r/pcgamingtechsupport/

Simply put, it does what it says on the tin, it's meant to be a haven for technical support. This includes but is not limited to:

* People wondering whether or not games will run on their computer
* People seeking fixes to performance issues
* People attempting to fix crashes

And, to a degree

* People who need their hardware judged, whether they are buying or are trying to get an opinion as to how well their games will run.

This is a subreddit where you won't be judged based on specifications and you will be given factual and helpful advice as quickly as possible, instead of clogging up other, only slightly related subreddits like /r/pcgaming and /r/buildapc.

Hopefully this will help clear up the Subreddit that is /r/pcgaming

Picked up Far Cry 3 today and it's awesome, really. Already sunk four hours into it; but I've spent a good chunk of that working out how to get it running at a steady frame rate. My rig is fairly average: i5 3570k 3.4GhZ, Nvidia GTX660 2GB, 8GB RAM, Windows 7 64-bit. Resolution is 1920 x 1080.

It's not an understatement to say that this game is a real hog. That said, here are my tips for maxing your performance:

* The number one way to get high FPS is to switch to Direct X 9 mode. It won't be as pretty, but it'll work.

The following apply to DX11 mode:

* A big performance hit: Post FX. Set it to Medium and you'll see **big** gains and only lose a bit of lens flare.
* Shadows have a huge effect on performance. I've now got mine on Medium and everything else on Very High, and am getting a steady 60fps.
* Switch to SSAO from HBAO. You can't really see the difference and performance is much improved.
* Set GPU Max Buffered Frames to 5.
* Set v-sync off (limit frame rate to 58fps on a 60hz monitor to avoid tearing).
* If you're on Nvidia, install these drivers: [http://www.nvidia.com/object/win8-win7-winvista-64bit-310.64-beta-driver.html](http://www.nvidia.com/object/win8-win7-winvista-64bit-310.64-beta-driver.html)
* Set Alpha to Coverage to Standard or Off - I don't notice much difference.
* Switch MSAA off and force FXAA in the control panel - looks as good as 2x without the performance hit.

FINALLY: no matter how you set things up, on an average gaming rig, you WILL see fps drops. They're unavoidable. Maybe once the game's been patched a few times things will improve, but for now it seems there are some optimisation issues - likely driven by console-itis.

Hope this helps someone, and hope everyone enjoys the game as much as I am.

1297262074.0,113,self.pcgaming,fi0xg,"Star Ruler: An independent, 4X, RTS game I've fallen in love with.",130,17,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/fi0xg/star_ruler_an_independent_4x_rts_game_ive_fallen/,"[Blind Mind Studios](http://starruler.blind-mind.com/) ran out of money part way through making their game, so they got it to a playable state, opened up almost all their code, and started selling it with promises of huge future updates. So far they've definitely followed through. It's along the same lines as Sins of a Solar Empire, but it's more 4X and less RTS than that game.

Things I love:

* No tech limit. I always thought it was stupid that in most 4X games you could reach the top of your technology tree. In Star Ruler, research costs double each level, but you'll never reach the limit. Each level damage, HP, production, and all those good stats increase. 
* Open code (not open source, just readable and editable in notepad), very mod-able, and good ideas and fixes get incorporated into the game. I've had two of my smaller mods made permanent by the developers. There are also some great mods out there already, adding everything from extreme galaxy customization options to requiring food for ship crews. Also, no Diablo II mysteries about the game math and mechanics: it's all readable. 
* Real freedom for ship customization. It's not Space Empires, but it's damn close. Carriers work - they really work - like they're supposed to. You can put whatever parts you want on each ship or station. Size is a completely variable number, with the only restriction being the resources it takes to build. In the endgame, it's normal to have ships bigger than suns.
* The only limit for ships, planets, and number of opponents is your PC. If you like fleets of thousands of ships, this can definitely scratch your itch. I usually find myself with a few large ships, but beyond the resources to build there aren't any artificial ""logistics"" limits.
* It's on Steam.

Bad things:

* It's still a little buggy. The recent versions don't crash nearly as much, but YMMV. Luckily, you can send your crash files to the developers and they're good about fixing your problems in the next release. The demo is (or was, last I checked) a few versions behind the actual game, so keep that in mind if you're trying it before you buy.
* It's not finished. Diplomacy, intel, and victory options are very light. As of now, there's only one set of ship models (though you can add more if you want). The tutorial is a little weak, too.
* For an unfinished indie game, you may think the price is a little steep. Personally, I think it's worth it because the game is great and they're not even close to being done.
* Dumb name.",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,True,,,True,t3_fi0xg,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/fi0xg/star_ruler_an_independent_4x_rts_game_ive_fallen/,

Actually it’s still quite cumbersome once you discover the quicker, secret way of travelling, which is to throw yourself into the nearest pit and die. Viola! Back to the first Leystone!

Take [this screenie](http://i.imgur.com/8iGC92S.jpg), for instance (a scene from the end of the game, so don't look if you're sensitive to spoilers). Two HD 7950s in Crossfire mode (Catalyst 13.3 beta 3 drivers) handle everything this game can throw at them, at 60 fps almost everywhere. But not even RadeonPro and the SweetFX shader suite can mask the fact that many of the textures are low res and horribly compressed. Look at the ground in this screenshot -- it's a muddy mess. I also notice that objects like doors and crate labels look badly scaled and riddled with compression artifacts when you get right up next to them. 

Is it supposed to be this way? Coming off 500+ hours of *Skyrim* with a buttload of HD texture mods and ENB postprocessors, am I just spoiled?

Here are a few reasons why this is wonderful news for us:

 

** PC gamers will be able to use our powerhouse systems for more than high-res textures and tessellation.**

* While these features certainly contribute to a greater sense of immersion and they are impressive in their own right, there is a limit. 

Cross-platform developers always start with the lowest powered console as the limiting factor for game design. If a game can't be ported to xbox, they are not going to do it. So no matter what is possible with the current tech, if it can't be used on 8 year old hardware, it isn't going into our games. The next gen of consoles will change this.

* For example, Metro: Last Light's ""Optimal"" specs list a ****ing GTX 690 or Titan as the GPU necessary to max out all settings. This is ridiculous because the same game is playable on hardware that is orders of magnitude less powerful than those $1000 GPUs. All the game design.. the plot, the dialogue, the ""world,"" all runs on the super low powered xbox. The PC version offers enhanced DX11 graphics effects.

* Developers of cross platform games are basically throwing in DX11 effects as afterthoughts once their core product is complete. With the next gen consoles, the lowest common denominator will be much larger. The size of worlds and possibilities for AI will be greatly enhanced.

* Basially, these new consoles will allow developers to utilize our powerhouses for something more than polishing the xbox 360's turds. ",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,False,,IntelRadeon,True,t3_1enyj4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1enyj4/reasons_to_be_excited_about_the_next_gen_consoles/,

Regarding PC ports of Kingdom Hearts III and Final Fantasy XV.",96,22,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1gt17o/i_wrote_this_for_square_enix_but_i_have_no_idea/,"Dear Square Enix, the total of AAA Action-JRPGs on Steam is currently zero. If you release Kingdom Hearts III or Final Fantasy XV onto Steam, they will have zero competition in a market currently starved for JRPGs. I have never wanted a game as badly as I do these two, and would pay any price for them, and I’m sure many feel exactly the same. Chances are, if someone asks what JRPGs should be played from Steam, these two will always top the list for years to come. 

The architecture used in consoles has never been more like a PC before, and the games even use DirectX 11. Action games may not have done well on PC in the past, but Skyrim is one of the best selling, if not the best selling game currently on Steam; still in the top 100, years after its initial release and proving most people either own a gamepad, or are willing to play these types of games with a keyboard. 

If these games are half as good as they look, (and they look to be two of the best games I've ever seen) I see the worst case being a break even on the cost of porting, and at best, being among the top selling games to ever grace the platform. I don’t know the exact nature of licensing with Disney, I can only imagine Kingdom Hearts III becoming only more and more difficult to port as time goes on, so please consider this while it's still a possibility.

If nothing else, I would like to see an official poll hosted on the Square Enix website, with a goal of 100,000, or alternatively, around 3 times the amount of full price purchases needed to recoup porting costs. There already many petitions popping up, but they go unnoticed because people don't expect them to make a difference.

I would not blame you for not taking this risk, but I would be grateful beyond words if you did. Thanks Square-Enix, for being one of the best game companies.





Here are some of the petitions for anyone interested.

It is packing a mighty 3.3 Ghz dual core and a Radeon HD 7770 plus a 8 whole gigs of RAM. It's certainly not a powerhouse but hopefully should get me back into PC gaming and I plan to show it some love over the next few months and start upgrading stuff. 

To give you a bit of perspective as to how long I've been away, my last PC was a 486, with a lock on the front, two floppy disk drives and a button marked 'turbo' which actually slowed it down incase your games were running too fast on the mighty processor. I spent a lot of time making boot disks to try and get enough base memory free to run any of the games that I had bought.

Since then I've been in the world of Macs and the occasional bit of Playstation gaming. I use Macs because of my work and quite liked the fact that there weren't any games to distract me from actually getting a job out of the door. I think I was also kidding myself that I was somehow more mature. But now I'm 30, like a wife letting themselves go after their wedding, I can return to the comforting bosom of the Windows desktop and the time sponge that is PC gaming

Anyway, it's done, and I'm ready to return. I bought the PC primarily because I do a lot of iRacing on my iMac (iRacing is a thing - a motorsport simulator - not a bad Apple joke) and I can only run at the bare minimum. But now my machine is coming I'm quite excited about Steam and everything going on there as well.

So I ask you PC Gaming; what do I need to know? What amazing games have passed me by? What is the best my PC can offer me? Has anything changed in the last 15 years?

1333479366.0,67,self.pcgaming,rrkex,"[Win7/Vista] How to use Dropbox to synchronize save games/Characters across PCs.  Works with Steam/Origin, too.",75,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/rrkex/win7vista_how_to_use_dropbox_to_synchronize_save/,"First, make sure you have a free [Dropbox](http://db.tt/msceZEzQ) account.

Second, on your *master* PC, locate the folder (Let's call it *C:\Game\Save*) in which save games are stored.  **Move** the entire saved-game folder (Save) to Dropbox.  These are the save-games you'll be keeping.

Open command prompt, (or run CMD.exe) and use CD to navigate to the folder that used to contain the saved game folder (i.e. C:\Game)

now type this command
 
    MKLINK.exe /J [exact Name of folder] [Location of the moved folder] 

For me, with a default Dropbox install, I would type:

    MKLINK /J Save %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\Save 
Which Windows will translate to:

    MKLINK /J Save C:\Users\Acepincter\Dropbox\Save 

If the folder name was actually ""Data"", I would use:

    MKLINK /J Data C:\Users\Acepincter\Dropbox\Data

The MKLINK command will create a unix-style soft link that looks and feels just like the folder is where the game expects it to be, but the game will be reading from and saving to Dropbox.  When the command is complete, a folder will be created with the name you chose in the 2nd option.  It will open to the location specified in the first option.  Note that this command *creates* the link - the folder must not exist in the desired location when the command executes.  This is why we *move* the folder.

To complete the process, on any other PCs you wish to sync, simply delete the saved-games folder (or combine with the Dropbox save-games folder), and run the same MKLINK command as you did on the master PC.

This is terrific for syncing large-scale sandbox games that you invest huge time in, for example SimCity-type games or large-scale RTS like Total War.  It's also great for Steam/Origin Games, which don't let you choose the save-file location.

My personal opinion is this. I think although its wrong, if you do it in moderation then whatever. I choose not to pirate though because owning it and spending my hard earned money on a game makes me want to play it and get my maximum enjoyment out of it. I have **never** beaten a game I didn't have to pay any money for. I never have. And even though I really want to play a game, I know that if I pirate it, then I won't be inclined to play it a lot and beat it. 

And sure I could buy it once it goes on sale after pirating it, but then I have already enjoyed a good amount of it and I know I won't play it.

So thats my reasoning behind it. ",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,False,,,True,t3_15amat,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/15amat/what_are_your_reasons_as_to_why_you_do_or_do_not/,
1351468508.0,63,self.pcgaming,128uff,My experience with Windows 8 - Gaming and Not,104,41,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/128uff/my_experience_with_windows_8_gaming_and_not/,"So I was able to get an upgrade for Windows 8 Pro. Almost EVERYTHING that I heard previously that was negative about it turned out to be false rumors.

Let's start with the removal of the start button. Yes, it's different. Yes, there is a program to bring the start button back. At first, I didn't like the new Metro UI start interface. But after about an hour, I couldn't imagine going back to the Start Button. It just seems so primitive once you get use to the Metro, and trust me, you will. 

The UI is much more smooth than Windows 7, as well. I loved everything about 7, but I love 8 a little more. In Windows 8, after getting the hang of things, it's much more smooth than 7. It took me around an hour, hour and a half to learn all of the shortcuts and what-not.

The whole Windows 8 apps thing, along side the normal Desktop PC, is actually really cool.

The one gripe I had about Windows 8 was it took me longer than necessary to figure out how to add a tile to the start interface. And just incase you were told lies, like I was, you can add ANYTHING (note, folder, program, etc.) to the start interface as a tile.

As far as games go, Windows 8 surpasses 7, IMHO. Compatibility has been fantastic. For example, on this laptop on 7, Fallout 3 would crash every 10-15 minutes on a bad day, rendering the game unplayable. On a good day I could go a an hour and a half or so. On 8, however, I've played for hours at a time without a crash. Makes me a happy camper. Haven't had a bit of trouble at all with ANYTHING I had on Windows 7. No incompatibilities, haven't had a SINGLE program/game crash on me, or anything.

The reason I'm making this post is because of all of the rumors going around about how terrible windows 8 is, %80 of which were not true. So if you're on the fence about upgrading, I say go for it.

Edit: when I say problems with anything I had on 7, I meant that the programs I used on 7 are still totally stable and compatible after upgrading to 8.",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,1351476127.0,,IntelNvidia,True,t3_128uff,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/128uff/my_experience_with_windows_8_gaming_and_not/,

Yet for some reason I've failed to make three of my strategy loving friends budge.  I don't know if it's the generic name, the perception that it's a cheap budget game (which it totally isn't) or what, but my inability to get people to buy this is astonishing, because usually I'm great at getting my friends to waste money.

I went back and forth, and Full RGB has much more vibrant and realistic colors compared to the default Ycbcr. Compared to Full RGB, Ycbcr color looks washed out and hazy, at least on my monitor.  

You can find the setting under ""Pixel Format"" -- This is only relevant if you are using HDMI since DVI only supports Full RGB. I read that Ycbcr is good for Bluray movies, but clearly sucks for gaming. Your mileage may vary since your monitor might handle the colors differently, but give it a try.

It currently needs about 740,000 in the next 11 days to fund.

**Some quick facts about the game:**

* Largely PvP driven (3 realms 1v1v1.)
* Housing from Launch that you can build almost anywhere in the world. And very Minecraft like building.
* Different style of PvE (No Raiding, still have roaming NPCs for tradeskills, and things like trainers, merchants, guards etc but this game is not PvE focused.)
* Very Crafter driven, Mining is a huge deal, controlling those mines is huge. Everything is crafted.
* Mark Jacobs, A Designer who knows his stuff. He helped Design Dark age of Camelot and Warhammer Online. He wants to design a game without the constant scrutiny of a publisher, This is Niche game obviously and he wants to keep it that way.
* Andrew Meggs, whom recently worked on Skyrim.  He is devloping a custom InHouse engine to run Camelot Unchained, which is insane. http://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=plcp&amp;v=bHiJSP6GuZ0

The idea might seem a little far-fetched at first glance but these kind of developers deserve recognition for their creativity at the very least. There are a ton more features to sift through but go check it out and see for yourself. The guys developing it are very active in the update section.

He just launched a Kickstarter for it today, so I am trying to get the word out to anyone who thinks it would be fun. He has made a couple XBLA Indie games, but the console limitations were preventing him from making the game he really wanted to make, so I told him about Steam Greenlight, once the game is near completion he is going to put it on Greenlight and hopefully get it published through Steam. 
Here is the website for his game: http://survivalgames.gazidogaming.com/about/

I would appreciate it if you guys would check it out, and possibly leave some feedback in the forums for him, as the best way for him to create a better game is with feedback from potential customers.

I haven't played a whole lot of games (just started playing again after a looong time), but I think the ones with good AI were the following: Bioshock 2, Far Cry 3, Crysis, TC Splintercell Chaos Theory, and Mark of the Ninja. 

I haven't played any of the Thief games yet, but I've heard good reviews of this game's AI.

So I have two questions:

-what factors (technological, creative etc.) hold back AI in games?

-what are some games with seriously smart and tough to beat AI opponents :)

(don't feel you have to answer both questions).

Here's my definition of ideal AI: this type of AI 

-remains unpredictable throughout the game, 

-uses group tactics to hunt the player (if applicable), and 

-learns from player behavior in the present stage or level. 

And yes, in this instance I am referring to AI as an opponent, and not an ally.

So after much trouble I finally decided to build my own PC and start saving money. They look really cool and the benefits are simply amazing, like F2P games, no fee for online play, mods... but there is something that scares me and makes me want to give up on the idea. 

The Lifespan. I would not like to spend +1000 and then it being outdated in a year or two.

I'm asking this because the consoles are changing their specs, new products (Motherboards, GPU's) are coming out. For example: Crysis 3 looks like its going to be really demanding and it will need a really good GPU. My friends have told me that it's okay, all you have to do to upgrade is change your GPU (sometimes the motherboard as well). Is this true? 
Keep in mind I'm just a noob in all this.
Thanks :D

EDIT: Pheew... Thanks everyone, this really took a huge weight off my shoulders. Apparently, my dad was right, hehe... :P
4-6 years sounds good. 

Anyway, here are my specs:
http://pcpartpicker.com/p/wtuj
How would this hold up? Is it good? It may sound like I just put this together right now, but I didn't, haha. Just to get that out of the way. When I said I was a ""noob"" I meant lifespans, upgrading and whatnot. I do know what each part does and blah blah haha.

Please do keep in my mind my rig is planned for May/June so this build might change.

I've owned a Razer Naga and a Blackwidow keyboard for about 2 years now, and I've had **absolutely no trouble.**

I find the software that comes with both to be generally convenient (despite a few crashes) and the products are still going strong. The physical devices are in the exact same condition as when I bought them. On top of that, my desktop and I do a ton of travelling and I throw my peripherals around quite a bit; the keyboard and mouse are untouched and unscuffed.

So is there really just a massive quality difference between Razer's products? I feel as if I got my money's worth from both of my tools.

Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, FarCry 3: Blood Dragon, and Tomb Raider!!!

Instead of just deleting the email and letting them go to waste, I decided to give it away to one of you guys. In order to get the codes, you have to guess a random number between -1,000 and 1000. I have the number written on a post-it note on my monitor and time-stamped using google. Sorry I stole this idea from you LoCoNights, I'm not original at all.

You guys have until ~~9:02 PM MDT~~ Tomorrow, Friday 9 August to guess!!!
I will post whoever was closest at 9:02 PM tomorrow and send him/her the codes through private message

Good luck!

UPDATE: Since I have prior engagements tonight that slipped my mind, I will now announce the winner at **4:00 PM MDT today**. That is in about an hour. Again, good luck and to whoever wins, enjoy!!! :)

Is it more cost effective to buy off the shelf or build?

1368748639.0,37,self.pcgaming,1ehhcr,Really disappointed with Valve (re: Steam Trading Cards),69,32,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1ehhcr/really_disappointed_with_valve_re_steam_trading/,"If you didn't know, Steam recently implemented a system where you can obtain trading cards (random drops), which in turn raise your Steam Level (think PS3 trophies) when a certain amount are collected and crafted. These levels not only serve as ""bragging rights"" like trophies/achievements, but also let you customize your profile, increase your friends list, and even unlock emoticons for chat. They labeled this system as a way of showing ""who plays the most"". Well, an achievement like system is long overdue, so I was pretty excited once I saw the details yesterday (hell, my GS on my 360 is over 50k #swag). 

I then saw this:



[http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq](http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq)



*Is there a limit to how many trading cards can drop?
Most games will drop a number of cards equal to about half of the number of cards in that game's set of cards. For example, Half-Life 2 has 8 cards in its set, you can receive 4 card drops by playing it. You'll need to collect the other half of the set from other community members. Try the beta group discussions, community market, barter with friends, and trade discussions. You can check how many drops you have remaining on your badges page.*



For instance, it says I have ""2 drops remaining"" in CS:GO which, from all indications, doesn't reset. The problem is that it takes 5 cards to craft a badge (which gains you a Steam Level) of any given game. It gets worse:



*What about free to play games like Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2?
Free to play games drop game cards based on your in-game purchasing history. If you've made purchases in-game prior to the Steam Trading Card Beta, or if you purchased TF2 prior to the Free to Play Update, you'll have 4 or 5 drops available for these games. You'll receive more card drops when you buy items in game, approximately one card drop for every $9 USD spent.*

wat.jpeg

What this essentially means is that the only way to increase your Steam Level (the whole point of this update) is to either trade games (which cost money) or coupons (lol) with others (who will cling on to their cards as well as you only get a a few drops), or spend $9 fucking dollars in DOTA/TF2. This isn't a long overdue achievement/trophy system at all, it's a freaking cash grab.

A while ago I posted a thread here about the crap that I have to deal with in order to get Razer to fix my keyboard (Deathstalker light switch).  

I actually got it resolved (miracle)!  A week later there was an Synapse update and it did solve the light switch problem, which was really surprising to me (Since another redditor here told me he had similar software problems and he was just left with no answer/patch).

I decided to make a thread about it to do Razer some justice, I guess.  I was talking shit about Razer to infinity because I felt really ripped off.  Through perseverance, I was able to get in touch with the ""tier 2 tech support team"", and though they are WAY less friendly, they are able to fix the problem.

So I guess the summary is... Razer product aren't that bad.  If you do end up having a problem, you definitely need to CALL them, and not email them.  Make sure you call them daily regarding your issue, and make some sort of demand to talk to the supervisor/tier 2 tech team.  After several phone calls, you will be placed on the ""priority list"", then the problem should be resolved.  If you just call them once and expect them to do something about it, I guarantee that almost nothing will happen.

Please read this tutorial I wrote on how to figure out crashing/freezing issues! ",49,8,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1aeqoh/if_you_are_having_a_hardware_issue_or_getting/,"I see a lot of people posting here about computer problems and most of them aren't aware how easy it is to specifically check all your hardware to find the fault once you are told how. 

First and foremost, if your computer won't boot up and you are getting weird beeps when you start it, check out [this](http://www.pchell.com/hardware/beepcodes.shtml) page and look at what the problem is here. BIOS verifies your hardware when you start your PC, but it doesn't test it.

Now if you can get into Windows the first thing you need to do is download [WinDbg](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279) (make sure to select to install WinDbg in the install of the service pack, it's not automatically selected) so you can open your .dmp files windows saves when you have a crash. 

These files are automatically saved to your C:/Windows/Minidump folder when you restart windows after your crash. 

Now, your system needs to know how to decode these files with WinDbg which takes ""symbols"". In order to do this, run WinDbg after downloading and go to File-&gt;Symbol File Path and copy [this](http://imgur.com/JttP3r7) into the box and hit OK. What this does is allow WinDbg connect to a windows server to download the specific ""symbols"" needed for every .dmp file read.

Now we are ready to open your .dmp file and figure out what the problem is (or get a general idea). In WinDbg, go to file, open crash dump, and you should be able to find your .dmp files in the C:/Windows/Minidump folder. If your .dmp files aren't there search Google for your specific version of windows to find out where they are at. When you open your minidump a lot of different things will pop up, you can hit the ""analyze -v"" link to get more information.

 [Here](http://imgur.com/9zxA0A9) is a example of a .dmp file being opened. In this Bugcheck you can see a lot of valuable information. On the top of this you can see a bugcheck number of 124 which is a machine check exception. Now if you search that on Google and read the rest of the bugcheck that's a hardware error. It also gives a culprit on the bottom where it says 

FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:  X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV

BUCKET_ID:  X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV

Now every .dmp file and every bugcheck will be different but this will give you the basic information to start a search on Google to see if anyone else had the same problem you are having. If you [search this information on Google](http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=FAILURE_BUCKET_ID%3A+%20X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV+%20BUCKET_ID%3A+%20X64_0x124_AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV) you get a huge list of other people who have had this same error and many different methods to try.

Now, sometimes it will even give you a specific file that crashed or caused the crash. If that happens usually it's some type of software causing your crash. Search the file on Google to see which program is actually causing you to crash. 

Ok, so lets say you have the bugcheck 124 problem above (which is a hardware problem) and you can't seem to figure out what it is with old forum threads. If you go [here](http://www.carrona.org/hwdiag.html) this is a awesome run down of specific hardware stress tests you can perform on your computer to see where and when your computer fails. Now if we look at our information, something is wrong with our AMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV. So the best place to start is running CPU and GPU tests, because those are your processors in your system (Reason for GPU is windows would consider your GPU a ""AMD Processor"" if you have a Radeon). Each section has information on how to run and test with each program. You will get your computer to fail with one of these tests if it's a hardware problem and this is something YOU HAVE TO DO. We cannot do this over Reddit for you. 

When one of these tests fail when you run them with the info the website says, BINGO, there is your hardware problem and what you need to replace.

Now, lets say you've done all of this and nothing failed and you are still getting your BSOD and can't figure out what it is. You can go further by running a program like MCAT (AMD specific) to look into your processor logs using some of the information in your bugcheck to get a even more detailed log on the error. I'll write another tutorial for that program later if you guys want, but I seriously think you'll never have to go this far to figure out your problem. If anyone can add to this or I made a mistake some where let me know and I will edit it. 

This should help some of you guys with getting crazy crashes! The best thing is once you go through this all once it'll get easier and easier to find out problems and you'll just get ""vibes"" on what's wrong based on the debugging information when you read it and you should always be able to keep your computer running fast and strong and stable!

too often overlooked though, is that in the US you can walk into any fry's or microcenter, or in canada NCIX, memory express, and iirc canadacomputers, and have them build the pc for you, for a low fee (iirc it's about $50-100 on top of the parts and shipping).

a few things to have prepared:

* your budget.
* brand preferences (like intel vs amd, nvidia vs amd)
* OS preference(idk if any of these guys will do linux, but maybe you want win 7 instead of win8, you probably deffo want 64 bit though).
* any peripherals you may need (mouse keyboard, and what you're willing to allocate to each from your budget- it might be a better idea to buy these separately.)
* what size and resolution of monitor do you want. i suggest 22"" 1680x1050 or 24"" 1080p. you may wan to buy this separately. 

these guys will work with you to select parts, and then build and test it, and either ship it to you complete, or you can pick it up in store when it's ready.

i especially recommend this approach to peopel coming from consoles, or people that have only ever owned OEM pc's like from DELL or HP, adn have yet to upgrade their ram or video card on their own.

newegg and tigerdirect also sell some prebuilt packages that are solid buys.


EDIT: this post is advice for people who are otherwise holding back from pc gaming, because of the building it yourself and or research aspects of pc gaming. as pc gamers, we've been rather successful in getting out the word that building it yourself means better quality parts that make more sense together, over the premiums that dell and HP or even worse alienware charge. this is for those people that simply are unwilling to take that plunge, even if they are willing in terms of wanting the pc gaming experience and have the money to spend.

i've done a number of builds or assisted in builds for friends who were in that position. tired of what xbox or ps3 offers, and ready to step in to the world of high end high frame rate gaming, but not knowing where to start, where to look, or who to turn to. i woke up this mornign and thought, what about those people without friends like me, who will part out and build a leet gaming rig for them for a case of beer and a double big mac meal? these stores can be that friend, and it also starts their relationship with these stores, which i'd wager most of us know about from word of mouth, and their reputations.

yes building your own is fun and somethign to be proud of, and it's easier than it sounds. but rather than constantly throwing frozen meat into a frying pan full of hot oil, maybe we can help thaw them out and season them a bit before cooking them up eh?",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,1361724755.0,,,True,t3_194uct,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/194uct/my_best_advice_to_newbies_to_pc_gaming_your_first/,

They'll also be able to stay more true to their vision with the details of the PC version because of the lack of publisher input.

See [this article in PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/12/09/sniper-elite-v2-ceo-on-self-publishing-and-moon-sniping/) for Rebellion's CEO discussing it.

I just want to make sure people are aware of this, because this is one chance to show that PC Gamers will come out in force and support a product made specifically for them when it otherwise would have just come out on consoles.  From the [screenshots on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/63380/), they are definitely using higher quality assets and shadow mapping (and probably a lot of other stuff).  I think a hardcore sniping game (which this kind of is on the hardest difficulty) appeals more to the PC crowd, not to mention that quick, precision shots are *always* made easier and more natural with a mouse.

If you have a console, download the demo and try it out.  It's a lot of fun, and quite a challenge to stay undiscovered on ""Sniper Elite"" difficulty.  Hopefully we'll see a PC demo before release on May 1st.  There hasn't been a good sniping game since the first Sniper Elite.  Sniper: Ghost Warrior was a letdown for many.",,False,self,t5_2qhfg,False,,IntelRadeon,True,t3_sa9xr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/sa9xr/sniper_elite_v2_lets_talk_about_the_pc_version/,

I want to get my boyfriend into gaming but he hasn't played a videogame since Super Mario Bros. 3. He said he loved it and would play it all the time but after that he just sort of never played games anymore.   
  He knows people love games but doesn't really know why and I've been trying my hardest to explain to him that the elements that make up his favorite movies and books can be found in games.  
  Now I have managed to convince him to try a game or two for me to at least show him why his sister and I play what we play. However, as someone that never stopped playing, I'm worried I'll pick something too hard that will discourage him from trying more. I feel that perhaps a game played from the 3rd person perspective would be best as he obviously isn't used to exploring environments or controlling cameras.  
  Dialogue would probably be the surefire way to his heart with memorable characters bantering back and forth. He loves movies and books with scenes where people just talk because, to him, that really shows the depth of the characters.   
   
  I'm not trying to push anything on him I just want him to know why I love what I love. It would be nice if we could get to the stage where we play things together but I'm not asking for a miracle. Just something that lets him know his girlfriend isn't as weird as she seems for loving video games.

This had a significant effect: games run after a day of web browsing and programming had lower frame rates than those run after a fresh reboot.

Now it is 2012. My gaming PC is a laptop and it has 8 Gb of RAM. It's running Windows 7, which is pretty solid in memory management. However, my old habit of rebooting before playing a game persists.

As a boy, my dad's Commodore 64 seemed like a computer powerhouse. The graphics: amazing. The sounds: amazing. The gigantic floppy disks that could hold more information than a ream of paper and a cassette deck to store even more information on. The machine was truly amazing and for a technological moment, the pinnacle of home computing.

I remember sitting on my knee chair in front of my dad's hand-me-down desk which had hand-written and printed scraps of BASIC code taped to nearly every vertical surface; shortcuts and commonly used prompts, many of which I would never use, let alone understand their functions. He had made a cardboard cutout of even more shortcuts and key binds which layed on the keyboard perfectly. The hinged plastic dust cover for the keyboard, on which my father placed a now faded sticker of the Commodore logo, had long since been cracked at one of the hinge points, but I carefully made sure it it didn't crack any further, mostly by removing the entire shell when it wasn't needed.

I spent hours upon hours learning BASIC through the mere necessity of trying to run the various game titles my father had collected. I played Zork, Castle Wolfenstein, Pong, Asteroids, Centipede, Pac Man and many others. I thought Choplifter, however, was the coolest game. It gave me a sense of real accomplishment having rescued 'real' people and brought them to safety. I remember my first rage quit, though. I had been playing Choplifter for quite a while and I couldn't seem to live through any of the sorties. Over and over, I crashed and burned. I got so upset, I threw the joystick controller to the ground and broke part of the plastic housing. I didn't play for a couple days after that, mostly in fear that my dad would see the broken controller and punish me, but also because I was so dissatisfied with the game and my game play.

I'm 30 now, and while computers have evolved dramatically over 20+ years, and games have never been better, I find my anger and self-loathing at how horrible I can play my favorite video games now and then hasn't changed a bit. The game titles change, the hardware changes, and the controller still breaks when I smash it on my desk. Instead of dot-matrix printouts of BASIC code, I have Post-It notes of HTML code, license keys for games that I've pre-purchased but are still in Beta testing, passwords to my EVE online and Star Wars accounts, all taped to my triple monitor setup. My PC glows blue in the darkness of my office and, regretfully, my wife has to remind me to bring down the empty cups that magically gather on my desk.

My dad didn't take me fishing, camping, or teach me how to shoot a gun. He did, however, teach me how to ride a bike, fly kites, and virtually every aspect of remodeling a house, and he taught me what Shock was the night the (arguably) crushed my right middle finger under a chest freezer and then get pulled over by the police for speeding, but what stands out to me most is that he gave me a Commodore 64, my first computer.

As we play our modern games on our modern PCs, please realize that just as consoles can be passed down, so too can PCs. May our children find the same wonder and enjoyment in our old hunk-o-junk computers as we did in our father's.

1358461089.0,31,self.pcgaming,16s0qk,AVOID IBUYPOWER.com or my no good very bad experience with IBUYPOWER.com's customer support,42,11,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/16s0qk/avoid_ibuypowercom_or_my_no_good_very_bad/,"I ordered a Laptop through IBUYPOWER.com a month ago. After being jerked around and lied to by their customer service team I finally canceled my order. If you or anyone you know is thinking bout ordering form this company, i would highly recommend against it. I was so frustrated and angered with the way they treated me that it led me to write my first complaint letter, which follows. 


To whom it may concern:

If you read no further than this sentence please know that your company and your customer support staff represented themselves unprofessionally, rudely, and subsequently earned IBUYPOWER a very negative reputation and a new unofficial spokesperson. 

I ordered a Battalion 101 P151EM1 Gaming Laptop from your company on the 17th of December 2012. I hadn’t heard of IBUYPOWER before but it had come recommended to me by a close friend who was also in the process of pricing out a new gaming laptop. After some research and exploring I decided to order the aforementioned a Battalion 101 P151EM1 Gaming Laptop. 

I wish the rest of this email was filled with my thanks and appreciation of how well your company upheld it’s end of the deal, but it is not. When I ordered the laptop I saw that it would be delivered in time for Christmas. No problem I thought, as long as it gets here before the second week of January (3 weeks after the initial order) life will be good. Imagine my surprise when on the 21st of December I received an email telling me hey, my laptops parts were being gathered.

Since that email I have been in contact with their customer support team multiple times trying to understand what was going on with my order. I first called on January the 2nd and was told, don’t worry, it is shipping next Monday at the latest, and then was promptly hung up on. I found that odd, but having received the information I wanted I began to play the waiting game again. Cut to next Wednesday, the 9th, I had yet to receive any form of communication from IBUYPOWER, whether by email or otherwise about the laptop that was supposed to ship 2 days ago, at the latest. I called customer service again and was greeted by a gentleman who clearly had about a thousand more important things to do than to deal with me, but hey, I had called so he might as well humor the customer.  I informed him of my situation (it was now 3 weeks since I had placed my order, 2+ days after I was told it was “definitely going to ship”) and I want to know if they had any more information on what the hold up was. Don’t worry he told me, this time it was DEFINIETELY going to ship by the following Monday. 

Now imagine my surprise when I called again today (the 17th ) and was told that not only were some of the parts not currently in stock, but the ones they did have were packed in boxes and being moved, as they were changing locations. Finally, the customer service rep did tell me not to worry, as it was going to get shipped out next week, for real this time. At this point I canceled my order.

I have never experienced the amazing level of dismissive, rude, and unhelpful customer service as I did in my dealing with IBUYPOWER.com. My experiences with your support staff and your companies inability to contact me in regards to the numerous delays and other issues with my order has left me with such an overwhelming sense of disappointment and regret in using your company. IN truth, I feel like a sucker for ever having used your services. You turned the elation and joyful anticipation of ordering and receiving a new gaming rig and turned the process into a joyless, frustrating, and timewasting nightmare. 

For what it is worth, you have made a life long IBUYPOWER.com spokesperson out of me, but I don’t think you would want to hear the things I have to say. 

Thank you for your time.

Right now your only real option is to play in DX9 mode because the game is laggy as all hell with DX11 on and it's not just my rig. Thought I'd give you guys a little heads up incase anyone was interested in buying it. 

***Users are also experiencing saves that will crash your game and then save at the crash point making the game 
overstack and error out making it unplayable unless you restart from the beginning of the game.*** *I can confirm this.*

Another error is if you own a quad-core processor, which most pc gaming enthusiast own, it can randomly lock up and crash.

***Buyers beware.*** 

**Edit:** I've uncovered an unofficial GFWL patch that has not yet been released publically, use it at your own risk. It apparently remedies some DX11 problems and crashing. [It can be found here.](http://www.mediafire.com/?4z1dsj5finkp9u0)

It may not have the best graphics card out there but it is still in the high-end region. So my question is - having come from PS3 what are the best graphically impressive games? If i'm being honest I am a little disappointed because with the difference in hardware (PS3 being 6 years old) I have not seen many games that are far superior to the likes of Uncharted and God of War except for maybe The Witcher 2 and Max Payne 3. There has not been that Generation leap I have expected. What do you guys think?

It was an FPS

I remember as you advanced you would go through different levels where you would fight through time basically. You'd start out fighting animals with shit weapons/fists and then get swords and guns. You'd fight ninjas, pirates, mid-evil guys. I remember the last level you fought the virus. It was very green and you flew really fast through the level.

Practice more.

Watch pro RTS/tutorial videos.

So we got our behemoth all assembled and I spent a few hours this morning making the cables look nice - for aesthetics and airflow.  I also spent some time trying to figure out why none of the case fans were coming on.  The case we got has a fan control on the top of the case that takes a molex connector - the fan control then sends power to all of the fans.  It turns out that the molex coming from the power supply had a loose pin that pulled out just enough not to make contact.

So once everything was hooked up and juiced I hooked it up to a monitor, hit the power button and.........no video.  We did the usual troubleshooting, RAM, different video cards, etc. and came to the conclusion that it was most likely the motherboard.  We called ASUS and they informed us that our board had an old BIOS on it and needed to be updated to work with our processor.  Well without the CPU working we can't update the BIOS.  They're sending us a preflashed BIOS chip we can swap out.

Anyways here are the pictures of the completed rig:

[Case](http://imgur.com/ZaVHd73)

[Guts](http://imgur.com/ryGuu1O) after cleaning up the cables.  That took about 25 zip ties to get that looking nice.  I know there are a few cables that aren't tied down, but that's due to a couple of things that need to be changed.  In particular our 512 GB SSD is just sitting there - we forgot to order the 3.5"" bay adapter for it.  Once that's properly installed then I'll tie the SATA cable down.

If anyone wants to ask me about it feel free.  I'll even provide a parts list if anyone is interested.

Me has teamspeak = talky talky fun times :)


Me and a small group of friends from all across the globe have been playing games together on the pc for years, and heck... we've had some amazing moments together!
Recently we came to the conclusion that having a few more people join our little teamspeak would be great idea for multiple reasons;

1 - It would be a lot easier getting a game of something going, since more people=more people willing to play a specific game.

2 - More people means a broader look on cultures etc. which could make a simple chat a whole lot more interesting.

3 - We like talking to people (duh)

Now before we get to the IP and ports, take a quick second to glance over some of these good qualities a person should always posses.

1 - Speak english, you don't have to be a god at english, just the basics)

2 - Be open minded, no one likes the person bashing everything you feel passionate about.

3 - And for the love of everything i hold dear, don't be a dick... your hostile trash talking doesn't belong here (although some friendly kiddingly smack talk is quite common)


Now you might be thinking ""this sounds great! but what if we don't play any of the same games? :S""
Well, we regularily play several games, some of the games we've currently been playing is stuff like; LoL, Dota 2, TF2 (that's mostly me), ARMA 2 (yea, we might get around to dayZ), CSS/CSGO. Then we also have a bunch of games we play every once in a while, but you don't really need to play any of the above games with a passion, we just wanna have a chat :)

So any tips on where the best place to get a great PC?,35,7,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/o6lqq/just_decided_to_make_the_switch_from_console_to/,"So yea like the title said, I recently decided to forego my PS3 and get into PC gaming. I already know which games I should get by looking at other threads, but I'm looking for some advice on which PC I should get.

I thought about building my own PC, but 1) I have noooo clue how to do that yet and 2) I would rather get a computer from somewhere so I can get the warranty and support and all that stuff.

I'm willing to spend a decent sum to get a really awesome computer. So far I'm leaning towards an Alienware desktop, but solely on the reason that they're the most widely publicized for gaming. 

One last thing. I don't really know much about what kind of requirements I should be looking for when I do decide which computer to get. For example, on the Alienware site when you customize your computer you have the option of getting different parts some of which cost like an extra 500 dollars so if anyone wanted to give me some advice on which shit is just completely overkill and which stuff will actually make a huge difference it would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: gha! I wasn't expecting so much helpful feedback overnight. You guys rock. thanks for all the advice. I was pretty set on just buying one and being done with it, but i think you guys may have convinced me to attempt to build one. I do also like the idea of supporting my lokes(locals). If I do expect to see some pictures when I finish as thanks. Reading through all the comments now, I'll update when I decide what to do.

I have a high-end gaming rig so I'd like something that is aesthetically pleasing as well as involved and entertaining. Anyone got any suggestions for me?! Thanks in advance!

It was a game where you flew around large land masses. You could add spikes and cannons and such to these masses and ram them into one another. It was a very unique game. I was a kid when I played these games so I am sorry I do not have more info.

I'm looking for a game like WoW or pretty much something that I can play for the long haul.  I havent played WoW in a long time, so I'm not sure if its still as popular as it used to be or if the new expansion is even worth it.  I want to play something where my character keeps growing and I can interact with others, not being forced to just play with/against the AI.  I dont mind if I have to pay a subscription and am open to all genres.

Would you guys have any recommendations for games like this?  
Thanks!!
