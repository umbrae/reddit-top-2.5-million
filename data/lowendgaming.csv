Playing on minimum can add some fun difficulty to the game. For example, my draw distance is so low that enemies are able to attack me before I can even see them. 

The best instance was hands-down the invisible dragon fight:

In the main quest of the game, I was sent to kill a dragon. As I get to the top of the mountain I hear the dragon-fight music start, and I look around for the massive beast. But while I can hear him and see the red dot on my HUD, I cannot see him. When I start seeing the fire come out of thin air, I realize. *The dragon isn't going to render, so I will have to fight an invisible fucking dragon.* This added some fun difficulty to the fight. I had to guess based off the HUD and the dust effects around where it was landing or hovering over. After a lengthy fight I slayed him, and his bones appeared. 

He was a lot bigger than I had imagined.",,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,True,t3_1fi924,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/1fi924/playing_skyrim_on_minimum_fighting_an_invisible/,

1362960170.0,72,self.lowendgaming,1a1u8j,"Due to school I've been stuck gaming on my laptop.  That hasn't stopped me from finding some high-quality, deep gaming. Thought I would share my favorites (mostly strategy/RPG)",81,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/1a1u8j/due_to_school_ive_been_stuck_gaming_on_my_laptop/,"I have a fairly beefy rig back home (Crysis at near max settings, yadda, yadda) but can't use it right now due to my school situation. Anyway, I'm gaming on a Lenovo z570 which is a solid little laptop but nothing to write home about.  Over the last couple semesters I've discovered plenty of games that are amazing and require little to no graphics.  Honestly, most games with high quality graphics tend to have very shallow or derivative gameplay.  I used to think I was missing out before I got my nice rig, but really after awhile fancy graphics cease to be impressive.  In many cases, games with simpler graphics can achieve things that simply aren't feasible otherwise, and since developers aren't worried about throwing money/time at graphics, they can focus on the gameplay itself.

Aaanyway, here's my list:
Conquest of Elysium - It's like HOMM as a roguelike. Very addictive with tons of replayability.  There is also it's bigger, much more complex cousin, Dominions 3, which I have not played but have heard lots of good things about and will probably get at some point.

Xenonauts (still in beta) - XCOM remake much closer to the original than the new XCOM.  Has wonderful 2D graphics and once finished could offer the ultimate XCOM experience.

Avadon The Black Fortress and Avernum Escape From the Pit:  These two are from the same developer and if you like one you will like the other.  Simple sounds and graphics, but amazingly in depth worlds to explore.  You get lots of text pop ups to set the scene when walking into important rooms and encounters.  Really great, old-school style RPGs.  The same dev (Spiderweb Software) has several other games in the same vein, but these are the most recent ones.

Distant Worlds: The ultimate space 4x IMO. This is one of the few games I have ever played where the universe actually felt like a living, breathing place.  Dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of civilian, military, and commercial ships make their way through space, each with their own name, mission, cargo, etc. Only con is the price.

ToME - A free roguelike with nice simple graphics and a better UI than most.  As you play you unlock new races and classes, and each class can be leveled up in a variety of ways.  Plus while playing single player you can chat with others in game to get tips and such.

Panzer Corps - Kind of like Advance Wars, but with a bit more complex combat. Play as the Germans in WW2.  Your units carry over from one battle to the next and gain experience, can be upgraded and so on.  The base game has a great branching campaign, and then there are a series of DLC that make for a super long grand campaign. Really fun and easy to get into.

Finally, instead of listing out a half-dozen more, I will simply point you to [Matrix Games](http://www.matrixgames.com/).  This is **the** place for complex, realistic wargames and strategy titles that don't require much computer horsepower. The prices can be a bit higher than other places, but they put out quality products.  Every game has a launcher that links to forums, manuals, automatic updates, etc. and the DRM is a simple serial code at installation.

Hope someone finds something they like in here!",,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,True,t3_1a1u8j,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/1a1u8j/due_to_school_ive_been_stuck_gaming_on_my_laptop/,

The first time I played it I was disappointed due to the framerate of around 15-20 fps on the lowest settings and so I tried a lot of things to get the framerate up. The game wasn't unplayable at 15-20fps, but it gave me a few headaches due to lag, and I also wanted to boost the FPS to give me the possibility of recording gameplay.

So I did some research and looked for some mods and now my framerate floats around 50 fps and the game is much more enjoyable as a result. I put together a video to show the mods I've used, which can be viewed [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWuIcoe2UHg).

If you would prefer to see these mods in text form, that can be found [here](http://cookingwithgrenades.com/7557/modview-skyrim-enhancing-skyrim-performance/).

The game won't look graphically spectacular with these settings and mods installed, but it's not really that noticeable when you play. Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that this will work on all low-end systems, and I recommend only trying this if the system has a dedicated graphics card and if Skyrim is on sale.

Many of you have asked for a master list and I thought this would be a fun thing to do. I got the idea from r/boardgames so if any of you visit that subreddit this will be old news.

Nominate a game. Please serch if it has been already nominated.
Then upvote it!

We will take the top 10 freeware games with the most points/upvotes after a week, and compile them into the Top 10 list. (I plan on checking this on the 30th) As the title indicates I plan on having this be a seasonal thing as new low-end games become discovered or tastes will change.

Rules:
1.Please search for the game to see if it is already nominated. If it is not make it a seperate reply

2. Must fit in with the lowendgaming guidelines

3. Must be freeware, or made free by the devs, such as Beyond a Steel Sky on GoG

4. No pirated games or abandonware

5. No emulators

We also have a retail/digital game Top 10 list [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/u28gk/rlowendgaming_decides_the_ten_best_retaildigital/)

Instead of posting these games as individual submissions, can we get them added to the master list?

1. Cost of the hardware. You don't need to upgrade every year just play the latest and greatest game. You can also buy cheaper computers to start with.

2. Cost of the games. Games get reduced in price significantly following release, and if you wait long enough can be picked up in Steam sales or multi-buy offers for very little money.

3. Mods. The modding community for your 5 year old game is already mature, there are already fantastic mods out there and you don't need to wait for them. These often include total conversions, adding many hours of gameplay onto your (already really good value) game.

4. Documentation. In a similar way to point 3, bugs, walkthroughs, strategy guides and other information on a game have already been extensively bashed out. If you encounter a bug, just do a quick google. If you need help on a puzzle, just glance at a walkthrough someone wrote 3 years ago.

5. You know which games are good. You will never waste money on a game which just came out, and turns out to be a 6/10. You can google ""Top 10 RPGs of all time"" and be guaranteed a fantastic gaming experience.

6. Patches. Your 5 year old game is already on patch v1.04 and all the bugs have been nicely ironed out. In some cases the gameplay has been considerably improved over the original, with new content or bonus features.

I've been watching this subreddit with great interest since it was founded, since I've often found myself gaming on low powered hardware. There is currently no resource just for gaming on integrated graphics chips or very low spec GPUs. Hopefully we can change that today.

My aim is to create a single, user-editable (and always up-to-date) page with everything one would need to know about PC gaming on an old laptop or computer all in once place.

I've made a start to this page already. I'd like to invite people to help contribute to a wiki page dedicated just to low end gaming (no account required):

Now it is running a whopping 2GB RAM! (there's actually 2.5 in there, I think a slot is broke on my board), a 512MB nVidia 9800GT graphics card and a Gigabyte GA-K8NF-9 nForce 4 motherboard and I still haven't found reason to upgrade to a new machine.

Any game you post will be checked and added onto this list!

MY SPECS (Almost everything on this list is based off of them, my PC ""year"" is 2005)

Video Card - Geforce 8200 M G (this is usually capped/bottle necked by my CPU so I'd say it doesn't really matter)
CPU - Single Core 2.1 Ghz
RAM - 2.8 GB (most of the time most games don't even need this much RAM so you should be fine)


Hotline Miami

Halo 1

Halo Custom Edition

Minecraft (running optifine and on multiplayer it works pretty well)

Cave story

Limbo (How well this game runs is mostly dependent on your video card, mine runs it ok)

Killing Floor

Jet Set Radio HD

Planetscape

Dwarf Fortress (with a cap on it)

Doom 1, 2

Most Source games (Except for black mesa source, left 4 dead games, and counter strike GO and Portal 2)

Team Fortress 2 is no longer considered low-end due to the insane amount of lag that happens in in-game fire fights for people with the minimum requirements. (Updates, more particles/polygons, etc)

Tribal Trouble

Rome Total War

League of Legends (haven't really played this much myself but tons of people say it is low end and the tutorial runs nicely)

Fable - The Lost Chapters (Set to all low you're pretty much set)

Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of war

Bastion

Civilization 4

F.E.A.R

The walking dead games can run on ass

Vampires- The Masquerade (lags at certain points, other times it's as smooth as butter, could be CPU related might not be)

StarWars Battlefront 2 runs ""ok"" except for the fact it can get pretty laggy but if that happens just restart the mission.

Max Payne 1 &amp; 2

San Andreas has some lag but if you set it to all low it runs like a dream
N+

Every Single YS game, (good to start with oath in  Felghana)

Audiosurf

All of the splintercell games from the last generation

Most of the Hitman games

FarCry

Nintendo DS emulators (depends on the game but it usually runs fine, try No$GBA)

Prey (it runs ok, don't expect a smooth buttery framerate all the time)

Mount and Blade Warband (has a dx7 mode and runs fine unless in a major battle with my specs, depending on your CPU you might or might not experience lag in battles with heavy unit numbers)

Mafia

Morrowind

Torchlight I and II

Arx Fatalis

Commandos I and II

teleglitch

Eversion

Spelunky

I Wanna Be the Guy
Barkley Shut Up And Jam Gaiden 

Meat Boy

DOOM 3 (it's an ok game but it runs pretty nice if you have the CPU for it)
Space Funeral

Terraria 

Recettear

Of course if you can't run most of these games than the wiki has great some great games.


I reccomend you find a year with games your computer can run pretty good and stick to it and don't go above it.
2005 is an optimal place due to the fact that games were starting to get good graphics but the games usually had requirements from 2004.
If you want proof of this play DOOM 3

RESOURCES TO FIND GAMES

how to find your PC year 
http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?year=2005
Find a point in time where your rigs weakness was still acceptable and run with it. Once you find a year where your rigs weakness is ok everything in
and below that year is fair game

I don't really reccomend can you run it, but if it says something silly like ""YOUR CPU CAN NOT RUN THIS GAME"" and your CPU meets the requirements than
can you run it is probably not detecting your CPU and is auto-saying that you can't run the game.

Have to read the comments for specific specifications (heh).

**Edit 2:** Just picked up indie bundle 2, will report back what works on my craptop.

So far both Universe Sandbox and Botanicula work perfectly on my machine. They are both also cool as hell! :) Splice also works on my setup, However EYE is not working, although my google-fu suggests this isn't necessarilly a performance issue....

**Day 3 edit:**
Indie bundle 3 - I know braid works on a bottom end setup, it's really fucking good too...Not sure about the rest.


Anyone who has suggestions or comments on day 3 sales, please chip in!

Notes:

1. I cut the cost down by NOT including the hard-drive (which i assume you can salvage from your existing computer). If not, go ahead and add any decent sata drive in and its still under $400 USD.

2. I stuck with 1866 DDR3 memory, however, the faster you get the better your video performance will be since the APU uses system memory for its video processing. (1600 is the bare minimum for decent APU performance)

3. Feel free to swap out the A10-6800k for the A10-5800k to save 10-20 bucks. The 5800k is the last generation chip and the graphics performance between the two are pretty much identical.

&gt;Hello lowend-gamers!

&gt;Many of you have asked for a master list and I thought this would be a fun thing to do. I got the idea from r/boardgames so if any of you visit that subreddit this will be old news.

&gt;Nominate a game. Please search if it has been already nominated.
Then upvote it!

&gt;We will take the top 10 freeware games with the most points/upvotes after a week, and compile them into the Top 10 list. (I plan on checking this on the 22nd) As the title indicates I plan on having this be a seasonal thing as new low-end games become discovered or tastes will change.

&gt;**Rules:**  
                 
1. Please search for the game to see if it is already nominated. If it is not make it a seperate reply

1. Must fit in with the lowendgaming guidelines
 
1. Must be freeware, or made free by the devs, such as Beyond a Steel Sky on GoG

1. No pirated games or abandonware

1. No emulators

1. In your Steam library, right-click Team Fortress 2.

2. Click ""Properties"".

3. Click ""Set Launch Options"".

4. Type ""-dxlevel 81"" (without the quotes).

It switches the DirectX version the game uses to 8. It affects the graphics slightly, but not nearly enough to detract from the game.

I usually get 30-40 FPS and with this I get over 100. It should make the game more playable for older computers.

Edit: This should work for all Source games, but I'm not sure how it affects the other ones.

Edit 2: A general rule if a game doesn't run well is to see if it supports older versions of DirectX. Mount and Blade, for example, has an option in its menu to run DirectX 7 which makes the game a lot faster with no graphical changes. Some games will be unplayable and/or extremely ugly when run with old versions of DirectX, so this is by no means a ""magic"" fix.",,False,self,t5_2u51f,1345613054.0,,,True,t3_ym4g7,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/ym4g7/heres_a_fix_for_anyone_who_cant_play_tf2_on_a/,

1337727305.0,39,self.lowendgaming,u0186,"Want to play an amazing team-based f2p shooter? Try tribes ascend, with this ini on extremely low settings! (xpost /r/tribes)",43,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/u0186/want_to_play_an_amazing_teambased_f2p_shooter_try/,"ALL CREDIT GOES TO /u/Zbow over in /r/tribes , I just copied his OP here!

----------------------------

For those of you don't know, Tribes.ini is a file that you can access under your C:\Users\'username'\Documents\My Games\Tribes Ascend\TribesGame\Config directory. This file holds a lot of information which will allow you to drop your graphics significantly lower than the ""minimal"" setting. I have perfected this .ini and edited it repeatedly to get optimal low end settings. [This link describes what every single line in the .ini file does!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoLRo1M6-ypfdGtwVExZd2lHN3JuellwMTZndkJOZVE#gid=0
)

A lot of people have been asking how to get better performance. This Tribes.ini setup sets your graphics to be SIGNIFICANTLY lower than minimal settings. This is explicitly for people struggling with 20 - 30 fps when using minimal settings, and should boost them to around 45 fps. 

**Notes**

**How to use:**

Find your Tribes.ini file and make a copy of it. Place it on your desktop and DO NOT touch it! This will be your backup. Then, open your Tribes.ini file that is in your config folder and replace all of the text inside with the following information. When you start your game, the resolution will be set to 800x600. Change this resolution in game if needed. **Increasing resolution greatly affects performance, so keep it fairly low.** Enter a game! If the graphics are too low for your liking, simply delete your edited Tribes.ini file and drag the Tribes.ini file on your desktop into your config file! All settings will be back to your previous setup. 

**DynamicLights** Can be set to False (Default is True) to gain 5 to 10 FPS, however, it makes most maps very dark and depressing, also making it very difficult to see enemies at reasonably far distances.

**UseMinimalNVIDIADriverShaderOptimization** Can be set to True (Default is False) if you are using older NVIDIA cards (6 to 8 series). Will improve performance slightly for these older cards.

* Intel Celeron CPU 2.19 GHz
* 2GB of Ram
* Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit edition
* Intel x4500m Integrated GPU

So, after trying out for a bit, it seems to actually work quite well, as it only uses Source SDK 2007. However, you should use the command in Steam ""-dxlevel 81"" (minus the quotation marks) in order to get it running more smoothly. Additionally, turn off the HUD Bloom in the BM:S settings, as that will cause a white line to run on your screen.

* Know your aspect ratio (eg: 4:3 or 16:9) and wind your resolution down to the next smallest one for your ratio... It may look a bit funky but it is a **big** fps booster.

* Close **all** background programs. It may seem obvious, but it would surprise you how much junk you have running without even knowing it

* If online **don't** host. This can really grind your fps to a halt, especially on bigger games.

I humbly disagree.

Without further ado, here are my recommendations for (cheap/free), low-end, fun multiplayer FPS games that are in many cases cross-compatible with Mac and Windows.

* Quake Live: A F2P browser-based rendition of Quake 3 Arena. It has a burgeoning community for a game so old, with daily and weekly competitions. It is the king of arena shooters, and will remain so for quite some time I'm guessing.

* Warsow: Another free arena shooter. In spite of sharing the same genre as QL, Warsow plays extremely differently. The community is much, MUCH smaller than QL, but it exists nonetheless. Also note that Warsow is 100% free whereas QL has a freemium model.

* Xonotic: Another arena shooter. This is an open source continuation of Nexuiz, a game initially released many years ago (disregard that newly-released crap). 100% free as well, and in version 0.7 of beta right now. Very fun, and in my opinion, a bit easier to pick up than QL or Warsow.

* Assault Cube: One of my (for some reason) all-time favorite low-end multiplayer FPS games. It plays like a very fast-paced version of Counter-Strike (for want of a better, more well-known game to compare it to), and will run on nearly any netbook. A gargantuan update is on the way and is rapidly approaching which will make the game, in my opinion, infinitely better than it already is. Has a surprisingly large community for such an old game. A surprising amount of skill is needed to succeed as well. Highly recommended.

* Doom/Doom 2: What more needs to be said. Incredible classic FPS games from way back in the day. If you don't mind the dated graphics these are well worth a look, and Doom 2's multiplayer is still very alive to this day. In fact, QuakeCon 2013 just had a Doom 2 tournament. 

* Fortress Forever: A total conversion Source mod heavily inspired by Team Fortress Classic. I have put more hours into this game than almost any other. Extremely dynamic and fast-paced, and well worth your time if you're fine with a small and tight-knit (and competitive!) community. 

* CS: Source: Not much needs to be said. One of the most popular shooters ever released on the PC, with tens of thousands of players online every day. Very high skill ceiling, and I'm not sure how easy it is to find ""classic"" servers anymore, but it is definitely a lot of fun.

* Day of Defeat Source: A very fun, much overlooked WWII arcade FPS. For $10 you get a lot of content and a hell of a lot of fun with thousands of players online every day. Not even 1/10 as popular as CS, but it still has a solid community nonetheless. 

* Team Fortress 2: The second most-played game on Steam for a reason. TF2 is one of the best F2P games ever created. There are nine classes to choose from in many team-based game modes, and the gameplay is intense and can be very fast-paced. The graphics are stellar, and it is teeming with character. However, note that if you have a very low end system that you should be prepared to configure TF2's settings to obscenely low levels to run adequately.

* Unreal Tournament '99: Definitely worth checking out if you remember Unreal Tournament from back in the day, and it has aged very nicely. Still has a strong community backing it up.

* Wolfenstein Enemy Territory: I confess that I have never played this, but I have heard that the community is definitely still going fairly strong. It is an oldschool competitive WWII game; very unrealistic. Google for the forums if you want to check out the community!

* Call of Duty 2/4: These will run on what most would consider low-end these days. The competitive scenes have died for both, but *many* still play online.

* Half-Life 2 Deathmatch: Classic deathmatch and team deatmatch in the Source engine, using HL2 weaponry (including the gravity gun!) I found the game to be decent at best, but it is very cheap on Steam and has many hundreds  playing daily.

* Battlefield 1942: Now 100% free from EA's Origin client, BF1942 is one of the best large-scale multiplayer FPS games ever made. This was the first Battlefield game, and it is the one that started it all. Still many people playing, and the gameplay has aged quite nicely. Highly recommended. 

Note that most of these games have relatively small communities -- people *do* play them, but not nearly as much as the most-played games on Steam, for example.

As I was placing a janitor down next to Crazy Caterpillar 1 to clean up some vomit, I started remembering other tycoon games I've played:  Ski Resort Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, and countless others back when the big Tycoon boom happened.

Most of the time it's playable!

MY SPECS:

2.1 Ghz Single Core CPU
2.8 Gigs of RAM
NVIDIA 8200M G integrated Graphics Card

All of these download links have been checked and i've installed them myself!

First off, you need to download and install this .dll that improves performance all around

http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34778

Once you install that install this .esm!

http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40128

(Copy &amp; paste it into your Data folder in your new vegas directory and run new vegas and go to data files and click better performance.esm, if you don't understand there's a detailed how to on the .esm mod download site)

Download GameBooster and Boost your game! This temporarily closes out all background processes and adds a couple FPS to your game

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Unless you want the games audio to lag behind the game itself hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete while in game and this will minimize your game and bring up task manager, right click on fallout new vegas and hit go to process, set the priority to high and exit out task manager and go back to your game. THIS WILL NEED TO BE DONE EVERYTIME YOU BOOT UP NEW VEGAS!

Now onto the resolution, if your aspect ratio isn't set to 4:3 on the launcher options menu set it to that!
You should have a resolution of 800x600 and you should be able to run it in full screen as opposed to window mode.

While fallout new vegas's Vsync is checked, unchecking it won't do you any good as fallout 3 auto-forces vsync!
To disable vsync and get more FPS you'll want to do the following!

Taken from ""http://www.geforce.com/optimize/guides/new-vegas-tweak-guide#5""

You can force VSync off in Fallout: New Vegas by editing a command variable found in the Fallout_default.ini file in the \Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegas directory.

1340197911.0,29,self.lowendgaming,vbrm9,For Starcraft 2 players stuck at 1024x768 [x-post from /r/games] ,34,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/vbrm9/for_starcraft_2_players_stuck_at_1024x768_xpost/,"One of the things about Blizzard that annoyed the hell out of me, was limiting the lowest available resolution to 1024x768. Since most players with old laptops that barely can play the game have 16:10 screens it poses 2 problems:

- drivers usually stretch the game from 4:3 to 16:10 which makes it look like ass and hinders feel of the mouse


- terrain view is limited, due to SC2 being Horizontal+ game when it comes to widescreens.



Blizzard could have gone with minimal vertical pixel requirement of 600 when designing the game and us players with shitty computers would be delighted with resolutions like 1024x640 (16:10) or 1024x600 (16:9) which would grant us smooth framerates, no problems with stretching/black bars on sides and wide terrain view. But no, minimal vertical pixel requirement is 720 (as in 1280x720)which is too much to handle for my little Radeon x1400. At the same time 1024x768 works just fine, but it's stretched and missing terrain view.



Welcome to the franken resolution from Macs - 1152x720 - which gives me full screen image with perfect proportions (being 16:10), wider terrain view than 1024x768 and no noticeable drop in performance due to having similar pixel count as the good old 1024x768 (because of decreased vertical pixel count):



1024x768 - 0,78 Mpix (stretched to hell, narrow visible terrain)

1152x720 - 0,83 Mpix (just 6% more pixels, almost no performance hit, perfect proportions, wide visible terrain)

1280x720 - 0,92 Mpix (18% more - in my case noticeable performance hit, stretched, widest visible terrain)

1280x800 - 1,02 Mpix ( 31% more - completely unplayable, perfect proportions, wide visible terrain)



In my system 1152x720 is not available from the start - just add it through your GPU control panel, powerstrip or registry. AMD users can also check out this little tool: http://morrisoft.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/ati-custom-resolution-tool-v1-02/



TL;DR - if you have shitty computer that barely handles SC2 in it's lowest resolution and has 16:10 screen (like 90% of older laptops) - switch from 1024x768 to 1152x720 - SC2 will have perfect image proportions, wide terrain view and almost no noticeable performance hit in comparison to 1024x768 which you are already playing right now.",,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,True,t3_vbrm9,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/vbrm9/for_starcraft_2_players_stuck_at_1024x768_xpost/,

My friends and I would do weekly LAN's, typically no more than four people and we were always looking for something new. FPS, RTS, SIM, Racing - you name it we had it. Within a few months our library began growing exponentially as I scoured the internet researching and finding more obscure and lower budget titles. There were only two prerequisites each game needed: it had to have multiplayer and it had to run on a netbook or laptop with lower end specs. Now, a problem arisen after awhile that we had too many games. Too many people had no idea what ""Nitro Family,"" ""Klingon Honor Guard"" or ""Plain Sight"" were. Whenever someone found an obscure game with an interesting title we couldn't look it up very easily as the house we held these parties at had no dedicated internet connection, which resulted in all of us looking up each game on our phones. Then, one day, I had an idea.

The LAN Hub. The LAN Hub would be a website, stored and broadcast offline to those connected within our local network which would catalog and profile each of the 300+ games I had assembled. Below are some pictures:


[The main page](http://i.imgur.com/h950E.png)

[Example of a game profile page](http://i.imgur.com/VZvba.png)

[Available games at each party](http://i.imgur.com/ch5o1.png)

The website is stored on a 32gb flash drive using xampp to simulate offline sql databases (for the search engine and other fancy bits). It is still in the process of being constructed but should be done within the next few weeks. If anyone is interested I may release the entire website, along with templates and tutorials as well as a complete game list when it is ready. I even wrote a script which automates the content process to make the adding games to the website quick and simple. The automator renames the template .php file, resizes all pictures, converts them to the proper format and renames them in sequential order. It will also automatically place all files in the proper directories as well as update the search engine and games list (for perspective: it use to take me five minutes to do each game profile, with the automator it takes around 20 seconds).

As Judge Dredd, you can yell at perps and arrest them, and it will show you their crime and how long they'll be in the iso cubes. There are strange reasons like ""possession of goldfish without a license."" Overall it reminds me of Duke Nukem.

How that larger list will look has not been finalized, but for now focus on this list. Pretty much the point of this list is any games that will run well on a machine with 1Ghz, 512 RAM, and only on board GFX.   

I prefer more modern games for this list, but 286-486-pentium classics are not out of the question... But what will modern low end gamers actually WANT to play?   

Oh and 1 last thing. How easy it is to obtain these games is important. If it is not longer sold at all, if it is still sold at full price, collectible only, or torrent only may affect it's ability to be on this list. Putting a classic on this list might be nice, but if the only way to get it is to torrent or pay $300 it may not belong here. You decide. For now I will list almost anything and then break it down later.   

- The Sims (How to obtain this game?)  
- The Sims 2 (May not run on some older GFX cards)
- StarCraft (Blizz sales it directly for $14.99)  
- Myst (Masterpiece edition on steam for $5.99)
- The Longest Journey (GoG.com for $9.99 Wait for sale?)  
- Never Winter Nights (oG.com for $9.99 Wait for sale?)  
- Balder's Gate1&amp;2, Icewind Dale 1&amp;2,
- Fallout 1&amp;2  
- Septerra Core  
- (So many games from GoG.com)  
- Half Life 1

How Low End Is My PC?,26,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/v284j/not_familiar_with_newer_pc_specs_how_low_end_is/,"I received a free ""frankenstein"" dell machine from work.  Using CPU-Z, I was able to identify what it contained, and it was definitely an upgrade from my old pc.  I spent about $100 to give it an actual graphics card and a new power supply.  Here's the specs:

* Core 2 Duo 3.4 ghz
* 2gb Ram (4x512mb)
* XFX Radeon HD 6570 1gb PCI-E 2.0 Video Card (in a PCI-E x16 slot)
* 80gb Sata drive
* 250gb Sata drive
* 460 watt power supply
* WinXP

How low end is this?  I know there's quad-core and six-core processors out there now, with their sandy bridges or whatever that is so this dual-core should be considered ""low-end"" I guess.  Last time I built a pc, AGP 8X was the new kid on the block.

I downloaded Warhammer 40k Space Marine demo and it defaulted to 1360x768 res at High settings but someone told me ""that's a crap game to see if your system is good"".  What kind of machine am I working with here?  I typically try to play games at a 1360x768 resolution to start. 

*Edit*

Thanks for all the replies everyone!  Due to budget constraints, the video card will have to stay but I can upgrade the ram.  After some more research I discovered my Mobo can accept up to DDR2 ram 800mhz.  So I plan on upgrading to max on ram for 32bit XP.  

From what I understand on the video cards, because I'm sticking a 2.0 in a 1.0 x16 slot, some of the video card upgrades from what I was able to afford already won't help out much in the long run due to the PCI Slot speed bottleneck.

It sounds like with this setup I can at least run most things that have come out in the past few years which is excellent :)  I only have to work within the constraints of this pc until the beginning of next year when I'll finally be able to build a brand new pc!

Hope you guys enjoy this game, and if you want to play online, look up a guide on youtube. (Hamachi is not ideal, but it can also work)",,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,True,t3_u07an,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/u07an/terraria/,

A&amp;A is a first-person RPG on an engine rather like Doom's. The initial release was done without a publisher, before that was really viable... it sold less than a hundred copies. It attracted a following through 'abandonware' sites, which eventually lead to a Lets Play on Something Awful, which lead to one of the original devs working out the legal situation to do a rerelease. Plans are in place to add proper mod support, but it's not there yet.

Bad news: the windows port isn't ready yet, so you have to either have a really old system to run DOS natively or enough beef to run it in DOSBox. And there's a really annoying bug with the newly added mouse+WASD control scheme and wands only firing once.

My computer is an i3 dual core, 8gb RAM, and Intel HD Integrated Graphics.

If you want to play games through emulators, you must try to understand all the options and configurations; to learn you have to just keep browsing through and flipping switches trying things and undoing them. You have to understand the ""plugins"". Video/Audio/Input/console.

My computer:
Core-2duo 2.0ghz
2gbRam
Intel 4-series (hd4500m)
Win7 x64 pro

**This is not a post to talk about the games; but rather some information about the emulators.**

Snes and Sega emulators are the easiest to start off with as they should be able to run fine and dandy on most systems. I won't go into them, but here's a list of the best emulators I've no problems with:
""bsnes"", ""snes9x"" and ""fusion"" (sega megadrive/mastersystem)

Emultors for the Nintendo64 and Playstation on my laptop require more attention. This is where you need to understand ""plugins"".
The Emulators I use for the N64 are ""Mupen64"" and ""Project64"", I use them for varying reasons, and overall I find them both equally as good as the other. And the Emulator I use for the Playstation is ""ePSXe""

So heres an essentials list of plugins I think anyone with a ""low-end"" computer should obtain.

*Mupen64/Project64:*

Video - ""Jabo's Direct3D8 1.6"" / ""Jabo's Direct3D6 1.5.2"" / ""direct64 v0.5.03.25""

Sound - ""Jabo's DirectSound 1.6"" / ""zilmars audio plugin""

Input - ""Jabo's Direct Input7 1.6"" / ""N-Rage's Direct-input8 V2""

*ePSXe:*

Video - ""Pete's D3D Driver 1.77"" / ""Pete's DX6 D3D Driver 1.77"" - (there are opengl drivers - but they were slower for me)

Sound - ""Eternal SPU Plugin Lite 1.41"" / ""Pete's DSound Audio Driver 1.15

Cdrom - ""P.E.Op.S. CDR Driver 1.4"" - and ePSXe's

If anyone has more information regarding there experience's with low end emulating, please add. I must note that some of the drivers might be outdated, or may be the last ever made. I don't remember the specifics of it all, but I assure you I had little to no problems with the games I wanted to play.

P.S - Admittadly I only played Final Fantasy IX through the playstation emulator, the biggest problem I had was with running the discs, my laptops disc drive doesn't work properly. So i had to copy the cd's to my hard-drive. This requires a little more knowledge, and there is plenty of freebie software out there that will allow you to do this, but please read up about it first, for me it was not as simple at it first seemed.",,False,self,t5_2u51f,1337789896.0,,,True,t3_u16am,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/u16am/emulators_experiences_on_my_laptop/,

I've been able to get a great gaming experience out of it. Here is a list of games I've been able to run on this graphics card. 

Counter Strike 1.6-Highest settings

Counter Strike Source-Highest Settings

Counter Strike GO-Low to Medium settings at a playable framerate.

Half-Life collection all at Highest settings, or a mixture of Medium and High settings.

Portal 1 and 2- Mixture of medium and high settings. Mostly Low-Medium for Portal 2, and all at very nice framerates.

Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas (haven't tried fallout 3 since I do not have the patience to make it compatible with Win8.)- Fallout 1-2 at highest settings, and Fallout new vegas at Low-Medium settings.

So basically what I'm trying to say is, gaming isn't impossible on this graphics card. You can get a great gaming experience out of this card. I can imagine a hell of a lot more games run on this too. Maybe not the most modern games, but I've seen a lot of YouTube videos of people running modern titles like Batman Arkham Asylym, Arkham City and a lot more on Intel HD.

TL:DR- Gaming on Intel HD Graphics is not impossible. A lot of modern and older titles will definitely run on this card.

My PC is still decent, but my wrecked GPU probably puts me in the low-mid area of this group.... 

I'm just curious, how many other people have had a GPU burn out on them, and how many of you have had the manufacturer respond in any way (other than to clarify that it isn't their fault)? I checked with my manufacturer and they didn't seem to do anything other than state the obvious fact that certain GPU lines failed: [MacBook Pros were affected](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2377) though Apple did a decent job of replacing/fixing them.

&gt;Again, we truly appreciate our customers passion for our products and apologize for any inconvenience.

Then replace my GPU ffs!

To be fair, at least Dell &amp; HP attempted to fix the problem with new drivers, whereas Nvidia itself did nothing.

BONUS: Anyone wanna try to guess/compare how shitty my Nvidia 8600M GT GPU is after something blew, got it fixed and underclocked?

Many of you have asked for a master list and I thought this would be a fun thing to do. I got the idea from r/boardgames so if any of you visit that subreddit this will be old news.

Nominate a game. Please serch if it has been already nominated.
Then upvote it!

We will take the top 10 digital/retail games with the most points/upvotes after a week, and compile them into the Top 10 list. (I plan on checking this on the 30th) As the title indicates I plan on having this be a seasonal thing as new low-end games become discovered or tastes will change.

Rules:
1.Please search for the game to see if it is already nominated. If it is not make it a seperate reply

2. Must fit in with the lowendgaming guidelines

3. Must be able to be bought somewhere, Retail store, Steam, GoG, Impulse, Origin anywhere, but no freeware

4. No pirated games or abandonware

5. No emulators

I won't be suggesting the Jagex version as it's complete shit, but it's only fair to leave it hear, too. Stuff you need to know:

-Ace of Spades is a first person shooter that is set in the WWI - WWII era.

-Features completely editable terrain that is made of voxels.

-Free to play beta (Jagex's version costs 10 USD).

-System requirements are officially ""Your grandmother's rig can run it.""

-up to 32 players per game.

-3 guns:Semi-automatic Rifle, SMG, Shotgun.

-100% customizable maps.

-Every model and image in the game can be modded.

-A server software called pysnip (not the official server software) allows for custom game modes, anti-hacks, and all kinds of server managing utilities. -Servers are player-driven.

-Has the most dedicated, coolest community that I have ever seen.
Naturally, Jagex buying a game and leaving the good parts in the beta did take its toll, but I'll leave it up to you to decide how that's going to effect your opinion on it because I could probably rant about it all day =\

performance",18,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/udtl7/increasing_hp_dot_s_e3gma_3150atom_n570/,"Hello. My original ""gaming"" laptop (yes, I know that's a joke in itself, shush) is currently being fixed on warranty, and for the time being I'm stuck with this poor dot s netbook, literally the cheapest reasonable one I could find (costed me 280$).

I can't help being a gamer, so I've been trying to improve game performance, and I've had moderate success thus far - but my knowledge in this area is not very extensive, and I could certainly use some help.

&amp;nbsp;

The specs are: Atom N570 dual core 1.66GHz, 2 GB DDR3 666Mhz ram, GMA3150. I'm using W7 Starter.

&amp;nbsp;

First off, here's things I already do:

1) I'm using [Sherry 1.3](http://9xxssf.info/topic/360-sherry-13-for-gma-3150-is-here/) drivers for GMA3150. They have shown some noticeable performance improvements (for instance, Minecraft multiplayer went from just barely playable to comfortable - at least in the less graphically intensive areas).

2) I'm using the [GBoost](http://www.gzero.com/gboost/home.html) application. 

3) I'm using [ReadyBoost](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/readyboost). Not a huge improvement for gaming, but still.

4) I defrag my harddrive regularly and uninstall crap programs I no longer use. I use [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER).

5) I'm keeping windows up to date.

6) I set the process priority in task manager to higher on games.

7) Disabled power saving, and optimized 3d settings in the GMA driver settings.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, ways I can think of to further improve performance:

1) Getting an external SSD for gaming/pagefile. This one requires money I do not really have, so while it's the simplest, it's out at the moment.

2) Changing operating system. Tiny XP or Linux seem like good choices - however, Sherry is not available for either to my knowledge, so this seems pointless. With Tiny XP this would only slightly lower CPU/Memory usage, which is redundant given the GBoost utility. 

3) Overclocking existing components:

(**WARNING**: Do not try to overclock if you do not know what you're doing. Read extensively first, and be very, very careful with the temperature - otherwise you can and will cause permanent damage to your computer.)

* Allocating more memory to the integrated card. Sherry 1.3 already seems to allocate 256MB rather than the default (which I believe is 64) - and from what I've read, with the limited computing power of the 3150, allocating any more is pointless. Also, the bios on this netbook has absolutely no options for this.

* Increasing the clock speed of the integrated card. This should theoretically be possible - GMA3150 is clocked at 200 Mhz, while GMAx3100 (off of which it is based) is at 500Mhz. Also, GMA booster already does this for other cards. But since GMA booster does not support GMA3150, are there any other solutions?

* Overclocking the CPU. This seems like the most likely to work. Someone has already done this with this processor up to 2,2 GHz on an EEPC - which is obviously unreasonably high, but a slight improvement should be stable. However, I can't seem to find a clock generator file for my motherboard (sje06_pt) for setfsb.

* Overclocking the memory. Theoretically this should be possible. I've not yet done extensive research on this. The general purpose tools from www.tweakers.fr do not support this hardware. The bios has no options for this, sadly.

4) Some method of lowering graphical settings all across the board. The basic GMA driver utility has some settings for this, but they are limited. This would be to replace low setting CFG's in games that do not have them as an option. I've no idea if this is at all possible (I saw more extensive 3d settings in Nvidia drivers, but I'm thinking of something even more robust), this is just something I came up with while brainstorming just now. [Edit] I found something for this. [3dAnalyzer](http://games.softpedia.com/get/Tools/3D-Analyze.shtml) seems to have this capability for many games. However, an ""across the board"" solution would still be useful.

&amp;nbsp;

Please, please, please - if I have any misconceptions about any of this, correct me. I'd rather not screw something up accidentally. If you can think of any other ways to improve performance that I've not mentioned (even if they seem obvious, I tried to be fairly comprehensive), please point them out.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance for any help. I also hope that what I've listed will be helpful to 
some of you.

I apologize that I have not been very active as of late, but now that it is summer I will have a lot of extra time on my hands :)

So lets improve everyone's favorite gaming subreddit!

1. As a mod team, we want to know. what can we do better? Do you like the rules (read the sidebar) do you hate them? Let us know! Either post a reply or a simple mod message would do! 

2. Where would you like to go with this subreddit? Would you like us to continue on our path we are going in? Do you have a different idea? We are here for you!

3. I mentioned a while ago that we should start a wiki. Not just any wiki, but I think it would be cool if we had screenshots of games in various setting modes, to give people an idea of how stuff looks. I would also have them put their specs and frame rate (although that might delve into a circlejerk, of lol I get 1000FPS), so maybe just screenshots would be best, for example I was thinking 

* Oblivion: Low settings 45 FPS screenshot.jpg
* Oblivion: Medium settings - 30 FPS screenshot.jpg
* Oblivion: High Settings - 18 FPS screenshot.jpg

* Anti-aliasing
* anisotropic filtering
* resolution of lighting
* resolution of shadow maps
* regular or geometry shader reflections
* post processing (HDR, motion blur, depth of field)

If I can see what I'm doing, and the framerate is high, I'm good to go. The only game I struggled with was the new Deus Ex, some of the HUD graphics are too small to read at that resolution!

I find it interesting, as a whole reddit seems to be very anti-jaggies, while I prefer no AA when stuck in low resolutions. Again, reminds me of playing doom and duke and all the others, plus it gives a further bump to my framerate.

I also enjoy coming back to the game once I have a decent system, it makes the second playthrough much more interesting when you can finally crank the settings up. Finally did this for HL2 a few years ago, after originally playing it at 640x480 or some such.

So I'm curious, what things do you put on the cutting block first? What things do you keep?

We're be playing next to each other, in the same room, on separate computers. The problem is the other computers I have access to aren't designed for running games. They're not bad PCs, just not good with games. I only need to pick one of these, as I have my PC which can handle most games.

Here are the PCs I have available:

Option 1 - Gateway All-In-One (this is my preferred choice, because the screen is built-in and it will save space):

* Intel Core i3-2120 @ 3.3 GHz

* 6 GB DDR3 RAM

* Intel HD Graphics 1000 (GT1), which is integrated and the major inhibitor. **The biggest problem is it has no Video RAM.** I guess I received a false reading on one of the tests. 1.7 GB Video RAM showing up now. I had the wrong driver installed for the integrated chip. It's producing much better results now.

I was going to look into trying EverQuest II on this, but it didn't pass the minimum specs required on SysReqLab. Not that I'd like to limit myself to EQ2, just giving you all an idea of the specs.


Options 2 - Gateway Mini Tower (not a preferred option, but I will use if needed. Requires an external monitors, taking up some extra room.)

* Intel Pentium Dual Core E6700 @ 3.3 GHz

* 6 GB DDR3 RAM

* Intel GMA X4500 integrated graphics card

I don't have this set up currently, so I haven't been able to run SysReqLab at all.


Option 3 - Lenovo Z565 Laptop (Least preferred option, though it gives me the greatest range. I don't always have access to it, unfortunately).

* AMD Phenom II N660 @ 3 GHz

* 3 GB RAM (DDR3, I believe).

* ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 Series

I've been looking over other posts and have decided to look into [Anarchy Online](http://www.anarchy-online.com/wsp/anarchy/frontend.cgi?func=frontend.show&amp;template=main&amp;navID=1003) and [NEStalgia](http://silkgames.com/nestalgia/), but was looking for more variety.

But as someone with a modest laptop, 720p is a viable choice for me when I can't achieve a decent framerate at 1080p (on an external monitor). On a laptop screen it is perfectly acceptable, and gives me better performance than my native 768p at the slight cost of image quality.

Maybe it's because PC hardware is so powerful, but I almost never hear about people gaming with Sub-HD resolutions (below 720p), or even considering it being viable. Most games don't even give you the option to choose anything below 720p if you are playing at a 16:9 ratio. But I've discovered in the past that if you just need a few more frames that you can't get at 720p, dropping the resolution a bit might be worth considering. 

1200x675 is a resolution that, while not true HD, still comes pretty close to the image quality of 720p. It's often difficult to get a game running at a custom resolution, but if you know which files to edit, 675p can be the difference between a playable game and a slideshow. I managed to get the Mass Effect 3 demo running a few months back at 675p just for kicks and it worked great with 40-60 frames on my machine. It's sad that most games don't offer a 675p option as the next step down from 720p. Is it because some monitors can't recognize the resolution?

There are a couple other 16:9 resolutions worth considering if your system is pretty strapped for performance, although I have found that using these with games that rely heavily on UI elements and text can be a bad idea as unlike 675p, they usually turn into a blurry, jaggy mess. These are 1024x576 and 960x540 (also known as QHD, or quarter HD).

So yeah, discuss. There is definitely a stigma against using lower resolutions, and I'm sure some onlookers with GTX 690s will be horrified by this thread, but sometimes you just want to play that graphically intensive game, you know?",,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,True,t3_u008h,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/u008h/subhd_resolutions_for_169_screens/,

1376248115.0,12,self.lowendgaming,1k5p68,"Total War, Classic Ace of Spades and more",14,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/1k5p68/total_war_classic_ace_of_spades_and_more/,"Hello /r/lowendgaming, I've finally decided on posting my list of low end games that are extremely fun to play on even the worst of machines. Games I rarely see posted here and are easily affordable and playable. 

Let's start!

**The Total War Series**

The Total War series has had a great run and is still going strong. It's a favorite for history fanatics and those who are obsessed with war. The game focuses on taking control of a country at a certain time in history. From a feudal Europe, or a deadly and conquest-hungry Rome. It follows history accurately and you can decide how things play out. Who lives, who dies. You can play as Scotland and DESTROY England! You could play as Egypt and conquer Europe. Lots of things to do, many places and events to participate in. From the british isles as William Wallace fights of norweigen invaders and the English fight back the Welsh and Irish rebels, to Rome, where one of the three houses of Rome fights for their own survival against the rest, to Empire. Total War has been grand, great and easily playable. Maybe not the latest games, but the golden, great games can be affordable and playable, games like these:

**Rome:Total War** The guys at /r/Totalwar will tell you plain and simple, Rome Total War was what revolutionized the series. Shogun Total War and Medieval Total War were great, but Rome ushered in a new era. A era that brought the series up to the top and has kept it there for a while. With Rome II around the corner, a lot of people will flock to the series once more. But if you want to live in the golden era of Total War? Grab Rome! 
[It's $9.99 on Steam right now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4760/) though it has the tendency to go on sale and may, since Rome II is around the corner. I picked it up a while back when it was on sale for $1 and I do not regret anything about it. The game is big for it's time and can provide you many hours of great fun, also it was made in 2004, the battle proportions can get huge, you can have up to five thousand men on one battlefield, which can cause you quite a bit of choppyness, but that's only for huge battles. Adjusting the graphical settings can give you unbelievably smooth gameplay, and you will feel so empowered when you have four hundred archers rain fiery roman fury upon the Gallic barbarians. Afterwards hearing 'This land is Roman!' I highly recommend it. 

**Medieval II: Total War Gold** Medieval II is a improved second reboot of Medieval: Total War. It's an extremely fun game, especially for those with a Medieval warfare crave. The feudal and war-hungry Europe provides you with great enjoyment. Fight off your enemies and brace your lower regions when the Mongols invade Asia, pray they stop and not reach you. After gunpowder is discovered, DESTROY your enemies capital with cannons and mortars and firearm-wielding units, or march on a country of your choosing with an army of mounted knights, you decide how you dominate. The time frame is based from the late 1000's all the way to the 1500's. From William the Conqueror to Ghengis Khan, you have a lot of realistic historical figures to fight with and against. The game also has an active modding community.  

Medieval II Total War Gold, which includes the game and the Kingdoms DLC is [$10 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Gold-Pack-Total-Kingdoms-Pc/dp/B000YQ639M) This is a better deal than getting it with steam, as Steam can wrack up to almost $20 for both Kingdoms and the main game. 

Kingdoms, the DLC to the game gives you four different events to play in. Americas gives you the Americas and 7 playable factions, The Aztecs, New Spain, Apachean tribes, Chichlimeca, Tlaxcalans and Tasascans, the map stretches from Guyana to Texas. 

Britannia, gives you five playable factions, England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Norway. All on the map of the british isles. 

Crusades, puts you in the middle of the crusades. You can play as Jerusalem, Antioch, Egypt, Turks or Byzantium. The map covers Egypt, the Levant and Anatolia. 

Tuetonic gives you four new playable factions, Tuetonic Order, Lithuania, Denmark, Novgord  and you can unlock Poland the Holy Roman Empire, the map stretches from Germany to Russia. Great fun and greatly worth it.

Now, those are the two most playable Total War games for low-end systems. 

Furthermore, there are plenty of more fun games to play that don't require godly PC's, for example:

**Classic Ace of Spades(Or 'Buildandshoot')** Disregard Ace of Spades in the steam store. 'Build and shoot' is Ace of Spades in it's classic form, when it was Minecraft with guns! It's still very active and very fun. You can find it [here](http://www.buildandshoot.com/). 

**The Ship(And it's multiplayer!)** The Ship is an older source engine game where you are trapped on a ship in the middle of the atlantic and are given a target to kill on the ship, you must kill them before they get to you, you get more points if you do it with more unique weapons, all of which are scattered around the ship. The Ship is [$19.99 in the steam store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2400) right now.
The Ship Single player is [$9.99 in the Steam store.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2420/)

**McPixel** Is just a load of WTF for five bucks. It's plenty worthy, especially if you have a lot of time to kill. [Steam store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/220860/)

**Towns** is also a very fun game, you can build your town and community from scratch in a sandbox environment. It's [$14.99 in the steam store right now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221020/) and it's a great indie game to play on a low-end PC.

It was once a treasured game to many, having no paid advantaged in it's closed beta, but Ben Cousins (the former head of BFH) wondered why he wasn't making money and what players were interested in.

It came down to a few things, Paid advantages, and buying weapons permanently with real money. I myself have spent some money, and while I don't feel it was necessarily worth as much as I spent, it was worth the fun I spent on the game.

Anyway, the game received a lack of updates from around mid 2012 to early 2013, until the developers ran out of cash-grabbing ideas, or they finally started listening to the community, and introduced the long awaited meta game. (A map where players fight over territories and earn rewards) they also introduced the claw, a place where play can earn free rewards for doing nothing. Think a claw at your local restaurant, although people still bitch about that.

So yeah, BFH was your epic idea gone to cash grab. And there will be some people here who have played it who may try and turn you away from it, but I highly recommend this game to anyone with a low-end PC looking for a fun time and something to perhaps invest some time/money in the long run.

On a whim, he went out and purchased a PlayStation with a few games. One being Abe's Oddysee. It brought great joy to him and regularly wrote letters to Oddworld. These letters were many pages describing his game playing adventures."" He credited the game with helping him get through a difficult time in his life.

* Sonic Racing Transformed: This is on my Vita, I picked up for cheap. This is quickly one of my favorite kart racers of all time. The only thing holding it back from greatness is the occasional frame rate drop, which I suppose would be fixed on consoles.

I'll let you know now, when I run games on my Windows partition, I have almost no processes running, I even close down explorer.exe, I get my total memory usage down to about 300 or 400 MB, so I doubt it has anything to do with my computer trying to free up RAM for the game.

I have a Macbook from 2009 or so, Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB of Ram (only about 1.76 gb is usable when running Windows), and a Nvideo GeForce 9400M Graphics card (256 MB vram).

I keep my laptop on a cooling tray stand, but I keep the cooling tray's fans off since my framte rate seems worse if anything when I use the cooling tray fans to help cool down the laptop, but the framte rate is better when on top of the stand, plus it's a bit more ergonomic.

&gt;Hello lowend-gamers!

&gt;Many of you have asked for a master list and I thought this would be a fun thing to do. I got the idea from r/boardgames so if any of you visit that subreddit this will be old news.

&gt;Nominate a game. Please search if it has been already nominated.
Then upvote it!

&gt;We will take the top 10 freeware games with the most points/upvotes after a week, and compile them into the Top 10 list. (I plan on checking this on the 22nd) As the title indicates I plan on having this be a seasonal thing as new low-end games become discovered or tastes will change.

&gt;**Rules:**  
                 
1. Please search for the game to see if it is already nominated. If it is not make it a seperate reply

1. Must fit in with the lowendgaming guidelines
 
1. Must be able to be bought somewhere, Retail store, Steam, GoG, Impulse, Origin anywhere, but no freeware

1. No pirated games or abandonware

1. No emulators

&gt;The previous years list can be found in the sidebar

Bastion (sometimes need it windowed for full frame rate)

Cave Story

Dead Pixels

Deus Ex

Far Cry (runs *ok* with view distance way down and medium graphics)

Hotline Miami

Max Payne 1+2

Torchlight

Painkiller Black

So here's what I'm thinking:

The first and probably largest group of low-end gamers are those on sub 500$ laptops/computers that are prebuilts. Their specs usually look something like:

Decent Core 2 Duo - Lowest End i3
1-4gb ram
Intel HD graphics or similar

These games are usually fine with most non-shader heavy 2d games, and any game made on or before 2004.


The second group I think is made up of people with computers that were decent at the time, but heavily aged.

P4/Celeron/etc.
256-1gb ram
Dedicated AGP card


I think the best way to define 'low-end gaming' is to go with the performance of something like the 7600gt, you intersect both groups performance wise with that.",,False,self,t5_2u51f,False,,,True,t3_v5nhr,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowendgaming/comments/v5nhr/what_is_lowend_i_know_this_gets_asked_a_lot_but/,

You can buy it on Steam, or directly from Stardock if you like.

Galactic Civilizations 2: Dread Lords (and its expansions Dark Avatar and Twilight of the Arnor) is a 4X game based in space. Each turn represents a week of in-game time. There are nine empires to choose from, each playing surprisingly differently, and each with their own styles of ships. However, if you don't like the ships the game gives you, you can design your own ships in a very detailed ship-editor. The parts of the ship you can actually see don't really do anything, so you can make your ship as silly or serious as you want without affecting its capabilities, which are affected by certain types of parts (which you can hide if you so choose)

[Europa Universalis 3, Chronicles](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/europa-universalis-iii-chronicles) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/7654/)) with the [Faster Graphics Mod](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?517049-Divine-Wind-faster-graphics-Pack).  Basically, you try to run and expand your country starting from the year 1399 to the mid 1800s.  The game does not have any historical events, so you can get some pretty funny alternate histories.  This is my personal favourite, and probably one of the more accessible Paradox games.  **You might need a forum account to view the mod.**

[Victoria: Complete](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/victoria-complete) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42980/)).  In this game, you run a country though the era of Kings to the 19th century.  While a smaller time frame than Eu3, this game is MUCH more detailed and expansive in how you run your country.  You have different types of population, vote of reforms, manage trading, and overall much more dynamic than running one on Eu3 (for example: making USA a communistic government).  However, it is much more difficult, too.  Histroy-wise, it's much more likely to not get so off track.  Some people prefer this than Victoria 2.

[Hearts of Iron 2](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/hearts-of-iron-ii) ([Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/22130/)).  This game is all about running any country during World War 2.  You manage the flow of resources, pick technologies to research, have some control over changing your government, fine tune units, all that fun stuff.  It is rather Historically accurate, and is really good for ""What if"" scenarios.  Also, you can check out [Arsenal of Democracy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42850/) and [Darkest Hour](http://store.steampowered.com/app/73170/).  They were both made by other people, yet published by Paradox.  Both are based off of HoI, but they each have a few significant differences.  I own Aresenal of Democracy.  I've heard that a lot of people prefer playing these than HoI3.

That should get you started.  If your PC has at least 2Gb Ram, check out Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3, or any other Paradox game.

Admittedly, this is an old game. A very old game. Like, 1997-1998 old. This game isn't played by many, probably peaking out at about 300 people on at one time. It's a game I've played on and off for years, and a game that really needs some new life brought into it. It isn't a big game, nor a difficult game to learn, but it does cost 10$ a month.

It's a completely 2D, MMORPG, with player run Subpaths, events, clans, etc. The max level is 99, and after level 99 you hunt experience to buy stats.

Problems: 

* Cutscenes look like *ass*. They were originally encoded for the first Xbox, and thus are at some ridiculously tiny resolution. Anything above 800x600 will make you notice serious pixels.

* Sensitivity is borked, vertical sens doesn't correctly line up with horizontal. You have to manually edit an .ini file and work out the proper settings per your mouse to get it to work right.

* Video settings are lackluster, have to edit .ini files to properly adjust anything. 

* Story is incomplete. This game almost tanked the publisher because it flopped due to poor reception. Needless to say, they never finished the planned trilogy.

* Epic story 

* Great voice and sound assets

* Decent graphics for the time

* Fun and interesting gameplay

But I've noticed it in Left 4 Dead as well now. The flashlight seems to only light up objects (furniture, people, etc.) but not walls/floors. This is making the game really hard to play, even with max brightness. After some Googling, I've found some people saying it happens on low-end graphics cards, as well as some saying that if you roll-back your graphics drivers it may fix itself. I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with the issue, and a way of fixing it other than ruling back drivers? I have very limited experience with drivers, and would really rather not go that route.

My graphics card is a 256MB GeForce 7300 GT.

Each player gets his own four man squad with which he gets to use tactically. In a game you can expect up to 10v10 (so 10 squads each side) in an Axis vs Allies format on various maps. The game is actually capable of 32v32.

The thing I love most about this game is the fact that as you rank up (from private all the way up to colonel) you actually get more say in how the battle pans out. Once you're a high enough rank you'll eventually be the commanding officer (CO) in your battles. Once you're the CO of your team you decide who goes where and what the battle plan is. This player interaction is what I love most about this game.

I went here to get the info as it is more accurate than what the computer tells me.
http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri

Ok, here's what I can play-

[Silent Hunter 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hunter_III) - My only complaint is that the light reflecting off the ocean is rendered in high detail and there are no options to lower it.  Lags like hell if you go on the bridge or use the external camera above water.  But not really a big deal because it can be played with just the periscope and the navigation and tactical maps.  Aside from that I love it.  Used to play the original all the time when I was a kid and this is simply a great game.  Never played number 2, but I know that the first one was completely 2D, and should work fine with DOSBox.

Dawn of War- All of the first series run alright, Soulstorm is less optimized than the rest but it's still runs ok on low settings.  Also still has an active and very talented modding community.

[Hearts of Iron 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_iron_3) - The latest and most graphically demanding of the series, lags a little bit but definitely still playable.  CPU intensive, lots of calculations going on at once.  A bit grognary but fun if you like stuff like that.  Hearts of Iron 2 has a 2D map instead of 3D and so should run easily on older machines.

[Crusader Kings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_%28video_game%29) - Quite an old game, should have no problems running it.  EXTREME STRATEGY, not for those looking for action.

[Europa Universalis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Universalis_III) - Based on a modified version of the Hearts of Iron 3 engine, lags a bit if you have the time compression on high.  Very fun playing as a country and trying to conquer the world =D  Same as with HOI3, EU 2 has a 2D map and is less graphic intensive.

[Mount and Blade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_and_Blade:_Warband) - Yes, I love Paradox Interactive, why do you ask?  A very unique game, you play in a sandbox world where you can be a merchant and raise shitloads of cash, or you can take the bloody road and slaughter your way to the throne.  Five nations and an RPG leveling up system, dozens of castles and lords to siege and plot against. Full 3D but with great options to lower the quality, give it a try even if you don't think you'll be able to run it, you might be surprised!  

[SPAZ- Space Pirate and Zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies) - Found out about this one on Reddit.  A nice top down space shooter with enough of a skeleton of a plot and enjoyable gameplay to get you to play it at least once.  Sadly, rather graphically intensive.  I can run it on high settings with slight stuttering, but with lots of ships on the screen it can't handle it.  The low settings don't have much of an effect, but it becomes playable with dozens of ships on the map.  If you can run it you'll play it for a while, it's quite fun.

[Starfarer](http://fractalsoftworks.com/) - In Beta currently, but while the campaign sandbox mode is broken, the missions are an interesting mash up of Gratuitous Space Battles and SPAZ.  Not very graphic intensive.   My only gripe is you have to preorder the game- which has been in development for two years...- to play the demo 0.0 ... fortunately there are ways around that :3

Mechcommander 1 and 2 run fine.  [Mechcommander Omnitech](http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?board=210.0) is a free version of the game after the source was released.  However it tends to be pretty buggy, so beware.  I'm pretty sure that Mechcommander Gold was released free too but I can't find info on that at the moment.

Mechwarrior series- MW4 is free but the site distributing it is currently full of dead links and the client to download doesn't even work.  I'm sure there's an .iso and crack laying around somewhere though...

[Blitzkrieg 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg_%28video_game%29) works for me, however the second one threw up some error that I didn't feel like dealing with.  Shame because the demo was fun.  The first is an ok game, but I'd rather play VVvvVV
                                               
[Close Combat series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Combat_%28series%29) - The first Close Combat was released in '96 so I'm sure you'll have no problem running it.  I've played the first four since I was a kid and they never get old.  This is hardcore though, you and your enemies forces are rarely matched, you might have nothing but tanks and the enemy just some half strength rifle squads, or vice-versa.  The units you start the map with are it.  No building new ones, no calling in reinforcements.  You win with well thought out tactics and playing your strengths and your enemies weaknesses.  Realistic weapon modelling and morale- kind of iffy in the first couple of games but by Battle of the Bulge it's quite polished.  Hmmm, I see they've come out with some remakes...

[The Operational Art of War 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Operational_Art_of_War) - Great counter-type good old fashioned wargame.  I remember going into the computer store when I was a kid and drooling over this game.  And all the other games.

Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2.  Yeah.  Great mods too.

Dungeon Siege 1 and 2.



--------------------
Games that DON'T work on my computer :(

Battlefield 2- WHY GOD WHY!?!? D:  Apparently lots of people have issues with this game.  From what I can tell, dual CPUs is the culprit :/ 

Company of Heroes- Now, it *works*, just not playably.  Everything set to low and as long as I don't scroll I have perfect fps... however, as soon as I put my mouse to the edge of the screen and scroll ~5 fps max.  Then I stop scrolling and everything is fine.  Then I scroll and....

Crusader Kings 2- Simply wont initialize.  

I'm sure there's more but my brain is tired now.

It's definitely not the game for you if you are looking for a more realistic round of golf, but with the special shots and clubs to buy it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. Wind, elevation, terrain and terrain angle will all affect your shot so it still keeps a realistic sense to the game.

The courses (quite a selection!) feature many obstacles which will either hinder or help you, there are portals that kind of power the ball forward, usually through a series of them that can get you to the green on a par 5 etc. Usually hitting the first one will send you through them all.

Again, not a simulator and you can definitely see it was originally tailored to the Asian market but it's good fun, especially when you hit your first hole in one!

* Realm of the Mad God - Even this, character keeps moving when I stop pressing the button for ages during multiple enemies on screen.

* Amnesia - Definitely gets laggy.

* Air Conflicts: Secret Wars - I've crashed a few times upon starting because it seems to get jumpy a lot on me.

* Bastion - Somewhat playable, but usually shows me doing fine and then I suddenly have jumped off the edge.

* Limbo - works.
* Super Meat Boy - works (although, it seems others have a smoother time).

I've been having some trouble with some of the games I own, such as GTAIV, Far Cry 3(29- fps, stuttering), Minecraft (29- fps), Dark Souls(14fps). I've also encountered issues with the Source Engine games, especially in Nuclear Dawn and TF2. The strange thing is TF2 used to run very well not very long ago. I tend to run these games at my full resolution (1680x1050) and unfortunately I dislike having the resolution lower than my standard display resolution.



Specs:
OS - Vista Home Premium

Processor - Q8300 2.5ghz

8GB RAM

NVIDIA GeForce GTS450

Running at 1680x1050

I'm no expert but looking at my specs it seems my CPU is the bottleneck. Should I overclock to 3ghz?
Furthermore I may have caused some sort of damage or disruption to my PC as it seemed to be able to work slightly better until last month. The problem is I'm unsure what may have caused it. Any tips on how I can fix whatever it is may have caused it?

**Portability:**

The game can be run from a USB stick (just copy the game folder to a USB stick). Because the game preferences file (D3Prefs.txt) defaults to My Documents\Diablo III\, it is not 'fully' portable. On my machine where the My Documents folder is actually kept on a networked drive, this had to be manually created in order to edit any video preferences.

**Graphics fix:**

I implemented some fixes which I've listed here:

http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Diablo_III#Video_Card_Not_Supported

Because the integrated graphics did not support certain requirements, I needed to implement the HardwareClass fix, as well as use the SwiftShader hack inserted into the Diablo III folder.

**Performance:**

Result was very very poor performance, of less than 5 FPS. Not good enough for 'gameplay', but just about good enough to interact with the Auction House or assign character skills or visit vendors.

first off, we get 2 special presents we have to open first.  My sister gets one, I get one.  My sister opens it, it's a printer.

Mine is a keyboard and mouse.

My mom is processing whats happening, and starts her ugly cry.

Oh yeah, my mom also got one, it was a monitor. One of my two older cousins, who has a mancave and an amazing gaming tower he custom built, says the monitor is better than his own.

My mom is handed the final, and largest, present. It's a computer tower.

It has a terabyte of memory, 4 gigs of ram, forgot the video card, and a quad core processor. 

It's the greatest. i also got a gift card, 50 bucks, usable anywhere, I was planning on getting a new headset, I'm hooked, best Christmas gift ever.


No.

No, no, no.   See, on my way home, since my aunt and uncle live a special little place for older people to live peacefully, there's golf carts and stuff.

Some grandfather was drinking, and let his 4-year old grandchild drive a golf cart. The grandfather was holding the steering wheel, and his phone rang, he let go, and the kid crashed, and our bumper is now hanging off on one side.   Don't ask me how.

We borrowed a car from our aunt and uncle, and our car was towed back to town, we got covered, if it's within 200 miles they tow it without troubles.   

Anyway, I'm talking about all the awesome stuff i'll be able to do on the new computer.

My uncle tells me ""It's just for school stuff.""

School?  A THOUSAND GIGABYTES OF MEMORY, FOR SLIDESHOWS, ESSAYS, AND SMALL MISCELLANEOUS SHIT.    A QUAD CORE PROCESSOR FOR SCHOOLWORK.

I got home, and cried. On the drive home, I argued twice, and how it was unfair. The best game I can play is minecraft, and i get 30 fps if my computer is feeling up to it, on tiny with optifine, animations off, particles off, off off off. low, low low.

I'm crying now. 


I can't fix it, my aunt and uncle bought the tower so they pretty much 
 say what goes, I just.. and my mom's a retard.

She said when I got the steam client, she had 'problems.'  And just all this bullshit that doesn't make sense.


I just.. I...

FUCKING..    I have so much pent up anger, and I just..


I need a fucking hug.
