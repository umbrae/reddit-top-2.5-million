From the five, four receive $5,000 a year for four years, totaling $20,000, and one receives a full ride to any college he/she can get accepted into in the United States. 

I just found out a few hours ago that I am that one! I come from an extremely low income family, and I've always assumed I'd have to rely on scholarships and work to pay for college. Now I can stop worrying! Everything is going to be paid for. I'm hoping to go to Stanford University after I graduate next Spring and go into medicine, particularly the neurological field. 

I'm still trying to wrap my mind around how big this award is, but I simply can't comprehend it. I am so happy!",,False,self,t5_2qh5i,1375304193.0,,,True,t3_1jelju,http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1jelju/i_just_won_a_full_ride_scholarship_to_any_college/,

It came right out of the blue- we thought that she had stomach flu, and took her to the ER for rehydation.  They kept her overnight, and then had some weird results on bloodwork (mainly pregnancy hormones), and when the pediatrician came to see her the next morning the tumour had popped out of wherever it was hiding and she looked about 5 months pregnant.  She had an immediate ultrasound, and although the tech wouldn't say anything, it was pretty easy to see that there were 3 things there that shouldn't be (one large tumour, one very large ovary, and one lymph node). 

We got immediately transferred to an excellent pediatric oncology centre, but because she was so small, and the tumour was so large (it eventually turned out to be the size of a dinner plate), none of the CT scans etc were giving a clear picture of what was going to be involved.  They couldn't do surgery for 3 weeks as they had to stabilize her, but the assumption was that it was likely advanced ovarian cancer, with the strong underlying message that we should probably be starting to think about end-of-life care. 

The surgery was the best day of my life :-)  The surgeon came racing out of the OR, and I've rarely seen a happier man.  They took out the tumour, one ovary/fallopian tube, and one lymph node, and he was very confident that he'd gotten it all, and that she'd be fine.  A few months of chemo, and some recovery time, and she's really never looked back. 

Now all that we have to do is have a yearly 'aftercare' checkup, and yearly nephrology and pulmonary checkups to look for long-term effects of her chemo. So far she's great, and given that it was a germ cell tumour, there's very little chance of a recurrence. 

But I still panic a bit before every checkup, so every time we get the all-clear I just want to have a party :-)

It was a long time coming because we had conflicting dreams down the long run, and our negative traits clashed hard. I have wanderlust and I dream of traveling indefinitely, and my significant other feared change and longed for stability and familiarity. I have been saving up for an RTW trip for 2 years now, and when my SO realized they could not save up enough to go, we broke up.

I'm 25 years old and had to begrudgingly move back home suddenly. Currently sleeping on the couch. Working a dead-end retail job with a college degree. My mother asked me what my goals are, and I sadly said I would probably move to Austin and go to grad school with the money I saved.

She seemed displeased with this answer. Today my father walks in the room and confronts me.
""Your mother tells me you want to move to Austin. Why? How much money do you have saved for your travels?""

""I have around 10K saved, but i'll probably need closer to 15k or 20k. I am not the wistful freshly graduated 23 year old...all my friends are getting married and starting careers. I wonder if I should take the money and go to grad school? Seems like the responsible choice.""

My father shakes his head. ""I'm giving you a couple grand so you can leave by October. Don't shelve your dreams. If you move now, you will never go. When you get back, you will be a better candidate for grad school and you can worry about your future then."" They are very poor, by the way. I make only slightly less than them.

When I got off work, exhausted, I trudged my way to the grocery store, and hauled my groceries up 3 flights of stairs to my apartment.  I cleaned, put away groceries, made dinner, made a turkey breast for lunches, and cleaned again.  I felt unappreciated by everyone.  I had a bath and put myself to bed. 
 
I bought myself some daisies at the grocery store. 
 
This morning I thought, I’m going to bring these daisies into work for my desk.  Mary had wanted some pickles, and Jill wanted some dilly beans, so I brought those too.  I got to the office and placed the pickles on Mary’s desk, and the beans on Jill’s.  I was admiring my flowers and remembered that Jill was back from holidays today.  Her husband quit his job and is attempting a self-employment venture and she’s been really stressed lately.  I thought that it would be nice to put a few stems on her desk.  I got one of those bathroom mouthwash sized cups and put four little blooms on her desk.  Then I thought it would be unfair not to do some for the other clerks.  I figured it would brighten their days too.  So I made them each a little nosegay and placed them on their desks.  I couldn’t leave Kathleen and Vitctoria out, just because they’re lawyers, so I gave them each 4 stems as well in the tiny cups.  
 
All morning I’ve heard “where did these come from?”...“are there some in your office too?”...“flowers!?!” 
 
I’ve made 7 people smile today, with one $9 bouquet of daisies.  And I still have lots left for myself.  Feels good.

I walked with a cane until I finally went to the doctor, and an MRI and a hip arthrogram, and got diagnosed. A month later I got a procedure called a free vascularized fibular graft in which they removed 7 inches of my fibula with the connecting veins and drilled it into my hip, connecting the veins in the process. They said I would be in a wheelchair/unable to walk unassisted for up to a year.

Yesterday I realized I was pretty much just carrying my walker with me, leaning on it but not fully utilizing it. I was unsure if it was safe to try to walk, as too much weight too soon could collapse my hip and completely undo all of the recovery, work, and money put into my surgery. But I decided, hey, if it doesn't hurt using my walker like this, why not try? 

So I did. And I took two steps, holding on to nothing. I have not known that feeling in over six months. Words can not describe how elated that makes me feel. 

Given, I'm not walking more than a few steps every so often (I really don't want to over do it and hurt myself), but I walked. I still have to use my wheelchair on campus and for long distances, but I can walk from my living room to my walker across the room using BOTH LEGS.

Back in the old days when you had to sign a patent application and physically file it an office, you would sign and date it but you would also write where you signed the document. For example, London or Munich or New York. It was important because then it was easier to work out what had happened between the application being finished and being filed.

Since about 2005 everything has been filed online and my dad has been a partner since that time also so it's been pretty challenging for him to lose his job. They kept the old form, but everyone just leaves it blank when asked where it was signed because it doesn't matter anymore, maybe some of the keen interns fill it in but that doesn't matter.

My dad on the other hand has spent 7 years writing ""I love you Jane"" in that space, Jane is my mum and his wife. In 7 years I estimate he's filled out or signed off thousands of patents and most of those will now be kept indefinetly. There is a permanent and hidden record of my dad's love for my mum which will one day be found by someone.

Hi J,

As you may have realised, I’ve been a little pre-occupied of late and caught up in my own little bubble, but that notwithstanding, I’m aware of your project work and obviously discuss with M on a regular basis.

I have to say, I’m very happy with your effort and demonstrated ability so far, I’m just sorry (and a little annoyed) that the training company haven’t already begun to work with you in regards the Apprenticeship.  This seems a little unprofessional on their part as far as I’m concerned.  However, I’ll crack that nut, one way or another, and you’re aware I’m chasing them.

I’ll diarise a more formal face-to-face meeting between you and M and you and I (separately) in respect of an appraisal and to help guide your on-the-job learning as well as consider any concerns or interests you have and want to make known.

In the meantime, this might seem a little ‘unnatural’ or just plain awkward in some sense, depending on your personality, but can I suggest that you perhaps take the odd break from the excellent work you are doing in order to just lean back (or swivel around) and engage a chat about nothing and anything with M, S or J.  You’ve been here long enough now where I would encourage you to try and feel comfortable and part of the team, irrespective of how ‘new’ you may still feel inside.  You’re an active and valuable member of our staff, so do feel free to get to know the other guys that bit better and to open up, share your interests etc. M and I are always talking cars, Formula 1 or something else ‘petrol’ related…let’s find out what your interests are!  Your work so far has earned to right to ‘settle in’ a little more now I feel :)

Good job – keep it up, please.

T.


Fuck. I feel amazing.

Edit: Okay so after many comments here; looks like this wasn't really an e-mail I should be happy about. Sorry for wasting your time.

I joined OkCupid for the laugh, not expecting anything, and ended up talking to a lovely girl and after talking for a few weeks we met for coffee yesterday. It was fantastic. I was expecting a half hour/hour max, and it lasted 3 and a half hours, but felt like 30 mins! She actually looked a lot more attractive in real life, maybe a 9 or 10 in my books, so that was a plus! We talked about everything and anything and there was only one awkward moment which we both laughed at after. 

The best bit was she got a call and was offered a lift home with a friend of hers, but she declined and decided to get later bus which would take twice as long as the lift in a car! 

I got a message off her later that night saying she had a great time and thanks for the coffee, which was unexpected! I'm on such a buzz right now!

She's travelling for the next week, so I am going to try take her out for whiskey when she gets back.. a mutual interest of ours!

In December I was offered a job at a large bank, but the day before I was scheduled to sign official papers, the office called me and told me corporate had moved the location of the job, last minute, and it was a surprise for them too.

Kept my head up and continued my search. Today I was offered a job at a different bank, with much better pay and much more interesting job duties. 

Never give up!

Best part: I don't have to deal with Walmart customers anymore!

For those of you not familiar with the Publix deli, they have a wonderful practice of giving you the first slice of whatever deli item you are getting. Anyway, I'm in line with 6 people ahead of me. The couple ordering deny their slice and the deli man holds it up and says, ""Would anybody like to try a slice of jerk turkey."" I raise my hand and gobble it up happily. They then order their next meat, and again, I end up with the slice.

Then the little old lady next in line gets a few packs of cheese and some deli meat. She doesn't want her slices and again the man asks ""who wants it"". I wait to claim my prize till I'm sure nobody else wants it. After what seems like an eternity I pipe up and say, ""Fine I'll take one for the team"" and again gobble those delicious slices.

At this point everyone starts laughing, and suddenly it becomes almost a game. Every single person in line ahead of me gave me all of their free slices. By the time it was my turn to order, I'd tried 8 deli meats and 6 cheeses, all of which were new to me and all because 6 strangers got a kick out of me stuffing my face.

I'm still beaming from this, it made my day.

TL/DR: 6 strangers let me taste their meat... yea

As I'm walking away from the closed doors, the truck guy asks me what I was looking for. I tell Jim bread, but unfortunately the place is closes.

It didn't say why I owed them money and gave me a number to call if I couldn't afford to pay them in a week.

Well, I was quite worried. I had no idea what it was all about and I was nearly crying. Totally scared shitless. So I give them a call and the conversation went like this;

""You didn't do a tax return for '07-'08, so you shouldn't have gotten your parenting payment, you owe it back.""

""Um, I didn't work...""

""Oh, really? Hang on..."" (I hear her typing)

The lady starts laughing; ""Oh you're gonna love me! You don't owe Centrelink any money.""

""I LOVE YOU!""

""Oh that's not why you'll love me... Centrelink owes *you* money for cutting your payment for the last 3 years. You should have your $6000 paid into your account by Friday.""

I was speechless! This was first time something good had come from me calling Centrelink. I was crying and thanking the lady on the phone. This money will pay for my daughter's up-coming school fees, my partner can finally have the dental work he's long needed and we'll be completely debt free!

Most of my friends have been married, had kids, divorced, on marriage/kids number 2, sometimes divorce number 2, etc.  During the time most people were getting married and having kids, I was entangled in a long, complicated relationship that was good and bad, but ultimately didn't work out, for various reasons, some of which were my fault.  We never fully committed to each other and yet we spent almost 20 years together, mostly living like brother and sister, never feeling that passion. I longed for something more, but felt I had to take care of him.  Finally I told him I couldn't do it anymore, and ended it.  And saying goodbye was the hardest, yet best thing I ever did.  

This year, enter someone who wasn't really new....someone I had known for a very long time.  Someone who had patiently stood by and waited for me to make up my mind to leave.  Someone who wanted to feel passion and love and joy with me, regardless of my issues.  Someone who loved me for me, the good and the bad parts of me, when I was happy and when I was sad.  I finally let that love in, and it was like being reborn.  

I spent so many years thinking I had missed my chance.  This year, I started seeing that at 44, it was not too late to have love and romance, and all the beautiful things others feel. This year has been the happiest year of my life, going from my darkest saddest moments of being alone to my most precious moments of being with someone who truly embraces me and everything I am.  I hardly dared hope for anything more than just one day at a time, being happy and handling all the difficulties of life as they arose.
 
Yesterday was my 45th birthday.  My longtime friend, now my partner and lover, took me up to a park overlooking a bluff in Malibu, just at the edge of a beautiful ocean with the setting sun glinting bright on the water.  All around us were children playing and happy people flying kites...things I always felt remote from, things I always felt I missed. He gave me a big box, wrapped up like a present.  I unwrapped and unwrapped and unwrapped and finally came to a tiny box....with a ring inside. I burst into tears as he looked into my eyes and asked me to marry him, because he wanted to be with me forever.

It is not too late. It is only the beginning.  If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.  It is more than just a ring and a promise.  It is light breaking through the clouds, after a long and perilous storm, and knowing I have another day--another precious opportunity to make my life as good or bad as I want to. 

The real world will make this feeling fade, and we will go through good times and bad times like everyone else, but this memory will always be mine. Thank you for sharing my happiness.

I never understood how to keep up with the demands of life, I have no fucking energy.  10 or so years of this later, turns out I'm probably just a narcoleptic.  All my symptoms check out, just have to do a sleep study to confirm.

I thought I was just a huge klutz, and that's why I randomly fall and drop things.  Turns out this is just called cataplexy, which is a symptom of narcolepsy.  Happens when your muscles become temporarily paralyzed during the day, usually following strong emotions.

I thought my immune system just sucked, but never knew why.  I didn't know why when I got something normal, why the fuck my symptoms were so bad.  Turns out It was discovered in 2009, narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090503132613.htm.
Edit on this point, I misunderstood how autoimmune disorders work.  What it is narcoleptics don't get the deep sleep people need to heal their body, it's why I get very sick when I do get sick and my body takes a long time to heal.  A simple scratch can take up to a week to heal on my body, don't know exactly what is normal, but yeah.  I also scar extremely easily.

And them of course the constant questions from doctors or friends of why I've been on a low dose of adderral for the last 10 years when I don't really have ADHD.  My response has always been because I have no energy without it.  Turns out adderral is a medication used to treat narcolepsy.  However, not great for long term, so will probably be taking something else soon.

I am happy, so happy.  I feel really strange though.  I don't fail as a person (like I've thought for so long), I just have something wrong with me neurologically, and thats ok!

When the breakup happened, my grandfather had just died, I was incredibly depressed, and I realized that not only had I not finished my college degree (18 hours left after my medical withdrawal), I'd lost touch with all my friends, gained a ton of weight, and was barely squeaking by financially as a freelance designer.

This weekend, I'm celebrating my 25th birthday -- 3 years cancer-free, single with a sense of self-confidence I've never felt before, and I'll be with an amazing group of new friends who've loved me for who I am and have been a major reason why I am the incredibly happy woman I am today.

On top of all of that, I've lost 65 lbs (and counting!) this year, I'm just starting to get back into dating after a self-imposed moratorium, and I've finally figured out that I really enjoy helping older people, so I'm currently launching my career helping seniors and the disabled with technology -- and it's looking really good. :)

I'm still broke as hell and trying to save up to get back to school to finish my degree, but last December I could have never seen myself in this position: healthy, happy, surrounded by amazing friends, and finally with a real sense of purpose in life.

So, just a reminder: When you've hit the bottom and can't imagine a way out, that's when you have your greatest opportunity to reflect and realize what really matters in life.

Unemployment lead to being unable to pay a lot of credit card bills and ending up in collections. Already being bipolar, this sent me spiraling downwards for a long time. 

3 years ago I began my job as a software tester at a less-than-awesome pay, and ended up moving in with my much-less-than-awesome boyfriend (poor judgement on my part, probably stemming from the fact I was still horribly depressed). 

2 years ago I got a raise (to the point I could at least afford a small place by myself), and was able to leave the boyfriend, and sublet from a friend for the remainder of his lease. After his lease was up the only way I could qualify for a place of my own was by getting my mother to cosign for me.

Fast-forward to today. My credit is back to ""Fair"" from being *very* ""Poor"". I have two years of good rental history under my belt, and have advanced to Junior Software Developer. And finally - FINALLY - at 29, I have been approved for my own apartment, without any help from outside sources, in a nice part of town.

For the first time, I feel 100% self sufficient. I feel whole again. I can't even express the joy this brings me, but [this image comes close](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vIzhxpRh8ZE/Ts0IoVNIs9I/AAAAAAAAA5w/zieqIWM4S30/s300/tumblr_lucsp2zduw1qfasc6.gif)!

Dear [stevethepirate],
 
This note contains a brief summary of your classmates' and my feedback to your class presentation. It is my hope you will find ways to use this feedback to further hone your presentation and communication skills, so that they can be stronger and stronger assets in all your future paths of life. 
 
The great majority of your classmates evaluated your presentation as ""excellent""; a few classmates evaluated it as ""very good"". My evaluation of your presentation was ""excellent"" and your score on the presentation turns out to be 120/120. I very much appreciated your sense of confidence, your preparedness, your ability to think while you spoke, your clear awareness you were speaking to an audience. I would dare saying you seemed a ""natural teacher"" to me (some of your classmates said that too). All the basics of an excellent presentation were there, and I was very happy to see that: it's the time I have seen you present at your best. So I don't have much to say in terms of improvements for your future presentations. Only refinements: try to project your voice a bit more towards the audience, and make sure you give the audience enough background or framework of reference so that everybody can follow your line of thought. You have clearly thought about your topic quite a bit... most of the other people had never thought or even heard of it before. Try to keep that in mind when you decide how to present a topic you researched.

Thanks for your excellent work. I hope you find this feedback useful and supportive.

Yesterday I had a job interview for a position I really wanted. It's in a neighboring state, and I felt like it would be a good opportunity to 'start fresh,' because right now I am living in the same exact town I've lived in my entire life. I really wanted to get a job somewhere close but different so I could move to a new place and really start to explore a new community, without all the baggage that builds up in the place you've grown up. The job sounded really interesting, it was relevant to my interests, and it was in a small office environment - something I haven't been able to experience yet but really wanted to. To top it all off they were offering a higher salary that was actually enough to make a living on and pay all my bills!

Well I went to the interview yesterday and thought I did ok, but not great. I was really unsure about it and ended up drinking last night to take my mind off it. I convinced myself there was no way I had the job and resigned myself to my fate.

Imagine my surprise when around 1pm today the recruiter called, told me they had an EXTREMELY positive reaction to my interview, they were able to offer enough to make relocating worth it, and I start in 13 (business) days!!! I am so happy and overwhelmed and excited! I really didn't think I was going to get this opportunity but I wanted it so bad...AND I GOT IT!!! Yay!

I told her a few weeks ago, before I made it ""official,"" that I didn't think we were on the same page emotionally.

""What page are you on?"" she asked me. I hesitated, struggling to find the words without making myself completely vulnerable in case she didn't feel the same way.

""Well,"" I began. ""Mathematically speaking-"" Oh, God, I'm an idiot -""how much I care for you is increasing in a linear fashion."" I put my left arm up diagonally to indicate the increase in slope. I was too far into the analogy to turn back now.

""And if it keeps increasing at this rate, I think we can go very far and last very long."" There. I said it. Kind of.

She paused for a moment before asking me, ""How long?""

At this point, I knew no fear because I was sure of what I needed to say.

""I could see us lasting forever. I am for real, and this is real. And I love you.""

I don't remember if there was an actual pause here or not, but it felt like a million years before she replied.

""Then we're on the same page.""

Love feels like a drug. It is uplifting, in and of itself a different reality. I was always fairly cynical, or ""realistic"" as I called myself, when it came to romance and all this stuff. 8 billion people on the planet and you expect me to believe there's only one other person for me? Yeah, okay.

But when she told me we were soulmates, I didn't think to myself, ""We're too young to find our soulmates already."" I thought instead, ""Wow, how lucky am I to find my soulmate at such a young age?""

It's cheesy, I suppose, and I hate to gush. I wish I could say I'm not trying to convince you that true love exists, but I can't. You need to know. I found it. I didn't fall in love with her. I was always in love with her. It was always there, and I only discovered it. I've found the ultimate treasure, the meaning of life, the fountain of youth, the everything and end-all.

I was annoyed about it for many reasons (that are unimportant to this story), so I was already grumpy. 

When it came time for dinner, my 2 1/2 year old was already a bit wrecked (it was late for him) as was my 6 month old. The baby got mad and decided she wanted to eat with everyone, so instead of eating, I was feeding her (at the table). 

As I was grumpily (an maybe immaturely) grumbling to myself that no one cared that I hadn't eaten yet, my son said, ""Mommy, I wanna see it,"" and pointed to my empty salad bowl. I showed him. He then looked at my sister, who had been serving food to everyone else (she cooked) and said, ""Auntie Missa, my mommy wants food!"" 

At that moment, my family realized I hadn't eaten anything, even though they were almost finished. It was so sweet and it turned my whole mood around. I stopped being grumpy and immature and actually enjoyed myself. 

It made me so happy to have such a thoughtful and caring little boy, and it made me realize what was actually important. He helped me enjoy my family when I was being too stubborn to figure it out myself. He also made me feel appreciated in a day I had felt the opposite all day.

I posted this yesterday in /r/self, but someone suggested I should post it here as well, since I am, in fact, rather happy! :-)

I've never been able to see out of my left eye, I had extremely bad kerotoconus (damaged cornea, which refracted light the wrong way). I could kind of see motion/blur, but that's about it. 19 months ago, I had a corneal transplant (awesome picture of my eye at that point here: http://imgur.com/WEBZM) to give me a dead person's eye (well, cornea).

Yesterday, I had my final (barring checkups) appointment with my eye surgeon, and he took out the last two removable stitches from my transplanted cornea (a few will remain in the eye forever, or at least until they degrade). The vision will make final improvements over the next few weeks, but immediately after taking them out and putting on some glasses - I can see! For the first time in my life, I have (mostly) clear vision out of my left eye. It's incredible, I rang my wife in tears because I actually saw what my surgeons face looked like properly for the first time (my ""good"" eye isn't great either, that's next). My daughter is almost 5 and I've never really seen her face clearly, but when I picked her up from Kindy last night, I could recognise her from across the room. She's gorgeous! It's hard to explain - for my entire life, everything has had a ""fuzzy"" edge, but now things have defined edges. It's mind-blowing and weird - everything looks so strange because I'm seeing in 3D for the first time ever. This is what depth-perception looks like!

Fucking awesome.

I was an examination room by the time I heard a crying little girl, couldn't have been older than 3. She had her mother and younger (toddler) brother with her. I was waiting for the doctor,and could hear her mother across the hall explaining that the doctor would be there soon, that there were other people ahead of her. I knew I was the only other patient left, so I opened the door and explained to the mother that I didn't mind if the doctor saw her daughter first. She very graciously thanked me. Meanwhile, the little boy spots me and decides he's going to come hang out with me. I said hello and told him he had to go stick with Mom, and turned him around 180 :P  
  
When the doctor came by before he introduced himself I explained that the little one across the hall could probably use his help sooner than I could, if that was OK with him. Spoiler alert, he was fine with it.

5. ...and I want to spend the rest of my life...

We're going to go for a walk around the city to take pictures and then out to dinner.  I think before we go to dinner I'm going to take her to a little park/fountain area we like to relax and people watch at and tell her to check the camera and see if we got any good pictures.  When she scrolls through, hopefully she reads the message.  

Sadly the pictures didn't come out that great (I was in somewhat of a rush to get the pictures taken before she got home from work) and I have no skills with photoshop... but it's not that big of a deal.  At first I wanted to try to photoshop myself into interesting places with the signs... but realized I just don't have the required skill set.  Either way I'm really happy and wanted to share.  

Thanks for listening Reddit (or not... either way). 
__________________________________________________________

EDIT:  Thank you guys for all your support and suggestions.  Tonight was absolutely one of the greatest nights of my life and everything went EXACTLY as planned.  It literally could not have been more perfect.  The weather was beautiful and I got to propose just as the sun was setting.  She was sitting on the bench just outside the park/fountain... I gave her the camera and told her to scroll to the right... bent down to 'tie my shoe' prepped the ring and waited... she cried a little... but mostly just laughed.  

Thank you reddit... first for giving a shit... and second for letting me unload some of my excitement before actually proposing.  It was an amazing feeling to be able to share it with you guys (albeit complete strangers). 


EDIT 2:  She REALLY liked the ""Annoying the shit out of you"" picture.

I'm surprised at my own ability to keep a conversation going for this long with a person I barely know, and it feels awesome. And of course the fact that she's an absolutely stunning, and great, girl only helps improve my happiness.

I had a good job in SF for awhile, but it was seasonal and then it ended, and my commute was 2 hours each way, which was killing me. I used my savings to move into San Francisco proper with my boyfriend, but I've been watching my savings dwindle for rent and I couldn't get any kind of job. My parents were willing to help me out with this month's rent because they know I've been busting my ass trying to find a job and it's just a tough as hell market for new grads. But I felt guilty relying on them for help and want to be self-sufficient as soon as I can.

Well, I finally got a job offer today! It's part time, but pays enough to make the rent, working at the gift store of a world class museum. My work is divided into three 8 hour shifts, which means I can use my days off to do an unpaid internship at a nonprofit - nonprofit administration is my ultimate career goal. Now I can pay my bills AND get experience in my dream field of work! This is the best possible resolution and I'm so excited! I'm going to go grocery shopping, good and proper, for the first time since we moved. Huevos con chorizo for breakfast, lunch, and dinner no more!! (Unless I want to. It *is* delicious.)

**Edit**: I had a request for details of how it happened, so here's the story. I've known Isabelle since we were both much younger, but we only got to know each other properly at the 2009 new year's eve party. We got on like a charm (except for her Twilight obsession, which I can grant her considering practically every other aspect of her is wondrous. She dances in museums and laughs with her whole body — I hope that explains what I mean).

I know a few other girls who I had a major crush on but got into the ""friend zone"" and couldn't pull my way out, and I desperately didn't want that to happen with Isabelle. Because of this, I kept my distance and completely over-thought everything. Bad move. This distance made me lose interest in pursuing anything, and I sank deeper into depression. 11 whole fucking months later, I still hadn't done anything and was totally miserable. I decided that if I wanted to make things happen in life, that this would be a good place to start.

I knew she was at least vaguely interested and could stand the sight of me, so I called her up and we went for a walk. We were playing Pooh sticks on this bridge over a stream and I had just said something that made her laugh, and so I just went for it.

I'm not a big impulse shopper. I stick to the list for the most part. I'm consistent and usually only grab something on sale if it is something I would normally get anyways.  

But if I decide that I'd like to have ham today, then ham goes on the list. 

When I first saw my friends post about hamburger I snorted. Then I paused and remembered back to college days in the early 90's through 2003 when I wasn't making good money. I ate a lot of ramen noodles, wieners, and dried veggies. 

It was a humbling moment. I'm doing very well today. Got a lot to be thankful for.

Seems my second choice college appreciated my extra efforts and motivation and they decided to accept me to their nursing program for next fall!

While my friends have gotten accepted and haven't celebrated much, I've spent my entire day in awe of the fact that I'm actually going to college. After being rejected once, I was sure I was going to have to attend community college for a year and transfer, but I'm in! I don't think anybody - family or friend - realizes how much this opportunity means to me. I intend to make the best of this. 

""Congratulations on your acceptance"" are the most beautiful words and they have given me hope. If I can get into this college, why can't I get into my top choice? That acceptance/rejection letter is expected in 1-2 weeks. I have an excellent college that I love and would be ecstatic to attend if my top choice doesn't accept me, so I'm completely tranquil for the first time in a year!

Being able to stretch out diagonally in bed for a week has been nice, as has being able to listen to the radio as I drift off. But it doesn't beat sleeping next to the man I love.  

Today, he comes home!  He's actually on an airplane **right now** winging his way west.  I get off work at 7 pm, and I get to head straight to the airport to pick him up.

Two guys live there. One guy has severe mental problems (thinks he's a little girl? - clip-on pigtails, dresses, and most notably, a pacifier around his neck). He also has tourette's and grunts. All. Night. Long. Even with the windows closed, he keeps me up unless I put on headphones. Banging and crashing doing God knows what and he'll open the door and grunt for a minute, then close the door. Then turn the lights on and off for 5 minutes. I've seen him push a stroller full of random crap around.

Other guy starts drinking at noon every day in the backyard with 2-4 other people. By 4, they're usually arguing over how many beers they had. For someone in recovery that works from home, this sucks. You'd think it's help, but when I hear those beers crack, I instantly want to drink. This is compounded by their loud arguments. 

Every day, they have a yard sale and sell all these weird toys Grunty plays with. Barbie cars, carseats, random crappy furniture. That way, Drinky has money to get fucked up. I shudder to think what the inside of their house looked like...

So Grunty gets out the other night and I hear him, grunting away on the other side of town. He's gone the next day.

Drunken ramblings tell me that Drinky is being paid to take care of Grunty (hence, the pacifier. nice, right?). But it's cool cause Drinky makes sure Grunty eats. Drinky doesn't understand what he did wrong and is pissed because he can't afford to stay there now.

Not only is it awesome Drinky is leaving, but Grunty will be getting the help he needs. I was about to call social services because it seems obvious that Grunty either needs medication or 24-hour care. So in addition to the bizarre behavior, it was upsetting to think that this guy has to live like that.

Bad neighbors are a dime a dozen, but these 2 took the cake. Hard to ignore and emotionally exhausting. SOOOOOOOO happy!!!!

For those of you who were born to miserable families, I'm sorry.  For those of you who think man is born inherently evil, I'm sorry.  For others who have lost faith in humanity, I'm sorry.  I wish my grandma was your grandma - you'd have a different outlook on life.

This woman would make all of you cry with her beauty.  She would slaughter your face with kindness.  If she faced the Pope in a peace-off, that motherfucker would lose in a heartbeat.  Cats would cross the street just to walk beside her.

There was never a more generous or nice woman ever invented.  If Mother Theresa had met my grandma, she'd cry at what a failure her own life was, and probably run to confession.  My grandma was the best.  

There are angels that walk among us, and my grandma was one of them.  I loved her.

(i dont know why i'm posting this in happy, when i am so sad... but my grandma would probably prefer to be in happy, as opposed to science, or wtf, or shitty facebook or twitter)

She didn't get off work until 5, so she came home and opened the package to check it out.  Sadly the glasses were cracked and Christmas is only a few days away, oh no!  She started crying because the gift was supposed to be for her dad and she was worried that she wouldn't have a gift for him on Christmas.  I gave her a hug and told her that I would take care of everything.

This morning I called Think Geeks customer service line and pressed 4 for a return.  I explained to the first guy (Travis I believe) that I had received a damaged product, and he IMMEDIATELY transfered me to a second level representative.  The second level rep. apologized for the damaged product and offered to ship one out right away.

Rep: ""I'll ship the replacement out for you today""

Me: ""Oh great..... but we are leaving tomorrow to go back home for the holidays, we won't be here to receive it""

Rep: ""Well how about you just give me the address of the place you will be at and I will ship it there?""

Me: ""That would be great! &lt;gives address&gt;""

Rep: ""And it looks like Christmas is coming soon, so I'll 2-day it for you""

Me: ""Is that going to cost more?""

Rep: ""No, we'll take care of it.  Have a nice day!""

Now her dad will have his present in time for Christmas!

I did go to the gym, but It was on and off. It all really changed when I was introduced to my current girlfriend. She has had such an amazing impact on me and the best part is she doesn't even really know how much of an impact it really was.

When I first started dating her I started getting my act toget*her in school. I brought my abysmal 2.1 GPA up to a 3.6 GPA in the matter of just a year. Now the school of my dreams doesn't even look like it may be a dream anymore :D

Since around the beginning of the 2012 I've lost around 60 pounds, and a lot of that weight was due to me finally hitting the gym and seriously putting the time and effort into working out.

She loved the potato pancakes we made), and that was easily the best time I've had in a very long time.

Now on to this weekend. A couple months ago we were sitting at home watching The Lion King with a friend of hers and I asked her if she ever went to see the Broadway play. She always wanted to go, but the tickets are expensive and was unable to afford it. 

I saved up a couple pay checks and decided to take her out to see it last weekend. We had decent seats, but the most important thing was the fact she loved every second of it. Her year was made in that single day, I'm sure of it.

Getting older is awesome.,228,35,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1ct1al/i_made_it_to_30_getting_older_is_awesome/,"So, I apologize if this paints a depressing picture (silver lining and all, feel free to remove if this bums you out too much), but I had a very tough life, and I've been chemically sober for about a year and a half now. Before that, I was doing drugs. A lot of hard drugs. I passed up great opportunities to do what I loved (music), and I lost most of the friends that I held dear to my heart. I ruined chances at having great relationships, pushed people away, and even when sober, lost a girl I really fell in love with for the first time in....pff not sure I ever loved a S/O that much before.  It's been tough.

I'm here to say that no matter how many struggles I've had in life, I'm pushing on, and I've truly adopted a better way of thinking through HARD mental self-work. It's such a reward. Looking back at everything, and not letting it determine my future, but instead making me appreciate still being here, which in turn motivates me to get on with the B.S. and do what makes me happy, no matter at what age, or to what societal concepts tell me I should do.

There was a time, not all that long ago, when I didn't think I'd even make it 30. And I'm here. Whether I live another year, or 50 more, I'm happy that I made it. So now it's time to end this rant so I can get on with my day and live life, but I just wanted to share. I'm happy! And to anyone who's made it this far, be happy for that. 

Getting old is awesome! (lulz)

This last year, my life's been pretty weird. Not bad, or fucked up, just boring and a little weird. Unemployed, no school, no love life... You get it. 

Let's start from the beginning of this wonderful week, which strangely enough was last week. I've been in a choir for a year now, and I've never quite gotten close to anyone else there. They've been nice enough, but older than me and I felt like I didn't quite fit in. Last week however, we went on a trip with the choir and it was amazing. Concerts, pub nights, boardgames... Everything just felt right, and all the people were great! I feel like I've made friends with most of them by now. 

There was choir practice Monday, and for once I felt that I belonged. Both personally, and skill-wise. I managed to ace the a vista read (singing from sheetmusic you haven't seen before), and my range was proper for once. 

Tuesday, I managed to catch an opera I've wanted to see for free. I asked a girl there, but she said no as she didn't have the time. She said she'd love to do something someday, though! So now we're trying to find time for coffee some day next week. 

And the biggest thing of all: today I was informed that I've been accepted to the school of my choice! After a week of worrying over my future, I can finally say that I'll be studying musical composition in pursuit of my dream of being a conductor. 

Tomorrow, I'm going to go jam with some people I don't know, since they needed a mandolin-player in their band. They've got both a gig and a recording-session coming up, so I'm psyched!

In November, I moved to a different state due to a job transfer, and met a wonderful man. I've never been treated so well in my life. At first, it scared me, because I didn't know how to handle it. I shook off the fear and learned to embrace the happiness he brings to my life.

I was a pack a day smoker for 18 years. A little over a week ago, I bought a personal vaporizer (aka. electronic cigarette or e-cigarette). I enjoyed it so much that after two days I just stopped smoking cigarettes. I didn't even have to make an effort. I had no withdrawals and the cravings for cigarettes are completely gone now. 

Over the next few months I plan to slowly cut the nicotine out of my vapor juice and get to the point where I'm just inhaling tasty water vapor.

Anyone who's thinking about quitting smoking and trying a PV (personal vaporizer) should head to e-cigarette-forum.com and check out [The Wonderful World of Vaping](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/ecf-library/) series of posts. There are lots of friendly people there that helped me immensely in making the transition from smoking to vaping.

Edit 2: Some people apparently think this is spam. No where have I posted a link to buy *anything*. In my long reply to mookieXL, I specifically stated that I would *not* post the link to a supplier offering a heavy discount, because I don't want anyone to think I'm trying to pull a fast one. The models of vaporizers I suggested to mookieXL are sold by hundreds of suppliers. I am not one of them. The link above to The Wonderful World of Vaping goes to a discussion forum.

Usually I don’t tell my employers about my personal issues, but I feel it is necessary in this case.

I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it before, but I have bipolar disorder. And, since I have never had insurance before now, It’s been left mostly untreated. I have been self-medicating through street drugs and over the counter medication. Obviously, this is a piss-poor way to manage a mental disorder, but I’ve had very little recourse in the past.

Now that I have insurance, I decided I’d like to clean up my act and get real treatment for this. I’ve quit all medications to clean out my system, and I’ve scheduled blood tests and doctors appointments.

Unfortunately, I was severely unprepared for the effects of my untreated manic and depressive phases. I’ve also been having some rather severe withdrawal symptoms. Couple all that with the stress of losing my wallet and keys, and you can probably see what’s been going on.

I’ve been leaving early for the last little while. I haven’t been eating or sleeping well for the last couple weeks. When I had my blood drawn for tests yesterday, something snapped.

I had an extreme panic attack yesterday and ran home. Literally, I ran the entire way home. I have no memory of it, but my neighbors told me I was incoherent and babbling. I’ve never had a manic episode that extreme before, which is why I’m bringing all this up now.

I’ve been preparing for some extreme behavior by setting up ways I can work from home, and creating a list of excuses, so I could hopefully just ride through it until I got my treatment under way.  But there was nothing that could prepare me for the extreme mania I felt yesterday.

I felt it would be best to get the entire truth out there. I love my job here, and I finally feel secure enough in my life to try and get clean and get my bipolar taken care of. So far I’ve set up enough fail-over systems and practices that it hasn’t affected my work, and I don’t plan on letting it. But after yesterday, I am not sure how bad things may get.

I’ll be seeing a doctor on Monday. Hopefully none of this will last more than a week or two longer.

Thanks,
Keene Maverick

He just responded:


Thanks for the explanation and mainly for finally making the choice to treat something that would otherwise haunt you.  There is no reason to ashamed or embarrassed at all and hope you do not feel that way.

We will support you as best we can with this transition/titration to steady medication regimen to help you function and be effective.

Work with &lt;&lt;other boss&gt;&gt; on any specifics of ensuring that you have what is needed to work between home and the office the next few weeks, meaning some time here and some at home.  

Thanks for all your doing and also for being so candid with us as to your situation.  It will work out just fine, myself and family have enough medical/mental issues to keep most Pharma’s in business for centuries :)

Take care pal.

And on top of that, he's offered to pay 100% of my insurance costs.

TL;DR: I told my boss I did drugs and am trying to quit, he told me to start working half weeks at home until I'm better.
