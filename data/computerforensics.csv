From the article:

&gt;Johnson testified that he found two attempts to delete data on Manning’s laptop. Sometime in January 2010, the computer’s OS was re-installed, deleting information prior to that time. Then, on or around Jan. 31, someone attempted to erase the drive by doing what’s called a “zerofill” — a process of overwriting data with zeroes. Whoever initiated the process chose an option for overwriting the data 35 times — a high-security option that results in thorough deletion — but that operation was canceled. Later, the operation was initiated again, but the person chose the option to overwrite the information only once — a much less secure and less thorough option.

&gt;All the data that Johnson was able to retrieve from un-allocated space came after that overwrite, he said.

How likely is this?  I am new to this subreddit but I thought that a 1 pass zero wipe was good enough to prevent just about any document recovery.

I just want to thank the contributors to the subreddit, I know it can be a little slow at times - some of it due to the flow of new subject matter and other times due to momentum in lack of activity. But for the most part the subreddit is slowly starting to come alive and with a growing subreddit comes guidelines for submissions. As of right now there isn't a hard restraint on submissions, as long as it caters to the subject matter. Currently we will be working on a more formal guideline to submissions for better organization of content. But for the time being it's kind of a wild west in this subreddit until things become defined.

When you find them, they are often built in a lab and are missing that 'real-world' feel. We need more of them if we want to figure out how file systems work in the real world, how mainstream applications affect a system, carving, scripting, Tor, etc, and what random malicious activity really looks like. It's easy if you focus on a specific malware and infect a VM or media. The real world is different. You don't really know what is out there some times. When you're forensically investigating something, you don't usually have a starting place. 

So i'm testing a theory. I purchased a prepaid android phone with 1 month of service. I created a fake person and joined all the social networks i could think of. I downloaded packet capture software and have it constantly running. I'm geo-tagging everything, capturing all cell towers i touch, war-driving, etc. I'm also clicking on every link imaginable. I have even mailed it to a friend that will use it and s/he will mail it to another friend later. Maybe i'll even buy a prepaid credit/debit card and buy stuff with it (bitcoins?, etc). By the end of the month we should have one **dirty** android. 

My plan is to forensically image it and make it available on [CyFor](http://cyfor.isis.poly.edu). I'll probably provide a few versions (like one with some deleted files, another with the device set back to factory settings, etc) I will try to do this with other devices too if i can round up the funds. I will then donate it to the [ISIS](http://sites.isis.poly.edu/) lab for hopefully more security research. 

Here is what I need: 

Put me on dirty mailing lists
Email me malicious links
Find me on social networks and interact with me (You should know that since it will be **publicly** available, so will your data ....so **BEWARE**)

I've been looking for a career change for a while, and nothing seems to fit me, until I discovered computer forensics. The idea of LE investigations, being an expert witness, and recovering data seems so right for me.

I graduated from university with a degree in computer information systems, and the very next semester, a security and forensics curriculum was introduced, so I wasn't exposed to it until afterwards.

I will have the ACE cert next week-ish. I am trying to work out any possible way to pursue the EnCE, but those classes are expensive for me. I have also been looking into the GCFE, although it seem less sought after then EnCE. I am going to apply for security clearance(s), as I've seen they look good to hiring managers in this field. My current job requires me to be very meticulous, and document everything I do.

If anyone is willing to mentor me while I learn, that would be super helpful, I've been scouring the web for every bit of information I can find, and creating a library of links and software to play with. I am very hungry for this, and I'm committed to making my dream a reality, I'm just wrestling with the best approach.",,False,self,t5_2rubs,False,,,True,t3_1d73ue,http://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/1d73ue/looking_to_dive_into_digital_forensics_need/,

Recently, I've become interested in Digital Forensics, especially after the [[Digital Forensics AMA]](http://redd.it/kzdgt)

That said, I have some questions regarding this field::

* What type of degree/cert is needed in order to work in the Digital Forensics field? 

* Is a degree 100% necessary or would a certification suffice at least for an entry level position?

* Are there any good online institutions/universities that I should consider? (So far, Champlain College seems to have a reputable online degree program -- I live in Colorado, that's why I'm looking for an online institution)

* What type of companies should I look at for an entry level position?

* What would be the best companies to shadow? Or who would be the best person to talk to in my local area?

I do always know the system passwords and, for the routine, I could probably find another Mac, boot it up and run the built-in tools for ""unlocking"".

Here we go again!  Dan xxxx is turning in invoices for unapproved purchases.  Some of you may know that he and his wife had the same problem at xxx (proven untrue allegations, probably by the same person).  I think that every item on those invoices should be lined up and accounted for because Dan has a way of pocketing other peoples money.  He knows the vendors and he gets them to write an invoice for something different than was actually purchased.  That is just one of his many scams.  Regardless, we have a xxxx Club for a reason, and they are not doing their job if they pay these invoices without demanding physical proof!  If Dan xxxx is allowed to continue to ""not follow the rules"", we could risk losing our 501 (3) (c) status.  Shame on you Coach xxxxx for continuing to protect this guy and being a part of this too.  I am asking that someone please step in.
Regards,
xxx Father, Taxpayer, xxxx Club Member


Dan is the best guy in the world. He and his family do nothing but donate 40+ hours a week to help our kid's program. The allegations are completely fictitious and actually impossible to even happen.

if i select one line of garbage text another line somewhere lower in the document also gets selected the characters that get selected are an exact copy, also probability wise (not 100% sure about this but it seems logical) if it were junk characters due to a segment of the file being corrupt the characters should occur at random i.e. an exact copy of the garbage string in two places seems to be the output of a logical process

We are the 3rd-party IT consultants a company hires when they don't want to or can't hire someone in-house. We manage servers, workstations, mobile devices, websites... whatever they pay us to manage, basically.

Yesterday a client called to inform us that someone had transferred a large amount of money out of their corporate bank account. A *large* amount. The employee who had allegedly sent the email authorizing the transfer was on vacation at the time this happened. The email came from her account. She denies any involvement.

The client's Exchange is hosted by a 3rd-party company who claim that they did not have logging turned up high enough to tell where the account login came from - so we can't get an IP address that way. We have the sent message apparently (I haven't seen it). A virus scan on the user's workstation reveals a trojan (SHeur3.CMZF if that means anything to anyone).

I have been tasked with examining the logs on the domain controller for logon/logoff events using her credentials (I haven't started yet so I don't know if we're logging successes or even failures); examining the workstation logs to see if we can tell when the machine was powered on/off during the employee's vacation (she claims she powered it off prior to leaving several days before the incident); and basically just looking around for any other clues. I may have to speak with the police about this when they begin their investigation.

We haven't quarantined the workstation yet by the way, my boss says it's because we don't have a reason to yet.

So what else should I look for? What else can I do? This is a Windows environment by the way. I'm your basic network admin ""jack-of-all-trades"" type, I can pull the logs but I've never done anything like this before (although it sure seems like a hell of a lot of fun).

tl;dr - Need suggestions, advice, critiques on building an at-home digital forensics lab.  

I'm building out a plan for an at-home digital forensics lab so I can tinker in my free time.  I have a general forensics degree but not much digital forensics experience so I thought this would be a good way to be able to walk the digital forensics walk when I have to (some day).  

I think I already have 3/4 of the equipment I need here at home, but was looking for some input from those who have been doing this for longer than 120 credit hours before I start dropping time and money on half-baked ideas.

Tentative lab requirements:

* 1 x Windows primary computer for exploitation - Will have the primary software tools like EnCase, FTK, ProDiscover, etc.
* 1 x Windows sandbox machine - Needs to be ""disposable"" in that I have to be prepared to rebuild for clean-slate purposes
* 1 x Unix/Linux machine - For NetSec study and analysis.  I've been trolling my local craigslist for cheap desktops.
* 1 x Mac machine - For Mac/Apple exposure.  Using this to type this post now.
* 1 x Mobile device - I have an old Droid X smart phone I'm thinking about using for this

These ideas are just a little more than throwing things against the wall and seeing what sticks.  I'm looking for advice and suggestions or even descriptions of what you may already have at home so I can compare myself.  Not looking for state-of-the-art LE lab level stuff, just basic capabilities to practice and hone my skills.  


**16 August 2013 EDIT:**

I purchased a small Ubuntu machine with 8GB RAM and 500GB HDD, which brings my at-home lab platforms to 

* 1 x Mac machine (8GB RAM, 2.4 GHz Intel core 2 duo) - Already had
* 1 x Win 7 laptop (4GB RAM, AMD Turion dual core 1.5 GHz) - Already had
* 1 x Linux machine (8GB RAM, Pentium 2 x 2.3 GHz) - Purchased on the cheap

One of these machines (probably the Mac) will get VMWare so I can set up several instances of various OSes and environments.  The Ubuntu box will be where the webserver and programming environment go and where I exercise my network security muscle.

I was wondering something about iPhone and recovering deleted data.
Based on my knowledge, Apple has hardware encryption enabled by default (on all models after the 3GS I believe).
If we issue an ""Erase all contents and settings"" command, we essentially tell the device to destroy the decryption keys used in decrypting user data.

My question is, are the keys really destroyed? Apart from trying to brute-force an AES-128 or 256 key (which we all know is currently impossible), is there no other way of accessing a physical image of a wiped iPhone? 

I know there are ways to obtain the decryption keys before the wipe command is issued but I'm more interested in the aftermath of the wipe process.

Thanks!

This doesn't require anything other than normal User privileges in most environments I've been exposed to.

EnCase does notice the CAB signature, but doesn't open it with the ""View File Structure"" command because it's not a supported compression format, according to GSI.

Does any commercial forensics software actually read inside these?  It just seems like it's a slight oversight if anybody can obfuscate the file, change the name of a file and throw it in a system32 directory.

Been lurking for a while and figured this was just as good place to hopefully pick the brains of an experienced bunch of forensic professionals already working in the field.

I graduated with a BSc in Cyber Forensics at the end of 2011 and did some vacation work at one of the big four which was great for some hands on experience with corporate tools and practices.

Since then I've applied for about 5 forensic jobs at different firms, got to interview stages but ended up being unsuccessful due to experience levels of other candidates, or the firm deciding to hire at a more senior level.

I'm in Australia, and while a lot of larger professional services/accounting firms do have forensic service lines, they don't recruit for it within the graduate programs which makes getting an entry level position extremely difficult.

From what I can tell a lot of current professionals working within the private sector initially started working within the Police to gain experience. Unfortunately I've only seen one position for my states cyber crime police advertised here in the last two years.

I currently work within the IT industry in a software tester role, I have been considering undertaking a Masters degree in Cyber Forensics part time whilst working. Is this something worth pursuing? Whilst it will give me another qualification and broaden my knowledge base I will still lack hands on, real world experience.

I was wondering the following, when the other party uses the st_atime field to provide evidence that a file was not accessed at a particular date, that the field is dated from the day before (less than 24 hours) then you realize it's on a filesystem with relatime enabled, is it sufficient to invalidate the other party's argument ?

Also, in this case, is there a way to provide evidence that relatime is indeed activated on the fs (the kernel version is above 2.6.30, data in fstab shows default mounting options), I cannot boot on the system (and therefore can't cat /proc/mounts :p), it is mounted on my investigation workstation, I'd like to find some way to have concrete evidence on that matter

I'd be grateful for any advice, thank you very much

**EDIT :** To be a little more clear :

Prosecution claims a file was not accessed the 13th of May at 8PM using the atime on the file as evidence of this : atime : 12th of May at 11PM
Investigated system is linux 2.6.30+ (relatime default, default interval at 86400s), no special mounting options in fstab, no evidence of that partition having been remounted with different options manually (in .bash_history and system logs), no evidence the kernel source has been modified (default installation, no evidence in logs the kernel has been recompiled).
Is it sufficient to invalidate the prosecution argument ? and if yes, is there any way to prove that relatime is indeed enabled ?

Here's the basics of my predicament. 

OCZ Agility 3 120gb SSD. It was working perfectly one morning, I put the laptop to sleep and since then it is not even recognized in BIOS. I've tried multiple different computers (some desktops, some laptops) I've placed it into a SATA to USB adapter and still nothing. 

I understand this sort of thing happens all the time, and the best solution is to have backups, unfortunately I am cursed by the storage gods and simply didnt have backups of some things on the drive.
Apparently a panic lock due to S3 sleep is a documented flaw in the model, but I can't find anything concrete on a way to solve the problem. My interactions with OCZ are documented here: http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?100267-Agility-3-Disappeared
You can also see what i've tried so far.

I'm not above begging/paying someone with some data recovery expertise to get me my files back, but I'd really appreciate any suggestions or tools you all might have. I have a strong IT background and feel pretty comfortable with following directions. I'd really like to get my stuff off, I don't care about voiding the warranty, I won't ever trust OCZ again. In the last week or 2 i've seen about a dozen other posts with people having the same issue i'm having.

My group has to work on analyzing PCAP for a practice case we've been given by our club. This is not the usual case we've been given in the past, this is the first time having a packet capture included in the case. We believe that analyzing the pcap file first would allow us to do further searches in our forensic analysis in the copy of the hard drives.

We have to figure out whether the company's server has been compromised, and which data the attacker had access to, and which attack has been used, and have to figure out what the attacker took. The problem is that we do not have in-depth knowledge in analyzing packet capture data. With our very little knowledge in wireshark, we we saw that the attacker's ip(given) was on the ports for http, https, and ssh. We are not sure whether they were actually able to view the encrypted data though. The problem is that we do not know what method the attack used to get in, and we don't know exactly what the attacker had access to, viewed, or downloaded from or to the company's server. 

Would there also be any keywords we could search for in the hard drives without the pcap analyzed?

There are online tools, for example, for embedding images into each other by exploiting the fact that not every bit in an image container is necessary. I've also seen tools for detecting and flagging the resulting flaws in these images.

What you never see are stego technologies being used in crime. There are old unfounded rumors of Al Qaeda using image steganography, and that's about it. Why is that? Are stego detection tools that powerful that it's not worth it? If I convert an image into an SSTV audio clip and embed that into a low resolution picture using least significant bit techniques, how will anybody possibly know that anything's wrong?

Second of all with the software recommended in the book being very out of date, I had a quick question. When doing a disk copy to check the integrity of the copied disk you'd do a CRC check on both sets of data, and compare them. However all the CRC software i've seen checks files, can you do a global disk CRC to create on hash to quickly compare to the other? Or do you CRC the whole drive's invidiual files from the top most file structure and then do the same again on the other side?

This file server has the OS (ubuntu 12.04 server) installed on a separate 80G HDD so the contents *should* be safe. However in my short sightedness I repartitioned and ran mkfs.ext4 on a few of these. It turns out I made a mess of things.

I'm running photorec to try and scrape the files but since the drives were in a SW RAID5 I don't think this is reliable. What else can I do? Should I try testdisk to recover the partitions and try to remake a RAID5 array?

A question regarding True Crypt ""Quick Format""",5,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/q9qhm/1_a_question_regarding_true_crypt_quick_format/,"I have always been told to that the ""quick format"" in True Crypt was less secure by my coworkers. Encrypting a hard drive that is 1 Terabyte this can take 24 hours without using quick format, and takes about 1 minute using quick format. The True Crypt websites reason for not using Quick Format does not really make me feel like the data is any less secure, just that someone will be able to tell how much space the encyrpted data uses. Can someone give their opinion ? Will my data be safe using Quick Format ?

Quick Format If unchecked, each sector of the new volume will be formatted. This means that the new volume will be entirely filled with random data. Quick format is much faster but may be less secure because until the whole volume has been filled with files, it may be possible to tell how much data it contains (if the space was not filled with random data beforehand). If you are not sure whether to enable or disable Quick Format, we recommend that you leave this option unchecked. Note that Quick Format can only be enabled when encrypting partitions/devices. Important: When encrypting a partition/device within which you intend to create a hidden volume afterwards, leave this option unchecked.

At 0:10, he starts to violently kick the protester.

He disappears until 0:35, where he is on the right of the protester with the extended arm.

At 0:44, he goes behind, picks up an object and throws it.

At 1:00, he moves behind the protester and turns around to talk. At 1:08, he turn again; here is a capture of the moment:  http://imgur.com/fdCHB

I just read the SANS institute paper: http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/forensics/advantage-ext3-journaling-file-system-forensic-investigation_2011

To summarize, the author recovers a deleted file's blocks through the ext3 journal and by using dd manages to recover the entire file (the iNode of the file to be recovered was previously noted to simplify the proof of concept). 

My question is, instead of going through this complicated procedure of tracking blocks, couldn't the author have just done a physical acquisition of the partition in question and run a file carving procedure on it? 

What are the differences between the two procedures? 

Sorry if my question seems vague.

I have recently promised to a friend to help him. He has some malware on his system, which at the very least it has a keylogger on his computer, and probably has more since he knows for a fact files from his computer were stolen. Since he lives a bit far away I am going to have to help him through connecting to his computer through mine. He is a person with valuable information in his field but unfortunately is not very computer-adept. He was targeted with this attack and it wasn't just some random malware infection. I am willing to look into his computer for him because I know much more about computers than him. but I'm posting here just to make sure that I've got all of my bases covered.

I intend to do the following:

*connect to his computer through remote connection software
*find and remove the malware on his computer
*learn more about the particular infection that is on his computer
*trace the infection back to its source.
and
*help him harden his box against future infection

So I'm going to connect to his pc (by what program, I don't exactly know yet because I generally don't do this).

Now what I've been thinking is that I will probably be running Malwarebytes and Comodo Cleaning Essentials to scan his system and processes to look for anything which rings a bell or even seems a bit unusual, in addition to going into his processes and services and stopping anything which looks like he doesn't need to run.

My main concern here is what if he has a virus piggybacking on top of a regular program such as explorer, firefox, and/or has some sort of crypter which hides the infection? Or mimicks the myriad multiple processes running at the same time (ex svchost.exe) How would I deal with these?

As he apparently has some kind of trojan on his system, most undoubtedly the software has to be calling home somewhere on a regular basis. My plan is to install Wireshark on his machine and get a packet dump of it after about an hour, and look for anything unusual, any IP address, emails out of the ordinary and/or things like FTP packets which are not things my friends knows how to use. If it is calling home somewhere, it has to show up in the packet dump somewhere which will give me a clue of just who the hell is doing this to my friend.

In order to study the infection further, I may even want to create a virtual image of his whole box so that I can take peeks of it at home and see just how the things operates instead of having an open connection to his pc 24/7.

""Hello,

I am planning my dissertation for my final year of University (UK) around acquiring and forensically analysing a Amazon Kindle Fire HD (What can be stored on a KFHD, what can be returned in regards to internet history etc).

I have done Google searches and repeatedly end up back at computerforensics.cham...-forensics which in itself is a good blog, however, doesn't provide much information in acquiring the image. 
Other webpages I've visited are www.ericjhuber.com/201...nsics.html AND www.ericjhuber.com/201...sics.html)

The 'acquiring the image' aspect of my dissertation is the part I am struggling with. I have tried both Encase and FTK Imager and both see the Kindle as 0.0Gb and will not image it. I then tried Cellebrite which worked perfectly.... apart from the fact I need an E01/.dd image, which unfortunately Cellebrite doesn't create. 

I then proceeded to see if Caine/Macquistion would see the KFHD if it was plugged in while they were running... They didn't.

So what I am asking is if anyone has any information of KFHD forensics or even KF forensics which could be applied to the KFHD to which I could obtain an E01/.dd image file. Has anyone forensically acquired a KFHD in the past using Encase/FTK?

Thank you,

C""


UPDATE 03/05/2013:

I have loaded my .bin file Cellebrite created into Encase as a 'Disk Image' and it does display the partitions I believe (all 13). C, D, E, F, G, H, /dfs, /efs, /I, J, /system, /cache, /data. However in the named partitions, there are just 'Lost File' folders with nothing in. So there's progress, but not much.

The idea of LE investigations, being an expert witness, and recovering data seems so right for me.

I have also been looking into the GCFE, although it seem less sought after then EnCE. I am going to apply for security clearance(s), as I've seen they look good to hiring managers in this field. My current job requires me to be very meticulous, and document everything I do.

Well....the title is really messed up but i really want to expand on it a bit. 
I used to be in the NetSec business a long time ago and we used to laugh about when there would be warrant less tapping across the continents through the use of a ""digital line"" and it wont care about international law or rights, etc... those jokes were around 12 years ago...it is an understatement to say that everything we joked about in our ""invulnerable"" and ""curious"" youth has either become true or is starting to look very very close to reality.

One of the things we discussed was the use of a smear and propaganda campaign against an industry heavy-weight for a low-level implementation-device/software. This is to shift the majority of users towards a ""propped-up"" alternative which is not as good but gets the job done and has immeasurable advantages to people who use it, most being opposite of what the industry heavy-weight is reviled for. This ensures ready accepting of the new resource and a full on fanfare-type politicization of the positions of both parties, basically causing the ""superficial-intellectuals"" to adopt the new alternative to look cool, happening and hip.

The point of this all being the adoption of an already vulnerable system/hardware/software by the unsuspecting masses, a system from which the tech-giant being smeared also benefits, although not directly or massively(at first). 

Well....this is what i see in linux as time goes by, there are fanboys and cult-level  understandings and adaptation to its culture by very-informed individuals, and i respect that. but has anyone given thought to the massive amounts of linux code being contributed by corporate-tech giants? It's all very well to say that anyone can simply look it up, but would the normal, non-techy people be able to tell the difference? or care? not to mention, the revelation of a very hard-hitting yet basic security flaw in the (linux/grub????) architecture a couple of years ago in regards to physical login rights puts the theory of ""many eyeballs"" in the spotlight for questioning. 
That is just the start, what about adding obfuscated code that looks and behaves differently under different environments? How btw, would linux (or its many flavors) be immune to PRISM, memory corruption/injection, hardware level exploits affecting specific low-level software assemblies if the code itself is obfuscated for backdoor purposes? 

I apologize, i have been out of the game for quite a long time and even then i wasnt the most informed, so i ask, with certain linux flavors being given many services and catering to the ""normal"" people, what does it say about their potential to be monitored? I am looking at you, Ubuntu -_- or their potential to be used like Microsoft's products have been in the security game? The commercial acceptance of Linux by companies such as Valve and others gave me hope at one time, but also scared me, as now there is nothing stopping the once-bastion and gem of the Opensource community to be used and abused as governments see fit. 

Do not talk to me about ""opt-out"" options to being tracked and all that bullshit, talk to me about the code and the capability, for it is obvious to me and has been for quite sometime that  if there is a way to get it done, its usually been done and theres a better version in the works.

I have a 3TB hard disk with GPT and EXT4 file system. I accidentally ""shift+del"" a directory which contained the only copy of some video files from a project that cost close to a grand. I'm not exactly a n00b to systems administration, data recovery or even forensics (forensics techniques that is, not actually dealing with evidence/law). I know about mounting as read only an/or using write blockers, creating images, working with images, etc. the whole lot. I am very familiar. The issue here the disk is just about full and it's backup is also equally full minus this one brand new directory that I freaking deleted (on accident, needless to say!!) so this isn't even really an option. This happend hours ago and thus far I haven't tried anything. I am afraid to make a move and while I could drop $150 on a new 3TB and do it the way I know by imaging the disk, bit by bit and working with copies of said image, etc.. I'd rather not go that route. I have many tools available to me such as extundeleted, etc. I'm just afraid to try **anything**, it's like I'm frozen in shock and despair. Someone with experience in a similar circumstance please chime in with some comforting advice. What tools do you all suggest I try? I'm obviously afraid of altering the data since I only have ONE freaking copy to work with - the live copy on the disk itself! I'm ripping my hair out here. Again, I could drop the money for an additional disk to work with, etc it'd be worth it, but for one the nearest place to purchase such an item is hours of driving and ordering one online takes too much time. I need a quick fix and I'm to scared to move. Help me, won't you? ",,False,self,t5_2rubs,False,,,True,t3_1b5rmm,http://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/1b5rmm/seeking_advice_help/,

From your experience what has been the most effective way to recover and report a users internet history. I have used EnCase, HistEx and NetAnalysis and have got lots of results. we are interested in a selective period and the bit im struggling with is the method of presenting the data.

What would you do. (we are trying to give as much information as possible but don't want to go OTT)

1) give a summary of the users internet history over a specific period.

2) give a week by week in depth analysis over a specific time period.
