We're 65daysofstatic, a noisy band from Sheffield, UK. Some people call us post-rock. We are instrumental and make songs with guitars, drums, pianos and loads of electronics. Mostly, we just try to make people dance or go deaf.

Our last 'proper' record was called We Were Exploding Anyway and you can find loads of that streaming on our homepage here: [65daysofstatic.com](http://www.65daysofstatic.com).

Last year, thought, we self-released a soundtrack album to the 1972 sci-fi film Silent Running, which caused a bit of a stir. You can find that on the website too.

Right now we're all together in the studio. We'll be about all day, but answers might come intermittently as we have to, y'know, make music in between.

Ask us anything and we will endeavour to answer whatever comes through.

Cheers.
65daysofstatic // paul/joe/si/rob.

EDIT: 14:20pm. Keep em coming, we're pretty busy right now, but we'll keep answering if there's more questions.

EDIT: 17:24pm. Ok. It's getting a bit crazy in the studio now - lot to do today - so we're gonna have to mostly sign off now. Thanks for all the questions - it was fun. Between the four of us, we'll keep trying to pop back throughout the rest of the evening and answer any questions that haven't already been covered elsewhere.

I was confused and a little afraid, but as the world didn't end that week, I wrote it off as a fluke. Maybe everyone was just being really sarcastic and I was being too dense to pick up on it. I tried to block it out of my mind.

Now I'm seeing the same trend here on r/postrock. People are being open minded, agreeing to disagree, and just generally respecting each other. We're sharing new bands with each other instead of screaming about which ones TOTES SUCK FER REEL LOL. We have got to stop this. Everyone knows that the internet is fueled by xenophobic hate, close minded immaturity and all caps racism. Every time you're respectful of someone else's opinion that you disagree with a server corrupts.

My daughter passed away less than two years ago in a car accident. I think about her all the time. Today is her birthday, she would have been 18 years old. 

[Your Hand In Mine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzIK5FaC38w), unlike **any** other song, reminds me so much of her. I'm driving 4 hours this Friday to see them in Asheville, NC and can only hope that they play this song, and that I can keep it together if/when they do.

- - - -

**Edit** - I'm speechless. Thank you so much for the beautiful thoughts and kind words, they mean more to me than anything anyone has said since her accident. I know the pain will outlast me, but I also know that she lives on through me and others. If there's one lesson from her that I could share with people, it is simply: ""**be kind**"".

Here [we are](http://exposur3.com/we.jpg) when she was just a baby, and this is [her on the left](http://exposur3.com/her.jpg)... She was such a beautiful person.

Yes, this music is *so fucking* powerful, and amazing, and emotional - words can't describe it. I knew that posting here was the right thing to do, so again, thank you all.

Not sure if you guys know of this, but you should put it on if you haven't listened to it yet.

There are others out there, but this one I've really enjoyed the most.

1. No circlejerk-ing. Yes, these bands are amazing and all of us know it. The thread is meant for an intellectual discussion about them.

Here is the spotify playlist of your 50 most upvoted tracks for the past year !,69,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/yab63/hey_rpostrock_here_is_the_spotify_playlist_of/,"So here is the playlist : http://open.spotify.com/user/diddykong5/playlist/5EmplyrzalOyjbpLL0BSpV

One thing is for sure, you guys LOVE This Will Destroy You (and rightfully so) with 6 tracks out of the 50. Of course GY!BE would be the ultimate leader if they were on spotify, but we all know it's not gonna happen...

Surprisingly, only one 65daysofstatic track made the list, but maybe they were all uploaded before the past year (or maybe they're more math-rock than post)

Oh I almost forgot : The trophy for the ""most post-rock name for a song"" goes to ""They Move on Tracks of Never-Ending Light"" by TWDY ;)

Anyway, enjoy ! I'll update the playlist every month or so with new upvoted songs, and you can check out my other playlists I made for [/r/listentothis](http://open.spotify.com/user/diddykong5/playlist/0kVkrjXa9jXtWYNaqJbign) and [/r/metal](http://open.spotify.com/user/diddykong5/playlist/0XgKfkvJbg5DiYrFVsQ56M) !

EDIT: The playlist is already at 48 subscribers, which is really awesome :)

For those of you with no access to spotify, here is a youtube playlist : http://www.tubufy.com/spotify:user:diddykong5:playlist:5EmplyrzalOyjbpLL0BSpV#

And a grooveshark one ! http://grooveshark.com/#!/playlist/R+postrock+Best+Of/76374886

First, thanks to Chrys for his invitation and for helping setting this up.

Next, fire away. I'm combining session this with work emails and watching the Chelsea-Napoli game, so will be at my computer to answer questions all evening.

Lastly, here is a brief introduction to what I do:

- www.yndihalda.com - my rock band
- www.alily.co.uk - my pop band
- www.saintcoltrane.info - my punk band
- www.fat-cat.co.uk - my day job
- www.orosarecords.com - my record label

(other things I am involved with: www.sqlr-mag.info // www.galapagospresents.tumblr.com)

Will add more when I think of what to put here.


MARCH 15th:
Sorry for neglecting the last questions last night, everyone. I'll finish these up and continue checking back over the day in case any more arrive. Why don't we allow for stragglers and finish up this evening. 

Thanks again.

MARCH 15th | 9pm GMT:
How about we finish up in an hour from now? I'll check back then and answer any leftover q's.

Thanks again, again.

We can help...,73,17,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/1kaul3/this_makes_me_sick_marriages_maliciously/,"As a musician myself, it kills me to hear about a band getting ripped off of their gear... which is ONE thing. Today, MARRIAGES posted a link to a new Indiegogo campaign which describes a much worse situation that they're currently facing...

I suggest reading their full write-up on the [page](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/marriages-maliciously-burglarized-and-displaced), but basically (and more than once) they've returned from touring to find their home (which is in a bad neighborhood) completely ransacked and purposefully flooded. This most recent time, they came home to this again to also find that almost everything they hold dear has been destroyed or stolen - harddrives full of their recordings, laptops, tons of studio and instrumental gear, personal sentimental items like a grandfather's penny collection - approx. over $20,000 worth of items, all gone.

On top of all that, their shitty landlord is threatening to sue *them* for the damages. 

I've never made a post like this on reddit before, but these people are some of my favorite musicians. They're just normal people like the rest of us, just trying to get by. How could I not post this? Please check their page out and contribute if you can.

2. Links to interesting articles and interviews are encouraged. So are exceptional live performances. However, discussions are of primary importance.

3. Be nice to the newbies. Don't scare them away.

4. Unless its an obvious troll, use the downvote button sparingly.

lately I've been trying to find some new postrock to listen to but most bands I discovered had nothing unique in their sound. They all remind me either of EITS or Mono.

It seems like most new bands have this etched vision how postrock has to sound. It becomes rather repetitive and thats kinda sad for such a beautiful and inspiring genre.

So, do you guys know some really cool bands with a unique sound who push the boundaries of the genre and mark themselves off the the same old sound ?",,False,self,t5_2qvaq,False,,,True,t3_17vx4o,http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/17vx4o/unique_and_inventive_postrock/,

Want to make a difference?

sleepmakeswaves have had an amazing 2012, touring Europe and America, appearing at Dunk!festival, supporting numerous amazing bands in Australia (including Omar Lopez Rodriguez, Karnivool and are currently on tour with 65daysofstatic) and generally exhausting themselves.

Unfortunately, it comes at a cost. I was actually shocked at quite how much of one though when I read an interview conducted by their bassist, Alex Wilson (in a half-serious, half-joking tone).

AW: “A few weeks ago we bought our drummer new shoes for his birthday cause his old sneaker let the water in and he couldn't bring himself to buy new ones. Please tell me that there is at least enough in this instrumental rock game for shoe security.”
http://themusic.com.au/interviews/all/2012/12/28/65daysofstatic-paul-wolinski-alex-wilson-sleepmakeswaves/11704/

Now I know there’s so many bands out there that are trying to make it big. I know they’ve made themselves broke and maybe over-stretched if we look at it practically. But this is the band that I love and that I think can be amazing in the post-rock scene with their epic, triumphant sound and killer songwriting. They’re giving everything to follow a dream and they are getting close to beginning to realise it.

Underground, instrumental music is a niche genre and market. But it’s a goddamn beautiful niche and I’d like to think that we can support it. Sleepmakeswaves is my local band that I want to see succeed and it’s ridiculously hard for any Australian band to do that, let alone weird genres like this. But they are on the path to doing just that, with many sacrifices. If we can help them overcome just some of those obstacles wouldn’t that be fucking awesome?




**What can you do to help?**

It’s simple, buy stuff! If you’ve heard the band before on r/postrock, youtube or anywhere and liked their sound, now would be a great time to get one of their CDs on your shelf or in your hard drive. Have a listen, if you haven’t already and see if it’s worth your money- http://sleepmakeswaves.com/album/and-so-we-destroyed-everything

*Have all their CDs?* Buy a t-shirt, they’re pretty awesome designs (and good conversation starters, believe me) http://sleepmakeswaves.com/merch

*Can’t quite afford a full CD or got every piece of music already?* You can use the “name your price” option on this EP to donate as much as you can afford- http://sleepmakeswaves.com/album/split-with-tangled-thoughts-of-leaving (insert normal kitsch of ‘if just everybody gave 50 cents”). Plus you get some pretty awesome songs while you’re at it ('we sing the body electric' in particular!).

If you’re in Australia, go to one of their gigs. Post-rock is even better live and their sheer energy and stagemenship will blow you away. If you’re in Europe or America, keep an eye out for their next tours!

*Can’t afford to do any of the above?* I know that feeling, as a broke university student myself... But you can still help, either by spreading this message or spreading word of the band. 

Thank you for at least reading this and an even bigger thanks to those who’ve brought something!

Congrats to everyone who contributes by posting tracks, videos, news, questions and comments - you're the reason why r/postrock kicks ass! 

Seven months ago, around the time of the ""[Top Albums of 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/nscis/rpostrock_top_albums_of_2011_results)"" post, we were about 3,000 strong, so our growth has been pretty amazing. I grabbed [a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/m2jQB.png) of our stats today, which will give you some additional insight.

**So, where do we go from here?**

We need your feedback - any ideas or thoughts about any new features that we can try out? What do you like, what don't you like? 

-----

Some additional thoughts:

* How can we get more eyes/ears on lesser known bands? What about a ""band of the week""?

**Edit**: Ok, this turned into a new feature called ""Album of the Week"" which will mostly focus on lesser known, new releases - let's see how it goes. Any feedback would be helpful.

* New music Fridays featuring tracks from 2011/12 albums?
* AMAs - I've got a tentative ""yes"" from Red Sparowes and TWDY, but who else would you like to talk to?
* We need a ""post-rock essentials list"" ([a lot of talk about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/search?q=essentials&amp;restrict_sr=on))

**Edit**: Have a volunteer to help out with this, work on details now.

* The new wiki system will be released soon - how can we improve our FAQ, band lists, etc?
* /r/Music has implemented some [new rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/wh5p7/new_rules_you_wanted_selfpost_friday_no_images/) as well as /r/Metal implementing a [band blacklist](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/smons/on_reposts/) - good ideas or too much?

**Edit**: Going to hold off on this for now, looks like it didn't work out so well for /r/Music so we'll keep an eye on things and reserve the right to experiment with the idea in the future.

* Did you know we have a [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-postrock) &amp; [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/rpostrock)?

**Godspeed You! Black Emperor**

The entire Slow Riot EP really stands out to me, as do Sleep, Static, and Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls.

**Mono**

I really like Moonlight, Are You There, The Flames Beyond The Cold Mountain, and Pure As Snow.

**This Will Destroy You**

A Three Legged Workhorse, Quiet, There Are Remedies Worse Than The Disease, and Happiness: We're All In It Together

**Mogwai**

White Noise, Rano Pano, I'm Jim Morrison I'm Dead, Take Me Somewhere Nice

There are a few bands that are posted here very frequently (GY!BE, Mogwai, EitS, 65dos etc) and while that can be frustrating for some longer term fans they do tend to be the bands that people usually get into when first discovering post-rock.

We could have a thread where people post ""essential"" albums and vote up albums they believe should be on the list and go from there. Some examples of the stuff I mean:

* GY!BE - Lift Yr Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven
* Mogwai - Young Team
* EitS - The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place
* Slint - Spiderland
* 65daysofstatic - The Fall of Math
* Tortoise - Millions Now Living Will Never Die

1. No circlejerk-ing. Yes, these bands are amazing and all of us know it. The thread is meant for an intellectual discussion about them.
2. Links to interesting articles and interviews are encouraged. So are exceptional live performances. However, discussions are of primary importance.
3. Be nice to the newbies. Don't scare them away.
4. Unless its an obvious troll, use the downvote button sparingly.

This Will Destroy You is a post rock band from Texas. They've released 2 albums and 3 EPs, the latest of which (Tunnel Blanket) was released last year.

**Tangled Thoughts of Leaving**

It’s like jazz meets post-rock and starts screwing it in hardcore’s bedroom while Beethoven experiments with electronica on the bedside table. Utterly original sound, led by virtuosic piano. Stream their entire album here- http://music.tangledthoughtsofleaving.com/


**sleepmakeswaves**

The big success story of the Aussie post-rock scene so far, having just finished European and American tours. They combine beautifully guitar textures with an insane drummer, varied bassist, dropdead gorgeous songwriting and an incredibly energetic live show. 
Their best song- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZSL_7W5Rqw


**Laura**

Think of a more concise, poetic and coherent version of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. That's pretty close to their dark, paranoid and oppressive post-rock but add brief poetic downbeat lyrics to their apocalyptic soundscapes with great effect. None of that twinkly, conventional stuff here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwtgMQ8dwIc


**Nikko**

Doom-country fused with post-rock. That's about as close as I can get to a description. Melancholy bar-room ballads so good you can almost smell the spilt beer and cigerette smoke staining your room as you listen. There's a mean violin in there too. Lately have gone more traditional song-writing but their post-rock instrumental punch is still in there.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLiQBnc_hWw


**hazards of swimming naked**

These guys put the rock back into post-rock. Their cinematic and driving songs feature a great dynamic between the two lead guitar players, while also having some of the nicest bass lines I've heard in this genre.  These guys know their way around a crescendo too!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiotsbW80VA


**Mr Maps**

Fusing together post-rock and math-rock, these guys' unrelentingly happy sound will put a smile on nearly anyone's face. It never feels forced either, a feat I've only heard once before in Jonsi's Go album. The musicianship is pretty damn amazing, drums, guitar and cello in particular. Perfect fusion of emotion and technicality in music.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUPMXaF5874


**Dumbsaint**

Halfway between post-rock and post-metal, these guys have a great focus on rhythm in their songs and it gives them a unique sound. The ability to go from full on metal assault to tranquil ambience only adds to the sound. The drums are amazing, the bassist is equally at home at pounding out the bass foundations or rising into a melody role and the guitarist handles the melody and riffage with aplomb.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me9JKjkBS3Y


**Echotide**

The new trio on the block, their sound is slow-paced post-rock/ambient. It's a really slow-burning album that has beautiful but gradual volume and chord evolution. It seriously is one hell of a ride. They use some great samples live too. Their debut album is available for FREE here.
http://echotide.bandcamp.com/


**Meniscus**

Their brand of free-flowing and melodic post-rock is stunningly layered and beautiful. Another extremely strong songwriting team too, these guys have been around long enough to be an absence on a few of the other bands here. And you can't believe it from the sound but they only have 1 guitarist!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKl9EZhK650


**Screens**

A fledgling Brisbane band, their main feature is the amazing voice of their singer. Operatically trained, she uses her voice mainly as another instrument and the sheer range she has is outstanding. Time will tell if they can strike the balance in their songwriting to get the most out of this highlight. Otherwise solid post-rock.
http://soundcloud.com/screens/taste-of-euphoria-1


**Solkyri**

A Sydney trio, these guys are much more on the experimental side of post-rock (mostly structurally). Unfortunately, they do tend to sound a little limited by the small amount of instruments they have (something I feel needs to be overcome in nearly every trio). Combine some nice film references as well. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQTE_ZdBdv8


**Lander Configurations**

A fledgling Sydney band, they're a little closer to the traditional brand of post- rock with math rock influences from the little I've heard of them. Also have vocals, for those that prefer them. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxqwzF1UDQA

Also, know of but haven't listened to **These Hands**, **Sparkspitter** and **This is Your Captain Speaking**. I'm surprised by the lack of post-rock from Melbourne, but that might be because they haven't toured up to Brisbane as much as the Sydney bands.

Most of these places are dark, and uninviting (which is oddly comforting); a place for solitude. 

El Ten Eleven does not give me such a feeling. They bring uninhibited joy. A carefree approach to a usually serious genre. They stick out of the pack with a unique vibe and smooth, constant easy-listening beat with a hint of '70s funk.

I can always trust ETE to brighten me up on a dark day, and to put a smile on my face while tapping my feet.

After doing some research, I quickly found this amazing blog (which now became a website on its own): http://www.thesirenssound.com/

A few dedicated posters post about 5 new unknown artists every single day. I have discovered pretty much 99% of my post-rock music over there. They of course also post updates on the most famous artists on the post-rock scene.

They usually do very good at finding out if one of the artists they've posted about has created a new album.

Most of the artists they show are just starting their career and are thus looking for a fan-base. This website is a very good way for them to reach an attentive audience. Nearly all the albums proposed can be downloaded under a ""Name your price"" policy. If you feel like downloading for free, it's pretty much always available as an option.

The website is mostly oriented toward post-rock, but you'll some times find some Mod-Classical, Drone, Post-Metal, and Screamo.",,False,self,t5_2qvaq,False,,,True,t3_n8wnr,http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/n8wnr/i_just_wanted_to_share_my_source_of_postrock/,

1301266809.0,30,self.postrock,gcq79,"Hey, /r/postrock, I drove 5+ hours to see Godspeed last night in Chicago and it blew my mind. Let me tell you about it (there's a recording involved!)",35,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/gcq79/hey_rpostrock_i_drove_5_hours_to_see_godspeed/,"I discovered Godspeed a few years after they went on hiatus. Since then, I've attempted to watch every one of their live shows on YouTube, and downloaded the most popular ones on Archive.org.

At exactly 6:30 AM on April 9th, 2010, I got a mass email alerting me that Godspeed had reunited and were going to hit a few spots in the US. I ran around the house with my mouth full of toothpaste going, ""YEAHHHHHHHHHHH!"" Later on that year, I bought tickets to see them in Chicago, which was the closest place from where I live (South bit of Indiana.) I hyped up the trip hardcore; it'd be on my spring break, so that made it hundreds of times better.

Last night, I stood on a bustling, old sidewalk outside the Metro (an old-looking building that could easily be confused with an ancient theater.) People had shown up hours before the doors would open, so the line wrapped around half the block. I got there early enough to secure a good spot close to the door (and got to watch a 14-year-old try to enter a bar with his parents.)

After getting in, I took my spot about ten feet back from the stage, behind a few people taking pictures with pro-looking cameras. Finally, the opening guy (Eric Chenaux) came on, and played something that sounded like radio static for thirty minutes. Finally, he announced, ""This will be my last song."" and the crowd exploded in applause.

A few minutes after Eric left the stage, the note that starts out Dead Flag Blues began to play, and one-by-one, the members of Godspeed took the stage. Moya came out first, and the air in the room suddenly felt much thinner as everyone breathed in at once. He smiled, then waved, which resulted in another round of thunderous clapping and hollering. He then sat down at his guitar, and began tuning.

Each member that came out after that picked up their instrument and started playing. By the time Efrim appeared, the drone was loud enough to almost drown out all the yelling coming from us. The projectionist then started a film loop of the word ""HOPE"", which flickered on and off the screen for several minutes.

After 18 minutes of solid noise, the room went silent, and the first notes of Storm began to play. You'll hear the entire crowd go crazy at this point, as this is more or less the epitome of song intros.

There were two projections being played at this point: flowers blooming, and various bees swarming around a stem of a dandelion. All in solid black and white film.

Sleep was played after that. Equally amazing. The films showed flocks of birds flying around.

Albanian dropped after that. Nobody really saw it coming, but once it hit the room got VERY tense in preparation for the breakdown near the middle/end. Personally, I'm a big fan of the crazy part right before the song slows down, and it was awesome, but nothing compared to the metal-like ending. If the rumors are true, and this song DOES get recorded, then I am very excited.

Dead Metheny and Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls were also played. And, of course, Moya and BBF3 ended the show. The latter of which went on for thirty minutes.

There were several parts during the show that had an almost spiritual experience to them. We all seemed to be experiencing it differently (two people looked to be having seizures during Albanian.) When the peak of BBF3 hit, I think everyone just felt awesome simultaneously.  Can't really describe it well, but anyone who has seen them live should know exactly what I'm talking about.

They ended the show much like it began; each member left their instrument blaring at full volume while the projectionist played a loop of random images until one of the stage managers came on-stage to kill the amps.

The crowd remained clapping for a while, then we all cycled down the steps to the lobby, only to see Moya and another guy selling merchandise: all of their albums, a tour poster, and a shirt. It was a bit pricey, but I picked up a shirt.

And to make things even more awesome, you can listen to the show here: http://www.archive.org/details/gybe2011-03-26.ca14.flac24

Another guy is working on a recording too, so I would also look out for that (just click ""(check for other copies)"" near the top of the page.)

&gt;Uh, the music is disturbing me, I'm going to turn it off.

&gt;Wait, when am I actually going to *listen* to music, then?

&gt;Oh well, let's simply enjoy the music without anything else.

And so I laid down, closed my eyes, and listened to First Breath After Coma, followed by The Only Moment We Were Alone.

Wow, the stuff I've been missing. It was like meeting an old friend. Simply put, I really listened to the music, examining each sound and how it works with all others, and trying to absorb everything that's going on at once. I found out how intricate the songs really are, that there's much more than I can catch by simply putting it to the background.

I knew the songs really well, but it felt like listening to something completely new, there were sounds I didn't notice, it all worked in a way I didn't understand before. I also realized how much work has this had to take to create something like this. Then the climax at the end of The Only Moment We Were Alone came, and it was great. 

Really, even when I listened to it before, I just waited for the climax, for the parts I liked, basically ignoring everything else, listening to it just as the necessary boring part.

I also found out that some songs I liked were rather flat in comparsion with some I found boring at first.

Guys, if you haven't, take a moment to truly appreciate music, and really, not only post-rock, but any music for that matter. Listen to each sound, think about it, try to listen to it all of it at once.

I love The American Dollar as well, though my favorite albums by them are Ambient 1 and Ambient 2, unsurprisingly. I also like Helios and Flica, though these aren't as guitar-driven as I would like. 

 I like to listen to this kind of music while I read (which I do a ton of), so stuff that is heavy distracts me too much. Same with vocals.

3. Be nice to the newbies. Don't scare them away.

4. Unless its an obvious troll, use the downvote button sparingly.

Slint, along with bands like Talk Talk, is often considered to be one of the pioneering First Generation Post Rock bands. They released 2 albums and 1 EP, of which Spiderland (1991) is their best known.

We wanted to let you know that we want to record our first full length album this summer and put it out on CD and vinyl, but we can't do it alone so we've [created a Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/innis/its-not-night-its-space-and-their-first-lp) and we'd love your help. No donation is too small and we've got some cool rewards lined up. 

We want to make a special offer too. There's a poster package deal that we throw in at the $100 level. If you let us know that you're from reddit, we will throw in those posters at ANY pledge level. 

Remember that Kickstarter is all or nothing. If we don't make our goal, we get no money, so that means you won't actually be charged until the drive is over on June 14th either.

**Edit/PS:** If you notice there's a special offer for the vinyl copy at the $25 level. That was a suggestion by one of our fans, which has proven to be a fantastic idea. But there are only 8 left. All the rewards we offer include worldwide shipping, but we can say that because of how expensive vinyl is, how expensive shipping is, and the fact we are only pressing 100, we will not be selling them online after the Kickstarter is over.

Here's my top choices, the arsenal I usually use when someone asks me what postrock is.

Albums:

On Little Known Frequencies- From Monument to Masses.  I've been listening to this album non-stop since its releases.  What I love about Monuments is how all of their songs have a real drive with strong riffs.  A lot of my friends aren't big fans of the ""softness"" or ""swelling"" nature of a lot of more progressively minded postrock, so this album makes for a good transition.

The Earth Is A Man- self-titled.  These guys are unsigned, but this album has quickly become one of my favorites.  It's just...really...really good.  I can't sit still when I listen to it.  Even my mom likes it.

Easily Misunderstood- Samuel Jackson Five.  Recently discovered these guys as well (thank you, last fm). This album incorporates some strings, some really good guitar tones, and some strange time signatures.  Good introduction to some of the common aspects of the genre, methinks.

Law-Cougar.  These guys are exceptional, and I have no idea why I don't hear their name mentioned more.  Really accessible, really creative, and really catchy.

Songs:

Those Who Stayed - Murder By Death.  Not exactly a post-rock band, but the song clearly has the influence.  Western/folk/rock stuff with some really good, creepy cello parts.  Builds up something fierce, too

Pulse Conditioner - Cougar.  This whole album is a go-to for me.  This song is actually one of the first songs that got me interested in the genre.  The song Altatl would also do nicely.

Frederica - Do Make Say Think.  Beautiful song, amazing band.  Also one of the first songs that got me interested in the genre.  Started to break the conceptual rock mold for me and broaden my horizons.


Runner ups include: Mudy on the Sakuban, Rega, Mercury Program, Mescaliner, Maserati, Tera Melos, El Ten Eleven, Dirty Three.

The purpose of this thread is to have a meaningful discussion about these bands. Feel free to talk about any topic - from musical direction and structure, to live performances and interviews. 

**Rules:**

1. No circlejerk-ing. Yes, these bands are amazing and all of us know it. The thread is meant for an intellectual discussion about them.

2. Links to interesting articles and interviews are encouraged. So are exceptional live performances. However, discussions are of primary importance.
3. Be nice to the newbies. Don't scare them away.
4. Unless its an obvious troll, use the downvote button sparingly.

**Sigur Ros:**

Sigur Ros is an Icelandic Post Rock band active since 1994. They've released 7 albums so far, the last of these (Valtari) releasing earlier this year. They're known to be one of the few Post Rock bands that heavily incorporates vocals. 

You can read their [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigur_R%C3%B3s) entry for more information.

Again, we just wanted to thank everyone at /r/postrock for checking out our music, and providing us with some great feedback... both positive and negative. We're setting out for a couple of weeks to tour our new release, Icebreaker, through the UK and Ireland.

The tour starts with a pop up show in Glasgow at 'The 13th Note' this Saturday (March 23rd). Our stage time is 11pm sharp. It's small. It's sweaty. It was booked yesterday.

It ends with a massive headline show in Belfast at The Empire Music Hall. It's big. It's old. And it was booked some time ago.

The shows between are as follows:

MARCH 23rd | Glasgow @ The 13th Note

MARCH 24th | Edinburgh @ The Voodoo Rooms

MARCH 25th | Leeds @ Milo

MARCH 26th | Manchester @ Castle Hotel

MARCH 27th | Huddersfield @ The Parish

MARCH 28th | Blackpool @ Later At The Blue Room (Festival)

MARCH 29th | Nottingham @ JT Soar (BYOB)

MARCH 30th | Stamford @ The Voodoo Lounge

MARCH 31st |  Lincoln @ The Shed

At first I'd like to say I was very excited (and nervous) to talk to them, being a huge admirer of their music. I talked to them backstage in Oberhausen, Germany and asked them about Waking Season, musical development, their creative process, the role of social media (and their recent AMA here), collaborations they'd want to do, horses and german bread. I'm happy that the Interview went well and the video we created from the footage looks good (thanks to my homeboy for editing it with me and creating the nice little clips from my concert photos inbetween the footage) and I hope you find some interesting stuff in there :) Oh, and, next to being really nice and friendly, they signed my baby blue You Are The Conductor, which makes it something even rarer that I will pass on to my kids (if i ever have some). :&gt;

I'm a journalism student and a while ago I had the chance to interview Robin and John from Maybeshewill whilst the band was touring through Europe. 
The entire interview (in Dutch) is in the magazine we had to make for school this semester, but we have put the English version up on [our website](http://www.dive-magazine.be) for people who don't talk Dutch (okay, I know a little part of it is still in Dutch, I'm sorry! But if you want me to, I can translate it to English.)

Anyhow, you can read the interview over [here](http://dive-magazine.be/239/), and I hope you enjoy it!

My band, [Followed by Ghosts](http://www.myspace.com/followedbyghosts) is planning our third tour and I, the bassist/violinist/pianist, wanted to ask reddit for some help. If there are any redditors who would be willing to help us with setting up some shows that would be much appreciated. Your involvement could be anything from actually setting up the show to just giving us the name of your favorite place to see bands play live. We will be traveling with our friend Dan and his one-man-band [DSF](http://www.myspace.com/fogontheshore). Below I will provide the projected dates and locations of where we will be, so if anyone in these areas would just PM me with the info that would be wonderful and I would love to see you at the show. Below will also be provided a resume of what we've accomplished over the past couple of years.

Dates and Locations:

July 28th, Cedar Falls, Iowa (this is taken care of)

July 29th, Minneapolis, Minnesota (this one has also been probably taken care of, we're working with the band [Giants](http://www.myspace.com/giantsmusic) on getting this one set up)

July 30th, Fargo, North Dakota

July 31st, Rapid City, South Dakota

August 1st, Denver, Colorado

August 2nd, Lincoln, Nebraska

August 3rd, Kansas City, Missouri

August 4th, Norman, Oklahoma (this one is also take care of)

August 5th, Dallas, Texas

August 6th, Houston, Texas

August 7th, New Orleans, Louisiana

August 8th, Memphis, Tennessee

August 9th, Nashville, Tennessee

August 11th, St. Louis, Missouri **EDIT:** Lemp Neighborhood Community Arts Center

August 12th, Indianapolis, Indiana

August 13th, Chicago, Illinois

Our resume of accomplishments, which may help with booking:

Having our music used by the HBO mini-series 24/7 three times, including [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGmG8mK0WrI). The other two were used for the Panguins/Capitals outdoor game special in the 3rd and 4th episodes over New Years.

The documentary film [Wake Up](http://wakeupthefilm.com/) used one of our songs.

Our most recent license is this Tuesday, at 8/7c our song is going to be used in the Finale of Dancing With the Stars.

We've toured twice before.

We've released two albums, [Dear Monsters, Be Patient](http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/followedbyghosts2) and [The Entire City was Silent](http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/followedbyghosts) which is sold out except for the six hard copies I have in my closet right now.

We've performed with other post-rock giants like Giants, Unwed Sailor, Caspian, Gifts from Enola, and Saxon Shore (once and it was kind of obscure, before they were big).

**EDIT:** I'd like to just say thank you, I posted this same thing on a number of places and this is the only place I got any sort of a response other than a downvote on /r/music.
