1321231111.0,3105,self.skyrim,mb8la,Massive list of all the tips and tricks.,4925,1820,1808,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mb8la/massive_list_of_all_the_tips_and_tricks/,"Lately been seeing many posts asking/listing tips about the game. I decided to create this one so all of you could post them here for other to see. 
I will update the OP with each tip posted so people don't have to scroll through the whole thing. Hopefully as we get more tips and tricks in here I can put them in different categories for easier viewing

Here to start us off, some of the tips I saw posted.

- THE SPRINT BUTTONS ARE: PC=Alt, Xbox=LB, PS3=L2, you can also sprint on a horse

- SAVE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE F5 IS THE QUICK SAVE KEY

- You can rebind all of your keys in the control menu

- If you give your companion a torch they will use it at night-[LINK](http://i.imgur.com/FOaQv.jpg)

- If you want to keep sprinting don't let your stamina run out fully as it takes a few seconds to starts regenerating

- If you see oil on the ground there is usually a lamp you can knock on the ground to set the oil on fire

- You can dismount a horse in the water and then mount it again to have regular speed-[LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5vEgQxkQqA)

- You can equip a pickaxe and ""hit"" the ore vein to start mining, likewise you can dualweild them to mine faster

- Waiting (Press T) will fill up your Magika/Health/Stamina bar instantly

- Try reading every book you see, the bigger the value of it, the more likely it has a free skill up or a quest inside waiting for you

- To hide your UI while taking screenshots type in **tm** in console (~), then type it again to bring it back

- Sometimes if a dragon is not landing for a long time try moving to more clear surroundings

- You can take torches off the wall to make the room more dark if you are trying to sneak

- When attacking with  bow from far away press the sneak button to do double damage, even if you are not a sneaky character

- Most items that you put inside your home will stay there, so you can safely decorate it however you like

- Using Unrelenting force will stop any enemy casting/channeling

- Every major city stables has a wagon which you can use to fastravel to other cities you've never been to

- In most major holds there is a map with little flags on it that you can use to mark new places on your map

- You can buy a dog form a breeder outside Markath for a small price

- Your horse can climb up mountains that you couldn't on foot.

- You can take keys from your companions to have access to their house

- If the NPCs are asking you about your health (""feeling sick?"" or ""You feeling alright?"") that means you have a disease, use a shrine to cleanse it, or craft a disease curing potion and drink it

- Don't sell all of your magical weapons since you can disenchant them and level up your enchanting skill that way

- You can place baskets on peoples head and then steal their stuff without them noticing -[LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxjwv5bjQTY)

- You can hotkey your favorite items by opening the favorite menu (Q), highlighting the item and click 1-8 buttons on your keyboard

- Fire does the most raw damage,Frost and Shock do the same amount of damage, but ice drains stamina and slows the enemy, and Lightning drains magicka.

- You can revive every living creature except dragons with the Reanimate spells in the Conjuration tree

- Making Iron daggers and Leather Bracers is a quick way to level up early smithing, use them for enchanting skill ups or sell them to a vendor for speech skill ups

- When you increase your stamina you also increase your maximum carry capacity by 5

- By holding the ""Use"" key you can move items around.

- When you trade armor to your companions they automatically equip it if its better then what they currently have.

- Resting in a bed will give you rested status, allowing for bonus XP gain, resting in your own bed (inside your house or one you purchased at the inn) will give you a well rested status allowing for even more bonus XP

- By wearing Amulet of Mara (which you can buy in Riften for 200g) you have an option to marry people, marriage provides all sorts of benefits for you. For more info on marriage and list of spouses [SEE HERE](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Marriage)

- To see locations of quests on your map select them in your journal and hit M

- To discover new dragon shout words talk to the Argenier the Greybeard leader in the High Hrothgar and he will give you a small side quest and direct you to a new world wall one a time.

- You can fast travel while over encumbered with a horse

- If you are completely outmatched against a mage (as in, an enemy that uses ONLY magic), try to get behind cover. If you can stay behind cover long enough while the enemy is shooting at you, their magicka will eventually drain, and you can then use a weapon/spell that drains magicka to finish them off while they sit there, helpless

- If you are a mage or archer who is outmatched by a melee-only enemy, you can use the terrain to your advantage. If you see a cliff, jump on top of it and your enemy usually won't be able to follow you, giving you precious time to deal damage while avoiding the enemy.

- If you are playing a mage character, make sure you check out the Mage College in Winterhold. Just be ready for a very challenging quest chain.

- If you are playing a stealthy character, ask your nearest innkeeper about rumors..

- Best way to skill up Sneak is preforming sneak attacks

- Summoned creatures ( through spells or scrolls) are very powerful and can be a great help in some of the tough boss fights, dragon priests come to mind.

- Saving enchanted weapons and disenchanting them will let you level enchanting extremely fast and make good profit out of it since enchanted items are worth more

- You can hotkey spells and equipment on the Xbox (and probably the PS3, someone will have to check) by favoriting an item/spell, then holding left or right on the d-pad in the favorites menu with the item/spell you want to hotkey selected. After you close the favorites menu, you will then be able to switch to whatever you hotkeyed by hitting left or right

- Atronachs are completely immune to spells of their own type, so if you are mainly a fire spell user, the best atronach to use is the fire one, as you can use your spells without needing to worry about damaging your minion.

- Your companion can carry an unlimited number and weight of stuff, but only if you tell them to pick them up in command mode.

- Guardian Stones! There are 13 of them across Skyrim. You can have 1 active at a time, but you can change them at will.

The Warrior Stone - Combat skills increase 20% faster.                   
The Thief Stone - Stealth skills increase 20% faster.
The Mage Stone - Magic skills improve 20% faster.
The Lover Stone - All skills improve 15% faster.
The Apprentice Stone - Recover Magicka twice as fast; twice as vulnerable to magic.
The Atronach Stone - 50 extra points of Magicka, 50% Absorb spells, -50% Magicka regen.
The Lady Stone - Regenerate Health and Stamina 25% Faster.
The Lord Stone - 50 points of damage resistance, 25% magic resistance.
The Ritual Stone - Raises all the dead around you to fight for you once per day.
The Serpent Stone - Paralyze the target for 5 seconds, and do 25 points of damage once per day.
The Shadow Stone - Invisibility for 60 seconds once per day.
The Steed Stone - Carry weight +100, no movement penalty from armor.
The Tower Stone - Unlock any expert level lock (or lower) once per day.


- Grelka appears in Riften after joining the thieves guild. She has over 3300 gold and will buy everything you want to sell

- instead of stealing things directly and risk getting caught, pick them up and move them to a secluded room. Then steal the item, hidden from sight.

- a good way to level up alteration and rake in some gold coin is by buying/mining iron ore and using the transmute spell to silver and then gold, smelting into bars crafting into jewelry and selling them to vendors

- If you make a trainer your companion you can train from them and then take all of your gold right back

- Shooting a fireball directly at a mage with a active ward will render the fireball harmless, but a fireball to the ground close to the mage ignores the ward and does full damage.

- If you are being attacked by the guards you can yield by sheathing your weapon and they will stop attacking and try to arrest you instead

- After serving time in jail/paying off the bounty you can go back in side the jail and retrieve your stolen items. They are usually in chests some where, marked as Prisoner Evidence.

- [READ THIS IF UR PLAYING A MAGE](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mb8la/massive_list_of_all_the_tips_and_tricks/c2zpedd) Tons of great stuff on destruction, too long to post them all so just read through this. Thanks evilnight!

- If enemy preforms a summon while fighting you killing the summoner 1st will automatically kill off the summoned creature

- Swords swing faster then axes and axes swing faster then maces.

- Eating an ingredient will only unlock its first effect, to discover more effects you need to start crafting potions

- You can pickpocket the gold back after you spent it on training

- Giving gold to a beggar will put a blessing on you that increases your speech skill by 10

- [Map with all skyrim locations](http://www.realsg.com/2011/11/guide-skyrim-complete-locations-map.html)

- When you break a pick or turn the lock when it's in the wrong position, the pick will ""flick"" towards the correct position. Paying attention to that should save a lot of picks.

- The experience towards speechcraft you gain from trading with merchants is based on the value. However, you only gain experience for that one unit.

- Dragon claws, have the code to open doors on the back of the item look at it in your inventory by zooming in.",,False,self,t5_2s837,1364250446.0,,flair-7,True,t3_mb8la,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mb8la/massive_list_of_all_the_tips_and_tricks/,

&gt;Yesterday, (27th November), I was taking a coach from &lt;redacted&gt;
(England) to London. There was a person sitting on the seats infront playing Skyrim.

&gt;He then went on his phone and started browsing Reddit. After a while of pondering what to do, and the fact I'm so socially awkward I did nothing and fell asleep.

&gt;I woke up at the London coach station, and he was already gone, but a phone was underneath his seat.

&gt;I want to return his phone, but I have no idea who it is.

&gt; tl;dr Was on the &lt;redacted&gt; Coach from &lt;redacted&gt; - London (27/11/11 ~ 8PM GMT) Guy playing Skyrim and Redditing (on the /r/skyrim subreddit)

1373455898.0,1892,self.skyrim,1i023d,The metals of Skyrim: In-game and real life,2988,1096,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1i023d/the_metals_of_skyrim_ingame_and_real_life/,"I found out quite a while ago that most of the metals used to make weapons and armor in Skyrim actually exist in the real world. I was looking at what Ebony actually was, curiosity got the better of me and I was soon researching all of the metals used in Skyrim! My results are below:

To start off, here are all the metals used that have no difference between Skyrim and reality: 

**Gold**, **Iron**, **Steel**, **Silver**

These metals are the same as they are in real life, so there's no need to go into detail. Now the fun stuff! 
___
**Dwarven Metal**

It's not known what exactly Dwarven metal is made of in Skyrim, so I can only guess as to what it is. Given its color, it might be an alloy of Copper, perhaps a type of bronze or brass. This metal is clearly supposed to have an air of mystery to it, so only the Dwemer know what it is and how to make it, and they aren't going to tell us anytime soon...
___
**Orichalcum**

Orichalcum has, through history, always been fictitious. It was first mentioned by Plato when he talked about Atlantis and all its riches, and has since been a material of fantasy worlds. It's been known to have several different iterations (sometimes it's a bronze alloy smelted with a special mineral, others it's own mineral mined from the earth), but in the end, Orichalcum has never actually existed. 

**[IdoNOThateNEVER](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1i023d/the_metals_of_skyrim_ingame_and_real_life/caztktp)** added that Orichalcum exists to this day in Greece, where it is the name for a metal we know as Brass!
___

**Malachite**

Malachite does exist! It's Copper Carbonate -a type of mineral- and forms basically as a type of runoff from copper deposits. It's not uncommon, and is used for decorations and jewelry. The Malachite in Skyrim is known as ""glass"" because it's a type of volcanic runoff (basically a blue-green obsidian) and is extremely sharp and lightweight. However in reality, Malachite is not durable(or that light) and would most likely just crack if refined into a blade.
___
**Quicksilver**

Quicksilver in Skyrim is used as a type of binding agent (I think) alongside Moonstone to make Elven weapons and armor. However, Quicksilver is just another name for plain ol' Mercury, so it would never be able to be mined or even smelted into ingots. In fact, adding Mercury to the intense heat of a smelter would  turn it into mercury gas, which is intensely toxic to just about everything.
___
**Moonstone**

Moonstone's primary use in Skyrim is for Elven and glass armor/weapons. In real life, Moonstone is  a type of mineral gemstone (a form of Feldspar -an extremely common type of mineral), and is not too far from how it looks in-game. There's little information on what Moonstone actually is in Skyrim, so it's entirely possible that they are the same mineral. Moonstone is hard and brittle, so forging it with other metals would be required to make it effective for battle (though I'm sure it can't be ""forged"" at all).
___
**Ebony**

Ebony in Skyrim is an extremely precious resource(its mining is protected under Imperial law). It's a type of volcanic product commonly found on Vvardenfell, and through Solstheim and Skyrim. It continually mirrors Obsidian (volcanic glass) in real life, but shares its name with a type of black hardwood used as decoration (like for black piano keys!). In reality, Obsidian would make terrible armor, but a small blade (like an arrowhead) can be easily made and put to deadly effect, as Obsidian is incredibly sharp - but also quite brittle. In-game, Ebony can be worked and forged like a metal, though this is simply not possible with obsidian as melting down the volcanic glass would render it useless. 
___
**Corundum** 

Saved this for last. I actually knew what corundum was before researching. In Skyrim Corundum seems to be a type of metal, when in actuality it's the crystallized form of Aluminum Oxide -also known as Alumina- the main source of Aluminum. It's naturally transparent and is used as a decorative gemstone, and sometimes the corundum is flawed with certain minerals, being stained all sorts of colors. In fact, Corundum is the base gemstone for rubies and sapphires, which are nothing more than flawed pieces of solidified alumina. Interestingly enough, one of steels base components is Aluminum, though there's a lot more that's needed in its smelting than just Corundum. 
___

Thanks for reading if you got this far! I did a bunch of this research a while ago and decided to write up out of boredom now. I though at least a few people would find this interesting!

It's time to talk.,4450,2732,465,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/xmuzk/rskyrim_its_time_to_talk/,"Every day, this subreddit gets a bunch of wiki links. Only one problem with that: they link to the [Elder Scrolls Wiki](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Wiki) instead of the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](http://uesp.net/).

This needs to stop. Its information has mislead people multiple times and is full of misinformation overall. It doesn't take long to find some bullshit on it, but [for the lazy here is one of the most egregious examples](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Elder_Council).

It does have some correct information... Which is about 5% of the whole site. And note, those parts are straight up copypastes from UESP! It's a pretty horrible wiki. And is full of ads too and a bad layout. The *only* reason the other was created was because of the Skyrim hype - try looking up anything that is from Oblivion and before, you won't find anything.

So why should you use the UESP instead? For first it has history. It was there since the late nineties for Arena and mainly Daggerfall. The second point is also very important: it is, behind the Imperial Library, the best source for Elder Scrolls history and lore. Some would say it's more *practical* than the IL even if not as resourceful.

**I don't get karma for this, so please upvote this post so more people can see it!**

In short, the UESP has a lot more information and is extremely complete, and the ElderScrollsWikia is crap. Thank you everyone and sorry for the long read.",,False,self,t5_2s837,False,,flair-12,True,t3_xmuzk,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/xmuzk/rskyrim_its_time_to_talk/,

Tl;Dr: I translated them from the Elder Futhark runic language, and they each say something strange. 

NOTE: These translations were of my own work and other people who filled in the blanks or corrected me on things. I do not claim entire credit for it.

The runes on the bee one translate to GIANT/THOR-HAIL-NEED

The runes on the butterfly one translate to JOY-ICE-SORROW

The runes on the dragonfly one translate to NEED-HORSE-LAKE.

The runes on the moth one translate to DAY-NEED.

The runes on the torchbug one translate to YEW TREE-HORSE-HAIL-NEED.

There have been many theories created while this thread has existed, most notable of which are mentioned below.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: This has blown up from runes on bug jars to theories about a religious Altmer trial to wipe mankind off of the plane of existence and from Tamriel. There's two likely theories here: the first one should be easy to find, it's the top comment, and the second one expands upon the Weynon stones, for which I will include a link: http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/nklj2/you_know_those_runes_on_the_lids_of_the_bug_jars/c39wpky

EDIT:EDIT: Upon recent investigation, I'm not sure if all of my translations were completely right. Either way, this translation of the runes has led to the discovery of the Transmutation circle between the five cities, so this could still mean something. A more accurate translation and meaning of the sets of runes: http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/nklj2/you_know_those_runes_on_the_lids_of_the_bug_jars/c39z2gn

I'm feeling this is required for the lazy, but here's a Tl;dr of the two prime conspiracy theories.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Someone noticed the connection between the five cities Morthal, Whiterun, Winterhold, Dawnstar, and Windhelm,  and realized they formed a Pentagon. He also noticed three dragon ""sanctuaries"" or whatever you may call them, Mzinchaleft, and the Tower Stone formed a smaller pentagon within it, making a transmutation circle. In the general area of the middle of the circle, there is a shrine to Talos with a circle of stones around it. His theory was that if you placed the bugs on their respective cities (see post for relation between bugs and cities), committed genocide in those ctities, kill the dragons at the dragon areas and the one that Mzinchaleft leads to, activate the tower stone, and wait for the ""Promised Day"".

______________________________________________________________________________________________
The second one expands upon the Weynon stones. The guy figured out that the Thalmor are trying to erase mankind from existence, and the things that are stopping them are the eight towers:

Crystal Tower

Red Tower

Tree-sap

Orchalc

Khajiit

all of which were destroyed or deactivated. The most significant and only remaining one are the Brass Tower and Snow-Throat, or the Throat of the World. The Brass Tower was cast out of time. The tower may have a spiritual connection with Numidium, the brass god, and the disappearance of the tower and therefore Numidium may tie in with the disappearance of the Dwemer. Snow Throat is the only active one. Each of these towers have stones which bind them to Nirn, and the theorist concluded that the Weynon Stones bound Snow Throat. This is why the Thalmor have been waging war on Skyrim; so they can destroy Snow Throat or the Weynon Stones, either way destroying the last tower and wiping mankind from existence.

I really think they deserve to be the wiki getting our traffic and contributions.

A new wiki is out , called The Elder Scrolls wiki and they've contributed much less to the community over time and are basically piggy-backing on what UESP wiki has accomplished.  They're also showing up ahead of UESP wiki on search results and thus far basically only have Skyrim info.  
The Elder Scrolls wiki is using Skyrim's (and the Elder Scrolls) new-found popularity in order to break ahead.

Basically, I'd just like to remind people not to forget a reliable old friend; the UESP wiki.

Feel free to disagree and share your opinions.


**edit:** With the amount of discussion this topic has garnered, I now realize that I should've actually asked ""Which wiki do *you* prefer?""    Obviously, I personally prefer the UESP wiki, but I'm proud that I was able to open a discussion and let people give their feedback.  Read over the comments and decide which wiki **you** prefer to use, if not both!

Yea there's some more content coming out, Yea PS3 is getting a bit shafted. It's fine and funny to complain but some of you are taking this as a fucking personal attack. Bethesda didn't kick your door in, kill your animals and call you ugly. They announced a new DLC, a fucking worthwhile one in my opinion. 

I mean fuck, Bethesda is one of the only companies doing shit right in the gaming world. Then we have fuckers like EA trying to rape creativity from the world as we know it. That's another rant for another day. But holy hell what happened to this community? You don't get ""fair treatment"" and suddenly everyone's got out their e-pitchforks.

You know who'd like some fair treatment? The employee. The average game developer, tester, and TD is working 60+ hours and getting paid for 40 to meet the insane deadlines demanded by their asshole fans and management. Good looking, complex and WORKING games haven't gotten too much easier to make, people are just willing to put up with more shit to make them.

**My fucking point:**
PS3, you got picked last for dodge ball. There's good, solid reasoning behind releasing for Microsoft first. That is undeniable fact. Bethesda doesn't have to be fair, but they try to. Thats better than most. Understand that you know less than them, come off your pedestal, you could not manage their team better. Porting is not pushing a button and walking away. It's hard and stupid, and filled with endless QA testing. They're not going to give you a date because they don't fucking know. Champ up and act like adults.

She studies the wiki, she helps people on forums, She has over 400 hours in to the game. She has done pretty much everything there is to do and then some.. She cant stop talking about the dragonborn expansion so with that said.. I want to make her a Skyrim book like i have seen a couple people do on here. I dont have a huge budget but i want to make it badass! I found a pdf of all the skyrim books.. So this is where i need you guys.. 

1. Where is a good place to have the pages printed on good paper/cut/prepped 
2. Where do i have it bound in something aged.. or old?

Appreciate any help!

**edit:** Wow! I never expected this kind of response! A Bookbinder got in touch with me and offered help. If financially it doesnt work out.. i will follow one of these guides and make it happen. Also I will try the tea wash on the pages and also singing a few of them to add to the aged look. I will probably also spring for the art book and dragon figure on ebay.. You guys are all so awesome! Thanks so much for all the ideas and help!

**2nd Edit:** For Clarification yes i am 28, yes she is 16.. she is my stepdaughter. I have had her as my daughter for 10 years now.. I also have another step daughter age 13.. and for you history crawlers.. the 3 year old Batgirl is my own daughter.",,False,self,t5_2s837,1352394133.0,,flair-24,True,t3_12ugow,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/12ugow/please_help_a_dad_out/,

",2137,853,458,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf9rp/i_am_a_professional_ux_designer_working_on_a_ui/,"These designs are all low fidelity sketchy wireframes, so we can focus on the information architecture rather than the skin and graphics. 

 The idea is to unite all of the separate screens into a single tabbed interface, which better supports advanced sorting and mouse interaction.

Here is a [inventory mockup](http://i.img.tc/21499753.png), the important things are:  Each item has an icon/image for easy identification at a glance, there are a number of properties of each item which they can be sorted by, and there are selection check boxes so that one action can be performed on multiple items at once. There is a character tab, which functions as a vanity window.

Here is a [magic mockup](http://i.img.tc/21499771.png) the important points are: Spell icons, No vanity tab since spells do not change your appearance, sortable properties columns, no mass action checkboxes.

Here is a [skills mockup](http://i.img.tc/21499789.png), the important points being: The visually impressive constellation theme is retained, while incorporating the idea of showing all the skills and their progress at a glance. There are a number of interaction models here, with the most important one being the ability to click on a specific skill and be taken to its tree instantly, rather than trying to rotate through the wheel.   

 On each page most things are now more noticeable at a glance, there is far less unused space, the fancy graphics are retained and even extended while making everything more intuitive. 

 I still feel like these need some work, there need to be action buttons incorporated somehow, so that all actions can be performed with just the mouse, perhaps a gesture based interaction model could work? Despite being early days, I feel that this kind of design would already be a lot more usable. 

So, what do you think? ",,False,self,t5_2s837,False,,flair-14,True,t3_mf9rp,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mf9rp/i_am_a_professional_ux_designer_working_on_a_ui/,

1360331908.0,1267,self.skyrim,184prp,"I'm not a mod, but I have a request.",2104,837,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/184prp/im_not_a_mod_but_i_have_a_request/,"Hey folks,

Just thought I would drop a line and talk to everyone for a minute, because I know the recent release of DLC for PC ~~and PS3~~ has brought a lot of old fans back to us (and let a lot of new fans find us). And that's great! Welcome!

However, there is a pretty clear trend in this sub, and I think anyone who has been here a while knows it. Every time a new piece of game content comes out, the sub is *flooded* with screenshots of every single new thing in the game.

*""Check out how badass my character is in the stalhrim armor!""*

*""LOL the rieklings look derpy""*

*""Full dragonbone, full dragon aspect, on a dragon, with dragon boots and a dragon cape mod.""*

Now, before you reach for the blue arrow, I want to stress that this isn't a ""we saw this stuff when it came out on Xbox, so we're bored with it"" post. *Dragonborn* and *Dawnguard* are awesome expansions - they add a lot of really good looking stuff to the game. If you're experiencing that for the first time, it's natural for you to want to show it off.

My complaint is that this flood of screenshots is burying content which is actually original and interesting. People asking for help with quests, glitches, or gameplay are being ignored because of another batch of 100 shots of the soul cairn skybox.

If you didn't know, there is a whole subreddit *dedicated* to [Skyrim screenshots](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimPorn/). It has members that *want* to see them.

I don't think all screenshots need to go away - if you find something truly unique, unusual, or unexplainable, post away. But I would humbly ask that you take your collections of vanity shots, landscape studies, and ""check out how cool my [fill in the blank]"" posts over there.

**TL;dr:** This sub is being flooded with screenshots that should be [submitted elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimPorn/), and we are losing valuable content as a result.

P.S. If I'm the only one here with this opinion, I'll happily just shut my mouth and deal with it. However, the amount of downvotes those posts receive leads me to believe that most of us are on the same page.

**EDIT:** I don't care about screenshots. I care about users that post dozens and dozens of posts that are generic, bland, and uninteresting content for whatever karma they can get.

Yes, we can downvote things. Yes, we can all contribute a little more. But the problem is that *there already is quality content here*, it's just being buried under garbage. On any other site, it would be considered SPAM.",,False,self,t5_2s837,1360344165.0,,flair-20,True,t3_184prp,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/184prp/im_not_a_mod_but_i_have_a_request/,

1322798491.0,1180,self.skyrim,mx3do,"Aela, NOOOOOOOOO!!!",2483,1303,279,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mx3do/aela_nooooooooo/,"This is a sad story. 

Aela the Huntress has been my companion through thin and thick for most of my character's experience in Skyrim. I can't count the number of times when I missed a crucial shot, and prayed to the heavens that I wouldn't be one-hit-KO'd - when Aela would slam an arrow into the monster's side to send it crashing to the ground, lifeless at my feet. 

Wherever I journeyed, she'd always be there, watching my back, whether it was a frozen mountainside or the deep dark of Blackreach. She was such a good companion for me, since I'm a stealthy archer. She was similarly skilled, so she never gave our position away, even to the most perceptive enemies. 

Long story short, she was my trusted companion, and I can't imagine having anyone else to guard my back. 

Tonight, I was traveling to Markarth. I'd reached the small crossroads just east of the city, when I noticed - wait, where's Aela? I looked behind me, and she was nowhere to be seen. Bah, the woman's gotten herself lost again. But usually, if I waited for a second or two, I'd be able to see her torch waving in the distance, and I'd only have to wait a little while for her to catch up. 

Which is why I decided to wait. But... then, a roar. And not any roar; THAT roar. The full moon in the still night sky was momentarily shrouded by a pair of massive, scaled wings, and I knew that battle was upon me. Cursing my luck at this ill timing, I nonetheless drew forth my bow. I'd have to do without Aela's help. 

The battle went as usual. The dragon circled me and tried to fry me with its fiery breath, while I sprinted and dodged, loosing shafts of ebony death up at him whenever I could. This game of cat and mouse continued, until the dragon got impatient and landed. 

When I recovered from the shock, I noticed that I was completely in the open. I knew the breath was coming - and surely enough, the dragon inhaled deeply. I let forth a powerful blast of unrelenting force at the beast, who reeled at the impact. I drew my swords with a battlecry and began to slice at the dragon's head. 

The beast recovered quickly - too quickly - and those jaws lined with deadly teeth snapped at me. I could feel my heartbeat, and knew that I was gravely, gravely injured. I desperately fished in my bag for some potions, and found few. Worst of all, I had no way to stop the dragon's relentless assault. I'd been too reckless; I should have only closed the distance after weakening the dragon further. 

And then; the sound of an arrow, cutting through the air. The dragon buckles and turns away from my gasping form with a snarl. I glance to my side, and there she is - that familiar sight, of a woman with a bow, rocking that Forsworn armor, defiant and valiant. She'd come to my rescue again. I sighed in relief and gave myself time to recover. I retreated and let Aela take the heat for a while. Surely, she'd bring forth her shield... 

...but she did not. She was still aiming at the dragon's head when the beast snapped at her, buckling her legs. Then it continued its assault, and I watched in silent horror as the dragon's maw clasped around her form, and thrashed around with her body gnashing between its teeth before throwing her lifeless corpse away like a rag. 

All I saw was red. My thu'um had once again filled my throat, and it came back with a vengeance. I tore open the Dragon's head with my swords, all notions of strategy wiped from thought. 

When the dragon finally fell at my feet and I felt its soul surging into me, I stood still in silent vigil, blades still dripping with blood, mourning the death of my companion, who had once again saved my life - this time, at the cost of her own. Then I realized what I had to do. I couldn't leave her body to rot in the wilderness. She deserved dignity in death, at the very least. 

It was surprisingly easy to find the body, even though it was dark. Her pale form was crumpled up against a boulder. Her distinctive armor was easy to identify; I'd reinforced that armor myself, with my own hands. I slowly approached, sighing; and then realized that the corpse was wearing a headdress. 

Aela wears a circlet. 

What the... and then it hit me. 

I realized that my valiant hero had actually been a Forsworn forager. 

I turned around to the sound of footsteps and saw Aela the Huntress, wearing her Circlet of Major Archery and the Forsworn armor that I had upgraded with my own hands, nonchalantly approaching me with a torch in one hand. She stared at me blankly until she noticed my look, and then she said, 

""We've stopped. What is it?"" 

I stared at her stupendously, before I yelled:
