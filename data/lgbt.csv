To the user who gave me gold, thank you very much! And there are questions that need answering, which will be found at the bottom.

EDIT EDIT: I didn't expect anywhere near this level of response - I've made one or two edits for clarity's sake.

Context: I teach Grade 8 (13-14 years old) in Ontario, Canada. I am gay, and my students have known this for about a month or so. I am in my first year of teaching, and I am teaching something of a ""tough"" class. 

In particular, I have one group of boys that can be a bit of a pain in the neck. Never keep their hands to themselves, always talk out of turn, have gotten in fights, etc. There is one boy in this group (he will be known here as Harry) who is a little quieter than the others, but very popular. He’s a bit tough to get close to, and seems like the type to be resistant to new ideas and different people. He hangs out with another tough kid (let’s call him Mark), who is loud and boisterous and often rude.

Now that it’s so close to the end of the year, I do a “YouTube of the Day” with them every morning. Kids can send in a short YouTube video for me to show to the class, I preview it, and if it’s appropriate, I play it. So this morning, Harry comes up to me and says, “I have a video I want to play.”

Now, I preview things for a reason. There are enough horror stories out there of teachers accidentally showing their kids porn for me to be very careful what I show my class. So I tell him to send it to me because, y’know, them’s the rules. 

“I really want to show it,” he says back. “You’ll like it, I promise. It’s a music video.”

Given what Harry listens to, I’m wary. He listens to a lot of rap and hip-hop, and that’s fine, but I’ve heard some non-school-appropriate language come out of the music he listens to. So I ask him if it’s appropriate for school; he tells me yes. 

This kid is many things, but he has never lied to me, that I am aware of. Not once. So… I take a deep breath and tell him okay. What the heck. 

(Note: I did read the lyrics, and they were beautiful, but what came next was unexpectedly awesome.)

So he goes on over and pulls it on up, and on comes a song I have never heard before. The artist is rapping about growing up gay, about the struggles of being gay, and about standing up in the face of hatred and homophobia. “Same Love,” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. The video was beautiful. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0.

And there’s Harry, proudly watching along with the rest of the class as the artist stands up for those gay kids who struggle, and the video shows a difficult, lonely life culminating in a fabulous wedding. Harry. My “tough kid.”

The video finishes, the kids applaud, and I thank him, and he says to me, “I told you you’d like it.”

And then his loud, rude friend Mark says: “That was for you, Mr. K.”

The whole class applauded again – for me this time – and then I cried. I cried the proudest tears I have ever shed. 

Harry and Mark… they might tick off every teacher they ever have, but today they gave this teacher a moment he’ll never forget.  

tl;dr: Tough kid in my class showed a music video whose message is to stand up against homophobia, and the class cheered. 


Important Questions Answered:

- Yup, I got that Macklemore isn't gay. He says it in the song. I think that makes it all the more awesome. 
- I told my kids I was gay for a few reasons, but primarily because I think it's extremely important for gay teachers to out themselves to their students. This gives kids positive, successful queer role models. 
Having said that, my school board has an explicit anti-discrimination policy, so I can understand that it might not be safe for some teachers in the USA to do so. Remember, I'm a Canuck. 
- To the idea that my sexuality is my own business, this reminds me of the argument against teaching kids about gay people because ""they don't need to know about gay sex."" My answer to that is a two-parter: 1) you don't need to talk about sex to talk about relationships. Kids understand relationships, and I have talked about the LGBT community to kids as young as Grade 4. 2) Lots and lots of teachers keep a photo of their loved ones on their desk - why should I have to be any different? 
- No, to my shame, I hadn't yet heard of Macklemore, really. I HAD heard of the Thrift Shop song but I hadn't listened to it. I sometimes avoid things that are over-hyped.
- ""Pink Day"", the occasion on which I outed myself to my students, is a day (up here? Not sure about the States) where people wear pink to stand up against (primarily homo/transphobic) bullying. My tough class didn't bring pink, but they went ahead and wore the pink bandanas I brought in!
- My school/school board is in a very multicultural area of the province; there are a lot of immigrants from south Asian and middle-eastern countries, which makes me all that much more proud of my class, because I know (and they have told me) that many of their folks back home don't exactly approve of teh gayz. So, though it isn't a high Christian-evangelical population, it isn't a giant left-wing backyard either.
And of course, for the record, I grew up in this community (and I am a pasty white boy myself) and I absolutely love the diversity in this area, and I love teaching it. Talk about learning a lot!
- As for the controversy surrounding this song in a classroom down south (south of me, perhaps not actually SOUTH south), I'm glad that I live up here...
... because honestly this isn't the most controversial thing I've done by a longshot. A few months ago I had a trans* guest speaker come in and talk about his experience to two different homeroom classes, and it was simply wonderful, and the kids were super respectful. 

Thank you for the commentary everyone! Much love!

This same christmas, my brother was visiting from Brazil with his wife and his 7 year old daughter.

When it came to gift opening, everyone got really awesome gifts, between game consoles, and tvs and laptops, all I got from my family were very manly gifts that I so hated, like tuxedos and shoes (which were donated the next day to a charity for people who need them), and saw that nobody gave a crap about it despite me being super sad about it, everyone was too busy looking at their gifts, I gave my niece a wii with like 3 games and she loved it.

Anyway, night settled in, we ate our dinner, and I was still supper bummed out but hiding it well. When everyone went to do their own thing, between playing with their gifts or just talking, my niece tugged on my pants when nobody was looking and asked me to follow her quietly, I thought she was bringing me to play wii with her, but she dragged me upstairs to her room, and she asked me to close the door behind me, at this point I still have no idea what's going on.

Right now I'm staring at her, and she turns around, she opens  up this drawer, takes out a bunch of her clothes out and takes out 3 tiny boxes and hands them to me. 

I open them and they're really really cute earrings, and she tells me: ""I saved up some of my lunch money and got you these earrings so you can be pretty like me one day""

I have never cried so much in my life, nowadays everything is a lot better, and my family has come to accept who I am.

**EDIT:** Wow, that was a lot of responses, thank you everyone, I will post a picture of the earrings when I get home :)

After failing to show their IDs (which they didn't have), they are maced and one of the men is hit by a car while being placed under arrest in the road. That young man is now in critical condition. Reddit, please bring attention to this.",2233,957,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/nvdyy/police_stop_gay_couple_walking_on_christmas_night/,"From WTOV9 (link below): BRILLIANT, Oh.

An officer and a Brilliant man are both hospitalized after getting hit by a car Christmas night.

On Wednesday night, Barry Starcher, of Brilliant, told Natalie Herbick his side of the story.

Starcher faced a judge Wednesday on charges connected to the investigation, but is now out of jail on house arrest. While police have released their version of events, Starcher said his side deserves to be heard. He said both he and his boyfriend, James Coil, feared for their lives.

""Christmas was a bad day that day. We were taking a walk to take a breather,"" Starcher said.

Just after 10 p.m. on Christmas night, Starcher said he and Coil, were approached by an officer along a Brilliant roadway

""He asked, 'What's going on?' and we said, 'Nothing.' He said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'Nothing,'"" Starcher said. ""He said, 'Well, what's your name?' And I said, 'I'm not sure if I should give you that. Why do you want it?' And that's when he jumped out of the car.""

Starcher said the officer started swearing and got in their faces.

Wells Township police said OfficerJ.J. Kamerer only had intentions of lending a helping hand but sensed confrontation and merely wanted identification. Police said Coil threw a prescription bottle at the officer's face.

""He didn't throw the pill bottle at him,"" Starcher said. ""He handed him the pill bottle and said, 'This is the only thing I have that has my name on it.""""

At that point, Starcher admitted, things escalated.

""Jimmy started to mouth off. I mouthed off a little,"" Starcher said. ""I'm guilty of mouthing off.""

Police said Kamerer chased the men on Third Street in Brilliant. Starcher said he never ran, but at one point backed away in fear. He said that after he was sprayed with mace, he couldn't see much but remembered hearing what happened next.

""I heard the officer running into the road screaming, and I see the officer being pushed by the car,"" Starcher said. ""And then all of a sudden the car stopped and the officer flies across the road, and when the car backs up, there's Jimmy laying in the road.""

Coil is in critical condition in a Pittsburgh hospital. Starcher said neither of them wanted to start any problems, and he is just shocked it came to this.

""He's never done anything to anyone,"" Starcher said as he fought back tears. ""He's never done anything to anyone. He didn't deserve this.""

Starcher pleaded no contest in court and was found guilty of obstructing official business and failure to disclose one's personal information. He is set to be sentenced on Jan. 11.

Officer Kamerer is in Wheeling Hospital with a serious leg injury. NEWS9 will make sure his side of the story is heard once he is ready to speak.

[News coverage on the event.](http://www.wtov9.com/news/news/man-speaks-out-about-incident-left-officer-suspect/nGBXb/)

Update on Jimmy's condition via his boyfriend's facebook: ""At this time Jimmy has 35% brain activity, broken pelvis and legs broken arm he is responding to commands he can not breath without the help of a ventilator, we believe he is a fighter and he will pull through this.""

Defenders of the Police officer have taken to Jimmy Coil's support page and have started attacking friends and family there: [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Justice-for-Jimmy-Coil/243257212414738?sk=wall](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Justice-for-Jimmy-Coil/243257212414738?sk=wall)

http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/18i8cq/my_little_brother_is_gay_how_do_i_talk_to_him/

Like many of you suggested, I decided to go with the ""rip the bandaid off quick"" method and talk to him about it over the weekend. I also went with the suggestion of talking to him while we're doing something like an activity or road trip. I'm working on a reloading room project for my house right now,  so I asked him for some help and used that as an excuse to get some conversation going with just the two of us. 

I ended up telling him that I'd seen him in the park with a guy and that I just wanted him to know that if he was gay or straight or bisexual or whatever else that I didn't care and I love him just the same. I said I was sorry if he felt like I was invading his privacy, but I didn't want him to have to worry about telling me and if I was ok with it or not. 

He just looked like he was in shock for a minute, then he cried a little and gave me a hug and said he was gay. Apparently he's been seeing this guy since November and has only told a few friends so far. I guess that explains why he's been s quiet and secretive for the past few months. Anyway, I told him he was more than welcome to bring his boyfriend over so say hello sometime, which he's planning to do next weekend. We talked for a while longer then went and told my girlfriend together, who immediately burst into tears and gave him a big hug. 

I just wanted to say thanks again to everyone here for all the feedback and suggestions.",,False,,t5_2qhh7,False,,,True,t3_18sqvf,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/18sqvf/my_little_brother_is_gay_how_do_i_talk_to_him/,

Since I was young I knew that I was bisexual.  I was a ""straight acting"", captain of the lacrosse team type of guy, but deep down I knew that I was turned on by both sexes.  I had a few experiences growing up, but nothing more than experimentation kind of things.  After highschool I started dating a girl and fell in love.  I thought that I would marry her and my latent questions about my sexuality were essentially moot.  After 3 years together, she introduced me to her gay friend from school, who I'll call Eric.  The moment I saw him (which I remember vividly), I got butterflies in my stomach, instant attraction.  We became friends but I never thought that anything more would come of it.

Eric being a young, hot, twink type, went to a male strip club on an ""amateur night"" where he won the contest and got offered a job.  Not knowing my status, my girlfriend thought it would be an awesome idea to go to his club one night and check it out.  I, of course, didn't put up much of a fight haha.  The next weekend I somehow suggested going back without raising any suspicion from my GF ;).  He was only there for maybe 2 or 3 months before the creepy old guys weren't worth the easy money anymore and he quit, but I was secretly fantasizing a lot by this point.

Before college the next year my girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  However, we couldn't afford it on our own so we asked Eric if he wanted to move in too.  We all signed the lease, but right before school started, my girlfriend got cold feet and we ended up breaking up over it.  Eric and I moved in together and over the course of a few months, we became best friends.  I knew that I was attracted to him, but I struggled with actually pursuing anything because I had always told myself that while I *was* bisexual, I would just limit myself to women.  I figured that it would be easy, like cutting out blondes for a straight guy.  This worked for a few months until one night when we were both pretty drunk and ended up passing out on the couch.  I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't help myself anymore and decided that if I didn't make a pass now, I never would and I'd always wonder ""what if?""

Looking back now, it seems kinda creepy actually, but I kind of let my hand *wander* a bit as I was ""sleeping"".  He *responded* pretty quickly and soon he was grabbing me too.  It escalated very quickly and soon we headed off to my bedroom.  I remember telling him ""This is only about the sex, I don't want to get into an emotional relationship, just sex"".  To which he responded ""Sounds great!"" (typical XD).  

The next 10 months were very complicated for me.  Eric would periodically spend the night in my room, and while I loved it at the time, I couldn't decide what I wanted the next morning.  I went through periods where I felt like I was falling in love, and that would cause me to try and create space between us.  Eventually I decided that I couldn't do it anymore.  I *was* getting emotionally involved and it wasn't fair to Eric to tie him up in my issues, so I cut it off.  We both eventually started dating other people (mine was a girl), and our friendship got very strained due to a lot of jealousy on both sides.   We had emotional fights and I slowly realized that I was in love with him.  After those 10 months, I decided: screw what anyone else thinks, I'm not going to give up a loving relationship just because some person I don't even know might judge me.  I told him I loved him, he told me too.

I told my friends, who were absolutely STUNNED, but very accepting (awesome guys, I love them so much).  I told my parents, who were just as stunned but less accepting.  That was 7 years ago.  We're still together and *very* happy.  My parents have come around and are not only accepting but are now *embracing*, which is freakin' awesome.  We have a dog who we love and while we don't live in a state where gay marriage is legal, I think we'll spend the rest of our lives together. 

So yeah, that's our story.  I hope that this can help somebody who might be struggling with the same kind of issues I was.  It was a tough ride at times, coming out is always hard, but it's been *so* rewarding and it breaks my heart to think that I was so close to throwing it away.

I do feel better but I feel I have lost a parent in the process. It's very sad because I was very close to my dad in high school and early on in college.

Here's the email he sent me at 4:30a this morning...

&lt;email&gt;

Evan,
 
I felt that i needed to write something to you now.
 
I'm absolutely shocked about this. Frankly i've suspected it for a long time since you've shown no interest in girls. I'm still bothered about your lack of interest in &lt;girl&gt;&lt;/girl&gt; at the prom. That was a marrying girl and you should have kept her.
 
Anyway, I have very strong feelings about this whole gay thing in general, which will never change. I dont care whether its a choice or the way some are born, i dont care who else is gay or how fashionable it is now. All i know is that i've lost a son to this madness.
 
Recall that prior to this news i had a lot of issues with you over the past three months. You are selfish, irresponsible, unreliable, thoughtless, untrustworthy and a chronic liar. And ad to that this madness of agnotisism. In my book all that adds up to a bad person who is going to Hell. You've become like someone whom i dont like at all. I told Mom weeks ago that i didnt want to have any Father's Day since the last three years have been so very disappointing. I was very reluctant to come over this time, but i pushed ahead. It was very uncomfortable sitting there with you trying to make small talk with you. You've become like a stranger to me and I feel that you are lost in a wilderness.
 
I do not approve of the way in which you behave or live your life. You've made nothing but bad mistakes since high school and cost me thousands of dollars and much pain and heartache to the point where i had to push away from you for my own safety. I stayed in a loveless sexless marriage with your mother for years just to give you a normal childhood and homelife. You OWE me more than this.
 
You say you ""love"" me. Love is not just a word. It's the most serious word in our world and must be proven with good deeds. You havent done one thing to show me that love in a long long time. All you've done is disappoint me and hurt me. Your mother selfishly cheated me out of more children. I wish i had a back up kid to make up for you.  Now you've selfishly cheated me out of having grandchildren.  I deserve more than this. I never put any demands on you. I never insisted that you join the band or go to law school or be ""like me"". I let you blossom into you. But I'd rather you married, had kids, gave the appearance of a normal life, and if need be then satisfied your aberrant lust in private, like a gentleman.
 
I never want to meet your boyfriend. And frankly, if i could, i'd dispatch him for violating my child. Recall the scene in ""Braveheart"" where the King comes back from France and throws the gay prince's boyfriend out the window.
 
I'm still your father, and on some level even now i still and always will love my only son. I love the little boy you used to be, I love the joy you used to give me. I love how smart you are. You;re very lucky to be healthy and handsome. I've tried to be a good father. I thought i always tried to be a good role model. Apparently i failed miserably. Nonetheless I will always love you.
 
But, I cannot and will not accept this horrible lifestyle that you've chosen, nor your rejection of God. I will not accept it and I cannot do anything for you while you persist in this madness.
 
I'm very hurt, ashamed,. disappointed and feel betrayed. This is not how you love someone. You have obligations to others around you, starting with your family. What you've done is wrong. You need to re-think this. You need to re-think a lot of things. Apparently my wishes and advice have no meaning to you. I've run out of things to say to you.
 
So for now, I need to wait and pray and continue to hope that someday you'll become a man. A good man.
 
Dad
 
&lt;/email&gt;

**Edit:** thank you everyone for you supporting comments, they are very kind and appreciated.

**Edit2:** I can't thank everybody in this community enough for all of your outpouring display of support and comfort over this. I am determined to respond you all of the pm's I recieved, so many of you are so very kind, even to someone in which you have never met. The best thing I can say at the time is Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, thank you and good luck to all of you. Sorry but thats the best i can do at 12:30 and especially after all of this happened today. 

For those curious i have attached a pic of me and Chris(ckryaninko), who has been more than supportive and wonderful through this entire rough experience. *I will say I was tempted with showing this pic to my dad* haha! =D

It seemed completely surreal. After she told me (we were at the local park) we talked for about 3 hours, just walking around  talking, she explained how she has had these feelings for a while (before we started dating) and has just come to terms with it. I was the first person she told. I honestly respect her so much for making that decision. It was actually kinda funny, afterwards we went for ice cream and we were talking about how we were going to explain our sudden breakup to our friends, we were laughing so hard, she suggested that she should fake her death and then hitchhike to Portland Oregon. We then decided that this would make our friendship stronger and we would remain ""The best fucking skiing buddies that have ever lived"" Reddit, I love this girl, we have so much in common, as much as it saddens me that I will never have the same intimacy that we had before, it makes me proud of her, to come out like she did to me takes a metric fuckload of courage. After we talked we made plans to go to the movies, I can tell this is a friendship that will last a long time.

*******************************

I know it's a bit douchey of me to say, but I kind of like this subreddit for bringing interesting news and articles about the LGBT community to my front page here. There were funny posts, well thought-out submissions, things to make you think, laugh, I know we're not all the same and don't all share the same interests, but is anyone else getting a bit annoyed of the front page of this subreddit being flooded with pictures of people just because they happen to be Gay/Lesbian/Transgender? 

Some of it is legit. Like a wedding photo here and there or a cool story to go along with the pic. Lately though, it's mostly ""I'm gay, here is my face."" It's cute and all but the attention whoring is getting to be a bit much. I will probably get flamed for making this post but I figured I'd at least make an attempt at readdressing what we choose to upvote as a community.

If anyone is looking to actually meet people in their area or see what people think of their pictures there is always [r/q4q](http://www.reddit.com/r/q4q). There is also [r/AmIUgly](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly),  [r/AmISexy](http://www.reddit.com/r/amIsexy), [r/MeetLGBT](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetlgbt/), and [/r/lgbtaww](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbtaww) if anyone wants feedback on their pictures. I'm just not believing that some sexy person posting their face pic is really just to ""introduce"" themselves more than whore attention. Really am sorry for being so harsh, but I know we can take it. 

**Edit**: Kinda getting hated on by some people for bringing this up. I'm not going to respond to many more comments here but I'm not going to delete this thread as there seem to be a ton of people who agree that the pictures are getting to be a bit much. It's easier/quicker to stop something you don't like by saying something about it rather than waiting it out. This site is obviously very democratic, so the most I can do is post my opinion and hope that enough awareness happens to at least tilt the subreddit in a slightly less circlejerky direction. Thank you to all who share my views, and thank you to those who can debate without getting pissy.

********************************

I messaged the mods about this and after some discussion they have decided to add another link or so to the sidebar which is more open to these kinds of pics. Keep in mind, they aren't going to regulate the community by deleting them and people are still welcome to post these if they like, but the important thing is that we're raising awareness that there are other subreddits that are popular and devoted to these types of submissions and they might be a better alternative than posting them here. 

Thank you to everyone who supported or discussed the current submission trend and no hard feelings to those that lost their tempers (including me on some of these comments). I really just hope that we can see a trend of more detailed submissions than simple self posts with next to no explanations.

Today i stumbled upon this lgbt subreddit open on your computer, so I probably think it's safe to assume you are gay or bi. I can understand why you would never tell me or mom. She would go balistic and the rest of the family would probably look at you with disgust. This is a shot in the dark, and you probably won't see this, but I love you no matter what and I dont care who you choose to love. I'm still scared to bring it up to you cause I know youre shy and we never discuss our personal business with each other, but I hope my support means something to you. 

Love always,

--Update: So as you can see from the comments, my brother is a smart guy and figured out this was him ( even with the obscure amount of details). We've texted each other back and forth and confirmed its me who made this and him who replied. So of course were going to discuss this later when he comes home. 
Anyways, thank you for everyone showing your support for me and him and for letting him see this. For people saying this is fake, I don't know how I can convince you otherwise, but this is a throwaway account because he knows the name of my other account. I just thought it was better to keep it anonymous incase I was wrong and he wasnt really gay, and he would think I was goober for questioning his sexuality on one of his favorite websites lol.

I guess this started around when I was 11, my friends started becoming interested in boys, but I wasnt, I just didn't find them appealing. I didnt understand it so I thought I was weird, I tried to convince myself some guy was hot, but in reality I didnt care. Instead of finding Justin Bieber and such hot, I was more interested in Emma Watson. I grew more and more attracted to girls, I thought I was a freak and just kept it bottled up until a week ago.

I really wanted to talk to someone about it, but I've never really been close to my parents, they aren't very 'loving' and I dont feel like I can open up to them. And I didn't want to freak out my friends, so I went to my priest.

Im a Catholic, go to a Catholic school and to church every week. Hes been my priest my whole life and there's nobody I trust more than him. He always helped whenever I had any trouble, I even went to him for my first bra because I felt too awkward talking about it to my parents :P

 he's never said anything about homosexuality before, so I was worried because I didnt know how he would react. I managed to work up the courage to come out to him, and we talked, for ages, and it was awesome. He was so accepting and supportive. He kept stresssing how theres nothing wrong with me, how its perfectly natural and that God loves everybody, regardless of sexuality. The conversation made me feel a million times better, and much more comfortable about myself and less like a freak :)

im not sure why im posting this, I guess im just excited because its like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and i just want to show you that most Christians don't think like the westboro baptist church :)

Overall we had a lot of fun and laughs, and this huge rift that used to be between me and my family is pretty much completely gone now. I wanted to cry I was so happy.

1329514584.0,688,self.lgbt,puf5m,11 Tips for the straight guy at the party last night...,1051,363,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/puf5m/11_tips_for_the_straight_guy_at_the_party_last/,"A mutual friend of ours threw a big party for her 30th birthday, tons of people were there and it was a lot of fun. Somewhere along the line you and I ended up on the balcony for some fresh air at the same time. We started chatting; we talked about sports, books, tv – discovered we both are about to start our masters degrees and spent some time debating the pro’s and con’s of the educational system. We talked about hanging out sometime, and you wanted to meet my girlfriend. 

I understand how upsetting it was for you when I blinked mildly in surprise and said I was here with my husband. I know it was a shock to your system, if your face had turned any paler I might have called 911. You made a good recovery though - that hurried mutter of “I’m not like that” was very polite and you only knocked over two drinks and one vase in your hurry to rush to anywhere other than near me. I can’t blame you – I forgot how delicate you straight boys are. So I wanted to give you a few helpful hints about where you went wrong last night. 

1) As a general rule we don’t walk around with big signs around our neck proclaiming our sexuality. No scarlet letters, no scent of hellfire and brimstone… sorry about that. 

2) We do not generally assume that everyone within 5 feet of us must also be homosexual – it was nice of you to immediately reassure me that you are hetero, but it was really unnecessary. 

3) Homosexuality is not infectious. While I am sure you meant no disrespect with your hasty departure; in the future you can rest assured that taking a few extra seconds in your mad dash for safety will not result in you being turned gay. It will however keep you from destroying expensive vases and knocking over senior citizens. 

4) This next one may come as a surprise; but you are not, in fact, irresistible. The fact that you have a dick does not instantly turn me into a bundle of uncontrolled lust. Contrary to popular opinion, being in the same room with a straight man does not cause a gay man to instantly lose all common sense and basic common courtesy. Though I am not so sure about the reverse. 

5) Homosexuals in general get a little irked when people treat us like some sort of leper. Rushing to another mutual friend of ours and advising him of my sexuality, so he could be “forewarned” was really uncalled for. 

6) Upon being told (by said mutual friend) to stop being an idiot and that you were not my type anyway… it generally confuses the issue when you then proceed to become upset that I DON’T find you attractive. Three seconds ago you were running through a crowd of people with your hands cupped protectively over your junk as if I might attack you at any moment with a blowjob. See hint number 4. 

7) We homosexuals have an odd sense of humor – I can’t help that. Something about watching you freak out as if all the demons of hell were after you just struck me as vastly amusing. 

8) While being pissed at me for dissolving into uncontrollable laughter might be understandable… gathering a couple guys together to “teach the fag a lesson” is not. 

9) You might also want to drink a little less and be a little more careful about the guys you approach for your little proto-hate-mob. 

10) Assuming the two tall muscle-bound bruisers must be uber-hetero and just as appalled by my presence as you was your first mistake. It was an understandable one though. How were you to know that pflag tshirt the first guy was wearing wasn’t a sports team? Also the rainbow ring the second guy was wearing could have meant anything I am sure. 

11) In retrospect I suppose that upon hearing your not very subtle hate-talk and seeing who you were heading for; I could have said something instead of just laughing harder. I apologize for that. I should have just introduced you to my husband instead of letting you walk up to him and ask him if he wanted to help you teach “that fag over there” a lesson. I hope that broken nose heals up cleanly.",,False,,t5_2qhh7,False,,,True,t3_puf5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/puf5m/11_tips_for_the_straight_guy_at_the_party_last/,

link to original: [I came out to my parents, it couldn't go worse](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/u9ptx/i_came_out_to_my_parents_it_couldnt_go_worse/)

I am doing this from my main account because I don't care anymore. Sorry it's a novel, but I had to get it out. Over the weekend, I came out to my parents. I didn't plan for it to happen until after I graduated college, but it just came to a head and was unavoidable. 

The plan for the summer was for me to move back in with my parents in and work full time at a bakery. Things were tense all month as I had started meeting guys that I could go out to the local clubs with and dance and have a few drinks. Of course I just told my parents I was going to see a late movie or going to friends' houses. But my mom knew something was up, she called it God talking to her; I call it seeing the obvious. Finally, it all came to a head this weekend while my sister was enrolling for her first year at college (we are attending the same one now). I was supposed to be moving out of my house that weekend as well, so we were all in the same place. Things happened that caused my mom to break, and started accusing me of hiding things, and why was I so protective of my phone, and on and on. So my mom and dad and I sat down in my living room and I came out to them. My dad was furious, started yelling at me; my mom nearly fainted, was crying and the last thing she said before she left was, ""You stay away from me, and you stay away from (my sister)."" 

Within literally 17 minutes of them leaving, they cancelled my car insurance, health insurance, blocked my on facebook, my cell phone was deactivated, and they had left with my paycheck which I was going to use as a deposit for a new apartment. I used facebook to communicate with some friends a little older and much more established than me in a bigger city about an hour away. They told me to grab as much valuable stuff as I could and come down and stay with them for the night. I did, and they were angels. The next day I went back to my house to finish moving my stuff, I found my parents had come back and taken a lot of my stuff. They have half of my clothes, my jeans and summer stuff, and lots of random things were gone. I also learned that my mom had told my boss to fire me (which she did initially and then took it back the next day, but I don't know if I would feel comfortable going back anyways) It was devastating to see that they were trying to hurt me like that. I came back to my friends in the City and they have just been incredible, taking care of me, giving me some of their clothes that didn't fit them to replace some of what my parents took, they even put me on their cell phone plan with one of their old flip phones until I am able to get more established. I am still figuring things out, looking for job, house, etc., but I know it will get better. If anything I am concerned for my sister. We were so close especially these last few years. I actually intended to come out to her before anyone else, and I know she would have been fine with it, if she didn't know already. I didn't even get to say goodbye to her they shut me off so quickly, and I know they are monitoring her phone for me to text her. Eventually I will figure out someway to contact her, but I don't want her to suffer because of me. But I made the right choice. I am free. Even though I have lost my family, I am so happy that I can finally be who I am without hiding anything.

EDIT 1: I just woke up and saw the incredible love and support you guys are giving me, and it is bringing me to tears. Thank you all so much, and I promise to go through and read every one of the comments on here. Many people are asking what city I am in. I am looking for a house and a job in Stillwater, OK. Thank you guys, y'all are incredible.

EDIT 2: I need to explain the whole job/stolen paycheck thing a little. I worked for a bakery in Tulsa that was owned by a precious friend of the family (went to hs with my mom). I had both mine and my sister's paychecks in my backpack, and when I looked after they left, both were gone. Later that night when I was at the friends house (who are a gay couple btw) i received this message on fb from my SISTER's account but it was undoubtedly written by my mom: [message](http://i.imgur.com/wXy3D.png). So I called my boss the next morning from my friend's phone to see if I was indeed fired. Boss (like a second mother) was concerned crying etc, but long story short, I repeatedly said that I had not quit (just in case so I would have legal protection behind me), but she ended with I have to respect your mom's request (this is how scarily controlling my mom can be). Next morning I get a call on friend's phone saying after talking with her business partners, they can't fire me because that would be discrimination (smart). So I technically still have a job there, but I really don't want to go back to Tulsa at all, I need to leave that behind me. 
I did ask her to cancel my paycheck and reissue it, but she said that she talked to my mom and they were going to deposit it. I have yet to see that happen, but if they don't by the days end I will be considering filing a police report.

EDIT 3: Just wanted to give y'all a quick update because each and every one of you has been so kind to me, I wish I could thank every one of you personally. They DID deposit the check into MY account, so that is a big worry off my shoulders. As far as the other stuff goes, I really could use my jeans, shorts, and t-shirts they have, but those are really the only things I need back. Not sure how I am going to go about that one. I don't want any contact with them, but I'll figure it out. Not entirely enthusiastic about bringing the police into it. I have sent messages out to my sister's friends asking them to pass along the message. We'll see if that happens. I also got in touch with the local PFLAG and they are going to pass my resume around to see if I can't get a job. It's starting to come together nice and steadily. I will feel so much better once I have a job.

Let me start with this. My mom is, in simple terms, a Jesus freak. She's stern on her beliefs, and considers many things that have happened in her life a blessing. She's very Christian, I suppose. She said that if she was at gunpoint, and told recant her belief in God, she would be dead.


Anyways, about two months ago, I came out of the closet to her, which was VERY risky (I'm in Utah, the chances rise significantly), because organized religion is TOTALLY against that, and about 80% of the time, they're usually kicked out of their house and not allowed back in the family. It's happened to two of my friends already.


So, tonight, I realized (I guess it had been a while), that she removed the jesus fish off the back of our car. I asked her why.
I was like ""Did you do something against your beliefs? Or are you an atheist now?"" I knew she was very big on her beliefs, and something like that was just... Odd. And she was like ""Neither. I'm a true Christian."" So I asked her to define that.

What she started telling me just absolutely blew me away. She said it was ridiculous that organized religion is being used as a weapon nowadays, and apparently, to believe in god, you have to dress a certain way, and meet in a certain building, and only specific people are allowed to worship god. She said Christians are supposed to love EVERYONE, no matter how they dress, their position in society, all that jazz. She said she was embarassed and offended about how Christians act nowadays, and that she simply couldn't be a part of an organization that preaches that type of stuff. So, when I came out to her two months ago, she removed the fish because it would have been contradicting to supporting me, and hypocritical.

Now, if you know how stubborn Christians are towards their beliefs... That's something HUGE. Like, almost a turning point in her life huge. And it was because of me. I'm atheist, but I still respect that almost more then anything she's ever decided to do. I feel like she's become a martyr in her beliefs for the good of them, and in Utah, which is so organization-based that it's practically a cult, is just fantastic to hear. I'm so grateful for that.



One of those friends that was kicked out was a good friend of our family, and immediately invited to stay at our house for a while. I couldn't be any more proud.

SON, IN THIS HOUSE, THE DOOR ONLY SWINGS IN ONE DIRECTION.""
One dad puts his foot down about his son's sexual preference.....

I was a college professor for many years. One day one of my students, a 19 year old young man, told me he was gay, and had known he was gay since he was 11, but that he could not tell his parents. I got him into contact with a support group on campus and a good counselor.

At the mid-year he went home for Christmas with plans to tell his parents.

His mom was very understanding and let him know that she had pretty much known for years, but his dad was could not accept the truth. He told his son that ""in this house there is a right way and a wrong way and this is wrong. The door only swings in one direction son and if you can't accept that you need to leave.""

This was his Sophomore Year. For the remainder of that year and into the next  he did not go home. He saw his mom and a sister every now and then. I did not see a lot of him senior year. He was very busy with internships etc.

Then come a the graduate honors banquet. He was being honored. I was astounded to see him setting at a table with his boyfriend AND both of his parents, sister and brother. They were all chatting away.

Later I got my former student aside and asked him what was up. He said that at Thanksgiving earlier in the academic year, his mom had insisted that he AND his boyfriend be invited to the house for Thanksgiving.  Mom, and the siblings ganged up on Dad.

It was not an easy afternoon but they made it. My student and his boyfriend drove down and back the same day. At Christmas, they were invited to say for a week. When my student asked if they could share a room, the mom said they could if they were discreet.

Dad grit his teeth and accepted the situation.

On New Years Day, a series of odd circumstances led to his Dad spending the better part of the day with his son and his son's partner. To his great surpise, he discovered he liked the boyfriend and for the first time saw how happy his son was with him. That night at dinner, the dad made a toast to the two of them.

The son looked up and asked: ""I thought the door only swung in one direction?"" His dad grinned back and said: ""It did. So I got a new door.""


Edit: I just re-read it and saw that it said preference in the beginning. I replied to the author with this: ""This is awesome. Thank you for the story. However, I would change the word ""preference"" to orientation. The way I like to describe it is: Preference is WHAT you like to do in bed and  orientation is WHO you do in bed. Preference implies choice, while orientation is innate.""",,False,,t5_2qhh7,1363880685.0,,purple,True,t3_1aqgv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1aqgv8/son_in_this_house_the_door_only_swings_in_one/,

This is probably going to come as a big surprise but I feel a need to write to you about something that has been bothering me for years.

Anywho was I do remember very clearly was a very callous and ignorant response on my part about their struggles. I'm pretty sure I said something like, ""Well they kinda deserve it."" I'm not sure of my exact words. Anyway that was a really horribly callous thing to say, even if I was completely ignorant about these issues at the time. I haven't forgotten that nor the fact that you still stayed my friend. Anyway even if it's crazy amount of years later. I am so sorry. If it's any consolation I have learned through the years to stay open to learning about other people's experiences and struggles and not to jump to convenient conclusions, though I suspect it is something I will work on all my life. Hope all is well with you! Your friend ______""

Help a supportive dad out?,725,114,178,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/yt25j/my_15_year_old_son_just_came_to_me_and_asked_for/,"Hi, LGBT. I'm a straight man, 41 years old, and I have a wonderful wife and two sons. I'm very liberal and I have tried to promote an accepting environment in the house, and my wife has definitely been on the same page. Our oldest son, now 15, has always been a little more feminine but we figured it wasn't a problem and let him play with whatever toys he liked and dress how he wanted growing up. Well, when he was 13 we found that he had been looking at a few gay porn websites. We stayed very calm and tried to approach him in a way that wasn't accusatory and was very understanding. Basically, we told him that it's okay to like boys or girls, but that porn wasn't a good representation of sex in real life and we didn't want him to get false ideas of what's normal. He seemed incredibly embarrassed, as was to be expected, but I think we handled it well.

Two years pass and he has never had a girlfriend, never expressed any interest in girls, has all female friends, etc. He's also become kind of secretive, minimizing whatever windows he's looking at when we walk into his room and he's on the computer. We assumed he's gay, which is NOT a problem in this house, and dropped a few pro-LGBT comments here or there. We figure that, if he is gay, he'll come out when he's ready.

Yesterday he came home from school in tears. I asked him what was wrong, and he wouldn't say but he admitted that he was having gay thoughts and begged me to take him to ""ex-gay"" therapy. He said he read some things on the internet that said it's possible to change, and he hated himself and would do anything to be straight. I hugged him and told him that I wouldn't take him to ""ex-gay"" therapy because he shouldn't try to fix something that's not broken. He just cried and cried, wouldn't say exactly what happened to spark it but I assume some kind of bullying occurred. Today,  he was much calmer but he asked again about ""ex-gay"" therapy.

My wife and I are at a loss. What can we do to help our son? We have made it very clear that we love him NO MATTER WHAT, but that's not enough. Something else is going on here, but he won't tell us what. I will not take him to ""ex-gay"" therapy! What else can we do?

Thank all of you so much! You are all beautiful and lovely and I adore you! The amount of solidarity the queer community has is amazing. In the words of Martin from The Simpsons, [""individually, we are weak like a single twig, but as a bundle, we form a Mighty Faggot'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yZYJSy3N6A). Looks like we put this transphobic homophobic bigot in his place, as he's deleted his account.  A lot of people are telling me that I should've just ignored him, which I can understand. Its a terrible thing to go through, and that definitely might be the best option for some people, and I'm not going to call them out on handling abusive behavior in the way they want.

Buttt...when it comes to transphobes and homophobes, I just don't see ignorance as a valid course of action for myself. The queer movement has never gotten anywhere by being placid and complacent. I do it in real life, when people call me a freak or a faggot, and I'll do it on the Internet, as well. I actually do have a pretty thick skin (thicker than I'd like it to be), so none of it really bothers me, especially this dude who was pretty incompetent at trying to get a reaction from me (In our back and forth, I actually seemed to be the one getting HIM more upset). But the point I'm making is that through pretending it doesn't happen, it not only lets them perhaps think that what they are doing is OK, but it is a disservice to queer people everywhere. If every single queer and ally decided to fight back the next time we get called freaks faggots and trannies, I imagine casual homophobia and transphobia would practically disappear overnight. Of course, those who are actual militant bigots would probably get much more active, but I'd see it as an overall victory. For example, rather than ignoring him, I started this thread. And looks like he deleted his account. I'd take that as a victory, and I haven't got any more messages from him. So rather than ignoring him and having him continue to message me, I've got at least a thousand people to notice him, and looks like he couldn't handle it, so he gave up.

I liked to think of myself as being 100% acceptant of bisexuality. I actually believe people when they tell me they're bisexual (it's gross when gay people are just like ""oh he/she is just gay and confused"" - like we haven't had straight people do that to us), dating bisexual guys is a non-issue (tho I can't say the same about finding one interested in me, but that's a whole other problem, haha), and whenever I hear people say stuff like ""I don't get bisexuality"", I always try to shut that down and explain ""they just like *people* not genders"". But then, I realized I totally do this...

When I meet a guy I like, I wait to see if he somehow indicates that he's interested in men before I consider making a move. I've realized that if the guy gives some indication he's interested in women first, I'm like ""OH WELL GUESS HE'S STRAIGHT"" and give up on him. I wonder now how many bisexual/non-straight guys I've written off just because he could appreciate a fine lady, too. It bugs me that this assumption of ""either gay or straight"" was so deeply rooted in my brain that I've been doing it my whole adult life without even thinking about it. I am resolved not to do this any more.

Anyway, it occurred to me this kind of stuff probably happens to the members of the bisexual community all the time. So I just wanted to apologize for being unintentionally closed minded. I get the impression you guys are already dealing with enough biphobia and homonormativity, on top of the hate GSM already get as whole, without an ""ally"" doing this too!

He was the nicest guy even gave me a month free and extra data. Now while my information was being processed he had to make conversation. He asked me what it was like to live on the Gold Coast, normal stuff then running out of things to say asked if I had a girl friend. I said no but I have a boy friend. He stalled and and giggled a little and said how cool it was and that we must be a cute couple. So I asked him if he had someone. He said It's complicated, after processing my info, he said I want to tell me that he was also gay and he was 'proud' to speak with me. I have a feeling he had never really talked with other gay guys. I told him that we are a special group and we should be proud of who we are. 

At this point we were both having a blast. Tony was awesome. He gave me his direct number at work so if I have any problems I can call him.

****


A few nights ago my roomates received a phone call from someone reading off our home ip and address claiming intent to burn down our house, now if it was just me living here I wouldn't care as ive already exceeded the average life expectancy for a transgender woman. I consider myself on borrowed time anyways and I really don't have anything to lose.

The people who were kind enough to take me in and employ me however have plenty to lose and it isnt ethically right for me to endanger others because of how i moderate [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) . So after a long discussion with rmuser on the matter I decided it was best to step down as moderator for the safety of my friends. 

However I would like to make clear that the people against my style of moderation have won absolutely no victory here as my replacement is an even more radical transfeminist than me. My good friend [RobotAnna](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobotAnna) will be taking over for me, and if you manage somehow to drive her away she will be replaced with someone even *more* radical. 

I have full faith and confidence in her ability to crack down on transphobia, biphobia, homophobia, sexism and racism and i will give her any advice and tips on moderation she is willing to listen to so the day to day operation of the subreddit should not change at all, this space is still safe for any marginalized group and the only people who have anything to fear are those who are bigoted. 

To the people who threatened my roomates and the people who have been spreading my personal information around reddit and other channels and the people allowing these things to happen i really hope it was worth it to you, you changed nothing and you proved to the world what we have been saying about you the whole time. You are hate filled little children and you were willing to end the lives of other human beings because you wanted the right to say ""tranny"" on [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) well guess what, you still wont be able to, and you destroyed your own cause with this extremism, this doesn't make you the hero, it makes you a fucking terrorist and everyone who supported you and helped you get my new address is supporting real life terroism. I want you to think long and hard about what you have done and ask yourself if it was worth it. I want you to think and ask yourself if it was worth the lives of other sapient human beings to get your way, though of course people like you have made it crystal clear you don't consider me a human being as many of you have repeated over and over, you like to think I am worse than Hitler when you are the ones who wanted to kill for your ideals, you are no better than the religious extremists who bomb abortion clinics or crash planes into skyscrapers. I see no moral difference between the ones who wished me harm and those who supported them, a pox on both your houses. 

To the people of this community who have supported me I want to say thank you for all of your kind words and loving support and I ask you to show the new moderator the same respect and love you have shown me, thank you for everything you said and did for me, you made it worth it for me and kept me strong when I felt like giving in and RobotAnna will need that love and support now. I will still be as active as ever in my struggle for transgender equality and I will continue to fight for our rights with unyielding fervor, or brothers and sisters die every day because of transphobia and bigotry and I will not rest until this has stopped so if people think they have heard the last of me, they are sadly mistaken. I will fight to my last breath for all of you and they will have to kill me to shut me up. 

In conclusion [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) will continue the set policies without me and they will simply be enforced by someone more anonymous than me. I will continue to post and comment in the subreddit and report posts as a normal user and continue to make suggestions for improvement and offer css code to the mod team, I look forward to seeing the new flair system that's being worked on, I believe in this community and its ability to grow and remain strong in the face of adversity and I have full faith and confidence in the future moderation.

On the way to the parts store, we started joking about stories I could make up for how I wrecked the front of the car. Off the top of my head, I came up with, ""I was driving in this mall parking lot and got up to 88 miles an hour when I was transported into a field and I ran into a pine tree.""

""That's pretty good,"" said my dad, ""but you should come up with something a little more badass. Like you were running from the police or something. Girls love the bad boys.""

I'm not out to either of my parents yet, but at every chance I get, I try to express that I am not interested in girls. I think I have successfully accomplished this over the years, but I still plan to ""officially"" come out, even though I think (hope) they've guessed that I'm gay by now. So all I said was, ""Yeah, whatever...""

Then he said these next words. He said them so naturally and off-handedly that it shocked me. ""And *boys* like bad boys too. It's that attitude that just blah blah blah...""

Such a small moment made me sure of a few things. (1) That he already knows I'm gay, or at least suspects (which you'd have to be pretty thick not to, I guess).

We were at this family's house for Thanksgiving, no problems.  It's natural for me to use female pronouns now, and I'm pretty automatic with it (although name use has been harder but that is also more recent).

I went by her house recently to pick up some presents I'd had delivered there for my kids.  In conversation, I stated, ""I'm not sure ""Bodelia"" will like this, but I hope she will.""
The mother of the family, who is like my second mom, and who has been ""supportive"" if questioning up to this point, firmly stated, ""ShellBell, I need to tell you something.  You *CANNOT* use Bodelia's name or refer to *him* (yes, she said ""him"") as ""her"" or ""she"" here at Christmas Eve, for the sake of my granddaughters.""  
I was pretty stunned.
""You can't do it.  You *CAN NOT* do it.  My granddaughters don't understand, and it's not *fair* to *them*.""
I'm still speechless and rather stunned.  I finally reply with, ""Um...Mom2, that's *who* Bedelia is.  She's not a guy.""
Mom2: ""I understand that. But you just can't do it.  Talk about *him* all you want, just don't use ""Bodelia,"" ""her"" or ""she.""
She also casually asked, ""Do you think *he* even wants to come?""

I was stunned and REALLY pissed, so I left fairly quickly.  By the time I got home, I was livid.

So, I called up and/or visited each of her three sons and their respective wives that very same afternoon.  ALL of them were shocked and flabbergasted, some more than others.  Two of these families are also very religious, and one of them stated that although they don't ""agree"" with our decisions re: Bodelia and her transition, they still love and support us. That's cool, I get it; and thank you for continuing to love us regardless of your personal opinions.  They all thought their Mom was nuts. One even said, ""Wow, what a punch to the face!""
One of the sons then said, ""I was wondering what was going on.  She was asking me last week what I thought about you (ShellBell) continuously referring to Bodelia as ""her"" and ""she"" at Thanksgiving."" The son told her that he hadn't even noticed and what was the big deal?

So, clearly, this is more Mom2's issue than any issue with her children or grandchildren.  All three boys' stated that they were planning on having a talk with their respective kids anyway, and that they would go ahead and do that, not foreseeing any issues.

So, I've talked with Bodelia and her brothers and my own mother.  We're choosing to change up our traditional Christmas Eve this year.  Even if Mom2 ""changes"" her mind, it doesn't change her thinking.  My daughter laughed when she heard the story and offered to just stay home on Christmas Eve.  I told her, ""No.  You will *not* stay home on Christmas Eve by yourself. That is not an option.  We all go, or we all stay home. And we're staying home.""

I'm not planning on telling Mom2 until 3 days before Christmas so as not to mess up her meal planning, and to avoid her flipping out, sending drunk texts, phone calls, IMs and emails, which she tends to do late at night.
It just makes me heartsick that someone I've loved my whole life, and who is verbally and superficially supportive, is really just very prejudiced after all.  I recognize that she is older and it might take her a while to get used to the idea, and recognize the errors in her thinking.  But it kills me as a mother to know that my daughter is that rejected.  BTW, my dad doesn't accept it either, but we really could give a shit because he's a neo-con nut job anyway and it's easier to overlook.

So, I'm feeling better about it today than I was yesterday. And I think my point will be taken. Whether she chooses anger or remorse (or both) as her response is to be seen. But, I'm choosing to simply not engage in her drama.  I'm glad that she thinks she's protecting her granddaughters from some imaginary gender-bending scourge that's going to traumatize them for life.  That'll make it easier for her to understand why I feel the need to protect my daughter from her ignorance and inflexibility.

UPDATE: 12/17 2:56 pm
I've never really experienced Reddit love until today.  I was surprised to wake up this morning and see all the comments and advice, as I'd only hoped to get feedback from a couple of people; and really, I just needed to vent!  So, thanks to all of you.  I do think I'm going to go ahead and draft a message to Mom2 to let her know sooner than later.  I do think regardless, we're sitting this one out this year.  I have made it clear to the sons/sisters-in-laws that I'd like for them to drop by my house on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  I'll make that clear to Mom2 as well.  My biological mother also wanted me to make it clear on here that I wasn't talking about HER, and that she's not the one with the problem.  She's not.  When I first told her about Bodelia's identification, her response was, ""You mean I could've been shopping for a girl this whole time?!""  I'll update this post with new developments as they develop.  Thanks for all of your positivity.  It is vastly appreciated.

UPDATE 12/17 4:25pm
This is the letter I drafted and sent to Mom2 today.  I've not heard back from her.

&gt;""Mom2,
&gt;I’ve given some thought to what you said to me the other day. I have to tell you also, that it hurt me deeply.

&gt;It seems as if Bodelia’s presence at Christmas Eve is problematic or that it will make people uncomfortable.

&gt;I simply cannot comply with your desire for me to avoid using her name or her correct gender pronouns of “her” and “she”.  Furthermore, I’m not even conscious most of the time about my pronoun use.  I know not everyone else is used to hearing it and I get that, but that’s not what is going on in our lives.  I’m about 98-100% accurate with pronoun use, although the name use is harder for me and I’m only sitting at about 50%.  The boys are having a hard time with the name use as well.

&gt;The reason I’m not able to comply with your wishes is that, regardless of what people’s comfort levels may respectively be, my child is now a girl.  Yes, she’s a girl with a penis, but it’s what her brain is about, not what her parts happen to be.  She feels like a girl. She identifies as a girl. She is getting medical treatment to facilitate her outward presentation to more nearly match her inner self-concept.  I’m so happy that I have a relatively healthy child. She’s the happiest she’s been since she was 11 years old, and you know the twisting, torturous path we’ve walked the past five years.  My daughter is gaining confidence like she has never possessed before. And all of it is due to recognizing and owning her true self.

&gt;No, she’s not the most feminine thing out there. I really don’t care how Bodelia looks, or what phases she goes through as she explores and discovers her own style.  What I care about is that my daughter is alive, she’s not cutting herself, she’s not in a hospital and she’s happy, or well on her way to happiness.  I have her, instead of a tombstone or a child committed to a hospital. Because that’s the direction we were headed.

&gt;So, I regret to inform you that we’ll be taking a pass on Christmas Eve at your house this year.  I really enjoy the tradition and it makes me sad to say this.  But I feel I have to stand up for my daughter.  Even if you should reverse your position on the matter, I still feel like it is the best thing that we sit out a year.  When I came home, pretty upset, Bodelia offered, quite generously, to stay home and suggested we go without her.  I bluntly told her, “You are not staying home by yourself on Christmas Eve. Not happening!”

&gt;I love the grace that my daughter is developing, even if it only is evident in very rare moments. She’s 17 and she drives me crazy with her disrespect, demands and mood swings.  But, she’s going through her second puberty, and estrogen is a bitch. So, we don’t always get along.  But, she knows that I have her back.  I will stand beside her, as I have, for as long as I am alive.

&gt;So, while recognizing and respecting your concern for your granddaughters, it is incumbent upon me to love and respect my own child for who she is.  I’m not certain from whence your concern originates, and whether it’s something that shouldn’t be further discussed with your boys and their wives for future situations.  If you’ve not discussed it with them, I suggest you do. In my discussions with your boys and daughters-in-law, it doesn’t seem to be that big of an issue.  Of course, I’m always available as a resource if you, they or the grandkids have questions.

&gt;I also hope that you and Dad2 will swing by on Christmas Day.  Because, we’d still love to see you.

&gt;As I respect your wishes in this matter, I’m sure that you can recognize and respect mine.  You know I love you, but this is something I won’t budge on.  When we get our PFLAG chapter (Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (and Transgender)) started in the new year, I’d like to invite you to one of our meetings.  Our goals are to educate, advocate and support the LGBT community.  We will be having faith panels, and general group sessions to accomplish these goals.  We will welcome anyone who is having difficulty with dealing with a friend or family member who is LGBT, or who simply has questions.  I’m on the leadership team to help re-start the chapter here in our hometown. 

&gt;I hope you understand what I am trying to say here.  I really don’t want to have multiple conversations back and forth about this. Thanks for listening.

&gt;Love, 
ShellBell""


UPDATE 12/21/2012: So to update, other than most likely surviving the Apocalypse...again.  Mom2 finally replied.  She professed that I certainly misunderstood her...misheard her....didn't understand what she was trying to say.  So, I went over.  Long story short.  I told her my position rather succinctly.  Told her how she came across. Repeated her words back to her and the authoritarian demanding way in which she presented it, and asked her how else was I supposed to take it?
She apologized profusely.  Stated that she hadn't slept much the night that she read it, was crying, had puffy eyes, etc.  That she loves me as her daughter and that she would never purposely do anything to hurt me or my children.  She asked if she could apologize to Bodelia, and I told her certainly.  She then asked what she should say in her apology.  
/Facepalm
I told her she'd have to come up with that herself, but that she should certainly include what she meant to say and not what came across.
So, it looks like we may be going after all.  My daughter was at first unwilling to go; but I think she's considering it now.  I explained that the whole situation may be a blessing in disguise, as it drew a line in the sand for what we deem acceptable behavior, and how important it is to validate Bodelia as the young woman she is.  It also updated all the sons/daughters-in-law and grandchildren about where Bodelia is in transition; and that she clearly prefers female pronouns and her name.  So, while we've not completely decided about Christmas Eve, we at least have reconciliation.

He was 11 when we adopted him and he came with a lot of misinformation on topics because of their culture.  He has always been a quiet kid, and never gets into arguments, or trouble for that matter in school.  He has always been hesitant to talk about my sexuality with people, and never talked about it at school.  Yesterday he proved to me that good people exist, and that people are growing less and less tolerant of ignorance.

My brother came home in tears yesterday, and big brother instincts kicked in and I sat him down to ask him what was wrong. He handed me a slip of paper that showed he was written up at school and suspended for punching a kid. I looked further into it and called the school. My brother got in a fight with a kid who was saying being gay is immoral, disgusting and wrong.

My brother proudly said, ""My brother is gay, and is one of the biggest role models in my life. He is better than you will ever be, and deserves everything you already take for granted.""

I have no words, other than this is probably the most touching thing anyone has EVER done for me. I love you little buddy.

Edit: He was suspended for 3 days out of school.

Edit 2: He hit the kid from self defense because my brother was hit after saying that to him.  He in no way instigated the fight.

Edit 3: The other student that was involved was suspended as well (thankfully).  I do not condone violence either, but as a big brother, knowing someone hit him lights a fire within me, not to mention what my little brother went through prior to his adoption makes this amazing that it was only the first time. He truly is an inspiration to me.

Edit 4: To the few of you who are obviously emotionally deep-rooted upset that I titled it as such, I sincerely apologize for putting ""beliefs"" rather than something else. Sorry for disturbing your life enough for using a word that so blatantly mislead you into reading my post.  To the rest of you decent humans, my brother thanks you for the kind words. I will attach a photo in a few of him and myself shortly.

When I saw the lineup, I was extremely excited that Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis were big names that would hit the stage. By the time that they were about to start, it was physically impossible to get into the crowd, so my friends and I went back to a hill which over looks the main stage. When Macklemore got onto the stage, everyone was standing up trying to get a good view of them, something which did not happen for any act before them. They started performing a lot of their hits and eventually they got to playing Same Love. Macklemore started talking about how admirable it is that Canada has made such progress towards equality. It was really touching. Then he invited Tegan and Sara onstage to sing the chorus with him (my friends and I had a fangirling moment going on). It was such an amazing performance, definitely one of my favorite of the festival. Here's the part that really took my breath away. At the end of the song, Macklemore said ""if you believe in the equality of all human beings no matter who they love, raise both your hands"". At this point, I did not see a single hand not raised. Seeing tens of thousands of people all showing that they support equality just made me realize how lucky I am to grow up in the time and place that I have. I'm a 17 year old gay kid from Montreal who doesn't have to worry about harassment or judgement nearly to the same degree as members of the LGBT community from generations before myself. The amount of progress that has been made in my lifetime alone is startling and wonderful and people like Macklemore bringing these issues to mainstream media are really helping society to progress. Anyways, I thought that you guys would maybe appreciate that as much as I did :)",,False,,t5_2qhh7,False,,,True,t3_1jotpc,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1jotpc/i_saw_macklemore_ryan_lewis_last_night_at_osheaga/,

1305168654.0,534,self.lgbt,h9gky,How many of you would support the removal of the word marriage from domestic union laws and make everyone have civil unions?,784,250,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/h9gky/how_many_of_you_would_support_the_removal_of_the/,"I'm writing a paper on this and I just want to make sure that this is actually something that would be supported by the LGBT community. Here's my train of thought. My eliminating the word marriage from domestic union laws we:

1) Remove any religious connotation (the word marriage has religion attached to it, despite it being a perfectly legitimate legal term)

2) Destroys any 'separate but equal' ideas by forcing everyone to have civil unions

This would only work if civil unions get bumped up to grant the same rights that marriages currently get (but this would be a forced occurrence if civil unions begin to replace the legal side of marriage).

Please tell me if there is something that I've totally forgotten about that needs to be mentioned. This is actually a very small part of my paper (in regards to the LGBT rights movement that is) and the bulk of it is on the separation of church and state being a sound argument for the removal of the word marriage from legislation which would allow this to happen.

Thanks to anyone who responds!

EDIT: Wow! Thanks again for all the responses, they have been pretty darn helpful in completing my argument (I've had to concede quite a few points for this argument to work as well as modify a few things). After reading the comments here I've come to the conclusion that while this might work in theory for a specific situation, the broad application of it would result in what might almost be a step back in the LGBT rights movement. Unfortunately it is too late to change my essay topic now so I will have to continue to argue this for the paper but I will definitely not try to argue this point again. It's pretty obvious I don't understand the plight from the perspective of a LGBT at all.

""Well you certainly will be able to get a wife with one of those!""

I shrugged it off and didn't think it was that big of a deal. I didn't know her all that well so i didn't feel the need to tell her.

""I've been meaning to talk to you. When Peggy said the wife comment.. You know you have every right to tell her your gay, in my house your family will back you up and wont allow anyone to say anything negative. It's completely up to you and i don't want you to ever feel uncomfortable. I haven't told any of them because i didn't feel it was my place and didn't know how public you wanted to make it or who you felt comfortable to have know.""

So many of you may remember me from [my last post which I wrote right after I came out to my parents where they disowned me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/uajj4/i_came_out_to_my_parents_it_couldnt_go_worse/) 

Today marks exactly two months since I came out, and I wanted to make good on my promise to give y'all an update. 

One of my biggest concerns right after I came out was getting in contact with my sister. I was finally able to and we met. I had high hopes that she would be accepting and still want to stay in touch. Unfortunately, she said that she, ""was choosing god"" and that she did not want to see or talk to me. That one really hurt, really hurt. I'm not giving up though. She will be moving to OSU in August and out of the immediate influence of my mom, so I'm really hoping that she will begin to open her heart and mind. So that put me completely disowned from my family.

After I came out I went down to my friends house and OKC and lived with them for a few weeks while looking for a job and a place to live in Stillwater. They were the most incredible people you will ever meet. They fed me, bought me some clothes and towels to help replace what my parents had stolen, and just took care of me. They helped keep my spirits up, stay focused on getting everything straightened out for school and work, even put me on their cell phone plan. I couldn't have asked for better people in my life at that moment.

I filled out countless job applications, and I got in touch with our local PFLAG chapter asking them to pass my resume around and let me know if they knew of any openings. They were fantastic, and through them I was given the contact information for a local insurance company that was hiring people for their call center. So I jumped on it, got an interview, and wouldn't you know it; I didn't get the job...Instead they hired me as the lead for marketing and customer service on a new project they had started! It had much better hours and paid better than anything I could have hoped for working at the bakery as originally planned; I couldn't believe it. 

At this point we are around half-way through June. I was contacted by a redditor from Stillwater who offered me an extra room to stay for the summer after reading my story. I can't thank you enough, because it would have been near impossible for me to get back on my feet without that room. So I lived there, working and building up some cash to get my own place. 

About the same time I moved back to Stillwater, I received a FB message from one of my mom's cousins. My mom had updated her FB status saying that anyone who wanted to stay friends with the family had to defriend and block me. Turns out this cousin is a Lesbian, and immediately contacted me, and we've been in touch ever since. It was an amazing feeling to know I wasn't alone, and she has been a great source of support for me. Well, somehow (I'm assuming someone was spying on my FB for her), my mom found out that the cousin was talking to me. She called her and started yelling and cursing at her, telling fer she didn't know what the ___ she was getting into, and how dare she talk to her son; asked if she was a Lesbian and threatened to out her to the rest of the family, and on and on - overall a fine example of real Christian love (am I right?). I also at this time received two emails, a week apart. One from my mom; one from my dad. My mom's email was just plain weird, basically ended in calling me demon possessed. My dad's email was long and very painful. He made clear that they would not support me; that I was not welcome anywhere around them. He compared me being gay to him having an affair with multiple women, and basically told me that I was going to die young from getting HIV. I did not respond to either of the emails, and I haven't heard anything from them since. 

Ten days ago, I finally moved into my own place! It's a fantastic 1BR within walking distance to campus, friend's houses, and the bars. It's kind of weird living alone without any roommates, but at the same time, it makes me feel like I'm finally standing on my own two feet. I'm slowly, but surely building up my supplies to actually make it a home; but it's absolutely fantastic! 

And last but not least, I have gotten myself an incredible group of friends that has been there for me every step of the way. It's something that is completely new to me; I've never been included in a group like this before. We have something to do nearly every night - movies, cookouts, frisbee games, Electric Beatdown Thursdays - always a new adventure. They have celebrated the little victories with me, and held me in their arms when I was crying my eyes out. I've never had friends like this, and to have a group that loves and accepts me for being 100% me, and that is fantastic. As a matter of fact, I even got me a boyfriend out of the group! :D 

I'd like to put something here for anyone who may think that they are in a situation with their family like I was. I know how scary it is being in that situation. If I could give you any advice it would be two-fold. First, if at all possible, wait until you are financially independent of your parents to come out. This is difficult, but work your ass off so that you can support yourself and not have to face what I did. If this is simply not possible, and you are put in a scenario like I was, where you have to come out now - you can make it! It's hard, insanely hard, and scary as hell, but you can make it! Keep your head up, stay focused. Don't let yourself collapse and curl up. Trust me, I had nights where I was so scared I was shaking, but keep your friends close and find some that you know can be there for you when you need that support. Use this horrible crisis to motivate you. Prove them wrong! Force them to acknowledge that you can be happy, healthy, and successful being 100% true to yourself with nothing to hide. Use your resources. Find local LGBT groups that can help you. For me it was PFLAG. [Find your local chapter](http://community.pflag.org/page.aspx?pid=803). I know that it's a cliche, but [It Get's Better!](http://www.itgetsbetter.org/). If you ever need to talk to someone, send me a message anytime; I promise to if anything be an ear to vent to.  

TL;DR I came out to my family, got completely disowned, homeless, jobless, and alone. Two months later, I'm completely independent, fantastic job, house, friends, and I couldn't be happier!

Here's the message I sent her:

""Mom,


   There is a reason I got so aggravated about what Bill O'Reilly was saying earlier tonight on his program. It's the same reason I left your marriage ceremony a bit upset Friday after you made that tasteless joke in front of your friends, and also why I got so angry when you compared gay marriage to bestiality and tax evasion.


   I've wanted to talk to you, which is why I've been coming over so often lately, but I simply can't find the words. The reason I'm doing this over Facebook is because this is hard enough to do without having to deal with hearing more logically fallacious statements and arguments based on a holy book you don't even actually follow.


   I'm gay. I've known that for a long time, and it's something only my closest friends know for sure. Shane and I have been in a relationship together for five years, and I haven't been able to tell anybody for fear of you finding out, for fear of my friends and coworkers finding out, and for fear of whoever else might find out. Every day I have to lie to people. I have to suppress a very big part of my life out of fear of it effecting my life in a more negative way than it already has and it's eating me from the inside out. I can't take my significant-other to company Christmas parties, we can't hold hands in public, we can't get married, if I were dying on a hospital bed, he would not be allowed to see me, all while I have to stand on the sidelines and watch everybody else in my life lead a relatively normal life, and to top it off, I get to sit there on your couch, and watch these TV ""personalities,"" accuse me of being ""entitled,"" or ""trying to destroy tradition.""


   When you said those things a couple weeks ago, it hurt me more than I could ever say. You pulled one slippery-slope fallacy after another out of a hat to try and rationalize why people like me and Shane, who have been together for HALF A DECADE shouldn't have the right to get married, while you're planning your own wedding to a man you haven't even known a year.


   Don't get me wrong. I think Gary's a great guy, but you really need to take a look at the people you think, ""aren't oppressed,"" because it's really NOT some liberal, immoral, family-hating agenda like you think it is. It's people like me, who want a fair shot at happiness, the way you and Gary have a shot at happiness.


   I'm trying my best here to really let you know how I feel, but honestly, until you've been spit on, had your car's window smashed in, beat up, teased, and had rumors start up about you from people you don't even know, all for something you already hate about yourself, I don't think you'll get it.""


I'll update when I receive a response. Sending this message was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but I'm sure I'll be glad that I did it.

Edit: I haven't heard anything from her since I sent the message. I'm supposed to have Thanksgiving with her but her and her husband are not at the house, and neither one has their phone turned on.

I also totally support gay rights - with all my heart.  I can't STAND bigotry and it really pisses me off that you don't have equal rights.

I'm straight but if I have a son or daughter that's gay I'll be damned if they don't have the same rights that I do....

My family however, is fairly homophobic.

They live on the east coast.  I live in SF.

I've never let them say anything discriminatory in front of me without it being challenged and flat out calling them hateful bigots.

Anyway.  Last week I flew back to spend some time with them... They're my family after all and before this our relationship was good... I see them like 1x a year.

We're having dinner and somehow the conversation turns to Obama and ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"". 

Long story short, my brother in-law says that ""fags shouldn't be able to serve in the military"" ... and I lose it.

I stand up and say that it's not right to discriminate against ANYONE regardless of sexuality, race, or religion.

... then it dawns on me... they don't know that I'm NOT gay.

So I just come out of the closet.

I live in SF... I'm 35... I'm fit, fashionable, metrosexual even.  I've NEVER been married. I've never even brought a girl home to meet Mom... 

(though for the record I have plenty of girlfriends, ha).

They think I'm bluffing but once I stick to my guns (and they can see that I'm visually upset) it dawns on them that I'm homosexual.

My dad goes silent and just leaves the table. My sister calls me a jerk for coming out ...my brother in law is pissed.  My mother is crying.

At this point I decide I'm not going back.  I'm going to be gay as far as they're concerned for the rest of my life.

It was pretty heated... I left shortly after.  My calls to the house aren't answered.  My sister says she's ok with it but that I shouldn't have come out of the closet....

In a way it hurts because I had a good relationship with my mother and father before this - however, I feel strongly that if they don't love me regardless of my sexuality, then I don't want them in my life.

So here I am.... one of you .  I'm ostracized from my family.  I'm out of the closet and kicked in the teeth.  

This is harder than I thought.

I work at a reform temple in Virginia with a pretty sizeable preschool attached to it. Last week, one of the boys in the preschool - 3 or 4 years old - came running up to me and said VERY excitedly ""Guess what?! Guess what?! I got a Barbie and a Barbie Deluxe Edition Dreamhouse for my birthday!!"" 

Didn't think that much about it - kids that age tend not to always fall into gender role toys - though I thought his parents deserved some credit for not forcing a football in his hands. I just said ""Awesome! Good for you!"" and forgot about it.

This weekend is Purim, so on Fridays all the kids dressed up in costumes. I get to sing Shabbat songs to them on Fridays, so I got to see them all at once. Lots of princesses, a few cats, a bunch of super heroes, one or two army men. And there, in the front row, was my buddy wearing a purple dress and a tiara. 

And he said ""Does my dress look pretty?""

And I said ""Yes, yes it does.""

And all I could think was, forgetting how accepting and progressive those parents were being, and how accepting the preschool was, how amazing for that kid to live in an age when not one of those kids he was with made fun of him for wearing a dress or playing with dolls. It was just who he is.

Anyway, It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, since I've spent my entire life hiding it. But I couldn't go on feeling...wrong. Incomplete. Looking in the mirror and hating what I looked like on the outside, while desperately hiding who I was on the inside. And I sure as hell couldn't marry this girl with such a huge secret. I was so nervous. I shook and my heart was going a mile a second. I swear I lost a pound in sweat out of my palms alone. But somehow I managed to force out the words. It was hard, I choked on almost every word but they came out a few at a time. Just remembering as I'm typing makes me shake a little. 

This girl has been my best friend since we were in 7th grade (we both just turned 27) and have been together for almost 5 years now. She was soooooo supportive and happy that I was able to come out to her. I emptied my entire soul on her. I told her that I'm transgendered and that I cant keep living in secret. How much pain and suffering it has caused me over the years. The depression, fear, and hatred for myself instantly started to melt away the more I told her. I also told her about how every time she left for the day, I would spend my time alone wearing her clothes (Which she totally noticed) and just being myself. How in high school I would secretly dress up in full makeup and a wig and walk around the local mall getting cute looks from boys and sometimes girls. It was all I really had to be myself and relax. About all the collections of clothes and shoes and wigs I've gotten rid of in vain attempts to escape or hide who I am. All my stress, anger, anxiety, our relationship problems, everything, it all stems from me having to hide who I really am in fear of losing everything and everyone I love. 

She held me while I cried and told me everything was fine. She told me she loves me for who I am, and will do everything she can to help me become the person I always should have been. She really is the best person in the world to be able to deal with this and embrace it so happily. She's so happy for me that I can finally be myself and that I had the courage to tell her everything. I was so fucking scared she was going to run screaming into the night. Her reaction was only joy. I had become so distant and angry all the time. Her clothes would be missing or moved. She obviously assumed the worst, but had no way of proving it. It instantly squashed any insecurities she had about what was going on. 

That was almost 2 weeks ago. Since then our relationship has been so much more amazing than I could have ever imagined. We went on a trip for a weekend and spent the entire time talking about everything and enjoying each others company. We laughed about her insecurities as I told her what was really going on while she was at school. I told her how I would spend time here on reddit or other forum sites talking to people who encouraged me to stay strong. When we got back she told me I had free reign of her clothes until I got my own, and that I can wear whatever I want around the house to make me feel more like myself. The next day she took me shopping for clothes and picked out an amazing selection of cute things. Since then, I've freely worn the clothes I feel comfortable in. Soon we will start seeing a gender therapist together so I can at least get pointed in the right direction to start my transition. 

I cant remember the last time I was genuinely happy. I feel like I can breathe again. My nightmares are gone. I smile more. I laugh. I wear color again. Everything has become so much easier. Even getting up in the morning to go to work. I get excited to come home and be myself with the girl I love. I look forward to my future instead of living in fear that I will never be myself. Trapped in a body that is not the real me. It will be a hard road ahead but as long as I have my beautiful, loving, and supportive fiancee I will be just fine. And it will be well worth it. Slowly I'll start telling my friends and family.

I needed to tell someone what an amazing and crazy-town banana-pants journey I've had the past couple weeks, and sites like this are one of the things that kept me going throughout the years. So I thought I would post my story here. I might even have my fiancee read it. Sorry it was so long, this is actually the short version...but for those that stuck through the novel, thanks for listening my fabulous redditors, it's supportive communities like this that have helped keep me alive and sane knowing that I'm not alone. /hug

TL;DR - Came out to my wonderful fiancee, it was so damn scary, but ended up being the best decision ever. Looking ahead to the future with hope. :D

When I got home from work Samantha and I spent the morning reading all your beautiful comments. She was so moved she decided to make an account to return the love. She even answered a few questions!

It's been pretty shittie, and today I had a little breakdown.  I told my parents I wanted to sell my car and move somewhere with a better job market (i.e. SF or NY), and my dad freaked out on me as usual, tried to fight me, and told me I just wanted to leave so I could be around the ""queers"".  This is nothing new, as he has tried to kill/fight me several times over the past 15 years since he found out.  

Anyway, my mom was on the floor crying, and my dad was blaming me for it, telling me that I'm killing her, and i'm the reason she's always going to the hospital.  He told me to leave.

A couple hours later, I came back to get some clothes, and my 16 year old nephew told me he wanted to talk to me.  He took me outside and told me he loved me and accepts that I'm gay. He also told my parents to basically get over it--that I'm not changing, and they should love me for who I am! Anyway, I am so proud of him and so thankful to have at least one family member who is supportive.  

EDIT:  Thank you guys so much for the comments!  I'm definitely going to get out of here as soon as I can sell my car.  If anyone is in Georgia and wants to buy it, check it out-- http://macon.craigslist.org/cto/2710906024.html &lt;3

- I'm straight
- I'm Canadian-Indian (Have dealt with very bad racism when I was a child)
- I'm 6'3 and on a university varsity team (don't mean to sound conceited) -- so being randomly harassed really threw me off guard as it rarely happens
- I have several homosexual friends, and it makes my fucking blood boil when I hear or deal with homophobic people because being a minority in Canada, I had to deal with horrible racism when I was a child now it seems homophobia is the new racism. LGBT are people for fuck's sake, so treat them as YOU would like to be treated.

ANYWAYS, getting back to the actual story...

I turned around and of course, a classic Ed-Hardy wearing, thin chin strap sportin' stereotypical douchebag bro was smirking as he says ""Oh what, the faggot has a problem?""

Before I could even say anything, I kid you not, almost 20 random students came to my defence and just ripped this guy apart (not physically of course!) for being such a small-minded bigot. Eventually as he was leaving I just said ""You know, for the record I'm actually straight and the reason I wear this bracelet is to show my support for the LGBT community because they have to deal with intolerant assholes like yourself. With a mindset like yours, good luck getting anywhere in life.""

I was actually kind of shook up by the whole thing, because I'm a fairly quiet and reserved person-- so I just quietly walked home afterwards and smoked a nice kief bowl. I do have to say though-- as an extremely cynical person, this really did give me some faith in society. The whole issue of homophobia really does get me quite emotionally charged and a big part of it is because I never want to see anyone go through the same discrimination I went through as a child. To have so many complete strangers come to my defence was just a very profound experience. 

Woah, sorry for the long post though. Didn't think it was that lengthy. Anyways, hopefully this can bring hope to anyone who's been a victim of discrimination.

EDIT: A couple of people wanted to know what initially started the whole thing (why I turned around)... I was near the LGBT volunteer group's table, buying the bracelet when some guy just yells ""faggot!!!""!

So basically, I think I finally came out to my parents. And yet I'm not quite sure how. But you know, it feels pretty good. 

I'm an 18, coming up to 19, year old woman. I've been struggling with my sexuality for the past few years... you know, the whole denial thing joined with the whole 'I'm not really ready to accept it yet' thing. I've known forever that I'm not into guys. This was something that gradually grew very obvious as I got older because, whilst all of my friends were out dating and entering that desperate zone where they were searching for a man as if their life depended on it, I was sitting at home staring at pictures of women and lying to myself that I wished I looked like them, rather than really acknowledging the fact that I wanted to date them. 

My parents had obviously figured this out before I had. My father and I were watching television yesterday afternoon before the topic of marriage came up, followed by me stating that I never wanted to get married. He then made a joke about how it wouldn't be legal for me to do so, because I was gay. I sat there silently, rather shocked at the fact that he'd even so much as mentioned it. And because I didn't outright deny it, he shrugged and told me that he didn't mind. With a huge, smug grin on his face. Then my mum laughed and told me that it didn't matter whether I was gay or straight or anything inbetween. 

So I pretty much came out, but with my parents doing the difficult bit for me. Which is nice, and it takes a lot of weight off of my shoulders, especially since I've been carrying it for years. So I'm now out of the closet, with parents who didn't make a huge deal out of it and going on as if everything is very much the same. 

So that's my little story. Not very exciting or interesting, but I just wanted to tell somebody. So, yay!",,False,,t5_2qhh7,False,,,True,t3_10u12u,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/10u12u/i_think_i_came_out/,

(Thankfully it's been taken off Facebook now) He lives in Gatineau, which is part of the Ottawa-Gatineau city itself. All I know is his name is Tanner and [this is his Tumblr](http://breakmyeverything.tumblr.com/), but I mean look at it. Right now the first post is someone saying ""kill yourself"" and he's agreeing.

I'm doing my best to not make this seem stalkerish, but is there anything we can do for him, as a community? His Tumblr is full of a lot of bad stuff that mirrors what Jamie Hubley was going through. I live in Ottawa and I don't want to wake up tomorrow with his face on the front of newspapers here.

edit: I've been out of the house for 5 hours. It's awesome that everyone is being so good with this. However we have to be careful. Going after his bullies will probably only make his life harder. In the end we have to be respectful of his privacy too. Last thing any of us want is for our good intentions to do any bad at all. Just keep telling him he's great and make a video if you want. If you've contacted the authorities or whatever, make SURE they know he isn't out. I didn't think anyone would do that. I just fear this whole thing may out him and that's the last thing he wants. Sorry for all the edits.

**if people want to make a video for him or send him a message of hope, I think the best way would be to make one on your own and submit it to the Tumblr that got set up for him [RIGHT HERE](http://weloveyoutanner.tumblr.com/) or throw it up on your own and make him aware of it.**",,False,,t5_2qhh7,True,,,True,t3_lhq5d,http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/lhq5d/make_this_kid_feel_loved/,

I apologize in advance for the depressing wall of text, but I have to put this out there.

I was outed to my family three days ago when (of all things), my oldest sister was on my facebook page and saw where about a month ago, I visited an open/affirming church in Atlanta.  I commented on their wall, and she opened up their page, and she sorted through their wall to find my comment.

Then, she went back six months on my profile to where I was seeing someone, sorted through all of my comments on people's wall until she found ""I can't wait to see you next weekend :3"" on his wall.

His profile isn't set to private and his ""interested in"" is set to ""men.""

She then took this information and passed it onto my father.  My fucking father.  He's 68.  I'm 26 fucking years old, she's 43, and she's tattling on me to daddy.  Fuck that.

So, obviously, the shit has hit the fan with my hyper-conservative, pseudo-religious south Georgia family.  I have two sisters who knew already and they're playing damage control for me, but I just got a text from one that said this:

""You know I love you, and I hate what's happening, but it's probably best if you plan on not coming home for Christmas this year.""

My parents will hate me, my sister will hate me, my friends might distance themselves...

But I'm gay. And GEEZ does it feel liberating to just *type* that. I've lacked the courage for so long, to even *admit it to myself.*

I'm scared shitless to tell my friends. I don't know if I'll ever tell my family. But there's a gay girl I know, sweet as can be, and I'm marching down to tell her first. She'll be supportive. I know my friends are going to judge me, and they will act disgusted. I'll let them know when I feel the time is right.

But to just embrace it. To no longer feel embarrassment and shame...and I'm just telling it to you, Reddit. I'm trembling as I type this. I don't think I've ever felt this joyous in my life. These are tears of happiness.

This is a new chapter in my life. This is me starting over, being the person I have always known I am. I'm not sure what to do next, and I don't care.

edit: I really didn't expect for people to interpret this as a trolling attempt. I didn't know how to really express myself, so I apologize if anybody gets the impression I'm being insincere. I just wanted to spit it out. So downvote/ignore this if you really want to, I was just looking for a little support.

Recently, I had to undergo a medical procedure. There was no risk involved, but I was going to be put under. For some weird reason this made me go into a mini panic mode. Although I didn't show it, I made sure I let my wife know that I loved her (and ensured we parted on smiles). 

Later, as I thought about this I realized how unfair life is to LGBTQ couples who aren't treated as partners (let alone spouses). What if I had the same panicky thoughts and couldn't feel my loved one's touch one last time because the hospital wouldn't allow it? 

I feel unhappy, disgusted and angry. I grew up homophobic, so part of my rage is also directed at myself as guilt. I promise to raise better children if and when we have kids, and make sure ""coming out"" is not a ""thing"" in our family.  

Just thought I'd get this off my chest. I apologize if this is the wrong forum, I'll delete the post in that case.

**edit** : Thanks a lot for the kind words. Really appreciate how well this was received. Some responses to things that came up multiple times in the thread and PMs...

* While my parents weren't homophobic due to religion, they considered it a ""perversion"" and I grew up with that belief. I overcame my homophobia when I moved out - I put myself through a lot of thinking to make sure I held my opinions because I **believed** in them, not because I was told to follow something. Sexuality, race, class hatred all fell by the wayside since there was no logical reason to hold on to them. The internet, various forums, trolls, ""it gets better"" all helped.

* I hope this brings some comfort - I'm not the only one like me among my peers. No one I know in my circle is homophobic, and most are vocal supporters of equality. My wife who's 5 years younger (and her peers) - almost a different generation - was never homophobic to begin with.

* As everyone has stated, what we do for our children is vital. I have a lot of learning to do even now, and I've been trying to gain as much knowledge as possible.
