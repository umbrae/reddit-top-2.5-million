I want all of you to know what you did.

Dan was super-bummed that he hadn't gotten a chance to see the 9 minute *Star Trek: Into Darkness* teaser before *The Hobbit*. He's a big movie fan, and one of the directors of the New York Asian Film Festival, and movies mean a lot to him. He has known he's dying for a few weeks and he wanted to see as many movies as possible before he went. When ideeyut started that thread for him to get a chance to somehow see *Into Darkness* it seemed like a long-shot, and it had a hard time getting traction. Other Reddit boards didn't upvote it much, and I figured it was a nice try, doomed to failure. But you guys wouldn't let it disappear, and as you upvoted ideeyut's post some of you also took to Twitter and Facebook. Word got out. The press picked it up. A lot of different people started making noise about this online and word traveled fast and got to the right people through a variety of channels. But it started here, and it started with ideeyut and you guys.

A day or so after the thread began, Paige, Dan's wife, got a voicemail from JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof that was very nice and very straightforward: a producer for the movie would get in touch with them. The next day, one of the film's producers showed up at the door of their apartment with a DVD containing a very rough cut of *Star Trek: Into Darkness* in his hands. Paige had made popcorn, Dan had spent the previous day resting so he could sit through the movie, and after signing about 200 non-disclosure agreements they watched the film and had a blast. 

Afterwards, Dan got back into bed, exhausted, and didn't get out again. Yesterday he was pretty non-responsive and Paige took him to the hospital for hospice care. Last night, at 10:15pm, with Paige and his brother in his room, Dan died. The last thing he got to do that gave him pleasure was watch the new *Star Trek* movie. And it's because of you.

At a time when he didn't have a whole lot to look forward to, r/StarTrek, JJ Abrams, Damon Lindelof, and Bad Robot performed a simple act of kindness for a total stranger and gave Dan something to be excited about for a couple of days. The movie did exactly what movies are supposed to do, it helped him forget about his problems for a couple of hours. It doesn't sound like much, but in this case it was.

Dan was pretty clear that he didn't want to be the inspirational cancer story of the week, but I wanted you all to know what you had done, and how much it meant. At the risk of sounding all grand like the prologue to LOTR or something, Reddit can be a force for great evil, or a force for great good. Every day, all of us come together here and choose which. This time, you all chose kindness, and it made a huge difference to Dan, his wife, and his friends. So thank you ideeyut, and thank you r/StarTrek. You should all be proud of yourselves.

The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all damaged.

**Jean-Luc Picard:** We think we've come so far. Torture of heretics, burning of witches, is all ancient history. Then, before you can blink an eye, suddenly, it threatens to start all over again.


**Worf:** I believed her. I... helped her. I did not see her for what she was.


**Jean-Luc Picard:** Mr. Worf, villains who twirl their moustaches are easy to spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well-camouflaged.


**Worf:** I think... after yesterday people will not be so ready to trust her.


**Jean-Luc Picard:** Maybe. But she, or someone like her, will always be with us. Waiting for the right climate in which to flourish, spreading fear in the name of righteousness.

I've seen some amazingly kind and generous stuff happen on here. I'm hoping there's room for another amazing act of generosity and kindness for a friend of mine who is really sick. I couldn't begin to put into words what he has gone through. Luckily his wife did it for me...
""My amazing healthy film buff husband diagnosed with leukemia (CML) at 38 had to endure 3 rounds of chemo before they found a bone marrow donor match had a Bone Marrow Transplant, which was MORE chemo, full body radiation &amp; lots of other horrific things....then endured/survived 3 major infections + a massive GI bleed that put him in the hospital 10+ times over 3 1/2 years not to mention 100's of doctors visits.... he is my hero; I am his caregiver - I would do anything to help him.... he is now ravaged by a new TOTALLY UNRELATED cancer, (isn't that a fucker?) an aggressive and EXTREMELY rare vascular tumor that is crowding out his healthy liver tissue... they grew under treatment; there is nothing left to do but make him comfortable, at 41, he is jaundice &amp; his liver is enlarged, his body has had enough, he has weeks to live, He was hospitalized and had to exchange our HOBBITT tickets (where the 10 min Star Trek preview was supposed to be shown) we were able to put him in a car and get over to the HOBBITT but NO PREVIEW???? we, his friends and family, the love of my life - WOULD LOVE him to be able to see the Star Trek movie but even the 10 minutes of the trailer would be AMAZING.""
If there is anything any one of you or anyone you know could do to make this happen that would be an amazing, kind and generous thing. Please help. Thanks.

TLDR; My friend is dying. Would like to see the new Star Trek movie. Please help. At the least, upvote to get to front page for someone else to see.

1372599565.0,823,self.startrek,1hd3wx,Something about *Enterprise* you rarely hear from a Trek fan,1169,346,487,http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1hd3wx/something_about_enterprise_you_rarely_hear_from_a/,"(This was originally a comment on another post. I felt it would be a good discussion starter.)

All right, you're going to make me do it:

I love *Enterprise*. And I like the theme song. 

Among millions, I'm one of the few. I like the show's tone, I like the fact that it predates the older series and movies and that it tackles problems differently. To me, it's closer to the original than TNG or DS9, where everything is well-established and almost routine. They struggle with translating languages. They run into aliens that essentially dismiss their mission as foolhardy. Spare parts aren't around the corner and making a breakdown an emergency. Yet they persevere, taking the first steps into a lot of territory that the other series take for granted and establishing humanity among the other civilizations in the galaxy. You feel like its actually a group of people doing something for the first time, truly exploring ""strange new worlds"" and seeking out ""new life and new civilizations"".

And the song? I don't get the hatred. It's a different kind of show. Hell, they even titled it *Enterprise* at first, leaving out the *Star Trek* part to set it apart as a different look at the universe. Why must all theme songs for the franchise be instrumental or have the captain reading the mission statement over the credits? Why can't someone else find that song inspirational and appropriate for the show?

All arguments aside, I've never understood all the infighting among *Trek* fans. I like all the shows. I like all the movies, mostly. I enjoyed *Into Darkness*, too. 

This post will be my most downvoted, I'm sure of it.  I don't care. There has to be someone else out there who agrees with me. I am unashamed. ;)",,False,self,t5_2qixm,False,,,True,t3_1hd3wx,http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1hd3wx/something_about_enterprise_you_rarely_hear_from_a/,

As weird as it might seem, I never watched the last episode, even when it aired. I refused to watch the characters of my youth go away. They entertained me while I was bed ridden, through a divorce of my mother and father, the death of my grandfather and grandmother, the times when my brother was sick, when I had a bad day at school, and so much more. They were always there, shaping who I would become.

The crew inspired me to be kind to things that would seem out of place in the world, respecting life as is, going beyond what was normal, traveling and seeing life through other cultures.

If games like Fallout 3 and Skyrim can construct these massive game worlds filled with unique characters and comprised of elements that are all somewhat effected by the player/each other in a dynamic fashion, surely a game of this caliber based on a starship could be executed properly. Some ideas:

* Missions could vary in nature, from simple fetch-quests *(""Commander La Forge needs this report on Warp Plasma Cell efficiency in Main Engineering right away, Ensign."")* to social interactions *(Ensign Lockland has been acting strangely. Speak with her in Ten Forward.)*, to away missions to alien planets *(Report to Transporter Room 3 and join the away team on the surface of the planet with a Phase Discriminating Amplifier.).* Some of the side missions could even take place on the Holodeck. Experience points would accumulate in the form of your reputation among the crew, and eventually you would be offered promotions based on your performance in different areas, i.e., command, operations, sciences. Players could, of course, complete the story/side missions in whatever order they like, but the main storyline would probably accumulate to the equivalent of a DS9-length story arc.

* Environment: There are, to my knowledge, extensive blueprints of the deck-by-deck layout of the Enterprise, most of them modular corridors and rooms. It would be a lot of work, but you could definitely simulate the corridor flow of the Enterprise with modular design, using screens from the show and photos of the sets as a reference, with special unique areas (Main Bridge, Engineering, Ten Forward, etc.) having their own unique elements. The Player could of course have their own quarters, with customizable furniture/decorations within, if desired.

* Character/NPCs: If Skyrim can have a game world populated by thousands of (relatively unique) characters of varying species, facial details, and personalities, a crew of 1000 could be relatively simple to simulate. Special 'vital' NPCs would have their own unique facial models, responses, and even voice actors (nudge nudge, wink wink).

* Your 24th century equivalent to your ""Pip-Boy 3000"" could be a PADD. Your Tricorder could take readings on virtually everything in the game: Life-form readings of unexplored areas, scans of NPCs to determine illnesses, or even their true species, environmental hazards, material natures of various objects, etc. Phasers could of course have varying levels of stun/kill and be used for drilling/melting parts of the environment should the need arise. Your communicator could be used to interact with any member of the crew at a moment's notice should the need arise, and if you have them in your database (i.e., you know they exist).

I'm sure there are other things that could be implemented to make the game more fun as well. I know I'm missing something.

All this would of course be massively ambitious, and I'm fully aware of how much time/work it would take to actually make something like this, but I'm just saying it would be awesome.

Anyways, massive nerd-fart over. Feel free to discuss.

EDIT: Holy sha-moly, what an awesome response!

1366202277.0,651,self.startrek,1cj1ig,"5 Things You Really Didn't Know About Star Trek (No, Really!)",758,107,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1cj1ig/5_things_you_really_didnt_know_about_star_trek_no/,"Yeah, it's a frequent title, isn't it? And you click the link only to say, *well, that was a waste of time*. 

But I hope this time it's a little different. If not well... double-dumbass on me!

 **1) Shatner wanted to wrestle a real tiger**. Bill Shatner's ego is legendary [(and with good reason)](http://jdkolassa.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/kirk-inspirational-awesome.jpg). In the episode *Shore Leave* (1x15) the Enterprise crew are confronted by their imaginations turned solid. One scene sees a tiger threaten some crew. Shatner had originally been transfixed by the idea of wrestling the tiger (""While the argument went on, the tiger just stood there, licking its chops""). Eventually Leonard Nimoy defused the situation by pointing out that, if necessary, he could just nerve pinch it.

**2) Gene Roddenberry was not a fan of treknobabble**. Gene was quite careful that technology not be too explicit; that it erred on the side of the generic rather than the specific.

&gt;The writer gave us two pages of highly technical, scientifically accurate jargon from Kirk in accomplishing the manoeuvre. I [Gene Roddenberry] threw out those pages, substituted it with a one-line order from Kirk: 'reverse course!'

The treknobabble tendency was developed (presumably after Gene's departure) by Rick Berman who ""was absolutely adamant about making sure the Tech had some logic to it. And, ultimately, that frequently led to long speeches in order to make some interior logic to these technical speeches.""

**3) The vibrant, contrasting colors used in TOS were chosen for the benefit of audiences watching in black and white**. Although Star Trek was filmed in color, the majority of television sets in use at that time could only receive in black-and-white. ""As a result, great care must be taken in the selection of colors used on the set. Matt [Jeffries] even uses a special viewing glass through which he can check colors in order to determine what they will look like on black-and-white TV sets.""

**4) The pointed sideburns were a last minute compromise by the male cast to avoid wearing their hair in a permanently cut 'futuristic' style**. Gene had wanted the cast to wear interesting new hairstyles to demonstrate the futuristic time Star Trek was set in. Not unreasonably the actors were concerned that they would look ridiculous off-set. The compromise was reached a few days before production began.

**5) The Enterprise was intended to turn transparent at warp** due to a compromise made from a misunderstanding of what it meant to travel at light speed. Essentially, Gene thought that light wouldn't be able to reach the ship when it travelled faster than light, so it should be invisible. 

You can actually see this intended effect in the original Pilot *The Cage*.

----

*I hope at least one of those was new to you! This post was inspired by [some of my others](http://www.reddit.com/user/skodabunny/submitted/) over at the [Daystrom Institute subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/). It's worth checking out if you like going full nerd from time-to-time.*

Rick Berman was talking about TNG, about Gene Roddenberry and about his reputation within fandom. I can't remember what he said exactly, but it was along the lines of ""I tried my best to find a line between Gene's dream and what worked on television, of course it didn't always work well and I've ended up getting a lot of dislike from the fans for that"".

It occurred to me that Voyager was a Gene Roddenberry show. 

DS9 was an excellent show, but it's not Star Trek in the same vein as TOS, TNG, VOY and bar season 3, ENT. DS9 was very much about looking at the flaws within a utopian society (A certain season 4 story arc comes to mind as a perfect example). 

Voyager? It's Gene Roddenberry all over, these character who should hate each other, who should be at each others necks learn to work together and quickly, it had the sex appeal of the original with Seven Of Nine (instead of the scantily clad female alien of the week). 

People draw a lot of comparisons between Voyager and TNG, mainly due to re-used plotlines (franchise fatigue setting in), but I think the creators intended it to be a lot closer to TOS, exploring the frontier and going boldly, rather than exploring the frontier and retreating to Starbase as was often the case on TNG (Not that I'm saying that's a bad thing). 

To conclude, I've come to a sort of realization that in many ways Voyager is Rick Berman's love letter to Gene Roddenberry's way of thinking, that the darkest of circumstances should bring out the best in us rather than the worst.

Clearly, with no starbase access for this extended period of time and a provisional chief engineer who failed out of Starfleet academy, I was anticipating it to be a bit of a mess, but... good God!

Ignoring the dormant Borg trojan hardware and software throughout the ship and the remnants of a failed warp drive conversion to the notoriously unstable quantum slipstream, and giving the multitude of holodeck-related bugs a pass (refer to log stardate 49288.8 for my full opinion on why those things are death traps with no place on a starship), I am absolutely terrified to go anywhere near the deflector system.

I cannot stress enough that the deflector dish has only two general systems more vital than it: life support and the warp core. It is a fairly simple concept, emitting a shield to deflect high-velocity particles at high speeds to prevent the ship from tearing apart with every speck of hydrogen. That's pretty much all it was ever meant to do. But ever since the Borg Invasion of 2366 caused the USS Enterprise to reconfigure their deflector array in a (failed) attempt to destroy the cube, cadets at the Academy read all about the potential uses for such a massive emitter and can't wait to start fiddling with things.

But I have never in my 23-year career with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers seen a mess like this. The sheer amount of rewired circuitry, new mismatched parts, and general bastardization makes me amazed the ship ever managed to make Warp 1 without ripping in two. This goes above and beyond emergency measures. I have consulted with engineer Torres who informs me that the dish was deliberately reconfigured to allow for a massive variety of functions to be performed from the array without additional physical labor. Torres even demonstrated for me how with 5 or 6 screen taps she could program in a brand-new function for the dish, and her modifications would instantly reconfigure the mechanical workings of the dish.

THE DEFLECTOR ARRAY WAS NEVER MEANT TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS. I PROBABLY HAVE CANCER JUST FROM BEING ON THE SHIP. Almost no regard was given for occupational hazards, and while I still have no clue what self-sealing stem bolts are good for, even I know that they don't belong where Lieutenant Torres put them.

The best solution I can give is to completely tear out the deflector array and install a brand-new one. Trying to restore this to factory defaults is absolutely pointless. Take it out and bury it in the Marianas Trench encased in lead just to be sure. And remind Admiral Janeway that there was a reason Torres failed out of the Academy, and it's probably not the one she told people.

I was asked to do it again and was pretty reluctant as the pool of interesting *and* obscure trivia is shrinking all the time. 

But I have some time on my hands and I like a challenge. So without further ado, here I go again.

**1. Spock might have had an ear job in one of the shows.** Leonard Nimoy had to try out lots of different ears to make sure they got the right look. As a result the crew started making fun of him, calling him 'pixie' or 'jackrabbit' and he threatened to quit because of it.

&gt;So one day Leonard came into my [Roddenberry's] office, sat down and began to express his doubts about the ""pointed ears"" role. He explained his desire to be known as a serious actor [...] This Spock part was beginning to look to him like he'd be playing a freak with ears. He wound up saying, 'I've decided I don't want the part.' [...] Finally the only thing I could think of to say to him was, 'Leonard, look believe me. I make this pledge to you. If by the thirteenth show you still don't like the ears, I will personally write a script in which you will get an ear job and go back to normal.' [...] And that was the end of that problem.

**2. The Tricorder was originally created just to fill out the role of Yeoman.** It's probably the most *Trek* of all technology besides the transporter or phaser but was originally conceived merely to solve the problem of making the character's prominence in the show more credible (as well as 'to be a potential toy item for female-type children'). Quite unintentionally it became a vital piece of equipment for stories and landing parties.

**3. McCoy's medical equipment were originally intended to be futuristic salt shakers.** In the episode *The Man Trap* (1x01) there is a creature that craved salt. One of the scenes called for Yeoman Rand to be followed by the creature as she carries a tray with a salt-shaker on it.

&gt;This posed a problem. What will a salt shaker look like three hundred years from now? Our property master Irving Feinburg, went out and bought a selection of very exotic looking salt shakers. It was not until I looked at them that I realized they were so beautifully shaped and futuristic that the audience would never recognize them as salt shakers [...] So I told Irving to go down to the studio commissary and bring me several of their salt shakers, and as he turned to go, I said, 'However, those eight devices you have there will become Dr. McCoy's operating instruments.'

**4. The star dates are not supposed to be incremental in the same way as our date system is.**

&gt;We began to get complaints from the viewers, asking, 'How come one week the star date is 2891, the next week it's 2337, and then the week after it's 3414?'
&gt;
&gt;In answering these questions, I came up with the statement that 'This time system adjusts for shifts in relative time which occur due to the vessel's speed and space warp capability. It has little relationship to Earth's time as we know it [...] The star dates specified in the log entry must be computed against the speed of the vessel, the space warp, and its position within our galaxy, in order to give a meaningful reading.'

So you can stop nerdily watching the show in star date order - it is in fact *anti-nerd*.

**5. There are no enlisted crew aboard the Enterprise.** We're all familiar with Miles O'Brien being an enlisted crewman and that Nog outranked him by being an ensign (DS9 *Facets* 3x25), and that in *Star Trek '09* there are simpleton Red Shirts at the Academy. But in the Original Series, although the *Enterprise* is a military vessel, 'its organisation is only semi-military. The ""enlisted men"" category does not exist. *Star Trek* goes on the assumption that every man and woman aboard the *U.S.S. Enterprise* is the equivalent of a qualified astronaut, therefore an officer.'

----

All of these are taken from the incredibly awesome [*Star Trek: The Making of the TV Series*](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Making_of_Star_Trek) which you can pick up on eBay for next to nothing.

Again, I hope that at least one of these was new to you!

1364893850.0,404,self.startrek,1bi7o5,I just watched all of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine for the first time. Here are my thoughts.,476,72,390,http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1bi7o5/i_just_watched_all_of_star_trek_deep_space_nine/,"I finished Star Trek: Deep Space 9 last night, making it the third Star Trek I've marathoned through (didn't need to with TNG and I haven't seen Enterprise yet). 

Like any Star Trek there are ups and downs in levels of quality, but DS9 has a distinct advantage in that it has a very long ""up"" period. There are plenty of good, solid episodes that run back to back and help to not only establish the theme of the series, but create rich and strong connections with the characters and the viewer. I was honestly interested in their lives and development, and seeing them go through both good times and bad was entertaining and made the episodes go by too quickly in a good way. I was left wanting more as the end credits rolled and I was all too eager to hit ""play"" on the next episode.

But when DS9 was bad, boy did it stink. By the end of the series, I was mostly just relieved that I didn't have to hear anymore about Bajoran religion. In fact, most things about the Bajorans were irritating. Major/Colonel/Commander Kira had some good moments, but she was also belligerent, annoying, and surprisingly immature for someone meant to be a hardened resistance fighter.  I found her and the insufferable Kai Winn to be my least favorite characters, largely because I knew that if the episode focused on them, I'd have to slog through more crap about the Prophets and the Emissary.

Don't get me wrong, I like Ben Sisko. I think he's a great character and the father-son relationship with Jake is a dynamic not seen with any other captain in Star Trek. But it's when Sisko starts taking the role of the Emissary seriously and especially when you find out that he's Space Jesus that I found the quality of the show took a huge dive. 

When the focus wasn't on Bajoran religion, though, it was fantastic. I loved seeing Chief O'Brien develop from an ancillary character on TNG to a lead protagonist, a family man and ex-soldier who worked engineering wonders and became a fleshed-out three dimensional character. It was fascinating to learn about the Trill and see the differences and similarities between all the Dax hosts. And Odo, I can't possibly tell you how much I enjoyed watching Odo. Plus let's not forget Worf, whose story more or less ends in a surprisingly peaceful manner and with his long lost honor finally restored as a hero to the Klingon empire. (All hail Chancellor Martok, by the way.)

I know I'm not mentioning the Ferengi, I could write an entire essay on them. But I'll keep it brief: the Ferengi episodes are some of my favorites and they are the race who benefited the most from this show. If you want me to explain, I will.

DS9 is known as the least Star Trek-y in the franchise, and for good reason. It deals with a lot of themes not seen in the other shows and punches holes through the idea that the Federation is perfect and utopian.

I grew up on the original star trek and as a teenager on TNG.  So I am a trekkie.  A little more back story too just so you all can understand how significant and uplifting a  moment this was.  Without going into too much emotional detail, I'm getting divorced and recently moved out of my house into a very nice but still crappy apartment.  It has been very, very difficult and to a point devestating.  So, yesterday I turned on the TV for my kids as it's my week to have them and what was on BBC America?  TNG!  Expecting to hear moans and groans I prepared to defend one of my favorite shows but was stunned when I was greeted instead with rapt silence!  They were intrigued!  I spent the next hour excitedly explaining the intricacies of the show, the characters, the plots and the actors.  As if that moment wasn't awesome enough....this morning my son and I went to my favorite coffee joint and my daughter stayed home.  When we came back, with donuts, my daughter had cued up TNG S1:E1 on Netflix and was contentedly watching!  Best. Moment.

We hate on things we do not understand. I went to a Star Trek convention with a friend in high school. I made the calculated decision that you (yes I generalized the whole; stereotyping is fun!) are all a bunch of dorks. 

Now, years later, with netflix at my fingertips I decided to give TNG a try. I just finished season 1 and I'm halfway into season 2, and I have something to say:

There are 16 holodecks as per TNG: ""11001001"". So that's ~63 people per holodeck. With roughly 720 hours per month, that means each person gets nearly 11.5 hours per month.

Let's say you have a family of four - you can combine your hours into a vacation (when not on shift) for a total of 46 hours each month... this shouldn't be a problem, since people seem to be able to invite anybody else into their scheduled time with no problems. Not just a vacation, but a vacation *anywhere* doing *anything*.

I also assume that the command staff needing to use a holodeck overrides any scheduled crew member - as we've seen a few times, they use the holodeck to solve a mystery and a mission would take priority over recreation.

I guess it's not a huge discussion point, but while watching the show I always wondered how much the crew would actually get to *use* the holodecks to unwind.
