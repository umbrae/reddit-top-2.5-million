Can you help me get the ball rolling?,51,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/12i25t/i_made_a_website_that_turns_first_world_problems/,"A while ago, I started thinking about how First World Problems are a really popular thing on reddit and around the internet. We all think they're hilarious, because we're so guilty of all of these relatively minor annoyances. But I figured there must be a way to actually use the popularity of this idea to help out the people who don't have these issues.

So I created **[AllTheProblems.com](http://alltheproblems.com/about)** - a website where you can post First World Problems, and all the profits from advertising go to a charity that creates wells in Africa for communities that need them. I set it up so each person's account keeps a tally of the views that their posts receive, then converts those views into a dollar (USD) amount that represents how much their account has 'donated' thus far. Each post has a similar tally.

I want to be clear here: I'm not attempting to take advantage of reddit's humanitarian side for personal gain; I will not be making a profit on this site. I just wanted to do a good thing for people who need help. 

There are very few posts at the moment, but if it starts taking off, I can see the site generating several thousand dollars a year. According to the charity I'm using (the Blood:Water Mission), a **$1 donation gives one person in Africa enough water for an entire year**.

My mom runs an animal rescue charity (horses, mules, cats, dogs, wolves, rats and various other needy critters) called *Wildhorse Ranch Rescue.* It's in its 15th year and struggling. The charity is trying to kick off a campaign called 1inamillionmakesadifference. The idea is that *a million people each donate one dollar* to keep this rescue operation afloat for the next decade. :)

It's expensive to save, feed and medicate animals! Especially the aging, previously abused and neglected ones. This is a 501c(3) registered non-profit organization. No one has now (or ever) taken a salary. It's 100% volunteer-operated. They've rescued over 140 equines since 1995, care for 60 on-site felines (all fixed when they arrive!) in three large atriums and the constant influx of new rescue animals.

*They even run hiking troupes into the Grand Canyon to pull puppies off of the reservation (with permission) and adopt them out to good homes. It's called the HavasuPup program. :)*

**The website for the campaign is:**

### [http://www.1inamillionmakesadifference.org](http://www.1inamillionmakesadifference.org)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------

The rescue's website is: [http://www.whrr.org](http://www.whrr.org)

- Wildhorse Ranch is a NO-KILL shelter. That means animals are NOT euthanized due to overcrowding. When they reach capacity, they simply focus on caring for and adopting out the current residents to good, loving homes.

- Feel free to use PayPal to donate. The ranch's website is a bit outdated. (As I said, everything is donated and run by volunteers!) Our PayPal is:

------

Ever since I graduated high school, I've been trying to music. At first, I was poking just around on a keyboard and trying to learn to play the guitar. I got a little better, and started writing instrumental songs. Just piano and bass with some strings. I did that for a couple of years. Then, I started recording guitar tracks. In 2008, I swallowed my fears and started to sing. Three albums later, well, here we are.

I don't really have much gear - just a single electric guitar, an acoustic, my amp, some pedals, and my computer. I do all my own recording, mixing, and production. Last night, I ordered my first (small) round of discs, and signed off on the digital distribution agreement for iTunes and whatnot. I'm still learning, but I'm quite proud of how far I've come. I would be thrilled if you took the time to listen. 

----

Standout tracks, according to those who have listened before (and me, of course) are:

[Poster Child](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/poster-child) - 80s rock with a huge beat.

[Girl's Got Altitude (Little Bit Higher)](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/girls-got-altitude-little-bit-higher) - Big guitars, soaring chorus.

[Going Down (Little Bit Deeper)](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/going-down-little-bit-deeper) - A grinding, gritty beat and a noisy solo.

[Indecent](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/indecent) - An electronic track with as many synths as would fit.

But then someone decided that it was a good idea to call it ""Baby Bieber"". In response, the student community which I'm part of decided to counter this by nominating ""Holly"" as a name.

Essentially slacklining is balancing on a 1"" piece of nylon webbing that is tensioned between two points. Slacklines are generally a few feet off the ground between two trees but my favorite aspect of slacklining is highlining.

Highlining is just slacklining.... up high(not while high). Most highlines are above 50' I consider it a highline if you fall it's a sure death. However you are of course tied off to the line and highline rigs are very complicated and very safe if done right.

Another popular part of slacklining is tricklining which is the most common part of slacklining. The lines are low to the ground and generally much tighter to give you more bounce. The tricks vary greatly from balance yogaesque moves to aerial flips/tricks whatever you can think of really.


Here are some pictures of a few of the lines I've walked

Basically, I need to sell a few t-shirts before the end of the month and thought I'd try this unconventional method for doing that (hey, it worked for Radiohead).

The shop is here: http://toughlove.bigcartel.com/

There are 4 t-shirt designs that come in black or white. They are currently priced at £12.99 (roughly $20) with free shipping. For reddit I am offering discount codes so that you decide what you'd like to pay. The codes are tiered and allow you up to 70% off (I can't offer them completely free, even though I'd like to).

So, if you make a purchase and when you get to the checkout enter one of these codes:

* REDDIT10 - 10% off
* REDDIT20 - 20% off
* REDDIT30 - 30% off
* REDDIT40 - 40% off
* ~~REDDIT50 - 50% off~~
* ~~REDDIT60 - 60% off~~
* ~~REDDIT70 - 70% off~~

EDIT: Thanks those that have bought t-shirts so far! Unfortunately too many have opted for the 70% off code and I can't afford to sell anymore at that price as it works out at a loss. 50% breaks me even :).

I thought maybe I could get in on the action.

I propose something a little bit different. 

$25 gets you a digital painting with one subject and a simple background. The subject can be you, your mom, spouse, significant other, child, cat, dog, parakeet, favorite shoe, a steak dinner, cliché bowl of fruit, or whatever else you can think of. 

If you want multiple subjects, a more complex background, or an epic scene, then it will cost extra, but we can negotiate the price.

I will send you the .pdf (Photoshop file) and a .jpg (or any other format of your choice) at a resolution of 2500 x 3500. This should print nicely to most standard frame sizes. It's up to you what you want to do with it. Have it printed at your local CVS, get a nice poster from Zazzle, or set it as the wallpaper on all the computers at the office. Makes a perfect gift; stroke someone's ego until it climaxes all over your face!

Here's some (kind of unfinished) examples of what I do:

[Tegan and Sara](http://i.imgur.com/1AcX7.jpg)

[Casablanca](http://i.imgur.com/oeylC.jpg)

[Kitty cat](http://i.imgur.com/KNFFH.jpg)

If you're interested, send me a PM with your e-mail address and a photo, and we can chat about the specifics. Before I begin, I will send you a PayPal invoice. Once I finish, I'll send the file. If some shenanigans go down, and I happen to lose my right hand in a tragic woodchipper accident, you will get a refund.

I'm in a spot and need some cash, and I also need to beef up my portfolio. You need cool pictures of yourself which may or may not get you laid.

I'm announcing Project Trace Japan.",28,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/or0bq/hi_reddit_will_you_help_me_accomplish_my_lifes/,"I've not accomplished much in my life, of this I'm sure. As it stands right now I don't know what the future holds for me, but there's something I've always wanted to do. When I was a kid I used to love watching documentaries, so much so that for my tenth birthday my mom got me a tripod and a camcorder to start making my own with. That was nearly 16 years ago to the day, since then I have enjoyed making movies in my spare time but never anything serious, nothing meaningful. I want to change that.

Project Trace Japan is a documentary I'm developing that will take 2 years to film and will span over a hundred hours. It will be made and broadcast specifically for the internet, free to view and updated daily. My goal is to make a video each day and upload it to the internet as I travel from place to place on foot. The goal is to document every city and town in the entire nation of Japan over a 2 year period.

The videos will be around ten minutes in length each. They will be uploaded five days a week, giving me 2 days off for editing and recording narration. It's my hope that people will be able to take a few minutes each day and see parts of the world they wouldn't get to see otherwise. Each video is a little 10 minute vacation, as well as a chance to learn in greater depth the fantastic culture of modern Japan.

In addition to simply walking around and recording sights I will also be delving into the day to day lives of citizens. One day I might be perusing the Tsukiji seafood market, the next I'll be rubbing elbows with the fishermen themselves as they haul in their catch for the day. I want to define what day to day life is for the people of Japan and share their way of life with the whole world.

I've spent over a year budgeting and planning for the trip, the equipment costs, everything I'd need to put the project into production. That's why I hope Reddit and similar sites will help me to get this off the ground. The whole of my personal savings will be invested in this, but I'm still way shy of the money I'll need. I setup a donation page which I've linked at the bottom of this post for anyone who has a few dollars they can part with. Including my savings and assets I'm only 1/7th of the way there, so it will be years before I can start filming without outside assistance.

Making this documentary is my dream, it's what I want to do with my life and I will make it happen regardless of how long it takes. Small donations can add up to a lot, a dollar or five here and there will go a long way towards realizing my final goal. Even if you can't contribute any cash, an upvote or a few words of encouragement will always be appreciated. Dreams don't just come true, they're something we make happen, and I intend to fight for my dream until it sees fruition. 

Project Trace Japan is what I want to say late in my life was the thing I gave to this world. With that said, thanks for reading, be well, and never give up on your dreams.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT 1/22/12**

ExplainingmyDownvote has given me the indication I should better elaborate the details of this project. Trace Japan is something I've been wanting to film for about 7 years now. It's not just an excuse to get out and see a new place, it's a chance to create something unique. Yeah there is some tourist in me, of coarse I want to go, who wouldn't? Then again, only a handful of people ever went out on an expedition without wanting to see someplace new. No one's got a rifle to my head sending me to claim anything in the name of some queen. I'm doing this of my own free will, because I want to.

I'll admit making a documentary isn't the most original idea, but mine has a few key differences. Namely that I won't profit from it and the amount of raw work involved is staggering. Getting 50 minutes of footage at minimum a week isn't really hard, I could probably churn out a short video once a day with no problem. But I'm not running around with a handy cam and shooting footage like Mr Bean on holiday, this is heavy equipment I'll be lugging around. Right now the gear I'm currently set on weighs in the neighborhood of 80lbs. I'll be carrying it everywhere so that's about 12 hours a day I'll spend hauling it from place to place. I'll have the tripod setup when I'm shooting, but that's still a lot of damn work. I'm not just walking around Tokyo, my goal is to see every city and town in the entire country.

Editing and recording a narration will be a lot of fun too. On my ""days off"" I'll be running through five days worth of raw footage, notes I compiled about various places, people I interview, and recording a narrative to package it all up with. I won't have a lot of free time to say the least, not if I want the level of quality I'm aiming for.

Also, unlike people with backing from a major financial partner, this project is independently produced. I'll be in charge of everything from food to transportation, shooting, editing, and of coarse getting it all published online. I'm not going to be riding in cars and jets, I'll be taking trains and walking over most of the country. With the budget I've drawn up I can only afford to maintain a small studio apartment and will rarely be able to justify a hotel room when I'm too far away to get home at night. Some days I'll be walking around until dawn getting ready for another day of shooting. It's not like I'll have a steady stream of revenue or the ability to request additional funds, what I have in pocket has to last 2 years in a place with a relatively high cost of living.

It's a lot more work than most people would want to believe, in order to meet my quota weekly I'll be working extensively and traveling nearly constantly. I do think it will be worth it in the long run, when everything's said and done the world will have access to a comprehensive documentary about a great country. I'm willing to give up 2 years of my life to make this happen as well as pulling the rug out from under my feet to do it. My comfort zone will be non-existent, but it's a dream I've had since I was 18 so I'm willing to sacrifice my current stability and security to do it. Not enough people accomplish their dreams, there just isn't much time to set aside with the responsibilities of family and maintaining our own livelihood. I've got no one left to be responsible for except myself, so I have a rare opportunity most will never get. I intend to make the most of it, no matter how long it takes.

Trace Japan is going to be made in my lifetime, and the sooner I can start the happier I'll be. Any donation, no matter how big or small, will help me bring it to life. Please give what you can, I am grateful for any help that is offered. Rest assured, this is something I will put my whole heart into making.",,False,self,t5_2rfqv,True,,,True,t3_or0bq,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/or0bq/hi_reddit_will_you_help_me_accomplish_my_lifes/,

If you're like me, when you read about a movie, a book or a music that looks interesting, you bookmark the page about it to check/buy/download it later.

You end up with thousands of bookmarks that you ultimately forget about.

Well now you can just create a list of those things to have them all in one page and perform quick actions on them.

Here are some examples:

* You read a thread on reddit about how Battle: Los Angeles is going to be awesome. Well, then you go to [tho.se](http://tho.se), you type ""battle los angeles"", [tho.se](http://tho.se) finds the movie, and gives you customized buttons to watch the trailer on Youtube, buy it on Amazon, do whatever you want to do with it on Isohunt, and/or get the subtitles from OpenSubtitles. It also generates a random URL à-la tinyurl (shortlink) that [you can share with your friends](http://tho.se/.reddit).

* You are in a band. You do covers. Now you can add all the songs you cover to a list, you'll automatically have buttons to listen / watch the music video on Youtube, read the Lyrics on LetsSingIt, read the tab on UltimateGuitar and so on, for each song. A random URL is created that you can share with the other members of the band. You can also add a password that you may share with your friends if you want them to be able to add songs to the list in the future.

* You want to make a wishlist for christmas. Just add your items to the list, and send the random short URL to your parents.

Of course you may want to edit the list later. You just have to add a password that you'll have to type everytime you want to edit it. When you enter the right password, the list goes into *auto-save* mode and will save every change you make to it.

The last feature is a bit more meta, and you should use it sparingly. You can add URLs to the list, that is, anything that starts with *http://*. If the address points to anything that [tho.se](http://tho.se) can read, it will display a small capture of the page. Still, if you're going to link a movie, book or music, you should look for the title instead.

It's still a work in progress and I'd like to have some feedback.

1268530855.0,23,self.shamelessplug,bd3e1,I launched a URL shortening website for Reddit geeks like myself: rddd.it,27,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/bd3e1/i_launched_a_url_shortening_website_for_reddit/,"Try it out: http://rddd.it

I know URL shorteners sometimes get a bad rep and people don't see the point in them but I find them quite useful. Whenever I see a reddit link that I think somebody I know would like, I link it to them. So it helps to have a short URL that I can quickly email or even text to somebody. 

For example, my father used to work on ships and there was an AMA a while back about someone else who worked on them. I ended up showing my dad the link but it would've been a lot easier to text him: ""Hey, go to rddd.it/shipama"" because he lives far away.

And if you're really concerned about knowing where you're being forwarded to, rddd.it allows you to enable a URL preview page so that you don't unknowingly stumble into some gruesome shit. As a precautionary measure, I also snapped up [rddd.it/rickroll](http://rddd.it/rickroll) so that it is forever associated with youtube's rickroll video and if somebody tries to shorten that video, it'll just give them the same link. I want to do this with a few others too.

rddd.it is for geeks. I'm a geek, you're a geek. We're all internet geeks here. We have our own image host and I wanted us to have our own URL shortener too. For added ease, I made a few shortcuts like rddd.it/AMA and /TIL, /askreddit etc. that take you straight to their corresponding subreddits. 

Comments on the design always welcome. Another redditor [Karooble] kindly made the kickass background you see on the page.",,False,self,t5_2rfqv,True,,,True,t3_bd3e1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/bd3e1/i_launched_a_url_shortening_website_for_reddit/,

It's called /r/FuckingWithNature! A place to watch and post videos of humans interacting with wild animals in an interesting, educational, stupid, funny, or dangerous way. 

I mainly created it because the type of videos i find most interesting are the videos of a human having an intense (usually unintentional) situation with a dangerous wild animal. A good example of that would be [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixyA49jX_XI) [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V1J2Jyk3Uw) [3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_-9t5lXXSU) [4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqVE9qfg7yI). Number 4 is my favorite and the best example of what i mean.


The subreddit isn't specifically for that, there are all types of human/animal interaction videos posted there. They are all posted by me, so if you enjoy these types of videos as much as i do, and wish to see a decent sized subreddit featuring those videos, give it a visit and contribute!

10 years ago I started making ""silent"" narrative posters called Story Posters to exhibit and sell at comic conventions around the country. I've just begun a Kickstarter project in the hopes that I can raise enough funds to print an over-sized poster book collection of ALL the posters for the first time. The book will be forty 12x16 pages. 

Each poster takes from 50-100 hours to do and combine my love of comics and graphic design. The challenge is to combine fun, self-contained, comics with graphic design elements so the story makes sense but also works as an over-all piece of art. Everyone is different with it’s own look and feel, some emphasize the story-telling, others focus more on design but that’s what make’s each one unique and fun to do. 

I hope you'll check it out, see what you think! Thanks!

I race in a street stock division at a local race track in my home state of New York. I'm entering my 5th season of competition and my first full year in this particular division. For the past 4 years I have supported myself out of my own pocket, however that is no longer cutting it. I have done all I can with the caliber of equipment I currently have and I am looking for sponsors to contribute and help take my racing to the next level. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/8QA0v.jpg) is a picture of me and my car and [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/7LBlh.jpg) was taken in my garage to hopefully prove I'm legit (this is a throaway account for the sake of privacy but I am a regular user of Reddit). 

My season started this past weekend, and there are 7 races remaining, including 3 very popular Saturday night races that always draw a crowd. I am the driver, the owner, and everything in-between, which means you would only be dealing with me. We can tailor a deal that fits you budgetary needs. Every little bit helps so I'm looking for any type of sponsorship, from a small decal on the quarter panel up to full car sponsorship, whatever servers the biggest mutual benefit. 

So if you're a local person looking to promote your business, or just started a new website and want to spread your name, or anything else  for that matter, please message me or comment. I'll answer any questions and provide more details about exactly I do, what I'm looking for from a sponsor, and what I can offer you.

Sensible, dependable, cautious... that’s Indigo Coleman to a fault; but Indigo has a secret—she’s pregnant, and her abusive ex is the father. 

Not only is Indigo pregnant, but she's terrified because slowly but surely she's falling in love with sexy cowboy Matthew Brent, who knows nothing of her impending motherhood, or her abused past...

 Cowboy Up

[Can you be my fairy godmother?](http://www.whenyouwish.com/project/eyereader)

I am a recent college grad who led an all-undergraduate team that designs brain-computer interfaces. Last year, we built an interface for people who have limited voluntary motor control, such as patients in the advanced stages of motor neuron diseases like multiple sclerosis. Our interface only requires the user to concentrate on a blinking image on a computer screen (or LED), which produces brain signals at the same frequency, which we pick up with EEG.

IEEE EMBS Neural Engineering conference accepted our paper. Unfortunately, since I just graduated, I can't use my research fellowship or the travel award that I got for the team. It will cost $1100 for the conference fee and a round-trip plane ticket. I need $400 more than I have. 

I can trade you pictures of brain signals and the opportunity (if you live in St Louis, San Diego, or a city I visit for grad school interviews) to generate EEG data on this project and also on our current project to sort images faster than you can consciously recognize them. 

I'd love to join my team at the conference. Can you help me make it happen? Here is my [When You Wish](http://www.whenyouwish.com/project/eyereader), which is a crowdfundraising site similar to kickstarter. You won't get charged unless the goal ($400) is reached and I can actually go.

[Here's the link to the book.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TPZ7XO/)

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US, presented as a series of vignettes.

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:


[On whether teachers become attracted to students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k858y/teachers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_fallen_in_love/c2i8xq4)

[On teaching evolution in a rural southern high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/q0ee4/i_aint_even_mad/c3try9d)

[On a student who threatened to accuse me of sexual harassment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62u4)

[On a time where I tried to hold a lazy kid accountable and failed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62v2)

[The story that led me to quit teaching](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6ags)

People read these posts and encouraged me to write the book.  So I did.  Now it's free if you want to read it.

If you're reading these words, you can read the book.  [Here are all of the free Kindle apps you can use.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000493771)

If you download the book and read it, consider leaving a review of the book on the Amazon product page or over at Goodreads, so other people will know whether it's worth the investment.

So who am I and why should you care? I'll copy and paste a VERY brief summary which I used to enter the contest:

""I am proud to introduce you to my son, Isaac aka Bubba. Isaac was born two months early with complications and has struggled every day of his life. He is now seven years old and has a list of diagnoses and resulting symptoms longer than most people’s lifelong medical history. Isaac cannot walk, or talk, or eat, but he CAN smile and laugh. Most importantly, Isaac can love and he can feel when somebody loves him.

We are a family of 5 living on a single income with our oldest daughter leaving for college in the fall of 2012. Due to Isaac’s medical needs, he requires care 24/7, which allows only one parent to work. As he grows, it is becoming more and more obvious that it will not be long before we simply will not be able to get him in and out of a typical vehicle. Even today, I struggle to move him and position him in and out of our car. We are reaching a point where we either must find suitable transportation for Isaac or make him a prisoner in his own home. Staying at home simply is not an option for many reasons. First, his medical team is at AI Dupont Hospital in Wilmington, DE which is over 100 miles away and without these amazing people, I couldn't imagine where we would be today. Second, Isaac needs to have some level of normalcy in his life. He absolutely loves to get out of the house if only for a ride. He plays T-ball with a local Challengers Little League team for special needs children. He loves to watch his sisters with their activities. Being able to bring Isaac out into typical society greatly enhances his life and overall well being, however, without help, it won’t be long until he will not be able to leave the house at all for fun or for medical necessities. Isaac is the sweetest litle boy you could ever meet. His smile can melt your heart. He brings pride and inspiration to everyone in our family, and not only does he deserve an accessible vehicle, he needs one.

Thank you for reading our story. It barely even touches the tip of the iceberg, but I sincerely hope I have told enough to earn your vote for my boy Bubba.""

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance your your vote(s).

1327336096.0,14,self.shamelessplug,ot07m,Time is running out for this mother of 3 to get a bone marrow transplant this week.  Please help today if you can!,17,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/ot07m/time_is_running_out_for_this_mother_of_3_to_get_a/,"Check out Kelly's story on her facebook page: Keep Kelly Kickin'
This week is the week, otherwise the transplant can not take place.

A Letter from Lorelei, Another Friend of Kelly's:

I am writing this letter on behalf of Kelly Wasko, whom I have known for about twelve years. Kelly was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma a year ago. She kept this from many of her friends and family until recently, as she didn’t want anyone to worry or feel “bothered” by her problems. She has always been the kind of person who wouldn’t want to burden anyone.

Kelly and I were once roommates, so it is easy for me to say I know her pretty well. She has a zest for life that never ends. She is always happy and upbeat. In addition, she is a giving and caring person. She would give a friend, or even a stranger the shirt off her back. She participates every year in the Toys for Tots drive, actively encouraging all of her friends and acquaintances to give, even if it’s just a dollar.

Kelly has been through a great deal of trials and tribulations over the years. She is always one to pick herself up and keep going, regardless of how difficult it may be. She lost her sister at the age of 24 to cancer, and now Kelly is fighting the same fight and vowing to win, in honor of her sister. Kelly has two small children, Dominick and Danica, and a beautiful 20yr old 'mini-me', Meghan. Dominick and Danica's father left when Danica was just 7 days old. Kelly has struggled to bring up her two small children in a loving and safe environment, always putting them first. She has never had any kind of support from their father, either financial or physical. Kelly is truly a fighter. Meghan lives in Colorado, where she attends college but travels to Arizona to see Kelly, her brother and sister and has a close and loving relationship with all three of them.

Finding a donor for a bone marrow transplant is difficult. The odds of finding a match are one in ten million. Kelly was fortunate enough that her seven year old son, Dominick is a match. Unfortunately, insurance will not cover Dominick being a donor, citing it as an elective procedure. Kelly needs this transplant, not only to save her life, but to make certain she is there for her children. Kelly has no other family support and her children will have no where to go. It’s a dire situation that calls for your support. Kelly would give everything to someone in need and now she has finally learned that it is OK to ask for help. She is asking now, as are her friends and children. Please help to make her transplant possible
and give anything that you can. Her future and that of her children are depending on it.

Sincerely,

Lorelei DeLaCruz, RN",,False,self,t5_2rfqv,False,,,True,t3_ot07m,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/ot07m/time_is_running_out_for_this_mother_of_3_to_get_a/,

But when news reports show video footage of large-scale riots and unthinkable violence, he knows that something is wrong.

Alright, so I'll start with a bit of background information. About 12 years ago my mom decided to start her own small business which has now grown into the [Bushel Basket Candle Company](http://www.facebook.com/bbcandle?filter=1). She's put countless hours into making her store what it is today, but the area we live in tends to limit the growth of companies.

She has done more for me over the years than I could ever hope to repay, but if my request here is successful it will at least be a start. There's a contest of sorts going on at the moment called [Mission: Small Business](http://www.missionsmallbusiness.com). They will be giving out grants of $250,000 dollars to 12 small businesses. To be considered for judging, a business much reach at least 250 votes.

If anyone would like to help, all you have to do is go to the contest's site, http://www.missionsmallbusiness.com, select Illinois for the state and Sterling for the city, and Bushel Basket Candle Co. should be the only one that comes up. Just a heads up, I think you have to connect with Facebook in order to vote, but it doesn't cause any spam or anything as far as I can tell.

This is a really small VM written in just over 500 lines of C. No external dependencies, save the C standard library. This virtual machine consumes roughly 500K of memory at start (most of it it used by a hash table). There are no memory leaks. As far as I know, it is _impossible_ to leak memory with this VM, no matter what program you write.

The instruction set closely mimics Intel syntax x86 assembly.

So far the feature set is minimal, but the VM is Turing complete, and it's fast. In my tests so far, I've found that a well-coded program written for TVM can match a fully-optimized C program. Also in my tests, I've found that TVM programs aren't that much slower than x86 assembly running natively. So far, the performance of TVM has been no worse than 1/4 the speed of hand-coded x86 binaries.

TVM doesn't offer many of the high level language features of something like Python or Lua, but it's 10-20x faster than these other VM-based interpreted languages.

Recently, I was accepted to my dream internship. I was asked by SANLAAP - a non for profit organization based in Calcutta, India to come over for two months and make a student documentary. They fight against the sex trafficking of women and children (which currently is a 700 million US dollar industry in Bombay alone!) As an Anthropology student who is specializing in gender studies, I'm sure you can imagine the rush of excitement I got from reading that email.  
That excitement was soon crushed in paperwork. Basically my school told me that they won't support me because it doesn't involve an area that they are ""focusing on right now.""  
Dont get me wrong! **I am not asking for any money to go towards my expenses**. I am going to use my student loans to cover my plane ticket. unfortunately I was hoping to use that money to give them a rather large donation when I got there for being so generous in welcoming me (they will be providing my room and board.)  
I created an IndieGoGo in hopes that I can raise some money to present to them. The reddit community has not only done amazing things in the past, but has been taken advantage of as well. I am more than happy to present any proof you would like.  
I want to reiterate that none of this money will be going to me. I am willing to eat the cost of the plane ticket with my loans. This will be an amazing experience for me, and theres a cost that comes with that.   
**TLDR**: I am trying to raise money to present a donation check to the Indian non for profit SANLAAP.

Our 10th biennial benefit auction is another celebration of the vital link between these two worlds.

Last summer we planted the seeds of this endeavor at a fundraising meeting, and all in attendance were excited about bringing radio theater to the airwaves again (a staple of the early days of broadcast radio in this country). When we floated the concept in other VFR circles, it was loudly supported. When we floated the idea to other people and groups, we were met with hearty cheers and encouragement. We found immediate support from the local theatre group Serious Play! who in turn pitched the idea to us of a first performance of “Love, Anarchy, and Other Affairs,” by Jessica Litwak. This is a play about the life and loves of Emma Goldman, and which has been performed in New York and other locals, and the playwright and lead actress is living here in the Valley, and is a sponsor of the project. What could be better?

Emma Goldman, as many of you know, is a founder of the anarchist movement, plus an early feminist, labor activist and radical thinker in all ways. The play traces a short period in her life when she was on the run from the law, and fearing for her life. She was a Russian immigrant factory girl who became a labor activist/organizer and fiery orator on the speaker circuits in the early 1900's. She fought for free speech, women's right and free love long before those concepts were popular. We hope to bring her story to you and wider audiences through the medium of radio theater.

There are of course significant costs for making this happen, as we will need to pay royalties, rent a professional studio, pay actors, etc. but we believe the end product will be outstanding, and will build strong support and acclaim for the station.

But this cannot all happen with the support of only a few of us. It will truly take a large majority of us shoulder to shoulder pushing forward to reach this goal. There is much you can do. First and foremost, please make a donation of any size. The best way to do this is through our crowd funding source—IndieGoGo. There you can make a donation via a credit card, as well as seeing pieces of the production in our short video, plus further descriptions of the play, the actors, the playwright, and what we are trying to achieve.

As of recently, I have been working for a few months developing a console/PC game.

It's taken up a lot of my time, and almost all of my money (I can't spend EVERY dime.. I have to feed myself, you know!), but I have very high hopes for the future, and I'm pouring my heart into this. It's my passion.

Before I go on, here is some of my work:

[Actual gameplay example.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls4BaF85UtU)

I'm still in the process of designing, texturing, and modeling the landscapes, character models, and objects.

I've had to find and hire a couple of people to do some work for me. This gets very pricey.

I don't want to throw away my project or hard work, or have to push back the release date (late December, 2012). If anyone is compelled to donate, please let me know. I'll talk to you by e-mail or skype. I don't care if it's a penny, or enough to cover our national debt. I am thoroughly content with anything to help me.

I don't want this to be completely one-sided though. So as a simple, simple token of my gratitude, I want to include the name of anyone who donates anything (like I said, it doesn't matter how small) in the credits of this game as a big shout-out. Also, anyone who donates over $15, gets a free copy of the game!

If you can't donate, or don't necessarily feel compelled, thanks for reading and checking out my work! Be sure to give it a thumbs up on Youtube!

Anyone in North America can call, and record a message of up to 3 minutes in length, completely anonymously. I plan on editing and organizing the messages to make audio pieces, and the pieces will be posted on the blog for all the internet to listen to. I'm thinking that once I start getting a sufficient number of messages I can group them by theme and post them to my blog in little episodes.

At the moment I'm looking for people's secrets so I can do a sort of audio version of PostSecret, but it's an open ended kind of idea so anything you've got to say is still a great contribution.

I'm trying to break into the writing game, and the hardest part is getting my name out there.

I wrote a dystopian sci-fi novel about a man who plots a false-flag operation against his own people because he's obsessed with control, and the consequences of what can happen when things don't quite go as planned.  The man behind the scenes is named Anders, he cultivates control over his own emotions to an extreme degree, worrying that man is little more than an animal and fearing that he may be nothing better himself.  There is a whole cast of characters, ranging from an alcoholic outlander ex-revolutionary to a man-child in a position of high power, and many more in between those two.

Anyway, that's briefly what the story is about, and I get to give away free copies for today and tomorrow, so if you or anyone you know wants a free kindle book, [the link is here](http://www.amazon.com/The-Walls-of-Samwel-ebook/dp/B00AVMIZL8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359387225&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+walls+of+samwel).

Thanks for your time, I hope you have a good day.

She's big into typography and design and loves the idea of having pieces from all over the world. It's truly something that you can never finish collecting. She's put a lot of love into collecting them from everywhere she can during her travels around the US and Canada. (TINY sample of the collection: http://i.imgur.com/VQotV.jpg)

Unfortunately, she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The prognosis is very good, and she's expected to win as it was caught fairly early. That's the good news. The bad news is that her treatment plan involves at least 6 months of chemo starting soon and perhaps a year battle all said and done. Here's some proof, I know it doesn't say BC on it, but it's the best I could do quickly this morning on the way out the door with what I had. (proof: http://i.imgur.com/hKqIp.jpg)

I was hoping to use the power of the Internet and Reddit's kindness to overwhelm her with business cards from around the world. Do you think you could spare a stamp and a few minutes of your day to drop a few cards in the mail? They don't have to be yours. They could be a card from the restaurant down the street, the dentist office, a roofing contractor, a mechanic,  one of your colleagues... it doesn't matter. Just grab a few during your travels and anonymously drop them in the mail. Just a few cards from cool places will go a long way. Even if you can't send some cards, how about an upvote to get this in front of more people?

At this point, we're getting roughly 2-4 envelopes a day. It's amazing.  Spread this around, send it to your friends! You have no idea how much it helps to have something to look forward to every day. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

I can't thank you all enough. I'm using a throwaway and a PO BOX to protect her privacy.

Thank you so much for voting so far (http://inspiringexperts.com/videogallery.php#aHiqeWe5Tzc)! As much as it has helped, a person who was around last place had a friend with 12,000 followers who tweeted: ""GO HERE AND CLICK ""VOTE NOW"". IT'S FOR A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND, TAKES 2 SECONDS &lt;3"" and in 2 hours got twice the number of votes I took 2 months to earn.

What should I do?  I'd post this on AskReddit, but would that not be condoned because it has to do with voting for a competition?  I feel like on the one hand, it's fair game; anyone can use social media.  Heck, even I am.  But on the other, I always stated what it was for.  This person got a bunch of attention just because someone on Twitter said ""Go here!  2 seconds!  Helping high school friend!""

TL;DR: Not 1st place because of Twitter.  Trying to figure out how to match that.

(X-post ineedafavor)",15,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/14337o/please_vote_for_me_and_help_me_prove_cheaters/,"After a lot of asking friends and all over the place, my vote count was pretty good.  I discovered cheating (vote buying), and reported that and provided proof of this to the sponsor of the contest.  

Yesterday the ability to see both the vote count and the profile photos of the people that voted has disappeared.

I did speak with the contest sponsor, and they do believe me that 'cheating' has occurred.  They are upset but they weren't sure how they planned to proceed, because the rules did not specifically say vote buying/fake profiles were against the rules.  She said they might end the contest early (the rules say they can do so at their discretion), or because the rules were not specific against cheating...they might let the contest run it's course and take this as an expensive lesson for next time.

And that right there is wrong...that someone can spend $20-$30 for a bunch of fake votes and get $5,000 worth of furniture in return.  Perhaps some people might give the man a high five...but I think it is wrong.  Each of my votes were from genuine people, not from an online vote buyer.  Take away the votes that were bought, and I'd be in the lead right now.

I did report a boatload of the fake profiles to Facebook, and some of them showed up as broken links when I checked earlier yesterday...but as I mentioned a moment ago...the contest page no longer shows the vote count OR the ability to see who has voted...so I can't report anymore of the fake profiles.

Before this happened, his vote count was at 341, mine was at 290.  As for the rest, the majority of the people who entered the contest didn't follow the rules...which state you MUST have your photo taken in one of two stores...so they're disqualified for not following the rules.

They may end up terminating the contest early...but in the event the information has been removed because I reported the cheating...and they are continuing the contest under the 'expensive lesson' theory...I am asking for help.  Please vote for me.  

I'd like to win the furniture HONESTLY.  Which means REAL people voting...not spending $20 for a couple hundred votes.  It's not just about winning the furniture.  Yes, winning the furniture would be nice...I do need it.  But more important to me is that someone doesn't profit from cheating or taking advantage of what shouldn't have to be spelled out.  If they canceled the contest today I'd be totally okay with that...and I said so in my letter to them when I first reported the cheating as well as verbally.  I simply do not want someone who cheats to win.  It's as simple as that.

The site is essentially for reviews. I think we would all agree that there doesn't seem to be a one-stop-shop for reviews online, Amazon is pretty good...but you can only review products held on Amazon's database.

Snowglo is different. Snowglo is a community based review site, where users can review anything. They could review the latest video games, they could review a movie trailer. There's even an option to review things like 'How my morning went' and 'my breakfast'. Literally anything.

The site generates income by affiliate links to Amazon, users can earn cash by writing reviews which generate purchases on Amazon. There is a competitive leaderboard, showing which users have  the most successful reviews. 'Achievements' can be unlocked by users for reviewing certain products, earning the users badges on the site. These badges can be shown off on the user's profile.

The site links in perfectly with Facebook and Twitter, becoming an extension of the community.

Personally I think it's a solid idea. The site has some decent features which will entice users to a repeat visit, it has a good ranking system, and their brand is solid.

We have yet to win anything in my class and my students wanted to start the year off with a victory. Last year we submitted videos to 5 contests and did not get a certificate or win for any of them.

So my proposal, help my students get first place and I will submit photos of them giving you high fives or hugs as a reward for your kindness.

Even if you don't vote, can I at least get a reddit ""I like students that stay after 3 days to work on projects"" upvote?

My father was laid off from Kimberly Clark a few years ago at the start of the recession. While he was out of work, being the genius engineer he is, he thought of the idea to build a sports equipment sanitizing machine. He built the first prototype in our garage, patented it, and started his own business. He currently works at least 60 hours a week to bust his butt in order to provide for out family. He runs a two-man company by the name of [ZONOsanitech](http://zonosanitech.com), based out of Roswell, Georgia. 

Just a few days ago he told me that his company was being considered for a $250,000 grant ponsored by Chase and LivingSocial. He only needs 200 more votes to qualify for the final selection round. It only takes a minute to vote, and he would be amazed if you guys could move him on to the next round, much less if he won. So, what do you say Reddit? Could you help out an engineer in need?

Here's how to vote:

1. Go to **www.missionsmallbusiness.com**
2. Click 'Log In &amp; Support' and log in using Facebook.
3. Search for ZONOsanitech
4. Click on the blue Vote button next to our business name to show your support for ZONO.

1.) Each statement\action made by a candidate for federal office gets a support score based upon contributed money, facebook likes, tweets and url shares. (yeah kinda like reddit)
2.) That each individual can see the influence they have by tracking the support their networks gives to a statement or action when they share it. 

We have set up a non affiliated 527PAC and are non-partisan - so basically all money contributed to the candidate is pooled and aggregated once a week and sent off to the candidate with a note with why they are getting the money.

If you've made it this far you might want to know about his company. Both my mom and dad got laid off around 2008 and my dad chose to follow his dream of bringing frozen bananas to everyone, instead of only having them at festivals. They're pretty good and peppered throughout South Florida, but have also spread up to NY, Canada and the west coast. Right now we're meeting demand, a pretty solid demand, but can't yet exceed it. To grow the business we need a larger facility and to scale up; this grant would allow it. The 250 votes are a minimum to be considered, and don't guarantee he'll win, or cost you anything but time. For the size of reddit, 100 is nothing.

Read about Totally Bananas at www.Totally-Bananas.net and thanks (hopefully) for voting!

Please check this out.,12,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/uy8ed/were_trying_to_get_an_entire_town_on_a_fiberoptic/,"I live in a tiny remote, rural community (population, around 4,000) in the south desert of Utah. Out here we're used to being at the bottom of the list for most things - good food, cell service, and internet connectivity.

However, my good friend started an internet service provider a few years back and has made it his entire life. Now, with the advent of things like Netflix, skype, etc, and other bandwidth-heavy programs our users are finding they *can* get involved in the world outside our remote town. 

The problem, of course, is that as more of our users get keyed in to this stuff the more our bandwidth is constrained. Usage *quadrupled* last year, with no appreciable increase in subscribers. 

What we're doing is building a fiber network throughout the town, and *digging a 50 mile trench to the next largest town* - so that as our user's bandwidth needs increase we'll be able to keep up with capacity without needing to buy an entire microwave tower!

So, like many businesses, we're competing for grants. What I ask of you is this: please go to the chase bank small business grant website here: http://www.missionsmallbusiness.com/ and use your facebook account to vote for *Xpressweb* in the town of *Kanab, Utah*
-

I know it's asking a lot of clicking, but I really feel this is a worthwhile goal. I think that getting people reliable communication through the internet is nearly a *right* in the modern day.

A note about Xpressweb: This is a great company with a great owner. He is a volunteer scoutmaster. He goes personally to the homes of clients to do everything from installs to teaching them how to send emails. He gives out his cell phone number. I really admire him.

Xpressweb isn't going to be charging an arm and a leg for fiber connections, either. In fact, existing high-use clients will get it at no extra ongoing charge. The owner figures it's a win-win: they get more bandwidth and other clients get more bandwidth on our traditional network if they don't want to switch. 

My math says that if we don't get a grant the company will probably not see a profit from fiber for about 10 years. We're not counting on it, but it sure would speed things up. [Please help if you can.](http://www.missionsmallbusiness.com/)

Seeing the program become a reality has been incredibly rewarding. More importantly, those who participated in Seas of Peace have described the program as the experience of a lifetime that has the power to change the lives and minds of many. During their time at Seas of Peace, the participants discuss who they are, where they come from, and how conflict has affected their lives. In choosing such an isolated environment, the program challenges the students to truly engage with one another, offering them no choice with whom they interact.

We have made it to the final three, but we are up against a fraternity who has the ability to call on a large social group for votes.

While we know our video has it's weaknesses, mainly the fact that we shot it in 4:3 and that our actor wore a white suit (We wrote, shot, and edited the whole thing in about 4 hours because we found out about the competition at 0 hour so it's far from perfect). That being said we still think it is the strongest of the three videos by a healthy margin. If you agree please toss us a vote or two (you are allowed to vote once every hour from every browser on your computer).

Our video is ""Stuck in the Past""

[Here's the link](http://6dollarshirts.com/submit_a_design.php?view=submission&amp;id=1300300272). It's my own original artwork. Also, any critique would be good, too!

What it does is:

&gt; It's too hard now, say the bill's backers, and I can sympathize. It's their solution that appalls me: under language approved 19 to 10 by a House committee, the firm that sells you Internet access would be required to track all of your Internet activity and save it for 18 months, along with your name, the address where you live, your bank account numbers, your credit card numbers, and IP addresses you've been assigned. 

&gt;Tracking the private daily behavior of everyone in order to help catch a small number of child criminals is itself the noxious practice of police states. Said an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation: ""The data retention mandate in this bill would treat every Internet user like a criminal and threaten the online privacy and free speech rights of every American."" Even more troubling is what the government would need to do in order to access this trove of private information: ask for it.

&gt;I kid you not -- that's it

What makes that even more dangerous is this little bit:
&gt;As written, The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 doesn't require that someone be under investigation on child pornography charges in order for police to access their Internet history -- being suspected of any crime is enough. (It may even be made available in civil matters like divorce trials or child custody battles.)

[Obituary](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-11-27/news/bs-md-ob-daniel-siegel-20101127_1_yale-student-brain-cancer-martial-arts)

[Article in the Yale Daily News (Dan was an undergrad at Yale)](http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/nov/29/daniel-siegel-11-dies/)

From a personal perspective: Dan and I grew up and went to school together from the time we and my twin brother were in preschool until we graduated high school together, and he and my brother were best friends growing up.  When we were in middle school pretty much all the boys in our class made fun of me constantly (middle school is always rough, especially if you're a nerdy girl).  Even my brother would laugh at his friends' jokes about me, but Dan was the only boy in the whole group who was always nice to me and defended me.  He is pretty much the reason I survived middle school lol.  He was just the nicest person you could imagine, in addition to being brilliant.

Anyway, I really just wanted to share his memory with you guys on the anniversary of his death, and to let you know about the Barnes &amp; Noble fundraiser.

Sample - this story won me third place in a contest a few years ago.

The Knock

Did you hear that knock at your door?


I think you did. C'mon answer it.


Go ahead – it’s only me. You're not afraid of me, are you? You shouldn't be. I spent a lot of time on this. I'm waiting.

Look I have a package under my arm just for you. Everyone likes packages. You love deliveries. You know you want to see what it is and who it’s from. It's something special; I'll tell you that.


I wrapped it myself. Just for you. You know it’s your favorite paper and your favorite color.


Are you going to make me knock again? Please don't. I get awfully impatient. We can't have anybody see me now can we? So please hurry.


See my uniform? Doesn't that inspire trust? It should. I spent a long time making it. I think it looks pretty good. Good enough anyway. Everyone else trusted it. 


And my nametag. Can't you see I'm wearing a nametag? You can always trust a guy with a nametag, can't you? It's not my name but does that matter? 


If you look really hard you can see my truck parked in the street. It looks real doesn't it? 


And I even put a phone number on the side. Would a bad guy put a phone number on his truck? And look at that smiley face. Everyone trusts a smiley face, right?


They're only magnets. I'll pull them off as soon as we are done. I don't think you'll mind.


Please answer the door. I've waited a long time for this. I don't have much more time. Do you know how long I've been watching you; getting your schedule down?


I know you're home. I've looked at my notes. There's no one with you, is there? I think I can hear your footsteps. Hurry up.


I promise I won't be long. I've gotten faster. Now it takes me all of about 5 minutes to finish. That's fast right? I think it is. Maybe I can be faster today.


C'mon please hurry. There's not much time left.


I can see the light change in the peep hole. I know you are watching me. I'm just a delivery man. Look at my smile.


No, sorry, I can't leave the package. You have to sign. That's the story anyway. It always works.


And I'll just need to step inside. I'll tell you I'll wait for you to go put my package down. But I won't. I'll just step inside and shut the door. I'll wait for you just inside the door as to not alarm you.


Ah, I hear the deadbolt turn. Any second now. You'll be so surprised.

Your attendance or referral would help save the show, and lift a great burden on my girlfriend.",11,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/gika6/san_diego_redditors_into_the_hip_hop_scene_are/,"SD Redditors, my apologies for the rather classless plea for help. I admit, this will be a shameless plug that is made out of desperation and sympathy, and I am prepared to take the karma hit for it. But here's what's going on, please consider reading before killing off this thread's exposure: 

For 12 consecutive years, the 220 Second to None dance group and Multi Asian Cultural Association (MASA) of UCSD have hosted what has always been regarded as the biggest dance competition in the West Coast. This show exploded during the height of popularity of the show ""America's Best Dance Crew"" where all of the winners up to this point have been friends among us during the years these competitions remained ""underground."" 

The past 3 to 4 years, the popularity wore off and ticket sales took a huge dive as many of the competing teams' footage were uploaded onto Youtube in HD quality. 

Though other shows in the circuit have remained prosperous (namely Vibe, Body Rock, etc.), it is due to the fact that Fusion is placed toward the end of the dance season, where many of these teams have performed certain sets, and may not have choreographed anything new until the last show, Body Rock. 

Therefore, the organizers face the reality of Fusion being cancelled by UCSD in the future, and the four coordinators (my girlfriend included), face the possibility of not graduating until all the seed money is at least paid back. At this point, my girlfriend has set aside $2000 to give to UCSD, as the show is happening in less than a week, and ticket sales are far from breaking even.

And so, if any of you Redditors enjoy the hip hop culture, enjoy dance, enjoy those shows and want to see real and not-gimmicky choreography, please check out [the Fusion website here](http://www.fusionhiphop.org). 

If you are considering attending, go ahead and drop me a message, instead of paying $23 online, or $26 at the door, I can get you presale tickets for $21, or if you end up bringing a crowd, I might be able to get my hands on a free ticket for you. 

Thank you for listening. Again, apologies for this shameless plug. Fusion has been a tradition, and what little profit that might come out of it only serves to help the team pay for competition costs and helps pay for the next Fusion show.

**TL;DR: My girlfriend dances for a dance team that puts on a very well known dance show every year. The show has taken a dive in ticket sales the past few years, and if their target ticket sales aren't met this year, she will have to owe UCSD about $2000 before she is allowed to graduate. If you love hip hop, love dance, or are interested in something new, please check it out.**

**Actually in all honestly, I don't even understand the gravity of how much they owe right now. I'm just hurting for her, so I'm just doing what I can to support.**",,False,self,t5_2rfqv,False,,,True,t3_gika6,http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug/comments/gika6/san_diego_redditors_into_the_hip_hop_scene_are/,
