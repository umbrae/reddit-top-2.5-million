The original campaign is now officially over. 

You can still pledge if you create a RSI account and pledge through their website directly. However, new backers get fewer privileges than original backers:
""if you want to back Star Citizen and participate in this amazing community, you still can. but it's going to cost you a little extra as of now, and you aren't going to have as many extras (no lifetime insurance, for example.)"" |   [Source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen/posts/352301)

**Total raised: $6,238,563**


**General features:**

* Full orchestral score (I personally suggest Bear McCreary (BSG, The Walking Dead) or Thomas Bergensen (Two Steps from Hell) as both candidates have the chops to compose epic scores!)
* 100 systems to explore in persistent universe (single server like Eve Online, post-single player campaign World. See below for full blog post by CR on instancing mechanics and how PvP will work. Take note you WILL be able to create private servers and mod them to your heart's content)
* 50 SP branching missions in Squadron 42 campaign 
* Professional mocap 
* Celebrity voice over (at least one original cast member will return. MARK HAMILL COME ON OVER!)
* Extensive peripheral support (MFD, multi-monitor, Oculus Rift, pedals, chairs, etc.) 
* Tablet app for Android and iOS (check inventory, missions, newsfeed, etc.)
* Monthly updates on progress of game development (Town Hall meetings CR called them)
* Largest playable ship in the online persistent universe hosted by RSI: Bengal Carrier (5.5M stretchgoal)
* Multiple types of bases (see below for more details) 
* A Lamp 
* Cockpit decorations (including bobbleheads with realistic physics, dinosaurs)
* Mod tools
* Private servers
* AMX-1 Repair Droid ""Thanks to a network of nine telescoping flex arms, the AMX-1 can access and repair any standard ship system with ease. Though it lacks the full speech boards and the emotional memory cores of more expensive models, the trademark whirring and beeping of an AMX is a welcome sound for anyone charting a path between the stars.""
* A Lamp 
* Multiple classes/types of ship: bomber, interceptor, general purpose fighter, destroyer, carrier, transport, pirate ship
* Extensive trading system 
* CR would like to add crafting as well, but it will never approach EO complexity as this is not what he wants for SC. No details for now.
* Purchase of in-game credits with real money. Planned conversion rate is 1$ = 1000cr
* No monthly subscription to play on persistent server
* Ship-to-ship capture and boarding with FPS elements, Melee &amp; Heavy Weapons, Zero-gravity Simulation, Suit HUD Options, Increased Customization, Outside-the-ship combat (magnetic boots on a hull; think Moonraker)
* First/Third Person movements on big ships (Bengal Carrier, RSI Constellation)
* NPC interactions on stations and bigger ships
* Planet landings (scripted)
* Ability to fly through a planetary atmosphere to siphon hydrogen to use as fuel
* Manual take-offs and landings on carriers
* Fully modular ships. Damaging key components will affect flight capabilities. Although built slightly simpler than the smaller ships, capital ships will have sub-targets we will be able to destroy to incapacitate or disable it.
* Multi-person ships. The RSI Constellation (250$+ tier or available via add-on) can be piloted by a single person, but has room for 3 more. The ship has a dockable P52 fighter friends can use, as well as two mannable turrets (think Millenium Falcon). It has not been confirmed whether crew ships can be manned by NPCs if friends are not available to drop-in your ship and control the fighter and turrets.
* Tractor beams
* Choose between male and female avatars, and they will be customizable, though not to the extent of Skyrim
* A frakking lamp! In the frakking ship!

**Monthly backers**

**Centurion 10$/month:**

* The ability to participate in the live monthly team “show and tell.” We will answer twenty questions from subscribers (selected via voting system.) Subscribers will watch the update live as it is being recorded.
Jump Point, the monthly digital magazine of Star Citizen. A 4-6 page monthly newsletter which includes updates from the team and new in-universe Star Citizen fiction from the writing team.
* Access to “The Vault,” a collection of Star Citizen artwork that would otherwise never be seen, including ‘paths not taken’ discarded concept art for the true collector.
* An exclusive catalog of Star Citizen subscriber merchandise.
* Your name in the game. We can’t tell you where you’ll find it, but if you subscribe for at least 12 months your name will be located somewhere in the Star Citizen world!
* Centurion decal for your ship

**Imperator 20$/month:**

Everything listed above, plus…

* Visit Cloud Imperium and see how the game is made! Imperator-level subscribers will be allowed one visit per year (scheduled in advance) to the Star Citizen development offices in Austin or Los Angeles.
* Three wishes – Chris Roberts will personally reply to three of your questions a year.
* Your name on the wall-of-honor at Cloud Imperium HQ if you subscribe for at least 12 months.
* Jump Point: Year One, a printed collection of Jump Point issues provided to anyone who subscribes for the entire first year of development.
* Imperator decal for your Ship.

**Ships**

All of these ships will be available at launch and be obtainable in-game either for in-game credits or by capture. The main advantage of pledge ships is the lifetime insurance on the hull for those original backers who pledged before the KS campaign ended. Insurance for up to 12 months will be available in game for each hull.

* Idris-class Corvette | ""Larger than a bomber but smaller than a ship of the line, corvettes occupy an interesting space in the pantheon of warships. While they lack the heavy armor and the capital weaponry of a cruiser, corvettes are more maneuverable and are highly configurable. Even the least expensive models feature numerous upgrade slots and multiple hard points for turrets and missiles. Corvettes are also frequently used for boarding actions; a single ship can support a team of marines capable of taking the fight to the decks of larger warships and stations.""
* Bengal Carrier | It will be used as a clan base and CR said it will be very hard to get.

Redditor psych2l has made a very nice spreadsheet comparing stats of all ships side-by-side for easy comparison. | [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AlblbRhPNxOWdFhMV3ZBNHhfMnZWcHM3MXYzb1dWTHc)

**Pledges**

* All pledges and add-ons can be added or upgraded in the first 12 months after campaign has ended so long you pledged before the campaign ended
* KS and RSI pledges will be combined once campaign has ended
* All pledges and add-ons count towards a ""total"" pledge amount that will reflect what Citizen card you get (so if you got the 60$ tier on KS but added over 200$ in add-ons, you're considered a ""Rear Admiral"" pledger (250$+))
* Pledges guarantee lifetime insurance on the hull ONLY. All upgrades and cargo will be lost.

* First ""expansion"" (mission disk) with 16 more missions free to all backers when it comes out

* You can name a system for 5000$+
* Unlimited and free garage space for all pledge ships

**Physical boxes**

* 125$+ get a green box (image: [here](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SC_CollectorBox_Green_lvladjust_Final-300x114.png))

Just like Citizen cards, all add-ons and pledges go toward a total pledge amount that will determine which box you get.

**Merchandise**

* T-Shirts, 25$ each | [Grey](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SC_Shirt_1-300x201.jpg) and [Green](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SC_Shirt_2-300x193.jpg)

Backers over $1,000 get the Squadron 42 shirt for free and backers over $5,000 get both.

Message from C. Roberts






The battle is over and we - PC gamers, space sim fans, WingNuts, Lancers and the rest - have won. You've not only met every goal we set, you've exceeded them. Star Citizen will be released because of your dedication and your willingness to put your money where our mouths are. Our gratitude is immeasurable; we owe you our livelihoods and will not soon forget it.

The question is: what happens next?

Our intention has always been to make Roberts Space Industries YOUR site. It's not a public advertisement for the game; it's a private community for those who are making the game happen. We want your input on what we're doing and we want to share our plans with you; the occasional passer-by doesn't concern us. The plan was initially to immediately switch on a wall that would allow only you, our backers, to access features like the Comm-Link and the Spectrum Dispatches. Kickstarter has thrown something of a wrench in this plan: we can't change the site until the Kickstarter backers are integrated, which may take up to two weeks, otherwise we would be blocking thousands of backers from participating.

Updates and features will continue, returning to a regular schedule in the next few days. The team needs a few days to collect ourselves and reform before jumping into the immense task ahead (after the last month, our husbands, wives, children and yes, pets, miss us!) We will also be launching new sections which have been in the works for some time: the Galactapedia will tell you more about the Star Citizen world, Engineering will introduce you to game mechanics that are being planned and Holovids will offer you video footage from the game as it takes shape.

What about pledges? Good news: those of you who got in on the ground floor are covered. Your ships have lifetime insurance policies and for the next year you will have the ability to purchase further tiers or upgrade existing ones at the initial prices. That's not true of everyone else: if you want to back Star Citizen and participate in this amazing community, you still can. but it's going to cost you a little extra as of now, and you aren't going to have as many extras (no lifetime insurance, for example.)

One issue which concerns us is what to do with the funding tracker. So we're going to throw the issue up to you: in two weeks, when the wall goes up, what do you want to see done with the tracker? Without the 'push' of the campaign it probably won't update very dramatically. but it's always possible it will go up enough to reach future stretch goals anyway. Should we keep it, remove it or put it somewhere else? We'll let the community decide.

We also have previously outlined the 'behind the screens' subscription plans available now. They're designed for users who simply want to give us a little extra support during the development - you're getting the whole story, regardless - but we will have some extra fun for our monthly contributors.

From what I've read, it seems like Chris Roberts wants to make this the best space sim game ever, which is great. Don't get me wrong. But I fear that resources will be stretched too thin to make good on everything they've promised. In a timely fashion, at least. To give you an example of features I'm concerned about...

* Ship boarding and FPS combat. I know it's already built into Crytek, so they get a lot of that for free. But do we need this to have a fun space sim? No. It's cool and I'm sure that this could add a lot to gameplay, but ultimately it just sounds like a lot of extra work for the development team. 
* The economy system. I'm specifically referring to the way that AI is supposed to buy, sell, and manufacture goods, as well as transport information from one system to the next. It's an interesting idea, and once again I think it would be great to have such detail, but I fear it could be a very difficult to implement correctly. Economies are incredibly complex, and simulating something like this on a galactic scale sounds like a huge undertaking. Not to mention getting the balance right so that prices don't just go all over the place. And then there's the fact that the AI presence is supposed to grow/diminish based on the player activity in a system. 

The drive to get more money isn't helping, either. With every new stretch goal, new promises are made. Building a motion capture studio.....? It just seems like CIG is making it increasingly unlikely that they will be able to meet the expectations that they themselves have set.

I am hopeful that by crowdfunding, CIG will be able to release the game when it's actually ready instead of sticking to a deadline. Meaning that I fully expect them to push back release.

Am I being too cynical? I may or may not have gotten severely burned by the recent Sim City debacle...

TL;DR: I think that Star Citizen's feature list and timeline seem to be aggressive and unrealistic. Agree? Disagree?",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_1dy2gm,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1dy2gm/is_anyone_else_concerned_about_overpromising/,

Let's say you destroy another ship and when salvaging you remove it's identification tag.  When Activated other players will see you on their radar as friendly, showing the squadron/name of the other player.  This could allow you to travel through police owned systems.

It would need to have several restrictions,  as only working for a set amount of time(unknown to the player).  That time can be affected by several factors. For example, if you put the tag of freighter and put it on a fighter, it's more obviously a fake, and if you get too close to another ship the effects will be disabled.  But if you somehow get the tags from the same ship as you, it will go unnoticed longer and may even let you dock.

What happens when they the effects fails? it could be turned around, lets say the police and players now see him as hostile, but the pirate still sees everyone as friendly until they open fire.  This way if the police or other players notice the player had a fake tag, they could ignore him and let him walk into an ambush before attacking.

Looks like RSI will hit the magic $10mil before the end of the week. 

Based on a budget of $20mil that CR mentioned, ""the crowd"" will be majority shareholders!

So what does it mean to the playerbase that Star Citizen may be the first AAA game to have a majority share in the crowd?

...that means only 100 more ""average"" pledges  to go.

As comrades in arms (and internets) however, and in honor of our common ground, I am proposing a Unified Reddit Alliance to ensure the mutual protection of our varied assets, regardless of our guild.

This would not be a guild unto itself, but rather an alliance of our separate guilds. While all guilds are, of course, free to pursue their own goals, such an Alliance would provide us strength in numbers, and ensure we always have allies in a hostile universe. 

This would be primarily a meta-game affair, as it appears that no higher organization than guilds will be implemented in the game.

The perks of such an Alliance could include:

* An SOS channel, on which you can call for assistance from your fellow Redditors
* A treaty of mutual defense. You are encouraged, though not obligated, to aid your fellow Redditors.
* Manpower for large operations, such as capturing and holding strategic elements such as the Bengal Carriers.
* A Unified subreddit, for planning such events.
* A Teamspeak/Ventrillo server, for voice comms, if desired.
* A wingman, whenever you need one!

Suggestions for the name of such an Alliance are welcome, as are any critiques/ideas.

**Will my computer be able to run SC?**

From Kickstarter FAQ:

&gt;At the moment you will be able to play it on a dual core PC with a GTX 460 or greater and 4GB of system memory. If you’re running an i7 2500, 2600, 2700 or better with a GTX 670 or greater then the stars are the limit! Since the game is built on CryEngine, their system requirements will stay roughly the same as ours.

Considering the game has a couple years to be released, the requirements could easily change. However, you also have 2 years, the hangar module, and the dogfighting alpha to get an idea of what you need to change. During this time, new CPUs and GPUs will come out and the price of current generations will drop.

**How can I get access to the alpha or beta?**

You need to purchase a package that includes the alpha and beta (for example, the Bounty Hunter or Rear Admiral packages). There are a limited number of slots however. [This page](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/) has a count of the number of slots left.

**What ship should I get?**

That depends. Here is a current list of ships that have been sold on the site. There are some limited edition ships here that have been available for purchase a couple times but will probably not be available again; the only way to get these ships is to find someone willing to gift/sell you a ship they have purchased. In order of ability to purchase and manufacturer:

*Ships currently for sale:*

[*RSI Aurora:*](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/d5uc8684zn6etr/source/Aurora_brochure.pdf) The cheapest ship. You will need to customize this ship with upgrades to make it what you want. $25 for the ship. $30 for one package (this is the only package that does not grant access to alpha or beta) or $40 for a package with alpha and beta. There are also some variants that were sold for a limited time.

[*RSI Constellation:*](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/fvuwqq1t17wzkr/source/RSIConstellationMK3BrochureV2.pdf) A multi-person ship. Good for bounty hunters, pirates, smugglers, and merchants. It has a good sized cargo area, a snub fighter, turrets, and missiles for defense. $225 for just the ship. $275/$550/$1150 if bought with in a package that includes in game and physical items.

*Anvil Hornet:* Civilian version of the military Hornet. Durable ship for dogfighting. $110 for the ship, $125/$140 for the packages (Digital Colonel/Colonel).

[*Origin 300i:*](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/exfjsh7mejoxir/source/300series_brochure.pdf) built for touring with upgraded versions that are more specialized (more on those later). $55 for the ship, $65 for the package (Digital Bounty Hunter).

*Origin 315p:* Built for exploration. The 315p is a modified version of the 300i with long-range engines and a tractor beam. $65 for the ship, $75 for the package (Pathfinder)

*Origin 325a:* Built for dogfighting. The 325a has missile launchers and a mass driver cannon pre-installed. $70 for the ship, $80 for the package (Arbiter).

*MISC Freelancer:* Could be used as a merchant ship or an explorer, not good as a combat ship. $110 for the ship, $125/$140 for the package (Digital Freelancer/Freelancer).

*Drake Cutlass:* A fighter favored by pirates. Has a larger cargo hold than other fighters and comes with a tractor beam. Not available as just the ship, $100 for the package (Pirate).

*Aegis Avenger:* An interdiction ship. Sturdy ship with central heavy gun mount with a total of 5 gun mounts. The ships seem to come with better sensors and computer systems than many other fighters (though exactly what that entails is not clear). The engines are powerful, and the cargo hold is larger than many other fighters. $60 for the ship, no package options.

*Ships not currently for sale:*

*RSI Aurora Marque:* Not available for purchase currently. An interdiction ship that comes with 2 laser cannons and a more powerful engine than the base Aurora.

*RSI Aurora Clipper:* Not available for purchase currently. Light Mercantile. It has weaker engines but has room for a cargo addon.

*RSI Aurora Legionnaire:* Not available for purchase currently (and the only one on this list that has never been for sale). Combat model of the Aurora. Looks like it will be used in militias. Has more powerful engines, shields, and weapons than other models, but is also heavier.

*RSI Aurora LX:* Not available for purchase currently. An exploration and light mercantile ship. It has powerful engines, a good shield, weapons, and you can customize it far more than other Aurora models.

*Origin 350r:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there it no reason to count on it. A 300i with upgraded engines and modified hull. It is lighter and faster than other 300 series models, however it is also not armed as well and has lower armor and shields. Looks like a good racing/courier ship.

*Origin M50:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there it no reason to count on it. It is a very fast ship; it is good for racing, exploration, and dogfighting if you want to use speed (not armor and powerful weapons) to win.

*MISC Starfarer:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there it no reason to count on it. Very large cargo transport. Useful for transporting liquid fuel or food as well as solid cargo. Seems the military will also have an armored version in game.

*Drake Caterpillar:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there is no reason to count on it. Essentially a pirate ship. Has a large cargo hold, heavier armor than other freighters, and room for a small boarding party. It is still a freighter however and will not be able to take down most ships solo.

*Aegis Retaliator:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there it no reason to count on it. Long-range bombers in the military, the civilian version could be used as a medium freighter, an explorer, or a passenger craft.

*Aegis Idris Corvette:* Not currently for sale (very limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there is only a small chance that they will be sold again. These are powerful ships. They have multiple hard points for turrets and missiles. The ship can hold multiple crew members (with the potential to send a boarding party of 10 people). There are also military and civilian versions.

*Anvil Gladiator:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, however there it no reason to count on it. Torpedo bomber. 2 person bomber with a pilot up front and a radar officer/turret gunner in the back. The civilian version replaces the bomb bay with crew quarters, but you can purchase a bomb bay upgrade in game.

*Vanduul Scythe:* Only were made available for a short time during the initial kickstarter campaign. These are the ships attacking the Bengal Carrier in the Star Citizen trailer. They are raiding ships that you will have to capture in game. Vanduul warriors are known to self-destruct making this a difficult challenge.

The Grand Admiral package ($2,700) comes with the Aurora, Freelancer, Constellation, Hornet, and 300i.

For original backers, the prices will be discounted in some places, and more packages are available.



**Which ship is better: X or Y?**

That is impossible to answer. CR has stated that this game will be heavily skill-based so all ships are viable, but it is all speculation until the dogfighting alpha. A more expensive ship may be ""better"" overall (if players are equally skilled, the Aurora will probably lose to the Hornet), however each ship has a place. If a ship has more powerful engines, it has probably sacrificed on shields and/or weapons to account for the increased power draw of the engines. If a ship has better armor, it will be less maneuverable and be slower than other ships or it will sacrifice adding weapons in order to boost the engine size. This means that no ship is the ""best"" it just has a different role and works towards a different play style. Do you enjoy zipping around dodging enemy attacks while whittling away the opponent's shields and systems, or do you want to go in guns blazing with the ability to take a few hits and come away unscathed? Again, this is speculation.


**What is Lifetime Insurance?**

If your ship is destroyed, any parts that are insured will be replaced. LTI just means that you will never have to renew the insurance (all insurance purchased in game will have a time limit, and all packages now come with 6 months of insurance on ships). LTI was available on all ships purchased before July 6th 2013.


**Will I have Lifetime Insurance/How can I get LTI?**

If you ordered a ship before July 6th, 2013 it will have lifetime insurance. Otherwise, the packages come with 6 months of insurance for your ship. To get LTI you need to find someone who backed earlier that can gift you a ship with LTI (original and veteran backers will have LTI on all ships purchased before November 26th). There are many backers who are willing to purchase ships with LTI and gift them to you at-cost.


**I want to get a different ship than the one I purchased, can I?**

Yup! Go to My RSI &gt; My Hangar and reclaim any purchase you don't want anymore. This will give you store credit that you can apply to another purchase (this is not a refund, this credit is only available for purchases in the RSI store).


**Are all ships available for purchase on the site available in the game?**

Yes. Every ship currently available for purchase can be purchased in game. The only ship that you can't purchase that was available for a brief period of time is the Vanduul fighter. The only way to get that in game is to capture one (and it will be very difficult to do so).


**When can I play? I want this now!**

[Here's a list](http://starcitizen.wikia.com/wiki/Anticipated_release_schedule) of planned modules and their tentative release dates. Keep in mind, this is subject to change.

As posted [over here on /r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1icf8w/hi_again_rbuildapc_im_touring_intel_nvidia_msi/), I've got a team of two photographers/cameramen out in California this week and will be touring several hardware facilities and the Cloud Imperium Games Santa Monica office. I believe we'll be meeting with Chris Roberts again; if you recall, I posted a similar thread back before PAX East and conducted a video interview where he answered many community questions.

So, that stated, anyone have questions they'd like to pass along to the team? I believe we'll be trying to work some on-camera coverage in once again, but will definitely be writing a full-feature article.

Let me know! I'm talking to them at roughly 1PST today.

1368483643.0,61,self.starcitizen,1e9vlp,"Controls Demystified(?) v1.1 (Part II, Controls)",65,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1e9vlp/controls_demystified_v11_part_ii_controls/,"**Controls:** 


When it comes to peripheral controls even in the gaming community there seems to be a lot of partial understandings of what is going on, leading to a lot of confusion on the subject since many people are usually at least partly correct in their actual assertions, however usually not for the right reasons and in almost every case are only accounting for a small part of a larger issue that is more complex than many are going to want to deal with. If your happy with your mouse, keep using it. If your happy with your joystick, keep using it.  Is a mouse more accurate then a joystick? Is a joystick superior to a mouse? Well...   yes to both.  Aaaaand no to both. The real answer? It depends. It depends on what type of movement/inputs the application was engineered around, and the nuts and bolts of how an input device tries to comply.  While people can use whatever controls they like and can call it whatever they want, from an objective standpoint different types of control schemes are not arbitrarily interchangeable and do not yield equal results.  It's important to understand the nuances of these issues, particularly if a user is may choose to try to influence the path a game designer takes on how controls should or shouldn't be implemented. 

What types of inputs are there? Up until recently, I have referred to the input types in what actually amount to layman's terms, identifying them as either being **Relative**, or **Absolute**.  While correct on some levels and possessing enough kernels of truth to make most people understand what I'm talking about and generally accept my previous explanations, in reality its a case of over-simplification coupled with incorrect nomenclature stemming from my own ignorance. In the process of trying to get to the bottom of the subject I've found myself having to sort through conflicting information when trying to satisfactorily answer good questions posed to me in previous threads/attempts at this.  I'm just a guy that wanted his joystick not to suck when he stomped around in his internet robot and before even playing MechWarriorOnline I read up enough on the forums to know I would have to make one to make this work right since it was one of those 'mouse games', although at that point woefully lacked the proper explanations as to mechanics of what made it so, despite having dabbled with flight sims and hacking/fabricating control projects for years.    

For other projects, I just I never needed to know this before, and I wasn't trying to learn this much on the subject but through being (rightfully) challenged on my assertions while trying to generate awareness that joystick != suck after [making a joystick just for mech piloting](http://imgur.com/a/ixi64) (descriptions in album), and  it forced me to look deeper into the problems and solutions in order to back up my claims. It was relieving to finally get science behind me, cause it's true: it's not the joystick but rather the *type of joystick* vs the *type of inputs* the application is designed around. This is not specific to MWO or Star Citizen, or any game in particular, although it was MWO that got me out of my comfort zone far enough to write this and provides a good example for comparing controls.  All games or applications requiring human controls, particularly pointing devices, are designed around specific input types and deviating from the standard prescription rarely proves effective or efficient. 

If one defines controls as simply being '*relative*' or '*absolute*' as I have been doing up until recently, one then has to then further define which part of the process is being described, since it can make a 180deg difference to the truth of a given statement! Example:  A typical joystick by definition is absolute control device. It takes it's absolute positional information from it's sensors, which is then turned into relative input commands, with the pointer/cursor/reticule capable of infinite travel in the axes.  So depending on what part your taking about, it too is both an absolute or a relative device, so neither of these terms cut to the actual heart of the matter despite being able to accurately describe what is happening during different parts of the process. 


Then what are we *supposed* to call this stuff?  

This falls under the engineering field of what are called Human Factors. There are numerous types of inputs that are recognized in this field which further subdivide into more specific types, of which all control schemes fall into but for the subject of gaming peripherals we really only need to consider a few of the lower order controls. This is an attempt to clarify some facts in the ongoing battle between mice vs joysticks in regards to gaming.  Basically, the lower of an order a control is, the easier it is for a human to utilize it for precision tasks, and the orders are loosely based on how many actions are required to achieve the desired effect when used in their native application (things get wonky when you swap as outlined below) or how or how complex it is in general. It's important to differentiate between these inputs, because they are not particularly interchangeable design criteria and substituting one for the other predictably yields less than optimal results. Identifying the control scheme that any given game or system is engineered around is step one for coming up with viable control schemes beyond the standard options.    
 
**Control Types:** -attributes (common examples; notes)   
 
 
* **zero-order control** - manipulates target position. (mouse, touchpad; single input action required) 
* **first-order control** - manipulates target velocity. (most joysticks, vehicle throttle; one or two actions required) 
* **second-order control** - manipulates target acceleration/rate of velocity change. (car steering wheel) 
* **third-order control** - notable lag between control input and perceived action (steering a tanker)   

Joysticks further subdivide based on their mechanical and electromechanical properties: 

* **Isotonic**: cursor moves as a result of movement of the joystick handle. (my mech joystick. other?) 

* **Isometric**: cursor moves as a result of the force applied to the joystick handle, which does not move or moves very little (force sensing joysticks like Saitek X65F or Warthog with FSSB R3 mod, X-Box controller) 
 
* **Spring-loaded:** resistance is proportional to force applied. Displacement produces proportional inputs, but hands off returns to a neutral position. Offers proprioceptive and kinesthetic feedback. (standard joystick) 

In all my previous rants on the subject, what I've been referring to as absolute input device is called zero-order controller, and what I've been referring to as relative input device is called first-order or second-order cnotroller depending on the particular implementation.  I have been using the wrong terminology, however the net result of what I have been hammering at remains correct and there is a large body of scientific studies that demonstrably prove applications designed around zero-order inputs can not be as effectively operated with a first or second-order controller, and likewise first order applications are not more accurately or easily manipulated with a zero order controller and it is my hopes to make people understand why.     

MWO is engineered around zero-order inputs, as are most if not all other shooter games, and even many other types and titles.  As such, a mouse really is the easiest input device to use, since it offers very high precision, ease of use, and is the most common form of this type of controller so everyone is already set up to utilize this input type. 

[What if I told you...](http://i.imgur.com/BfkfHVH.png)      Well, there are, and a normal off the shelf joystick is not one of them.  The ubiquitous joystick is a *spring-loaded first-order control* input device (second-order in some cases, sometimes isometric), and is engineered around very different principals than a zero-order device.  Below I will outline the differences, and why they matter when trying to substitute a first-order controller like a *normal joystick for an application designed around zero-order mechanics like a mouse.  


**Using A First Order Controller For Zero-Order Applications:** (aka using a *joystick in a shooter)   
 
**-attributes** (effects) 

* **First-Order Controller; Standard Joystick:**    
 
* **-moves in pitch/roll** (unnatural range of motion, not reflexively intuitive) 
* **-Spring Loaded, most likely with detents** (fights inputs, negative interactions across the axes center's) 
* **-requires deadzones** (distracting, imprecise, disconnected feeling between inputs and in-game reactions, wasted range of motion, lag)
* **-fixed displacement generates directional velocity** ( ie relative inputs, movements wind up either too slow, or too uncontrollable; difficult not to overshoot past target, requires 2 precision actions to complete one positional change) 

**Zero-Order Controller; Mouse:** 

* **-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane** (natural range of movement of the cursor/reticule) 
* **-no spring centering or detents** (nothing fighting inputs, unrestricted movement) 
* **-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across centers no different than any other point in x/y, no lag) 
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position** (obvious and easy to control, very precise, requires a single action to complete a positional change) 

**Zero-Order Controller; My Mech Joystick:** 

* **-moves in zenith/azimuth** (pitch/twist -natural range of movement of the mech) 
* **-Isotonic, with tensioned/greased rubs** (nothing fighting inputs,  smooth damped movement, always maintains physical orientation related to on-screen state) 
* **-no deadzones** (always in control, precision across center no different than any other point in x/y, no lag) 
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position** (obvious and easy to control, very precise, requires a single action to complete a positional change)   
 
 For anyone that doesn't understand the significance of *zero-order* vs *first-order controls*, here is an analogy:  

Picture a 12"" square sheet of glass and a marble sitting on it. Using a first-order controller is like trying to move the marble by picking up the sheet of glass with the marble balanced on it and tilting it front/back and side/side to move the marble, then quickly leveling it again when it's where you want it to be in x/y coordinates.  The more you tilt it, the faster the marble moves and the harder it is to make it stop exactly where you want. Your actions generate directional velocity reactions, proportional to the amount of deflection, which must be quickly brought back level to discontinue the input reaction. Controllers made for this task are specifically engineered to facilitate these inputs with ease. Springs hold it level, obvious centers, deadzones etc, and every convenience feature built into it for this mode becomes a hindrance the second you press it into service as a zero-order.  

Using a zero-order controller on the other hand, would be like placing the same piece glass level on a desk in front of you and using your hand to reach out and directly move the marble wherever you want on the plane, and for this reason are also called direct inputs. There is only one action required, and it's very easy to perform this single action very quickly with very high precision. Just like above though, the mechanical features engineered into these devices produces quite a very specialized form factor to make this easy. Just like above, all the things that make it easy to use for it's native applications work against you the moment you attempt to use a mouse as a first order controller as I will show.    
  
Working it from the other direction to further demonstrate the importance of using the right control type for a given application, lets examine what happens when you use a zero-order controller like a mouse for a first-order controller application such as the input dynamics for Newtonian flight physics.     

**Using A Zero-Order Controller For First-Order Applications:** (aka flying with a mouse)  

 **-attributes** (effects) 

* **First-Order Controller; Standard Joystick:**    
 
* **-moves in pitch/roll** (natural range of movement of the aircraft/spacecraft, reflexively intuitive)
* **-Spring Loaded, most likely with detents** (proportional feedback to mechanically gauge inputs, easy to find and hold neutral position) 
* **-requires deadzones** (allows a safe area free of inputs, easy to fly straight, no spamming the axes)
* **-fixed displacement generates directional velocity** ( ie relative inputs, perfectly suited for the dynamics of flight, realistic input&gt;reaction, intuitive control, takes single precision action to perform) 

**Zero-Order Controller; Mouse:** 

* **-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane**  (unnatural range of movement, not reflexively intuitive)   
* **-no spring centering or detents** (no feedback to mechanically gauge inputs, difficult to find center/neutral position)   
* **-no deadzones** (no safe zone to keep from spamming the axes, very difficult to fly straight)   
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position** (awkward and difficult to control, requires two precision actions to complete a single maneuver)    

**Zero-Order Controller; My Mech Joystick:** 

* **-moves in zenith/azimuth** (unnatural range of movement, not reflexively intuitive)    
* **-Isotonic, with tensioned/greased rubs** (no feedback to mechanically gauge inputs, difficult to find center/neutral position)    
* **-no deadzones** (no safe zone to keep from spamming the axes, very difficult to fly straight)    
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position**  (awkward and difficult to control,  requires two precision actions to complete a single maneuver)   

**tl;dr:** controls are complicated, but very important to understand

I know that many people are interested to play as the Xi'an or Vanduul, but I fear that this will only turn them into re-skinned humans. When you encounter an alien in the universe, they should really come across as ""alien."" They should behave, communicate and otherwise interact with you in alien ways. 

If your everyday player is able to play as the Xi'an, their behavior will become human by extension as it's obviously being controlled by one. And, as is seen commonly in MMOs, one who will be running around like a chicken with its head cut off, definitely breaking immersion. Now, one could feasibly role-play these races, but there is only so much roleplaying to be done before inhibiting the fun you're supposed to be having. Imagine trying to role-play aliens like the [Hanar](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Hanar) or [Elcor](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Elcor) from Mass Effect. There would be a lot of time spent standing around and a lot of time spent formulating ridiculous sentences.

Of course, there is the question of mechanical benefits. Will the Vanduul have faster reaction times? How would that affect a skill-based system like Star Citizen's? If there are no mechanical benefits, then playing as an alien species would effectively be merely a skin change, leaving us with only Star Trek-esque aliens whose only differences from humans are antennae or a few bumps on the forehead. If there are mechanical benefits, you'd then have to distinguish humans with their own or you'd be at a disadvantage playing as one.

It's been stated that humans will be the only playable race upon release, but that other races should become playable eventually. Would you feel too restricted if they never did?

1372973539.0,55,self.starcitizen,1hnng9,"Multiple crew, its awesome, but is it practical?",62,7,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1hnng9/multiple_crew_its_awesome_but_is_it_practical/,"I thought occurred to me while looking over the connie. The idea of having 4 friends crewing this manning both turrets and having the Snub fighter ready to launch is awesome. But then I started wondering if it was really practical and since them I have come up with a few concerns that I would love to get your opinions on.

-------

&gt;1) Combat Practicality/Opportunity Cost

 Would a 4 man crewed connie really be better then a 1 man connie with 3 auroras flying with him? What about if they were flying hornets, avengers, or any mix of 1 man ships? Why would one of you guys want to sit aboard the connie and man the snub fighter instead of just accompany you in his own 1 man ship? Your ship would probably be all around better in terms of combat and upgrades and it would give you far more flexibility. 

&gt;2) Crew member Flexibility

Lets say you're on your friends connie and you guys are going to do a transport mission that he has picked up, but on the local chat you hear about some guys who are about to go on a pirate hunting run in the lawless sector and are asking for volunteers! You want to go but your friend does not want to give up his mission then you are SOL. If you were flying next to him in your avenger then you could go and hunt pirates and catch up with him afterward. Or even simpler if you want to log off but the rest of your group doesn't. If you are in you own ship you could just fly back to a port and be done. What happens if you are a crew on someone else's ship. Do they have to go out of there way to drop you off? Do you stay on their ship while logged off? What if they die after you leave, does that take away one of your lives? 

&gt;3) Player Engagement

After the novelty of it wears off, would someone, even a guild-mate or friend, really want they want to join me as crew instead of flying their own ships with me. Why would someone choose to man my turret rather then fly formation with me in their own ship. Lets face it, if you come aboard a connie, freelancer, starfarer, ect, in order to man the turret and combat does not happen then congratulation you just spent X amount of hours sitting there and twiddling your thumbs while watching the pilot fly and have fun.

------------
Now there are a few mitigating factors that I have thought but many of them have good counter arguments as well.

A) ""Fuel cost: 4 people flying one ship is probably cheaper then 4 people flying 4 ships."" Yes, but if the costs to fly your ships are that high then the game will have a whole other set of much more important problems then this.

B) Novelty: ""While it may wear off after a while having 4 friends pilot one ship is a game experience that we don't get often and I think that it will be very enjoyable the first few times a couple of good friends get together."" This is a more valid counter point then the saving fuel, still I would hate to get to a point 3 months after launch where we see a bunch of Freelancers, catapillers, connies, ect that are just crewed by one person with NPCs or automated system upgrades because no other players want to crew with them.

C: ""Its a great option for new players or players without ships, credits, or insurance!""

D) ""Because its fun you twit stop nitpicking!""...............I haven't found a count argument to this point yet.

                Well this spiraled into a wall of text

**Note:** I am not trying to preach doom here. I really like the idea of this game and I love ships like the Connie and will probably be pledging for it either tonight or tomorrow and flying around with my friends in a space ship is one of the principle reasons for that but some of the above concerns have put a small dent into my enthusiasm.

I would love to hear your opinions on the matter. 
What do you think? What did I miss? Where might I be right? Where am I dead wrong?

Rival shipping companies could conduct corporate espionage to see what routes their competitors take. Traps could be set.

1372383142.0,51,self.starcitizen,1h7wu3,IMPORTANT REMINDER: Decide on your login and handle before the new site goes live!,58,7,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1h7wu3/important_reminder_decide_on_your_login_and/,"Once the new site is live, the very first thing you have to do is migrate your old account to the new site.  As part of that process you have to pick a unique login name and a unique handle that *cannot be changed later.*  Decide now to avoid frustration!

[Here is a mirror of the naming update](http://forums.starcitizenbase.com/topic/1758-update-on-naming-system/) that explains the system.

Your **login username** is *unique* and *secret*, and *cannot be changed*.  No one should ever know your login name but you, unless you want to get your account hijacked.  No spaces or special characters are allowed - only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.  Special characters were forbidden to keep people from using their email addresses as their login names, which is very insecure.

Your **handle** is *unique* and *public* and *cannot be changed*, so choose carefully if it matters to you.  It identifies you as a player, both in the forums and in-game across all the characters you will ever play.  It will be visible beneath your community moniker on forum posts, as well as visible in-game when you are scanned.  Be prepared with a second choice of handle if the first one is not available anymore.  ~~Your login name on the old site is reserved for you to use as your new handle if you want it, but you do not have to.~~ &lt;--(I'm not sure this is true anymore.  I *think* it is.)  (Do any new site beta testers know whether there are restrictions on using special characters and spaces in the handle?)

Your **community moniker** is your displayed name in forum posts, and your **character name / callsign** is your displayed name in-game.  These are *not unique*.  

The community moniker can be changed at any time.  I'm not sure about character names / callsigns in-game, but I think you probably can change them at will.  I have a suspicion that they might even split ""character name"" and ""callsign"" later, so your character has a non-unique but unchangeable name for the duration of his/her life, and a callsign you can change at will.  That's just speculation on my part though.

The [example Chris gave](http://forums.starcitizenbase.com/uploads/monthly_04_2013/post-1-0-98155500-1366120572.jpg) is using croberts68 as his handle, ""The Dread Pirate Roberts"" as an in-game character name / callsign, and ""Christopher Roberts"" as his community moniker.  

Please inform me if you are aware of additional restrictions or tips on choosing your login and handle, and I will edit this post.

however after browsing the official forums there appears to be many players who equate attacking someone as griefing. it doesnt matter that im a pirate. As a pirate if i find any oppurtunity for an easy kill im going to take it. . if its the fourth time ive killed you that hour is it my fault for killing you or your fault for trying to mine more rare minerals in low security space? 

The game was designed with dogfighting in mind and while i will definitely have an alt thats an intergalactic explorer the reason i bought this game is because i like to shoot things. At the end of the day a player who wants to play PvE exclusively can play offline but if i want to PvP i need the persistent universe so it makes no sense to heavily restrict my ability to do so to accommodate the PvE player.

I didn't include a more detailed point of view because I thought some of you would agree with me and it might start a discussion.

Also, I'd like to add: I was a big fan of Wing Commander and Freelancer. I used to play EVE:Online, but ultimately became disenchanted because I literally spent most of my playtime staring at spreadsheets and really wanted it to be an action game. I'm really excited about Star Citizen.

I feel like the use of the word ""star"" is pretty over done in science fiction: Starman, Star Trek, Star Wars, Death Star, Star Babies... Those are just off the top of my head. It's good in the sense that it indicates it's sci-fi, but also give it kind of a cheap, uncreative feel.

""Citizen"" makes me feel like it's going to a be a really dull societal simulation where you go to work, and pay your taxes, and maybe someday work your way up into politics where you get to do more boring shit like deciding where the roads go or something.

I guess I think Star Citizen is a bad name because it makes the game sound unremarkable and boring. Imagine if you'd never heard of the game and someone just told you the name and didn't have time to get into it except that it was good.

Star Trek implies travel and adventure in space. Star Wars implies conflict in space. Star Citizen implies that you won't be deported, but are otherwise just a member of a community.

EVE: Online is a better name, in my opinion, because it implies a rebirth of humanity or civilization(Adam and Eve), which ties into the fluff and generally when you explain the setup for the EVE universe, it makes it sound fairly intriguing. 

I would suggest a better name, but I really haven't heard much about the storyline. I've only seen tech demos and interviews. Apparently, the name must not be as bad as I thought because no one has agreed with me yet, but I still hope Star Citizen is just the working title and they come up with something better before the game is released.

If any of you are willing, tell a friend that you're excited about a game called Star Citizen and then ask them what they imagine the game would be like... For science!

Message from Ben Lesnick:

What a long, strange trip it has been! I'm very pleased to announce that the Roberts Space Industries website is coming back online as originally intended. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our web team, you can now pledge as originally intended as well as access your account information and view the real time pledge counter.

More changes are coming, too: we're in the process of setting up the more robust forum you deserve; a search feature, PMs and everything else you have asked for will be available soon. Additional payment options and the ability to add to your existing pledges (against all odds, you demanded it!) will be online in the coming days.

It's not all going to be apologetic letters and 'back to normal' updates, either. Now that we're not ""all hands on deck"" dealing with the site outage you will see the Comm-Link and other familiar sections return to life. Expect more polls, in-depth ship descriptions, news from the world of Star Citizen and more Q&amp;A with Chris Roberts! Ask him about physics! (On second thought, maybe you shouldn't, we'll be here all day…) We're also putting the finishing touches on the maps and the Galactapedia.

And one last thing: your Golden Tickets WILL RETURN. We had to put them away while we fixed the site, but you'll find them waiting for you in your accounts in the coming days.

I'd like to thank you all, personally: you space pilots have proven yourselves to be the most thoughtful, helpful and incredibly patient group I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I feel terrible that the web issues have impacted such a great group. We're going to do everything we can to justify your treatment of our endeavor. It's going to be cool!

Not as story driven and offering deeper remarks about human nature and society, Foundation is still a thrilling and thought-provoking read.

[The Return of Santiago](http://www.amazon.com/The-Return-Santiago-Science-Fiction/dp/0765341468) by Mike Resnik

Set in a fictional universe not too dis-similar to the Firefly universe (juxtaposing central authority with rebellious/neglected outer worlds), a simple thief discovers what it truly means to be an Outlaw.

[Honor Harrington: On Basilisk Station](http://www.amazon.com/Basilisk-Station-Honor-Harrington/dp/0743435710/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375053014&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=honor+harrington+on+basilisk+station) by David Weber

The story of a young and driven Star Kingdom of Manticore naval officer who's efficiency and personality puts her at odds with the ruling nobility and higher ranking officers.  Exiled to a backwater post and given an experimental armament designed to fail, her vindictive superior made one mistake: he made her mad.

These are a couple fictional Universes which share some qualities with the forthcoming Star Citizen play-verse.

I'll combine them as they come.

1. Will achievements be in, in some style? People like my wife and I like to do them together and creates immersion for us in our own little way. Even if they are not called ""achievements"" what are your plans in this regards?

2. Control of capital ships? Multi man or can be solo'd? ( this one has been talked about but I think it needs to still be further clarified as I'm the type of guy who wants the BIGGEST DAMN SHIP even if I have to have a guild of 100+ to fund it!)

3. Cash Shop - How will it work exactly, like GW2 or something else? And will the packages include some of these credits for the cash shop?

4. What happens if I loose connection / quit in the middle of a battle? What if friends are on my capital ship when I do?

5. What are some of the things we will be doing to progress our characters in the game?
What else besides trading/shooting things and exploring the universe?

6. It was mentioned ships are made up of 100s of parts that can be damaged are these parts we can choose?

7. More details on how much we can customize our ships and how much of this will be from the Cash Shop?

8. Team dynamics, will there be any team advantages other than having another fighter in play. The thought that comes to mind for me is a bomber with long range missiles being able to fire on targets spotted from a smaller fighter.

9. Will you be able to collide with these parts, and will these parts persist as debris, if so for approximately how long?

10. With regard to pilotable ships, will the rule be ""If you see it, you can fly it"", or are there going to be certain ships (or class of) that will be off-limits for players?

11. Will Cloud Imperium have any direct influence on the in-game world as peace-keepers or financial corporations? Will you be visible at all in-game?

12. Will you be posting updates on the progress of things? I know you'll have plenty on your plates just making the game, but all of us will be chomping at the bit for details all the way up until release, so I like to hope you'll be posting at least semi-regularly about how things are going - concept art, screen shots, [other random tid-bits] etc.

13. Further clarification of the indestructibility of pledge ships

1373041172.0,42,self.starcitizen,1hp41r,"Ideas for Star Citizen multiplayer: non combat ways to make multicrew ships viable, meaningful and more useful than just bringing extra ships",49,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1hp41r/ideas_for_star_citizen_multiplayer_non_combat/,"So as far as I can see most people seem to be focussing on the combat pros and cons of having extra crew members and how to actually motivate players to play as crew. I think we should look further than just combat and give a reason to actually want to be on other peoples ships in a way which will both increase immersion and make gameplay sense. 

If we allow multiple people apart from just the captain to  store in the cargo hold this would allow the proper development of a space haulage system. 

Escrow delivery missions which could be organised through space bar interface and could include passengers as well as freight. 

I can imagine a Player generated mission database with some of the following characteristics:

* can do both looking for ship and looking for crew

* eg trader has a 30t cargo he wants shipped which he can't fit in his aurora. So he hires a constellation to haul him and his cargo to his destination. He can defend his cargo enroute if the constellation is attacked (and there's a spare gunners seat) or just stay in his bunk til he gets there. After that he can either buy a new ship at his destination or buy passage on another ship ( eg converted Retaliator). In this case it's obviously better to buy passage on the constellation as you eliminate the extra fuel cost, docking fees and risk of bringing the aurora along as well. 

* some kind of rules about when and how the cargo can be unloaded. Maybe set up in the contract? Eg a slider between 'captain has full discretion' (maybe some payout if it's dumped inappropriately -eg abandoned in space to make a getaway) all the way to 'full cargo lock' where it can only be unloaded at the agreed destination or with owner's say so (might be higher up front and overall cost to the owner?)

* looking for crew might be similar - where the captain can specify how long the contract lasts and the pickup and drop off points. 

* some communication line with the generator of the contract - can accept or refine, eg ""I'll take half the payment for being a crewman if you drop me off in X system rather than Y""

* you could also have a covert system for illegal cargo. Captains could mention they're happy to take 'sensitive cargo' as they have the necessary equipment (cargo scan blockers). This could be quite risky as a bounty hunter might read this and wait until they leave the station with the illegal cargo and then turn them over to the authorities. 

* lastly if you have such a system an emergent space taxi system would appear. Players may want to go to a different system (their new hornet is 200000 credits at X rather than 300000 where he is now but he wants to keep his aurora at his current base) and rather than having an immersion breaking Fast-Travel system you could have a player based system. Would thereby give rise to the fluff point about the Retaliator where they have been converted from large Capital ship killer bombers to long haul passenger crafts. If you have a cargo hold modification you may be able to have hibernation pods/ extra beds for someone to sleep in which you could then deliver as cargo at the target, so the passenger could set themselves up as transport cargo, log off and when they come back (and someone has accepted their contract) they will be at their destination. RSI has also suggested that you might have a simulator system to practice dogfighting in safety, you could incorporate this system into the hibernation pods (maybe as an upgraded form) to give passengers something to do whilst they're travelling if they are still online. 

This would hopefully both give a robust system for organising crew and give them a reason to be there. In addition it would give a sensible, believable and hopefully meaningful passenger transport system. In addition it would make a lot of sense for space haulers (I'm looking at you Starfarer owners), who like the trucking gameplay niche but might not have the financial backing to make financially viable runs on their own if they had to buy all their own stock.

-------------

Edit: [the new article](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/13128-The-Star-Citizen-Economy) up on RSI seems to suggest a robust trading mission system which I was hoping for, the main question I still have though is whether this is easily done by players. Further, whilst I really hope they can think of some mercantile reason for getting people to ride as passengers (my bet is on having to pick up new ships whilst leaving old ship at current hangar), we still haven't heard anything which really suggests this.

Awesome! I start up my PC, click the shortcut, launch the program, log in with some awesome menu music playing in the background as the server loads, and them I'm ready to go. In game, my character is just waking up from the bunk or cyrofreezer he's been sleeping in onboard my spaceship, still resting in the hanger where I docked last night before logging off. My last trade run wasn't as successful as I'd hoped and I'm running a little low on credits right now so I figure mining would be a good way to raise some quick cash. This is one of my main spaceports and I'm renting a warehouse here, so I walk over to the cargo terminal, call up my inventory and begin loading up my cargo hold. As I do, robotic loaders run back and forth in the hangar carrying the cargo I select and storing it in my ship. A few minutes later, I'm ready to go. After a quick check with flight control to make sure no one's currently fighting up in orbit (there shouldn't be, I chose a safe planet and paid a premium landing fee for a reason), flight control and my ship status report all green and then I'm off.

For today's mining endeavor, I've chosen a system with a good sized asteroid belt. It's unclaimed and uninhabited, plus it has only two worm holes space pretty far apart and it's off the main flight path so there shouldn't be many ships passing through. As an added bonus, it's relatively new (only discovered a couple of weeks ago) so it hasn't been well-charted yet and there should be plenty of metals to mine. With the course entered into my flight computer, I navigate to the nearest wormhole and I'm on my way.

A dozen jumps later, I arrive at my destination. Immediately, I drop a basic radar bouy. Unpowered and dirt cheap, it stays where I put it and keeps me updated with radar telemetry as long as my ship stays within it's transmission range (small for a basic unit, but I can always deploya . I'm well within range right now, so the first thing my bouy does is fire up it's active radar array and begin mapping nearby space. As the nav data said, it's full of asteriods. Most of the area is still in shadows but my radar bouy will continue to update and improve my map the longer it sits there. The second thing this does is tell me if they are any ships nearby without revealing what I am. I'm flying a medium freighter, perfect for a bit of mining and trading, and I have a medium radar array on board. If I turn my ship's radar array on though, suddently everyone knows I'm a medium ship or a larger ship with a medium radar equipped. Either way, I'm slower and less maneuverable than a small attack fighter. Small ships can't hold a medium radar, but everyone can (and does) bring a radar bouy because they're cheap enough that you can turn and run, leaving the bouyies behind if you need to.

Ok, so the basic radar bouy is deployed and the system appears clear. It's possible there's a ship still hiding in the asteroids, but if there is they don't have active radar or don't have it turned on (otherwise I'd detect it), so they probably can't see my ship. Next thing I do is ready and launch a couple of prospecting drones. Simple single-engine, fire-and-forget drones, these fly in a straight line until they run out of fuel and scan the asteroid field for material composition, transmitting the data back to my ship in realtime. I paid for an upgraded model that burns half it's fuel on the way out, spins around and burns the second half on the way back so I don't need to go pick them up afterwards. (It takes a lot of time and fuel, but these drones are more expensive than the basic radar bouy, so its best not to leave them sitting around.) While the probes are searching away, I'm looking over the data they send back. I pick out a few large, metallic asteroids that seem promising and flag them in the nav computer. Once the drones are back, I fire up my engines fly towards the first asteroid, leaving my bouy to watch the worm hole.

Arriving at the asteroid, I begin conducting a detailed analysis, and Jackpot! The asteroid has significant quantities of Platinum and other shiny metals that should fetch a good price on any developed world. I maneuver into a holding pattern on the far side, hidden from view from the wormhole, and deploy my mining robots. Once mining commences, I set up alarms, power down non-essential systems in my ship to save fuel and reduce my EM signature, and alt-tab out to Reddit or YouTube or watch a movie on Netflix while my robot minions do the hard work.

* ALERT * ALERT * ALERT *

Alarms ringing in my headset bring me back an hour later, and a quick glance at nav computer tells me a new ship has just come through the worm hole. It's a small ship my bouy tells me, the kind usually used by explorers. And pirates. He powers up his own radar, not a nav bouy I note. Has he seem me? Probably not yet. I took care hiding my ship but he'd have to be blind to miss my bouy. There's another benefit about the basic bouy: they're cheap enough that you find them everywhere, left behind if the owner forgot to pick them up and didn't want to spend the fuel going back. Hell, they're not even worth salvaging most of the time.

The other ship starts flying slowly, orbiting around the wormhole. Maybe he's here for a bit of mining too? Small ships don't have as much cargo space, but for a new pilot starting out it's not uncommon and they usually mount prospecting sensors right on their ship to save space for more metals. Just in case, I begin checking my allies. No one nearby. How about trusted mercenaries? Closest one is six jumps away and he'd want an arm and a leg even if he could make it in time. No go there either. What's the other ship doing? Still circling the wormhole. Just in case, I tell my robots to slowly start making their way back to my ship with a low power transmission (short range, hard to detect).

Then the message burst arrives: ""Pay up 250,000c or prepare to be boarded!"" The other ship has powered up its engines and is executing a high-g burn straight towards me. Shit. No more shuffling around the issue, he's hostile and he knows where I am. Power up my ship, ready engines, ready sheilds, ready weapons (what few I have, I am a mining ship after all), get those robots back on board ASAP! The nav computer tells me two of them are too far away and aren't going to make it back before the pirate ship reaches me. That's bad because they're expensive and I'll have to replace them, but damn if I'm going to let some pirate salvage them. I flip a few switches and throw a small nuclear proximity mine at the asteroid. Hard to disarm, devastating at close range and illegal in most systems, it'll make the pirate think twice before attempting a salve op so there's a change at least that I can come back and retrieve my robots later. Right now, I need to run.

I chose this system in part because it has two worm holes. I don't need the nav computer to tell me the pirate ship will catch me long before I reach the second worm hole, though. I could turn and fight, I've got a few neat tricks  hidden away, but the pirate ship is much more maneuverable than I am and if he's a skilled pilot, he'll probably win. So I'm going to to run for it. As soon as all but the last two drones are on board, I fire up my engines on beeline for the wormhole. Bullets and lasers zip into my sheild as we fly head on towards each other, the pirate opening up with everything he's got and me returning fire with a pitiful gatling turret while power from my main lasers is diverted to engines and sheilds. I survive thet first pass, sheilds holding steady at 80% while he turns around, bring his guns to bear on my rear and readying for a race to the worm hole.

Does he catch me? Do I pull a trump card out of my hold and blast his pirate ass to dust or do I throw everything I've got in into jump engines in hopes of pulling a small advantage when we emerge on the other side? Does he have a friend waiting there?

1368483564.0,44,self.starcitizen,1e9vhr,"Controls Demystified(?) v1.1 (Part I, Intro)",46,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1e9vhr/controls_demystified_v11_part_i_intro/,"**Intro**   

Greetings Citizens, this is my attempt at organizing my musings on controls into a single entry, doing my best not to sound like a douche. This is my first draft of this version, dubbed v1.1. No doubt there will be refinements as I move forward, or maybe even some overhauling or just streamlining. I have a lot of respect for the members of the Star Citizen and MWO communities alike, and highly value feedback any of you have (witty tl;dr's?). If I have any of this wrong or anyone takes issue with anything presented here, all I ask is to let us discuss them in a manner that we both come away better for it. There are no stupid questions, and I welcome scrutiny too since without external pressures to do this better, I'd still be stuck on v1.0 below. This post is in preparation for my posting on the subject on the SC and MWO official forums, and I want it to be right so I'm running it up the flagpole here. My intention is not to tell anyone what type of controls are better or worse (hint-they're all better and they're all worse! ;) but rather to hopefully clear up some of the persistent myths that have clouded the issues beyond useful discussion in many cases, since along with the awesomeness of getting to help a game actually develop comes equally awesome responsibility. Its important we know what we're talking about in case we decide to lend a potentially influential opinion on the subject...        

**Preamble:**  

Many of you have already seen v1.0 of [my rantings on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1c52od/mwo_joystick_controls_worth_it/), others maybe not. I've been talking about this a lot as of late, and with my involvement in MechWarriorOnline and preparing [my new mechpit for SC](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1dbavu/my_new_battlemech_cockpit_will_soon_double_as_a/), it's no wonder.  A little background. I'm an engineering student, and a sailplane pilot IRL. I've been dorking out on sim projects since 2004, and have had the pleasure of comparing actual sailplane flying to sim flying to dial in my own projects as well as to help nail down realistic motion control parameters for Ian at builtforfun (http://bffsimulation.com/index.php), who is an instrumental character in the world of homegrown motion control simulator platforms and is the source of most motion platforms extraction parameter software and realistic dynamic motion cuing if you look close enough into most functional motion control cockpits.  I have worked on other motion control projects with RolandVanRoy (simprojects.nl), and [designed an analog servo circuit](http://i.imgur.com/gXlN0wu.jpg) that can be used in both control loading (force feedback) as well as motion control, which has been tested to good effect, and although not incorporated into any of my own projects as of right now there is a 747 motion platform with FF controls somewhere in Spain based around it and I think Roland has since replaced his LED/LRD (light emitting diode/light dependent resistor) circuits that served the same purpose with them as well.   

Through experiments conducted while being able to jump back and forth from my Cockpit to my cockpit, I was able to put my finger on what I feel are the key elements necessary for immersion. The list of non-negotiable  items was much shorter than I expected, however I found that removing or half assing any of these baseline pillars is a dealbreaker. It's actually not that difficult in *most* cases to fulfill these 4 minimum requirements (difficult for a sailplane!), but it may require knowing more about the controls than is common in some cases. I'm not saying there isn't a lot more to it, just that these are the bare minimum items that need to be taken care of first or else the rest of a simulator project runs the risk of becoming irrelevant. From my experiences, most of what immersion there is to be had comes from these 4 things, and the better they are done the more believable the effect. Going beyond these in most cases is an exercise in diminishing returns from what I've observed, and likewise failure to sufficiently meet the requirements of these initial 4 items can break the magic of even the most visually detailed cockpit.  These 4 items are the key to hitting what I call the 'saturation point', the subtle point at which one can effortlessly suspend their disbelief and they become fully engrossed in the virtual task at hand. To me, this is the whole point of a simulator.         

**The Pillars of Immersion**  

* 1. Correct seating position/ergonomics       
* 2. Believable/functional controls      
* 3. Fill thy eye with screen       
* 4. High fidelity audio  

Sounds simple enough, right? Well, maybe not. Number 1, 3 and 4 can potentially be easy, but number 2 is where it normally falls apart since controls can be a complicated subject when you examine them more closely, and also  is by far the most important item on this short list.  I didn't specify head tracking there, since it's kinda a cross between lines 2 and 3, but if there is *any* view panning function in-game, this really should be done with head tracking and *almost* warrants a pillar of it's own.  The interface you use to experience a simulator is not there to augment the experience, it IS the experience!  Failing on any of these, especially controls, is the boner-killer of immersion. For me, killing immersion = killing fun. I'm pretty sure no one reading this needs a screen/monitor lecture and more than likely could lecture me on the subject and its not so hard to come up with good seating; leaving only the topic of controls to expand on.

Aside from the few people I saw who posted their scout cards, it makes me feel like I'm the poorest man on the face of the earth right now.

I'm glad there are people out there who can afford it though, don't get me wrong - without YOU, the Star Citizen goal wouldn't have been shattered like it was.

As an aside too, this game isn't going to be a true MMO, so the level of dedication I've seen from people in buying ships has been humbling - it goes to show you that we desperately need another space sim, and no one was listening but these guys.

I know this won't be the most popular of topics, but I figured people should at least know.

Several of the people that have been helping newbies obtain LTI on the RSI site have been asked by Sandy to stop, as it's causing issues for them, and this is not how they wanted the system to work.

Food for thought.  If you still want to gift to strangers, I'm sure as hell not going to stop you, but everyone should at least know what RSI's thoughts on the matter are.

UPDATE: https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/13150-Package-Re-Sale-Policy

UPDATE 2 (from the above transmission): LTI may not be available anymore, but there are still plenty of reasons to back the current Star Citizen packages without the risk of the secondary market. Remember, insurance will be readily available for purchase with in-game credits… and the six-month (or more) free insurance bonds included in the current packages will likely cover your starter hull for far longer than it will take you to upgrade to another ship.

In a game like this where we're looking to be purchasing factories and stations putting money together with the right person could be tricky. 

Scams will definitely be kicking around.

So I was thinking a system where your clan can have a central account to which you can issue cards to members so they can use the funds there. You can set a credit limit (daily/weekly spend) and for when they complete a mission how much of that gets put into the clan account. 

Having options to override this, send additional bonus sums, and set a weekly salary to players would be a great way to run a clan too. I'd love to be able to say to recruits ""Join XXXX clan, 2000 credits a month and our cardamine recovery program"".

Obviously there's still the trust factor with those having allowed access running off with credits but being able to set someone trustworthy as a fund manager/accountant would be useful.

So, thoughts? How would you do it?

If i buy a certain level,is that the only ship i have in the game?

What do subscriptions do if the game isn't out yet?

The official website is very lacking in information about the game and looks like it ripped off the Metro UI from Windows 8. Chris [started a poll](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/poll-have-you-pledged/) asking why only 1/3 of people are pledging, and the number one response is **lack of information.**

[http://starcitizen.wikia.com](http://starcitizen.wikia.com)

I don't know who started this one, but it's very empty. We need to help build it up. Transferring info from the FAQ is a good start. Eventually we could get Chris Roberts to give us more info directly, or stalk him around the interwebs while gathering the gooey bits of details he leaves behind. I see the game plan as follows:

* Transfer as much existing information to the Wiki as possible. Get it looking awesome.
* When advertizing the game, drive people to the wiki *first*, where they can be sold on the game, then have the wiki link to the website and pledges.
* Stalk Chris across the interwebs for more information, and get him to reveal more info for the wiki.
* Get Chris to link the wiki on the official site. Make it a tile in the Metro layout.
* Hopefully get Chris to host an official wiki under the top domain of his site, and we can move all the info there.

I pledged $250 dollars and 15 years of my life playing space games, so I'll be damned if this project does not get funded! Let's start a goddamn Star Citizen wiki!

What do you guys think?

Edit: So I spent a lot of time going through both FAQs and other news sources, and transferred a lot of information to the wiki. I've got a thread going on the official forums, and a lot of people are willing to volunteer. I'm in talks with the admin of the wiki page, and I sent Chris Roberts a PM in facebook about the wiki.

The wiki is almost up to date and getting beefy. It still needs some polish and the storyline section needs to be worked on.

They are all modern designs in the context of the game universe, and they are also the product of a few hundred years of R&amp;D. This makes sense in the game design sense, limited time and money etc., however in the star citizen universe there would be quite a few older models drifting around. These ships wouldn't be cutting edge, they wouldn't have as many modern features, and they probably wouldn't conform to a lot of safety standards.

That last one got me thinking, the current line up of ships would presumably be limited by manufacturing laws and other regulations. It may be that older vessels wouldn't have restrictions on how they can be modified, or may work in ways that make them far more dangerous to be around. For example more primitive engines may cause a huge amount of electromagnetic interference that can be used to knock out sensors, or they may have stealth systems that were promptly outlawed when they were first fitted to ships. It's much the same way that weapons like flamethrowers were invented, then banned by international law. They aren't really safe for anyone involved, but they can be devastating in the right hands. I think that could be a good mechanic.

Of course all this would mean that these ships were outlawed in patrolled space, but it would also make them highly valuable to pirates who could use them to stage devastating attacks on merchant vessels.

1372193234.0,29,self.starcitizen,1h28xl,"Oculus Rift usage, from a SC perspective",39,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1h28xl/oculus_rift_usage_from_a_sc_perspective/,"I had bits posted in other threads, but by request I'm splitting it into a separate post.

So I've had an Oculus dev kit for a fair while now and have been building stuff for it, including some flying-sim-like content to mess around.  Here are some notes relevant to SC from personal experience.  

# **Tech specs**:  
- Assuming they bump the consumer kit specs to 1080p, GPU hardware requirements will be roughly the same as using 1-2 monitors. The CPU cost for the system to process the sensor input is also nonzero - so for most people a Rift will inherently be roughly the same or slower than using a monitor or two, *no matter how much optimization they do*.  If you're also leaving your regular monitor(s) plugged in, you're pushing a lot more pixels - so don't count on being able to plug it in to an existing setup and get better perf.  It will be **slower** for most people.  

# **Input peripheral usage impact**:  

**Keyboard**:  
- When you're wearing a Rift, you can't see the keyboard. Even if you're super familiar with your keyboard and don't look at it while typing/gaming, you would be surprised by how much your peripheral vision still matters. Once you can't see it at all, even highly experienced users get tripped up because they actually heavily use peripheral vision to help them keep their hands in the right place, especially if you're moving 1+ hands between mouse/joystick and the keyboard.  
- It then takes noticeable time to constantly reorient your hands (e.g. finding the bumps on F and J keys on the home row of a standard keyboard) or even lifting the headset up for a second, which kills immersion and makes you way less competitive. I have little doubt people will accidentally launch super expensive missiles, lose dogfights because they hit the wrong button, etc.  

**Mouse/stick/HOTAS/controller/G13/Nostromo**:  
-  Using these actually seems quite natural since they have more defined shapes and fewer buttons. Once you have the layout memorized and built into muscle memory the Rift really fits naturally with these types of input mechanisms. I think there's a reason CR uses a controller in demos. You really need to be familiar with your button layout though.  

**Other peripherals**:  
- Peripherals like a Hydra also really shine with the Rift. I can see this being a natural direction to go for some games. However it's still bad for space sim games in particular because you need the up and down axes as well, so your arms can get rather tired. This is in contrast to an FPS where you can rest your arms on a desk because you never need to go ""up"" or ""down"".  

**Peripheral usage summary**:  
- For Star Citizen I think it may also come down to how many buttons you need to use. If you can get away with just a HOTAS/mouse/gamepad (note CR was using an xbox controller) I think the OR be great. If you need 100 buttons and macros, I don't think it'll work as well.  We'll have to wait and see how scriptable actions are, what the controls actually look like when you disable fly-by-wire, etc.  

# **Combat effectiveness**:  
- My suspicion is the OR will be great for immersion just flying around, especially if not using a keyboard, but in a fight someone piloting using a monitor and an input method with a lot of buttons to disable fly-by-wire and have easier access to other complex controls will have an edge (assuming equal pilot skill). The OR would probably be equal or better for a turret gunner in a fight though.  

# **Immersion**:  
- One other major issue I'll note is turning speed. Unless you're used to it from RL experience, for the first while having a disconnect between your aiming reticle and your field of view can be *really* annoying, especially if you're used to playing FPSs. I'm guessing this game will have to separate the two, because ships can't turn and aim as fast as you can move your head. There may be articulated mounts/turrets which will allow perfect tracking, but it just wouldn't be fair/immersive/possible to do the same thing for steering/maneuvering or shooting fixed-mount weapons.  

# **Motion sickness**:  
- The motion sickness disconnect is a big issue for a lot of people, just like all the reviews have pointed out. It's not just seeing movement without your inner ear agreeing - using mouse or keyboard to move your frame of reference while using your head to change the POV also takes a bit of getting used to. I think this will actually be somewhat better with a joystick for that reason.  People that aren't prone to carsickness have still said they have problems with the Rift - especially if you're moving quickly while turning your head (think looking around while flying an M50 or 350) - so it's not necessarily safe to assume you'll be fine based on past experience.  
  
# **Comfort**:  
- even if they slim down the consumer model you'll still notice the weight - could get annoying for some people after a couple hours  
- they don't work super well with large glasses - I imagine this will continue to be true with a consumer version  
- they don't work well with big headsets - also unlikely to change  
- they're more uncomfortable in hot climates - they steam up, and if it's hot enough to sweat it gets really uncomfortable fast  
- you can't see anything around you - it's a hassle to try to grab a drink, or find a keyboard button, or look at TeamSpeak to see who's talking, or look at the time, or stay aware of your surroundings in general  
- The cord is pretty big and stiff and gets in the way - they're investigating wireless instead but that means the extra weight of a battery (so more uncomfortable), and needing to recharge  
- personally with the dev kit I can't go more than an hour or two without needing a break due to a combination of all the above    

#**tl;dr**:
Rift is awesome in some cases for Star Citizen scenarios, probably worse in others.  If possible definitely try a demo of a similar genre for a least a few minutes before you buy.

In the current Star Citizen ship schematics, cargo capacity per ship is measured in tonnes (mass). This makes very little sense. For the sake of practicality, freedom, and dare I say realism, it shouldn't be too difficult to change the primary measurement of cargo to volume (perhaps cubic meters) and then assign different density values to different items. Why? Well, aside from making more sense when talking about cargo holds, it seems to open up slightly more possibilities of what can be put in a ship and how specific kinds of cargo loads affect that ship.

Hell; spaceships aren't trucks. An M50 pilot can load up on a solid block of osmium if they want to, but their ship would handle like a cow. Likewise, maybe food rations might be a more attractive commodity item for a trader to fill their hold with than something more profitable like metal alloys if travel time is a major factor for them (or for funsies someone might want to splurge on cargo hold extenders for their Constellation and fill it to the brim with depleted uranium, just because). It's more balanced, makes more sense, and provides more freedom to measure cargo holds in volume, leaving the cargo itself to be measured in mass.

Edit: Actual measurements for the force put out by the different thruster types in Newtons would be great, too, but I suppose that's further down the road.",,False,self,t5_2v94d,1357261117.0,,,True,t3_15x6ct,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/15x6ct/a_minor_request_regarding_measurement_of_cargo/,

Every so often I find myself on the finished kickstarter page or the star citizen website but I've never taken the hours to read up on everything.

What i'd like to know is simply this: How is this game *not* pay-to-win?

The impression I've gotten from the small amount of reading i've done is that:

1. in-game credits are purchasable with real-life currency. 
2. in-game credits are used to buy gameplay affecting things.

My understanding is that: A non-paying player who plays X hours a week would be at a disadvantage competing with another player who also plays X hours a week but also pays $Y? Isn't this unfair?

As I said, the game looks really nice, i'm hoping there is something here that i'm missing!

----

**EDIT:** OK, just in case anyone else comes across this thread in future with a question similar to mine: From what I've gathered from the comments the three main ways in which the game avoids being Pay to Win are:

1. The Ships are designed to follow the **""Perfect Imbalance"" design philosophy** *(also known as the Rock-Paper-Scissors approach)* in line with other successful games (e.g. Popular MOBA games like League of Legends). If anyone stumbles on this thread in future [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w) is a great video explaining the features and benefits of this type of system.
2. **Horizontal progression.** The upgrade system does not offer any straight-up power. There are always trade-offs.
3. **The lack of an ultimate goal.** No ultimate goal means being ""ahead"" of another player is a difficult thing to crystallize. Although I think this argument breaks down when you start talking about any specific scenarios.

These make a lot of sense, and If they can pull off the imperfect balance stuff in the way that people are describing then i'm very excited for the games release.

I've been following this game loosely for the past few months and have been on the fence with it and weather or not I'd invest money into it.

If I buy one, I get a ship and a few other goodies, credits and life time insurance, and then if I want to, I can buy other individual ships for more money and those ships as well have life time insurance like the original one from a package or is it a 1 time only ship?


This probably sounds like a garbled mess, I'm sorry but I'm just so confused. If anyone here wants to help and explain things to a very interested newcomer I'd be so very grateful :)

A response thread quickly formed around the ambiguity of Chris's answer, found here:  [CR's answer from today's WMH re: Newtonian physics](https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/39609/cr-s-answer-from-today-s-wmh-re-newtonian-physics/p1)  

Then, CR jumps in with clarification on this hot button issue ([direct link](https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/comment/618968/#Comment_618968)) and sets the record straight:     

&gt;Nothing short of PvE vs PvP gets everyone riled up like the flight model!  

&gt;Here's some succinct answers to help put / remove my many ""umms"" and ""ahhs"" from the Forum Feedback section of Wing Man's Hangar.  

&gt;1) The physics simulation is Newtonian  

&gt;2) There is no drag.  

&gt;3) The IFCS (Intelligent Flight Control system) generally handles taking the pilot's inputs (desired pitch, yaw, roll and speed) and translates them into actions for the thrusters and ship to take to adjust the ship's velocity vector in the direction the pilot wishes to go. This system will do it within human acceptable tolerances (it will not change your velocity vector in such a way as it could cause harm to the pilot)  

&gt;4) Slowing down is caused by the pilot telling his IFCS that he wants to be traveling at a lower speed. The IFCS then communicates with the ships thrusters to adjust the ship's velocity accordingly.  

&gt;5) If you turn you engines and IFCS off you will continue to coast at the same velocity.  

&gt;6) Fuel is consumed by using your thrusters or main engines. If you coast you will not be using fuel, but making velocity vector changes will consume fuel.  

&gt;7) More advanced IFCS systems will allow you to turn of parts of its overrides or allow it to interpret you inputs differently - for instance you could tell it you want to go into an ""orientation"" not ""vectoring"" mode where it will take your joystick inputs as solely ship orientation inputs and not try to correct your ship's velocity vector to be aligned in the direction your ship is pointing (the famous Battlestar Galactica maneuver).  

&gt;8) We will limit the top speed of ships you can fly for technical issues (physics engines have problems when the numbers get too big) and fun - figuring out an intercept course for an opponent traveling at 0.2 speed of light (which is our fictional max for practical spaceflight in 2943) maybe be challenging if you're a mathematician or physicist but not what I call fun gameplay.  

&gt;9) This top speed will be less than the top speed of weapons.  

&gt;10) Top speed will probably be dependent on ship class but we haven't balanced this so it may be a matter of all ships having the same cap but the smaller faster ones can reach that limit much quicker (and therefore put some distance between them and their pursuers even if they go to max). This needs to be tuned so that people with the right kind of ships can run from a fight. The idea is that once you get enough separation between you and a hostile you can make the jump to autopilot / warp speed (using the Star Trek term), which is how you cover big distances in-system (essentially at that 0.2 lightspeed (c) number I mentioned). Just at these speeds you're not maneuvering - you're just accelerating and decelerating in a straight line. Think of it as human (player) controlled flight for the lower combat / docking speeds and then when wanting to warp to a destination (say a planet or a jump point) you hand control over to your ship's flight computer which handles plotting the trajectory and accelerating you to the 0.2 c speed that a RSI quantum drive can achieve.  

&gt;11) I do know what G-Force is :-) I use the term as a measure of acceleration on the human body as its good short hand for people to grasp the concept of forces acting on a body when accelerating and decelerating. You may be interested to know that ""..The accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations, and it is only these that are measured in g-force units. They cause stresses and strains on objects. Because of these strains, large g-forces may be destructive..."" Occasionally people think it is only to do with gravity and earth bound flight but that's actually incorrect - its just that's the case we're most familiar with. And yes these forces come into play when accelerating and decelerating in space and until we develop some system to increase our tolerances to the effects of this acceleration they will be the limiting factor on how aggressively we could change the velocity vector of a ship, irregardless of whether we are in the atmosphere or not. Its also interesting to note that we're built to withstand much greater accelerations in certain directions - modern day pilots can withstand 9 G but much less negative Gs. Its why you see pilots rolling and pulling back on the stick when attempting aggressive maneuvers rather than pushing forward or yawing with a rudder. The same will be true in space. We're going to factor in G-Force in the simulation, and allow pilots to push the boundaries (or switch the IFCS safety off) in search for a little advantage, but beware if you back (or red) out in a dogfight you may come to floating in space next to the smoking wreck of your ship!

&gt;Question from Incompitence:  

&gt;Will inertia be Newtonian or will there be a ""resistive"" force that will eventually decrease a vector to zero?  

&gt;Application: Crank my 350r vector up to max, go dark (zero emissions), run the blockade with stealth system at max.  

&gt;CR's answer:
(word by word)  


&gt;""so, uhh, in space there's no resistance force, and uhh, there's this endless debate that goes on but, ahh the ahh the underlying physics are of fully correct Newtonian, we just control the top speed of the various ships, and of the few other things mainly to make the game fun, but also there's sort of pseudo science reason for it, you are involved in dog-fighting and are making radical orientational changes, ahhm, actually the forces in the human body generally even in today's world fighter craft can take far more Gs than the actual pilot can, so I can of wanted the fiction that we use for the fact that our fighters, space fighters don't can't fly at the speed of light and turn instantly is that uhh, you can't actually do that without killing yourself uhh, if you are flying in person, so it's not a lot of fun having a bunch of robots flying around uhhmm.. and uhh if you don't have inertial dampeners for physical forces on you then you'll probably have to keep your uhhmm.. speeds of your ship down when engaging in space combat manoeuvres because uhhm otherwise yes you can go faster in a straight line uhhmm uhhmm but then some is going fire a laser after you, and you will never go faster than the speed of light so you'll probably be a sitting duck in that situation, so generally uhhmm we don't uhhmm have a resistive force but we do sort of have limiting in the fiction the actual ship's computer or the flight control system limits the speed depending on the situation you are in ahhh based of dog-fighting so it wont let you go too fast, because if you go too fast trying to turn quickly physically (..saliva slurping sound..) do bad things to you, so I guess the short answer to that is no you can't set your speed and keep on going and uhh.. you'd have to.. to.. keep thrusters to the same speed.""

Blizzard has upgraded WoW's look a lot in the recent years and it looks amazing compered to the early days, although you can definitely see the age of the engine. 

I'm just curious about how scale-able CryEngine 3 is graphically and furthermore would they be able to increase the size of the ""instances"", add more land on planets, significantly better textures?

What kind of variety can we expect?,32,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1cnaet/ships_with_character_what_kind_of_variety_can_we/,"I've been following star citizen for awhile, and after reading the article about Spider it got me thinking. All of the ships I've seen have been very similar in style, and brand new, futuristic state-of-the-art deals. 

Surely there are ships that are 10, 20, 50 years old+, made by a plethora of companies. What about that mid-size fighter that never caught on because it was too expensive, and the thrusters were in a weird configuration, and it was too damn ugly? The freighter from 50 years ago that was the best in the galaxy, but fell behind new tech and couldn't keep up? The 250 year old luxury cruiser, sitting in an abandoned shipyard, waiting to be restored and retrofitted by a savvy trader who appreciates the old-school style. The weird guys that live in a mined out asteroid and make ships that can only fit lasers and look like they're from an 80's anime?

Firefly, Cowboy bebop... my favorite ships are never fresh off the factory floor, sterile, and characterless. Sure, a new Prius will have better brakes, fuel economy, air bags, on-star, etc. But I'll take a 1970 Charger(with soft top) any day of the week.  I'd never love the prius, and it would never by ""my car"" just ""a car"". I want the inside of my ship the have grease stains and steel grates, not white plastic and uncomfortable square sofas.

I want to pay for fare to Spider, buy an old derilect for the price of a hot meal, and strap the best kit I can afford to her. Might not look like much, but with enough work she'll fly just as good as that ""Cargo-Master 6000"" with its new ship smell.

So, what can we expect? Lots of ship variety and flavor? Will there be 50 kinds of freighters? Or just 3?(small/fast, medium, big/slow)? Can we get an older ship with some soul, or are all ships next years model from Shipleys Starships Inc. ?

-Can 'record' footage from players perspective by press of a button(or key).

-You can watch videos you record on your black-box, and edit and upload it to the ""Citizen's Forum""


Black-boxes can be:

-Destroyed.

-Taken and retrieved from a wreckage, if not destroyed in the fight/crash/whatever.

--If a black-box is taken, you have the option to download the clip and do what you like with it

-Scoured for data (Ship name, model, armaments, cargo,location) so the data can be purged or shared


Reasons for having one in the game:

-Provides an RP way of capturing in-game footage, bypassing 3rd party software.

-Allows a neat way of posting info about a pirate or dangerous system.

-Could make insurance claims much easier on the devs (send them the video).

-Anybody can make a short clip on some tips and tricks without having to buy FRAPS or settle for some 
buggy freeware. 


EDIT: So it is pretty clear that the black-box sans video recording might be a good idea for implementation if CIG has the time.

Fair enough - I can always earn these ships in game. Then wait, there's more! People that pledge early will get exclusive lifetime insurance. OK, fine, guess you don't want your early backers to lose everything. Oh BTW - ships will be really expensive in game - many people in the persistent universe might just focus their career on ugrading something like the Origin 300i, rather than affording a new ship. &gt;_&gt;. I get that you want to reward early pledgers, but this shouldn't be with a game mechanic that requires massive amounts of grinding to upgrade to one of the starting ships.

Now look at the stretch goals: CR made a big point of saying how much he hoped we would get to 4mil because there was a really important planet unlocked at that goal. If it's ""really important,"" why isn't it the first one unlocked?! Similarly, why is making the Bengal Carrier player-flyable a stretch goal? I get that there was a lot of player support for this idea; I supported this idea, but if there is a lot of support for this, then it should be moved up in development priority regardless of how much money the project makes, not held hostage. Similarly, I thought the reason it wasn't being included initially was for balance reasons - why does raising $5.5 million suddenly make balancing the game a smaller issue?

Contrast the funding incentives being offered in SC to the incentives for [Elite: Dangerous](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous) - another space sim with MMO elements being funded on Kickstarter. In that, the greatest in-game advantage that can be garnered is access to special missions and a few discounts. Most of the pledge rewards focus on greater communication to and from the dev team, earlier access to alpha/beta, and getting recognition within the game (naming systems after you, etc.)

When I compare Star Citizen's funding drive to Elite: Dangerous', I feel like SC is sliding into pay-to-win territory.

I have no evidence to back this up, other than repeated comments from CR and CIG, that a large portion of the game will be made up of NPCs and I think many people are missing the main point.

Pirates, by their very definition, are looking out for just one thing: themselves. They may occasionally look out for each other, when profitable, but are just as likely to stab their ""buddy"" in the back as soon as it is advantageous to do so. This tells me that while you and your band of pirates are looking to rob some poor schlep you are just as likely to get attacked by another (player and NPC) group of pirates, your own crew, (player and NPC) police, hostile aliens, (player and NPC) bounty hunters and the escorts of the cargo you are trying to steal.

I feel that being a pirate is likely going to be **or at least should be** the hardest profession and will be filled by only the most bored and or skilled players who are looking for additional challenges. Many people have been saying that without choke points a lot of the time being a pirate in a high risk system is going to be sitting around waiting for a target to come your way so you can ruin his day. I would argue that in those systems everyone will be running for their lives just about constantly - and that is not only the way it should be but also good for the game!

I could be totally off base on this and perhaps pirates will all be buddy buddy and agree to not attack each other, but I just don't see that being realistic or **what is best for the long term health of our game.**

So in my scenario, I imagine a large corporation (either player or NPC) getting a little too competitive and having a little too large a slice of a market. Now this ticks off other (one or more) large/small NPC corporations who would like to do a little 'down-sizing' of this competitor. Now of course they can't have their own hands soiled and reputation lessened so this then prompts them to 'hire' players (or npcs) to go do it for them. 

I imagine this could be anything from just harassing some haulers to something as drastic as placing a forced embargo on some stations/planets/systems or blockading a trade lane for an amount of time or even something as shady/creative as pretending to be an 'escort' for large trade going down. Many possibilities for pirate shenanigans!

The kind of transmissions advertising these jobs could be on some 'black market' frequency or requires a particular piece of hardware to pick up. Something that maybe Bounty hunters may have to really have a hard time coming by. Whereas pirates could quite easily get their hands on them.

TLDR: Greedy NPC corporations/companies giving out high paying pirate jobs to deal with other corporations/companies getting too large.

It's a free to play MMO (basically World of Tanks in space) that recently [hit Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/212070/) but has been around for much longer. 

It's quite beautiful (the screenshots don't do it justice) and performs well on weaker machines. 

Combat is fun but can get rather dull because it's less about aiming and tactics than stats and abilities. Also, it does not have much variety, at least at the lower levels.
I haven't played much yet but it seems like in terms of gameplay value most equipment that can be purchased by real money has equivalents that can be unlocked through (extensive) free gameplay, which is good.

Obviously not trying to advertise the game here, just wanna give you my honest opinion. It has its flaws but is a lot of fun nonetheless.

I had seen the IAMA by Chris Roberts, but had not read it and a co-worker had mentioned that he was doing a new game but I had not researched it.  It wasn't until the last day of the Kickstarter that I followed a link and realized what was going on.

I am a long time fan of space sims and MMO games, including several of Chris Roberts' games.  I have gotten incredibly excited over the past few days.  In MMO's I have been part of high end raiding guilds in EQ and WoW, including leading one in WoW for about a year, and am a huge fan of the genre.  I played a solitary life in Star Wars Galaxies, being a solo Armor merchant.  I made the most high end armors on my server until I finally got bored.

What has me so excited for this game is just how many opportunities exist to play the game differently.  Trading, smuggling, pirating, etc.  there is the single player military campaign.  I am no expert at this point, but it seems like there are many guild and faction type goals that can be achieved as well.

I am somewhat worried that the learning curve will be extremely steep and make the game difficult for more casual players.  I will be hoping to scrape together a small group of core friends that can maybe man a constellation class ship, or maybe a few cutlass ships and can carry  out some cool trading/smuggling without getting totally destroyed in a what can easily be a very hardcore game.  I know a little about eve online and i know it is a hard world out there in the darkness of space.

How do you plan to play?  Large guild? solo? small group? hardcore guild?  military existance? piracy? trading? smuggling?",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_13khvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13khvn/how_will_you_play_star_citizen/,

[Discussion on RSI-Forums](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/forum/showthread.php?14837-OpenGL-vs-DirectX)

I would like to remind everyone to make their voice heard. With the first techdemo release set to this summer and alpha later this year, RSI has to make their final decision for the ongoing development on a 3D-API rather soon.

The survey released a few hours ago asks for your opinion on ""DirectX 11 only"", which would mean no support for Mac/Linux. This would be rather sad, as Chris has commented [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/CommanderRoberts) on RSIs and CryTeks interest in OpenGL, and thus Crossplatform-Support.

Please, keep in mind that well made OpenGL game is in no way inferior to a DirectX game (a very nice discussion on this topic can be found in the RSI topic above). It would simply give you the freedom of choice to play on Windows/Linux/Mac and any operating system you might use at home.

Like many of you, i put down quite much money on this project, of course fully aware it might be a Windows only title. I guess in the end i would maintain a Windows-partition for SC, if there really is no other way, but with Valve/Steam pushing for a open PC gaming platform, Linux support and the indie scene work over the past few years we might have the chance to get Crossplatform-Support for StarCitizen.

So please, think about your answer on this new Survey and what it means in the long run. It means a lot to me and all the other Computerscientists, Linux-enthusiasts, Mac-~~Hipster~~People etc.

When you buy a mech, you'll know what kind of weapons you can atatch to it and how fast it will move, but you don't know how it feels until you buy it and take it into a match.

As for flying, I was thinking you could virtually test-drive ships in your price range, and I say virtually because I find it unlikely that in any real world scenario, any ship salesman would to into space at breakneck speeds with someone who intends to haggle them down.

POST 1



&gt;Hi all, I just wanted to introduce myself. I’m the designer/coder for the Star Citizen HUD and additional 2D elements. While a good deal of my work wasn’t integrated in time for the live demo, that was largely because what we’ve been doing has pushed the limits of Scaleform and CryENGINE – and is radically different from the standard game HUD formula that’s prevailed for the last decade. 
&gt;
&gt;Taking inspiration from previous Chris Roberts ship controls, nothing in our work is similar to the templates you’ve seen in more recent games; it’s been engineered from the ground up to deliver an unparalleled degree of control and detail to the pilot. Chris is an inspiring guy to work for, and I’m honored to have been picked for the job. We aren’t cutting any corners. 
&gt;
&gt;**All the elements of the HUD systems we’ve developed are based on procedural algorithms and can be customized to different ships and styles to a huge degree of depth and flexibility, keeping the scope of the universe in mind**. My task is to pack as much useful information as possible into tight, clear displays, to give pilots those crucial visual cues that can mean the difference between life and death in a dogfight. 
&gt;
&gt;The HUD will be your friend, and learning to read it reflexively will shave crucial milliseconds off your reaction time. Sometimes it feels more like I’m developing an avionics package for the military than for a game! For my qualifications, I have 15 years in Flash/Flex development, including dozens of casual games and a custom gaming platform for a Bitcoin site I operate. I’m very much a DIY, self-employed developer, and this is my first team effort in over ten years. But this is a game I’m dying to play, and I couldn’t say no… I’ve been a fan of Chris’s work since I was a kid playing Wing Commander, and it’s a dream job for me to work with the team he’s assembled. 
&gt;
&gt;There are lots of reasons to pledge to this project, but one of the best (in my view) is that the authenticity of the flying/fighting experience is going to be unparalleled. I can confirm that all the pieces are in place to ensure that it will be – and as for the avionics, I think this HUD will be the gold standard in “AAA” games for the next decade or longer. I hope to hear your feedback as we go along, and thank you all for showing your support and helping to building this awesome game!

&gt;I’m looking forward to showing off the design, and I’ll see if we can’t get a sneak peek in here pretty soon! **You can catch a tiny bit of it in the “Immersion” video at [1] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVua...&amp;&gt;feature=relmfu which shows some of the earliest integrations of marks, radar and ship displays when you climb into the cockpit. Although this is just the tip of the iceberg, you’ll notice the screen displays there look quite a bit different from anything in the other videos. What you’re seeing (for HUD-skeptics) are functional components with a lot of data layers and controls built in, but they aren’t engaged &gt;yet in that video.**
&gt;
&gt;Mea culpa, by the way. I was trying to do something that hadn’t been done before, which was part of the reason we missed our integration target, which is most of the reason why the targeting reticles and gun pips weren’t in for the live demo (which is why Chris missed the enemy ship — **and why some people seem to doubt the HUD exists). But I promise the end result is well worth it; you’ve never seen this stuff in a HUD before, because we had to rewrite parts of the CryENGINE/Scaleform integration code and roll a whole bunch of new graphics methods just to make it work.**
&gt;
&gt;I’ll shut up now before I say too much, and leave it to Chris to make the big announcements


POST 3


&gt;Thanks for such a warm welcome! Can’t believe so many people stopped by to say hi while I was sleeping. I’m by no means able to answer all the questions, and I should be getting back to work :P but I guess I can give you all another good teaser…
&gt;
&gt;**I’m seeing a lot of questions about 2D vs. 3D displays, and about 3D HMDs vs. cockpit-projected HUDs. In fact, Chris made the decision to use all three types in Star Citizen from the beginning.**
&gt;
&gt;**There’s a fixed holographic projection within the cockpit, which overlays things that don’t move with your head, e.g. velocity, acceleration, attitude, altitude, heading and targeting data. This projection has depth for greater effect (along the lines of what you see in that Scaleform promotional video), and also uses some 
&gt;(non-essential) stereoscopic depth cues to assist the pilot in reading certain situations more quickly. You don’t need an Oculus to get all the same info, but I’m not saying the depth cues won’t give you a slight edge.**
&gt;
&gt;**In addition to that, there’s a separate projection on the inside of the pilot’s helmet which can be loaded up with with deeper data sets (e.g. ship status, weapons selection, power balancing, navigation maps, communications, etc). This HMD projection stays in your field of vision when you turn your head.**
&gt;
&gt;**Finally, elements from both of these projections can be shunted to the flat LCD displays or brought back up to their respective projection, and have been designed to shift shape, color and opacity, and/or break into separate elements, depending on whether they’re being displayed on a flat screen or holographically. So yeah, there was definitely some inspiration from Minority Report and Iron Man, but at the same time these elements are very much in the CR space sim style, and my primary goal is to remain true to his original vision.**
&gt;
&gt;**I should stress that these projection layers exist, and about 80% of the gizmos are fully functional; in tests, they have been added to the projections and screens and run successfully with dummy data. The part that’s not yet complete is the full integration that sends active environmental data to the components. The HUD is a platform in itself with 62 custom classes and a 20-page API manual so far. There are hundreds of data points that need to be connected up to the ship’s systems, so we’re still in the process of getting the cockpit fully “wired”.**
&gt;
&gt;**And no, we’re not deviating from the classic polar-mapped radar screen! But we’ve added some nice touches like sector heat mapping, and ship-on-your-tail alerts.**
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, someone asked me about incorrect and/or damaged displays. **Every element in our HUD responds to damage. As Chris built the fly-by-wire system to procedurally handle an infinite range of ship states based on damage to various components, that philosophy was extended to have damage also rendered procedurally in the HUD. Just as one example, text in the HUD is not pre-rendered or even generated on the fly as a block; it’s printed procedurally to the displays one character at a time, with a greater likelihood of transcription error (or garbled transmission) depending on specific damage to your avionics or communications systems. Response to damage is a bedrock feature of every element in the HUD and has a negative impact on boot times, data latency and accuracy. If this sounds like something not recommended in a scaleform project, it isn’t – and they said it was crazy – but we’ve refactored, honed and optimized it to work.**
&gt;
&gt;So, I’ll end it here before I give away all my tricks, but I’ll drop back in from time to time. Meanwhile, stay tuned for the next vid!"" 

 
POST 4 (21.10.12)


&gt;Good luck to all of us! 
&gt;
&gt;**I just want to say, as far as modding the HUD, a lot of things (e.g. colors, custom drawing styles) are written to be extremely moddable. I imagine custom skins will be an early addition. Totally custom HUDs that include unique ship configurations are probably further down the road. We’ve overcome some major technical hurdles with Scaleform in terms of getting all of our procedural elements to work, although the trade-off is that we had to mod the SDK a bit so it’s not as easy to compile these things in. But the HUD is made to be very, very flexible… we’ve already got some in-house programs written to ease the process of integrating new elements and new ships… so I do think community modding of the HUD is ultimately in the cards.**
&gt;
&gt;Also: Personally, and not speaking for RSI, I’m a big fan of Privateer, and the exploration/trading side of things (although with some good dogfights to spice it up). Actually one of my favorite games from back in the day was Starflight, which was pretty much all about that. **I still have great memories the planetary analysis that would piece together the atmospheric and mineral composition of new planets you’d orbit.** My 9-year-old best friend and I (can’t resist linking to him) decided to start a software company to build an open universe after playing that game, which ended a year later with a journal full of dozens of solar systems and a bunch of hypercard stacks. 
&gt;
&gt;**So from my perspective, civilian uses for the HUD and ship’s systems are absolutely crucial as well, and they won’t be neglected in Star Citizen. It’s one of the reasons I’m thrilled to be part of the team.**

This game is looking to be amazing! If you donating early helped it be even more amazing isn't that enough? And besides, you'll always have the date of your first pledge to indicate your ""founder"" status? 

I pledged on 10-24-2012 and did so the first time I saw the game, but it was my first exposure. Not every potential donor got a chance to see the early promotional stuff - so what that someone else who just happens to come across the 300i commercial and decides to pledge and gets similar treatment? We need those people to pledge and support the game. We need more people to donate to the cause. Without them investors are needed and investors, being investors, are concerned about ""their"" investment not necessarily the quality of the overall game experience.

Maybe some sort of interest system could be created? The longer our money has been in game the more starting credits we can get?

In all of the video demos of flight mechanics and the role of physics, so far, the side thrusters are only ever shown as being used for angular acceleration. That is, they're only ever being used to ""turn"" or roll the ship. Never are they shown being used for strafing or forward/backward movement. That is, they are never all pointed in the same direction.

To elaborate on my question: If I were to opt out of using the fly-by-wire system as a means of creating the illusion of only being able to fly forward, will I be able to make a custom control scheme that lets me use those directional thrusters to strafe left/right, accelerate laterally (up/down relative to ship), accelerate backwards, or even contribute to my forward acceleration in tandem with my main thruster?

Since this implies using the same thrusters meant for mouse aiming to also move the ship with keyboard commands, let me further this question of custom control versatility: *Exactly* how much will our custom control schemes be able to dynamically affect the movement of our directional thrusters? Does anyone know if there will only be a few preset control schemes; if the custom control mapping will work the same way as regular binds; and/or if we will be able to write custom scripts to dynamically translate what the controls are saying into thruster directions through conditional statements, vector math, etc.? If only the first and second cases are true, what happens if my mouse movement is telling my thruster to point one way and my keyboard is telling it to point another way (assuming I want to use the side thrusters to perform lateral maneuvers)?

TL;DR *Exactly* how much control will we have over side thrusters outside of angular acceleration?

Edit: solarisfowl points out another interesting part of this: ""They've said you can jetison cargo to get an edge in a close fight, so that would be another disadvantage, you'd likely have cargo coming in, but the carrier ships wouldn't... so less weight from cargo (and lack of jump drive if slot is unused but I suspect the drive would be heavier than most upgrades), and the possibility of an extra fighting-related upgrade on the carrier fighter.""

“If you were unable to get on the site in the last 48 hours there is a short grace period.

After the grace period, only the original ships (Aurora, 300i, Hornet, Freelancer, and Constellation) will be available as add-ons.

this is something which I have [posted on the official forums](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/forum/showthread.php?14607-Call-Signs) but given that I had the idea while browsing reddit I thought it deserved a post here.

One thing that quite often gets to me in games is an inability to change my in game user name. And in a lot of instances I can understand why this may be but I got to thinking about call-signs today when someone was talking about the naming of jump points.

What I am suggesting is to allow for the separation between your characters given name verses your characters pilot call sign.

I propose 3 types of in game identification.

**1) Call sign:**

Completely mutable, you change it anywhere you can land. It's what displays to people when you're out flying around. Any actions you take can be associated with that call sign (for fame or infamy). Players can flag a ship ID with known call signs associated with it. That way if people look up the ship ID database they can see call signs that have been flagged in the past.

**2) Character name:**

Immutable, you cannot change this. You can choose to give people your name but you are not forced to. This makes it a display of trust if you are giving out your name.

**3) Ship unique hardware IDs:**

A semi-permanent aspect of a ship. Players will be able to scan other people's ships and see their unique hardware IDs for that ship. Call signs seen piloting that ship can be tagged. That way if you scan a ship and get its hardware ID, you can access a database and see a history of tagged call signs and how reputable they were.
However if a player can obtain a new ship ID then they can ""clean"" the ship. This hardware ID should be hard to obtain.

On another note, I wonder how this could work for multi person ships; after all if you flag a ship for doing something nasty to you, you would want some way of tracking down ALL people involved. How this should be implemented I am unsure. ",,False,self,t5_2v94d,1358204847.0,,,True,t3_16j46m,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/16j46m/game_idea_call_signs/,

For me, music is one of the primary pieces that sets the mood of a game. Without good, appropriate music, a game is likely to fall flat.

Considering Star Citizen's budget, and also my desire for a well-orchestrated soundtrack, I was considering some ideas and was reminded of the virtual choirs that Eric Whitacre does. Whitacre is an American choral composer, but some of his most popular projects are the virtual choirs he does. He takes a piece that he's written and solicits his fans to send him performances via youtube or other media and then chooses the best, combines them and creates a choir of them. 

You can see one of his more recent projects [here](http://ericwhitacre.com/the-virtual-choir). 

I was thinking that there have to be other musicians like myself that are excited about Star Citizen. What if RSI passed on an expensive professional orchestra and choir with expensive studio fees, and did a crowd-choir project in which fans of the project performed the music for the game? 

I know I could get at least a dozen high quality instrumentalists and vocalists together for such a project.

If this and other unconventional tactics aren't possible already I would very much like them to be. **Warning: wall of text ahead**

I'm cruising around in my slightly modified 315p, seeing the sights and doing some exploring. Suddenly, the sensors chirp. 

There's a pirate at range closing fast. I flare up my thrusters in an attempt to run. They begin shooting but luckily my shields are holding for now. They're still getting closer and I try evasive actions but they stay on my tail. It's clear based on how they're firing they aren't out to destroy me and likely just want to capture my ship. The shots are focused on my engine. 

At this point I know I won't be able to escape by running and I don't have the offensive capability with this ship to defeat them if I turn around and try to fight head to head. What if I make it seem like they scored a good hit on me and knocked out my power... I quickly make some adjustments as I continue evasive actions. I wait for a shot to land near my engine and then dial back my powerplant and kill the main thruster. It appears that I'm dead in the water. 

They seize fire and begin approaching to board my ship. I prepare all my +z facing thrusters to fire at once and turn off the safeties on my missiles. As the pirates pull up next to my ship I trip my thrusters, dial back up my powerplant, spin the ship to face straight at the pirate and dumb fire my missiles straight into their underside at point blank range. The ship retains its rotational inertia and I fire up the main drive once again and zoom off back the way we came. The missiles managed to temporarily knock out their systems and allowed me to escape... for now.

In order for something like this to work I would need to be able to do a few things with my ship:

* The powerplant/grid need to have variable outputs
* Thrusters have to be individually controllable and queue-able
* Missiles must be able to fire without a lock

Now this is just one example of unconventional tactics that I'd like to see possible but there are many more possibilities. The key to making something like this be able to happen is to allow a lot of custom control over different parts of our ships.

**TL;DR** My purpose in making this post is twofold; I'm curious as to the opinions of the rest of you in regard to unconventional encounters and also I want to see how much of this is already announced as being possible based on known features.

*EDIT: So apparently a scenario like this won't happen. Sensors will be able to tell whether or not I'm truly disabled and more importantly there's no reason to even attempt not to blow up my ship since it's a single crewed vessel.*

*Maybe we'll be able to use ingenuity in other ways.*",,False,self,t5_2v94d,1373643267.0,,,True,t3_1i4zug,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1i4zug/unconventional_warfare/,

Considering that SC will have trade routes for raw goods between planets, which is exactly what these current container ships do best, CIG will have to design some monstrous ships like this.

Also, if these monsters are used exclusively for inter-system transport, they could be built in orbit and never land on planets. Therefore, they would never be subject to gravity and the other pesky forces that our Earth container ships must resist.

Will it be the same in Star Citizen? Or will the cargo in the holds of all players mean something to the universe. If food isn't shipped to a remote science facility will its crews starve? If raw ore is delivered to certain smelters will we see a surplus in fabrication metals? If I hijack a transport carrying medical supplies and deliver it to a suffering pirate base will there patrols increase?

I feel like Star Citizen is going to be so much more than what we've gotten in the past and with this persistent universe there is some potential for some really great stuff.

And if so, what all will you be able to do on your ship to pass the time?

survival elements, such as eating/sleeping

performing maintenance and repairs

talking with AI or multiplayer crew members

look over ship cargo

use the computer to check cargo manifest, world map, reputation, messages, story, etc.

One idea I had earlier that I thought might be cool would be to integrate a web browser into the ship computers, allowing you to browse the internet, play flash games, etc while waiting to reach your destination (instead of minimizing the game, and opening your computer's browser, making the pass-time a part of the game) 

Any idea if at least some of these will be possible? Should they? (If not, there's always modding)

EDIT: I should clarify, i would like if there was a bit of travel time between systems, but not every system. The kind of situations these would be relevant would be when traveling from one side of the system map to the other, and the amount of time wouldn't have to be much. Just 5 minutes or so to walk around your ship and relax, taking a break from the intense spacefaring action to do maintenance and check up on the latest news (some mentioned a combination in-game network and out of game network, which I really like the sound of) Also, playing flash games isn't something you would necessarily want to do, I just think it would be funny if the possibility was there.

1. Cargo Jettison/ Kamikaze

Let's say you're running some sort of unstable weaponry to a buyer and a couple of pirates jump into your system. Let us also assume your ship, and cargo are insured. You don't think you're going to escape from them and they are directly behind you , so you jettison half of the unstable weaponry. They slam into it, and explode. To make up for it you plunder their ships and file insurance for lost cargo due to an attack. On the other end of it, let's say you are attacking a large carrier ship and it's about to blow up, your shields are down and you aren't going to make it out of this fight, so you slam into the carrier(assume we are carrying the same reactive cargo) and blow it up, assuring victory for your team.

2. Wormhole Ambush

You are on a giant mining ship containing a massive and powerful mining laser when you get warning from a friend that a squad of pirates is moving towards the wormhole into the system you are in. You quickly turn to face the wormhole and divert all power to your mining laser. On your friend's signal you fire into the wormhole. The pirates warp into your system just in time to catch the full force of your mining laser, Due to its enormous power their shisp are ripped apart instantaneously. You are now safe to continue mining.

I am very much looking forward to this game (or at least a few videos, showing off cool stuff).


What I was wondering, was the following:

Has Chris mentioned anything about space stations that are run and created by players or larger groups of players, alliances? Maybe this a no-brainer and I've missed some information, but I think it would be great to have such stations.

For some reason, whenever I think about the game, I imagine a ship approaching such a station, and asking a ""Space traffic controller"" on the stations, if he's allowed to dock.

For example, [Pugachev's Cobra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev's_Cobra) would be extremely easy to pull off—just cut thrust, rotate 180, and voila. On the other hand, the related [Herbst Maneuver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbst_maneuver) seems like it would be impossible, since it relies on post-stall maneuvering, which is difficult when you can't stall.

Here's a wiki page on [Basic fighter maneuvers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_fighter_maneuvers) to get started. From reading through this, things like combat spread, scissors, and high-g barrel rolls would still apply, but a lot of the maneuvers rely on gravity to work. For instance, the whole idea behind a split-s is to trade altitude for speed to disengage.

So it looks like we'll have to come up with at least some of our own. A lot will obviously depend on the ships themselves. For instance, it looks like the Constellation at least will be able to pull a Crazy Ivan with those fully rotating main engines, which is something I would dearly love to see.

There's several aspects of SC that are present in EoC. It is a fantastic game, especially for its time, and it gives a very serious idea of another facet of SC's ""what could be"".

As a former submariner, I know a little bit about stealth, detection, and ambushing.  I'm sure that with an in-depth detection system that battle-tactics and piracy will develop levels of complexity.  I'd rather not see an EVE-Online system where everyone on grid has a known range, course, and speed unless they are completely undetectable cloaked ships.

Space is a big place.  Finding your friends and enemies with the Mk I Eyeball is not as efficient as you would think, especially at range.  There are two main methods of utilizing electromagnetic radiation to detect ships.

The first is actively emitting radar waves and then detecting the reflection of object, giving you it's direction.  The time-delay from when the was pulse sent to when it was received gives you distance.  Analyzing the pulses over time allows the computer to give you course and speed.  I'm hoping Star Citizen incorporates at least some sort of realistic sensor suite with various limitations that can be upgraded (e.g. coverage, range, sensitivity, broadcast power vs detection power).

Secondly, passive detection would be an interesting addition, especially for the more devious among us (I'm looking at you, pirates).  Passive detection relies on simply detecting the radiation emitted by the enemies search or fire-control radars without emitting your own signal.  The benefit of this system is a reduction in your chances for being detected, whether it be to sit back and watch a powerful fleet pass by, getting away from trouble, or getting the jump on an unexpected enemy.  These are some of the reasons today's submarines rely almost exclusively on passive sonar and radar detection.

A. How much will the fuel cost and maintenance fees scale with larger ships? I don't want to be a slave to the ship by having to grind out credits or resources to just to fly it when I could get a smaller ship and keep it fueled just as easily? I am assuming two things: 1. A full tank on a ship like an Aurora will be cheaper than a Constellation. 2. Maintenance fees and repair fees will be significantly different between sizes of ships.

B. Early game will be filled with explorers, people looking to fight, and those who want to quest. All of the groups will be hungry to see what the game can do. Without a full crew or escorts, isn't getting a larger ship akin to putting a large ""kill me sign"" on my back? Again, I am assuming two things: 1. There will be swarms of smaller ships but far fewer larger ships which, in my mind, will naturally cause other players to focus on the larger ships 2. 3-5 smaller ships could match a larger ship solo?

In the case of the Constellation, all of the crew are in the forward section of the ship, so any amount of damage after the shields are down, is going to wipe the entire crew in one go.

Typically, transparent materials are weaker than opaque metals or alloys, hence the alloy framing holding the ""glass"" cockpit in place.

Of the three bottlenecks he mentions above - **internet bandwidth**, **server processing power** and **PC rendering capabilities** - which one is causing the most problems today? Will this change by the time the game is released? And most importantly, *why*? 

For example, if the real bottleneck is PC GPU power, we might find that 4 years down the road, the maximum number of players one instance can support has risen to 500, or even 1000. Alternatively, if the real limitation is internet bandwidth... well, the way things are going, 4 years from now there might be a maximum of 20 people in one instance!!

EDIT: the thread is really worth reading through, it is a thorough discussion with many good points raised and quotes of responses from the team. really made me less concerned. it seems chris wants to include freelancer controls ""without breaking the game"" so he is at least aware of the issue. If anyone can solve it, its probably him. Here's to hope

--------

**OP**

As I see a lot of  discussion about Joysticks and which one to use and how to map the axes, buttons, coolie hats and pedals I feel as with every newly anounced Space Sim the early community consists mainly of old school sim fans rather than new school shooter fans, thus the Stick seems the natural choice of control method for most people here.

 

Coming kind of freshly with rather negative impressions from the overall fail that was Black Prophecy I’d like to arise this pretty important question for the multiplayer part of the game. What direction is mouse control going to be? Black Prophecy did a lot of things wrong in the controls department and I’d hate to see Star Citizen repeat the same mistakes.

 

One might ask what the problems are, especially if you’re one of those Sim Fans that would never even think of using anything but a joystick to fly a plane or space fighter. Well let’s hypothetically say Chris and his team take the rather logical approach for a sim to build the game for joystick controls and implement a mouse control that emulates a stick. Meaning: You have a direction indicating cursor, the ship will turn towards this cursor, the farther away from the center that cursor is the faster the ship will turn, weapons still fire towards the crosshair in the center of the screen.  As soon as the new kids, that never saw X-Wing and Wing Commander or any serious simulator for that matter, but started with Freelancer and X, jump in they will start to whine that the mouse controls are rather unintuitive, since they are used to weapons firing where the cursor points.

In the single player world all would be fine, you give them what they want and make even the hardpointed weapons into pseudo turrets that always fire towards the cursor . Of course this would for some people be an immersion breaker as the focus in what is important shifts a little away from maneuvering your ship towards pointing your cursor on a target and hitting LMB. But again in single player this isn’t a problem since after all it’s everyone’s own choice how he faces the AI (that most times isn’t a real challenge anyways unless it’s allowed to cheat let’s be honest here).

 

Now here’s the fatal approach Reakktor took with Black Prophecy as a reaction to those rather loud outcries about mouse control: They gave in and made it pseudo turret control which instantly gave a HUGE precision and possible firing angle advantage to mouse players over joystick players.  I think most of you will agree that in a competitive multiplayer environment having an imbalance on the level of control schemes automatically makes the control scheme with the disadvantage an obsolete choice. They then tried to even the odds by emulating the mouse control with the joystick (which was fail by design since digital joystick axes only send 256 destinct position signals, while modern mouse have resolutions five to fourty times as high).

The conclusion and at the same time suggestion towards Chris and the team is: While with some practice it is perfectly possible to perfrom just as good with a mouse that emulates the stick as a player with a stick. The other way around it is impossible due to hardware limitations to reach thea same performance with a stick that emulates mouse controls as with the mouse control using turreted weapons. So please either go with Joystick and Mouse, where mouse emulates a Joystick or step up now and don’t even bother to implement Stick controls because in the end nearly noone will use it.

------
**TLDR; FPS-esque style mouse control ala Freelancer gives a distinct advantage in accuracy and field of fire to mouse users because the guns follow the cursor; joystick users are pretty much stuck with forward firing guns while they wait for their ship to come around.

I put my high school gaming days away, followed my family tradition joined the army, pursued great dreams there. Now I’m out, with only a few things broken with no “valuable” family orientated skills I’m pursuing flight school (Rotary) and about to get married. Man I’m feeling old and with that I thought (even despite my inner nerd inside) my gaming days where dwindling to a halt… 


Until I heard something about this “Star Citizen Space-Sim,” from a whim of a whim. Then one day Googled it… First thought was “noooo it can be, to complex, too hard, just a dream” I tried not to get my hopes up…  “Just another EVE I thought, big corps will ruin it (EA), play-2-win will kill it, and monthly costs are a no go then crowd funding? Won’t make it.


Then I squinted, the nerd within dug a little deeper…and the little nerd started twitching, then jumping and well here I am. I’m hooked. My nerd within exploded to the point where my fiancé is learning a whole new hidden side of me lol. Must scratch the itch! I cant stop!

what I was thinking after I concluded that I am with out a doubt backing this game...
So what you’re telling me I can buy a ship that would bring me work, my gun will help me keep it and my simple goal can be: find a crew, find a job and keep flying?

I can make the kessel run in less than ten parsecs? I can pull up if it’s a trap?? 

I can hear nothing but the rain, grab my gun and bring in the cat? I can fracking search the universe for signs of the 13th colony? 

I was never a trekkie but what the hell, I can’t do it because I don’t have the power??

I had to do that, hope you get all the references. I’m sorry if they were cheesy, I’m excited for this game and want to imagine I can play a character type from one (or all) of those great films/shows. I unfortunately missed deadline for old backers/vet. But I am now backing it with what I could scoot under the radar of the mrs... I bought the Origin 315 package, who could resist the shiny advertisement?  Powered by Crytech? Adds to my giddiness. 
I wish I could get the “Connie “constellation.  But that would NOT go over well on the bedside talk… long term and married will feel me on that :)  Money is tight :/ But when the hanger module comes I hope I can find someone that would let me wander a bit through their ships! 

Anyway, I had to get that out there. This is shaping up to be a great community with a GRAND future game. I’m hooked and excited to join. 
Caveat, I was thinking Chris Roberts holds the Golden key to either complete revive to this genre of game or total destruction. (Total is a bit far but final blow I guess works) but no pressure Chris. 
I’d love to talk all night about this game and learn what you know but I need sleep!
Thanks guys.

If so, it seems that there would be very high demand for crew (labor) and a depressed demand (relative to supply) for ships.  CI could either leave the ship glut to solve itself, or generate a huge number of NPCs to crew them, but I'm not so sure that players really want the game to be dominated by NPC pilots.

Alternatively, it could be that there is a huge selection bias when sampling only from r/starcitizen as maybe there is a higher concentration of big spenders among those who are excited enough about this game to be discussing it ad naseum on reddit a full year and some change before they can play it at all.

Either way, I would really like it if CI would maintain public statistics on the overall ship fleet relative to the number of backers, preferably broken down by ship model.

After a brief search you find the station owner because they have a tag floating above their head, or elsewhere, to indicate that they are the proprietor of the space station (it could also pop up on your HUD by means of ""scanning"" the player in a sci-fi fashion, but there's multiple ways to do this well, no doubt). You conclude your business and return to your ship, upon re-entering it, your name changes slightly to include ""Captain"" before your name, so as to designate your rank upon your vessel. You can have multiple ranks or tags depending on where you go, such as the owner of the station tagging you as a verified merchant for this station so that you don't need to find the owner to conduct your business every time you dock.

In another scenario, you may have been a little rowdy at a local spaceport's tavern, and the authorities have labeled you as a potential trouble maker, so that your name tag changes colour, etc. when you land in the district after disembarking your ship. Visibility options can be set to public, all the way to private, to specific groups and so on so that sensitive tags, like ""informant,"" or ""covert operative,"" etc. don't give away one's intentions, but make it easy for specific people to find each other in a crowd or foreign area, or as to not clutter other people's screens.

* How many people are employed by Cloud Imperium Games?   

The goals and ambitions of the game come across as being a AAA title, but AAA titles are driven by teams that (in some cases) are 100+ employees.   With the pay-scale for the games industry, the current level of donation the game has brought in wouldn't support more than 30 - 50 people (depending on individual title/pay) over the next two years.   

* Do you think what they are trying to create is realistic and achievable by a smaller team of 30 - 50 in the given time frame?   

I've seen a lot of titles with a lot of promise (Vanguard comes to mind, I'm still mad about that one - EABOD Brad) fall short due to any number of factors (Was it really necessary to buy a life-size Han Solo carbonite replica for the office, Brad?) and it makes me worry that either my own expectations are too high for this game and/or that the developer is being overly optimistic in what they want to -vs- what they can deliver.

* Are the ships that are available to the pre-order/Kickstarter/contribution folks something that will be available in the game at release or only to those people that paid?    Will there be bigger/better ships than the Kickstarter stuff?

I'd seriously consider going for a RSI Constellation, and my wife likes the Anvil, but there is that concern of not having anything else to look forward to later in the game.    I don't see the Bengal as realistic even for two hardcore gamers to get (I'm assuming it will be more of a guild cap-ship that will require multiple dozens of people contributing credits or resources) but I'd love to see a corvette or some freighter trains.

* Anyone that went for the Constellation, any input on what made you want to go that route vs the Freelancer?

* How long will the pre-order packages be available through the RSI website?  (if such a time has even been announced)

* I saw it mentioned you will be able to hire NPC crew members for ships that have crew slots.   Presumably this would mean an NPC could control the turret on the Constellation, but does this also mean an NPC could fly the defense fighter as well?

Thank you to anyone that can answer one or more of these questions!",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_17edu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/17edu5/several_questions_about_cloud_imperium_games_and/,

How cool would it be to actually have a place to call your own on the planet of your choice? A nice condo or apartment? A loft overlooking the city? 
It would be great for when you're not on a mission and just want to hang out and relax. Invite friends up to your place. Put your spoils of war onto the walls and furnish it the way you want to. 

During the day you can then go down to the city streets to the shops and hang out at the bars and from there head to your hangar.

Then - today - they come out with a surprise announcement about consumable items, tiered in such a way that the most powerful and beneficial item is for paying customers only. It was enough to turn me off the game forever.

Now I'm looking at Star Citizen, and it really looks appealing.  Mr. Roberts seems very sincere in his opinions and the game is making some amazing promises that it might just deliver on.  But I can't help but feel the same concern.  Is Star Citizen going to add consumable, real-money-only items into the game at the last minute and make sure that paying players have powers that free players can never use?  I can't participate in a game like that.

So, **why are you a Star Citizen?**

Its not because ""oh I want to support the game"" or the like. What I'm asking is why, game or not, did you choose to be part of a brand-new IP, and how od you see yourself fitting in this IP?

What it basically boils down into is what, how, and why would you be what you wanted to be in the Star Citizen universe, and how you see yourself having fun in it?

So, I've been racking my brain lately over how I'll want to play this game. My first instinct is to play as a good guy who fights for the little guy as every time I try to play as an evil guy my real life morality steps in and gives me terrible guilt, even against NPCs, so I imagine that I won't be able to sleep well after having robbed some innocent guy of all his cargo. So yeah, flying escort, bounty hunting, rescue etc seems like a good option, but I'd also like to stand out. I had an idea of starting a Workers Union Revolutionary Militia and attacking factory owners who don't keep their workers happy, by intercepting deliveries, attacking the station etc. until demands are met. This would also allow me to play in a moral grayzone, as I could be good, or just blindly zealous in my mission (regular union-guy, or militant hypocritical commie douche, probably depending on who you ask.) but I doubt that the game mechanic of factories and workers will allow me to fit it into the game world. The NPC workers won't pay me for it and I'll probably be unable to see what they are getting paid anyway. Does anyone know of a way to work this in? Will worker satisfaction benefit other activities on a planet that I could indirectly make money off of? Could I raise the floor for worker salaries above what the game sets, by being an annoying ass to anyone who pays just enough to keep them from striking? Could someone else benefit from keeping workers unhappy, such as whorehouses and drug dealers? I'd love for a game mechanic where unhappy workers would generate two missions; one to aid the workers, and one to aid the factory owner in beating down the uprising. I would like to hear your thoughts on unique roles, since my idea probably won't work out. How will you play the game outside of just picking a vanilla job like pirating or smuggling? Will you smuggle the SC version of crack to enemy planets to undermine their stability? Will you selectively pirate only certain traders? Maybe be a bounty hunter hunter, taking on jobs from criminals to do a hit on the bounty hunter chasing them?

Of course they should maintain each companies' current gear towards specs and ship types. That would even allow variety in this ship type.

The Drake version could be at a first glance a cheap competitor to RSI's Constellation, but under the surface it is geared more towards smuggling with hidden compartments in its un-standardization hull.

Origin's version would be a very fancy yacht with comfort in mind for the internal construction and sleek, steeliness on the outside. An almost overpriced pleasure craft with a lot of guns. Perfect as a status symbol for raising mob bosses or guild officials.

Anvil Aerospace could have a advance recon styled ship. A ship originally designed as a stealth vessel (something like a Blackbird), but repurposed as an exploration vessel for the civilian lineup because of its natural design towards advanced sensors. Bounty hunters could use the ship for its original stealth design by tracking their prey silently, or be utilized by a guild wanting to spy on an enemy's fleet.

These ships would allow variety for those looking for ships like the Constellation (the size and crew).

Basically.... Most games have a gameplay where you have a fixed number of hit points, you get hit, lose hp and if your hp bar reaches zero, you die. Eve online has this system, World of Tanks does, as well as most MMOs.

However, there is an alternate option. Games like Warthunder (a WW2 airplane fights game in style of WW2) or the (unfortunately) failed kickstarter game Rogue System have an idea that as long as your ship is in one piece, you're still flying. Unless your ship is completely blown up or your pilot dead, you're still in space, even if you took a gazillion damage to your wing - since it's not a crucial system for you to survive, there's no reason for you to stop playing!

The second system is of course a more realistic one. In my head it also sounds as the more fun one; if you destroy a ship's life support system, or you blow it wide open so the pilot is sucked into the space, you have a ship wreckage to explore and not some random mush of space salvage with generic loot. 

However it also seems like a more complicated system, one that is more difficult to balance. My question is: has there been any official talk on which kind of system will SC use? From some context I'm really not sure (in one of the blogs they said that you'll be able to shoot off guns from a ship you intent to board - does that mean that this damage won't contribute to ship destruction or that you have to keep that into consideration all the time so you don't accidentaly blow up your target?).


I appreciate all your thoughts and discussions although I'm hoping there's an answer out there already.

We can, however, use methods like this to get a rough idea of what to expect. Also please note that this is still a work in progress. If anyone has any ideas to improve this, please feel free to post them. 

I used the spreadsheet format and data from /u/dace 's original spreadsheet for simplicity sake. All credit on that portion of the spreadsheet goes to /u/dace. The new calculations are on a second sheet, labeled ""speed"" (Located at the bottom left of the page)

A quick rundown of what I did: I took each engine and converted it to a numerical value representing the total force being applied. Ex: a TR1 puts out 1 ton of force. 2 TR1s put out 2x1=2 tons of force. etc...

I then took the total force being put out by the ship and divided it by the total mass of the ship, giving the acceleration of the ship. This number by itself doesn't tell us much, but we can use it as a comparison tool. 

If we use the Aurora as the ""standard"" by which to judge the other ships, we can devise how fast they accelerate relative to the Aurora. I normalized the data to be a multiple of the Aurora, basically setting the Aurora to 1, and everything else being a multiple of 1. (Ex: The Aurora LX is 1.5 Aurora acceleration units, meaning it should, in theory, accelerate 50% faster than the Aurora)

Keep in mind that these numbers are *wrong*, but still provide some utility in terms of getting a ""general"" idea of how fast each ship might  be. Without real data on the output power of the ships engine and actual force produced by each thruster type &amp; model, we have no way of calculating with any real degree of accuracy.

[That said, here's the spreadsheet link](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=7F13F4B7AD74341F!118) - Direct link for clarity: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=7F13F4B7AD74341F!118

*edit: I've updated the spreadsheet to include the hypothetical speed of the available ships while under full cargo load (The p52 has no cargo capacity). *Keep in mind, there are two fields highlighted in yellow. the top reflects the theoretical acceleration vs an empty cargo hold aurora. The bottom section reflects the same comparison (vs an empty aurora) but compares the speed of your ship fully loaded with cargo.*

*edit2: **I've included a screenshot for mobile devices / other devices which might not display this spreadsheet very clearly.** [Here is the link](http://i.imgur.com/McieOj0.png)

*edit3: Just to clarify: This sheet does NOT represent each ships top speed. This is a chart showing the relative acceleration rates of each ship compared to the Aurora. If the aurora is a Ford Focus, and accelerates off the line like a budget car, you should expect, for example, the 350r to have 164.7% better acceleration. 

If we think of the Aurora as the the 2012 Ford Focus SE (0-60 time of 15.7 seconds), then the 350r would have a 0-60 time of 5.9 seconds, which puts it in in the performance car acceleration area. The m50 would have a very low 3.66 seconds 0-60, and the p52 an astronomical 1.92 seconds, a full half second faster than the Bugatti Veyron super sport.

1359417772.0,16,self.starcitizen,17gmnh,Shield Tech Ideas,19,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/17gmnh/shield_tech_ideas/,"How do we think shields are going to be implemented in Star Citizen? The way I see it there could be two core models for how shield generators are going to work specifically. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Percentage model:**

This is like a traditional health model. Shields will have 100% energy, and deplete as they are damaged. Once they are down, attacks begin damaging the hull directly. From here we have one of two options:

1)	The shield stays down for the duration of combat

2)	The shield is operating on an overheat mechanic and will regenerate after a cool-down.

**Mods under Percentage model:**

* Capacity (number of hit points)
* Heatsinks (cool down time after overheating)
* High heat alloy (Reduced odds of overheat damage)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overload model:**

In this model rather than having a percentage of hit points that are depleted, impacts on the shield raise stress on the shield. If the stress of the rating of the shield is exceeded then the shield overloads. This has one of two outcomes. It either overheats on a cool down before reactivating or is damaged (depending on how hard it was overloaded).

The way I envision this working is that any given shield generator is able to output a certain number of energy units per second. For example say a fighter shield has a capacity of 100 units and can regenerate at 20 units per second. 

Impacts from objects and weapons fire need to be able to take away those energy units faster than the shield generator can regenerate them, making shield removal about overloading them with sustained weapons fire (doing damage at more than 20 energy units per second, stressing the shield to overheat) or hitting the shield with such force that it drops the shield immediately (more than 100 units in one go which overheats or damages the shield generator).

**Mods under Overload model:**

* Generator (dictates output rate of energy units)
* Capacity (represents maximum energy unit pool)
* Heatsinks (dictates cool down time after overheating)
* High heat alloy (affects odds of overheat damage)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think that the overload model would be a better way to go as it reduces certain more silly circumstances, such as a swarm of fighters being able to whittle down the shields of something like a carrier. A carrier’s shield output would be such that you need some serious sustained damage output in order to overheat/overload it.

Both shield models of course are compatible with the concept of having multiple shield generators in larger ships so you could still have situations where you had managed to drop the shields on the starboard side of a target whist the target still retained shields over the other aspects of the hull. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Override mechanic:**

Another thought I have had looks to Mech Warrior Online for inspiration. Heat managment is at the core of gameplay there and whilst they dont have shields, a mechanic I quite like is an override mechanic. When the mech is overheated it shuts down to cool off, unless you override it. This regains functionality back for the pilot at the cost of heat damage to the components. I think this would be a nice touch to have in Star Citizen, for weapons and shields. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dump webs:**

Another idea which I cant claim to have come up with myself is that of Dump webs. Has anyone here read the Commonwealth Saga by Peter F Hamilton? The basic idea of this bit of tech was that you hit a shield with a device that would rapidly absorb shield energy. This energy would go into a large capacitor in the case of small shields, or with larger ones just dump the energy in a stream into the surrounding environment. The point of the device was to cause a massive draw on the shield generator and hopefully overload it. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this would be a neat kind of tech to incorporate into Star Citizen.  There would obviously have to be classes of dump webs. A web rated to handle the output of a fighter shield, might overheat and blow in a few seconds from the output a carrier produced for instance. 

I can imagine ships doing a fly over of a carrier, dragging the long filaments of a high capacity dump web across the shield before deploying it, and watching the light show across that section of the carriers shields.  Or in the case of smaller ships, firing a projectile which opens out into a web on impact with a smaller ship to start stressing the shields. I guess I am thinking about this as a kind of DPS alternative to EMP devices which are burst damage. 

Having Dump webs in Star Citizen could also add to the responsibility of a carrier’s fighters in a battle. Fighters would need to pick off the dump webs that ships have deployed, as well as try to shoot down the offending craft.

I want to build a preeminent community for all of us to enjoy, that will suit the needs of all of us and not just myself.

Thanks in advance for your input!",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_13qvve,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13qvve/roleplayers_what_do_you_want_in_a_community/,
1353656165.0,17,self.starcitizen,13nqn2,Handling player death (and potential boarding combat mechanics),24,7,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13nqn2/handling_player_death_and_potential_boarding/,"It's been brought up several times that, with boarding actions, player death is inevitable. People have suggested a technology that allows you to download your consciousness into a new body, allowing you to ""respawn"" (like Borderlands and many other games), but I don't think that sits well with the in-game fiction. You could also just be magicked back to life at a nearby space station with no explanation, basically saying ""No, it doesn't make sense. It's a necessary game mechanic, deal with it"", which IMO is better than forcing in a flimsy and poorly fitting justification that would weaken the overall integrity of the fictional universe.

But what if you didn't have to die at all? It's already been said that when your ship blows you'll be ejected into space, alive and intact*, so why not the same with boarding? Do boarding parties really have to execute you when they could just incapacitate you and throw your unconscious body out the airlock?

Suits could be made well armoured and highly resistant to gunfire, so that gunfire would cause severe injuries and incapacitating pain, but often** be survivable. The suits could be made self-sealing to take care of any bullets that do penetrate the armor, and a tough, opaque emergency visor would automatically seal the helmet if the glass breaks.

Incapacitation and subsequent jettisoning would mean hospital bills and suit repair/replacement would need to be paid upon rescue, but this would sidestep the problems with player death, replacing it with a nice in-fiction, non-immersion breaking game mechanic. Furthermore, the three mechanics of incapacitation by pain, incapacitation by trauma, and incapacitation by loss of helmet integrity open up a lot of design space that the developers could choose to explore (or not). If they wanted to have a straightforward, hp-based combat system, that would be easy to implement, but if not, I have some more ideas.

Perhaps the emergency visor has a pair of tiny 1x3cm windows that allow for minimal vision, so headshots could be used to (mostly) blind opponents in combat. Trauma could last until healed on a planet, space-station, or properly equipped starship, but pain would be transient, fading over time to a baseline determined by the level of trauma. Advanced suits could be customized with (expensive) consumable combat injections, like painkillers which reduce pain to keep you from passing out, but make your aim wobble and your movement sluggish. Adrenaline injections could briefly reduce pain and increase speed, but cause a ""crash"" after ~30 seconds severely reducing combat effectiveness. Illegal stimulants could have more powerful and more dangerous effects.

*though this may be subject to change, as all game mechanics are in this early stage

**Always survivable for player characters, due to their unaccountable luck.

I really *really* want a Cutlass. I'm a wanderer of the grey-area teetering toward the piratical side of things, always have been in these kinds of games and a Cutlass is just natural a great choice for my play style. However, I've noticed something that is rather troubling. 

Drake Interplanetary has been described as a company that puts out cheap, utilitarian ships. Where Origin produces BMWs, Anvil making Hummers, Drake is putting out the Hondas. Even interviews the Cutlass  has been colorfully described by the Devs as reliable, but not of the same quality as the 300 series or the Constellation and that was kind of ship the Drake was known for making. So the question has to be asked, why then is the only way to get the Cutlass through a $100 package?

Im not a marketing expert, nor do I know just how well or how poorly  its going to perform, but what really turns me off from it is the price tag to attain it. Why would I spend so much on a ship that has only been dismissed as the intermediate, econo-car of the starcitizen universe?

Instead of having this be something the developer makes, how about these be player created and purchasable in game. They would be like atlases to tell you about a system. When you first purchase a ship it could come with a very basic atlas of the most well known systems provided by the ship manufacturer. But then you could purchase after market ones made by players or exploration guilds that are tailored for your needs: someone could make one detailing some of the best mining operations, one detailing some the most profitable trade routes, or one focused on the lore of the game. 

This would also give these guilds something to constantly do as the game's landscape evolves. When a trade route stars being attacked by pirates, the guild could make a new version two of the atlas.

(Ideas inside)",17,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/12xbd2/am_i_wrong_to_believe_that_this_game_would/,"I spent my hour of getting back from  work to read up on Star Citizen and all the wonderful stuff that has been announced and one thing struck me as necessary yet missing: 

**A Mentor Program**

A way for* experienced players* to offer their time and knowledge *to the new, uneducated players* to explain them the game. Kinda like a tutorial, but **community-driven**, **dynamic** and with near **infinite possibilities**.

I got to this conclusion when I took a look at some of the stuff I know has been announced:

* Several Ship types with a TON of Upgrades, Modules, Weapons etc.

* Drastically different ways of playing the game, all intricate systems on their own

* Possibly a wide variety of movement-based tricks and maneuvers

* A huge economy

* PvP, Griefing, etc.

* Possibly confusing UI (see X Series)

* A huge universe, possibly intimidating

Now obviously there will be a tutorial, but we all know how **tedious** those can get and how many questions can go unanswered, especially if the questions arise later into the game (weeks, months, years even). Google helps alleviate some of the burden of knowledge, but I see a lot of potential in a mentor system. From my own experience in games like the X Series I feel that space sims in particular can be incredibly intimidating to new players, but also more experienced users that try to get into the more complex layers of the game.

---

Some of the **elements** I had thought of:

* Let players create **""Support Tickets""** ingame that can be filled out like a common support form of companies, which will place the request in the appropriate category, letting Mentors quickly browse the lists. These listings would only be up for a limited time to accommodate for their usually spontaneous creation.

* On the same note, let **Mentors ""offer"" their services** (free or for credits) in their respective fields of expertise on a public board - they should be able to offer very specific, specialized talents like advanced fighting or trading secrets here, which would appeal to other experienced players. These listings should stay up for a much longer time, since we're talking about specialized needs that may not get satisfied easily.

* Implement a **reward system** for good and active mentors that classifies them into different fields AND grades of knowledge. (Maybe displayable titles as well, or ship decals etc.)

* Set a specific **minimum level/game time/currency requirement for mentors**, to avoid trolling. Allow experienced mentors to issue warnings or even short bans to both horrible students (read assholes) and terrible mentors (read assholes).

* Further incentives for tutoring could be **percentage-based boosts** to income (or other game elements) for a short time, decals, accessories, you name it. Just make sure it's both worth the time the mentor puts into it and yet repels potential abuse.

* Elements that would greatly benefit tutoring would be **Voice over IP**, a way to **highlight/draw on the student's interface** or even **remote control**. These tools can be **restricted to higher reputation mentors if abuse is a problem**.

-----

A system like this, in my eyes, would benefit both new and experienced players by providing a flexible, human driven tutorial and general information network, while simultaneously turning knowledge into another tradeable resource for more experienced players, and especially for those with a very high level of expertise in certain game aspects.

This implementation could also **greatly benefit the grade of immersion, sense of community and therefore lasting power of the game**.

I want this to be a discussion thread, where we can come up with different ideas on the various ways we can earn credit on.  
The last part is a directly copypasta from Mordeth_Kai's post in the RSI forum.

## Asteroid Mining
The very first stage of asteroid mining would be to work for NPCs, use their equipments and tools, transport it yourself and get a share of their earnings.  
After you can afford your own builder unit, a unit which you control from your ship, that can build a temporary, portable base for mining and defense. You would need materials to build the base, of course, but the expenses to keep continuing mining could go in fuel, repair the drill, and any damage that happens to the buildings and the builder unit.

The ores and gas you extract from the asteroid will still be raw, so you would still need to take it to a mining company where they can process it for you.  
Others can attack your base and raid it for a certain percentage of what you’ve earned, though there won’t be any benefit for the attackers to destroy your base; for the sake of balancing, there shouldn’t be any benefit to destroy the base more than just raiding it.

The way I saw it is that you have stores controlled by NPCs where you sell and buy different materials, for a lousy price. Most of these stores can be bought out by players, and they can steer their own prices. Players would have to look up the stores and prices from the ship, sort of like an auction house, however, you need to travel to these places which means you need to decide on your best judgment whether it would be worth travelling to the store that buys or sells for the best prices. This also creates different markets for each galaxy, and traffic for those who owns a jump point.

Miners sell their raw materials to mining companies where they extract and convert them to processed materials, and the mining companies sells it to manufacteurs that produce components and aftermarket products, and lastly bought from stores with repair stations where players can buy from and put together their own space ship.

When it comes to transport, then you can buy services from either NPCs or players, where NPCs have a steep price while with players you have different prices by what they can offer for volume, protection and so forth. There should be some public statistics for how much success the players have in delivering the goods, where the value is taking into account aswell.
The players who transport goods should not have access to the inventory, however, they could still intentionally set themself to get robbed, but the public statistics should mitigate the distrust to the transporters. Though there could be hard for a newcomer to earn trust from those who buys such services.

## Dynamic Ship Design &amp; Construction
The vision I have for this would be to design the individual ship components then piece the ship together allowing for a variety of different components with their own pro’s and con’s in the development. Each component would have a size class associated with it so that a player doesn’t mix engines from a huge ship on a tiny fighter thats 1/4 its size. Basic ideas for the components would be the cockpit, the hull, engines, weapons, power source, and various ship systems. Each component would be given a size and weight factor as well as power draw, so that a ship design will be limited by its power source, and the weight of all the equipment balanced against the ships engines to determine speed and maneuverability. To truly spice it up, a component research system that will allow individual players to have their own unique ship parts (as far as stats go). By this I mean, gather the materials you want to use in the creation of a component, and based on the materials used a component will come up with random stats done by a R&amp;D computer with components being expended to create new designs. For example you might combine toss in 2 different materials to create a power source, each material with its own rating for conductivity, durability, and weight with each factoring in to a random end result so that if 3 designs were researched they would each have a different size, weight, durability, and power output with the overall numbers being equal if added together. At least that’s the basic idea if I am communicating it well. Such a system would allow merchants to have their own unique wares to sell to the local market giving a whole new factor for exploration and trade.

* LTI really won’t be all that valuable and you can’t get it anymore anyway.

* Most of the ships are going to have other variants that you’ll end up getting later in any case.

So other than getting a cool ship on the first day is there any reason I should buy something like the 325a on top of the basic package? (I’m probably going to die horribly very quickly anyhow. I used to go through a bil worth of ships in a day of playing eve).

Haven't played since the new scanning changes) scanning mechanics. If you're good and careful you can pretty well hide yourself away from the public in EVE. But if someone is a skilled scanner they can find you with enough patience. Someone who's skilled at escape will have no problem ditching a sub-par scanning ship pilot and they're less likely to be found in the first place if they've made good off-grid hiding spots outside of common traffic lanes. Likewise a skilled scanner who's quick with the scanning tools will have no problem pinning down the average pilot quickly. People of similar skill levels could have some pretty intense cat-and-mouse sessions.

I'd like like to see something like Asheron's Call content delivery system for the persistent world. There would be monthly patches with lore updates every time. Sometimes it would be a minor advancement of the story with no major, tangible effect on the game world.

Months down the road you'd see new NPCs setting up shops in tents around the destroyed town, slowly rebuilding.

We are hearing more and more about Star Citizen through multiple avenues. Lore, really high quality models and renders of ships, and even people now. What I would like to hear a bit more about is both the scale of planets and their appearance. If it is one thing that I always noticed about Freelancer, was that planets were bland and rather tiny. 

The first thing is that I would like to see planets on a decent scale, stars too for that matter. I want to be able to have a planet/star dwarf my view port as I am flying near it, with the horizon stretching out in all directions. Likewise it would be fantastic if stars at the centre of solar systems were of an appropriate scale, dwarfing anything else in the system and becoming more dangerous as players went within a certain range. 

I can envisage taking a fight nearer to planets or stars to raise the stakes, risking burning up in atmosphere, or overheating and burning up near a star. I am aware that atmospheric flight isn't on the cards for now, but the risk it poses could still be implemented as an improved version of what Freelancer showed. 

In addition it would be great if you could tell the difference between a highly developed planet and an undeveloped planet from orbit, seeing the cities on the night side of the planet, and perhaps even being able to tell something about the kind of development as Frontier entertainment are showing very nicely [here](http://gallery.mailchimp.com/dcbf6b86b4b0c7d1c21b73b1e/images/UrbanPatterns.jpg) ",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_19waj0,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/19waj0/planets_and_stars/,

1353352761.0,14,self.starcitizen,13gpqx,RSI Post-Campaign Text Wall,19,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13gpqx/rsi_postcampaign_text_wall/,"From the RSI website immediately after the end of the fundraiser period:

The battle is over and we - PC gamers, space sim fans, WingNuts, Lancers and the rest - have won. You've not only met every goal we set, you've exceeded them. Star Citizen will be released because of your dedication and your willingness to put your money where our mouths are. Our gratitude is immeasurable; we owe you our livelihoods and will not soon forget it.

The question is: what happens next?

Our intention has always been to make Roberts Space Industries YOUR site. It's not a public advertisement for the game; it's a private community for those who are making the game happen. We want your input on what we're doing and we want to share our plans with you; the occasional passer-by doesn't concern us. The plan was initially to immediately switch on a wall that would allow only you, our backers, to access features like the Comm-Link and the Spectrum Dispatches. Kickstarter has thrown something of a wrench in this plan: we can't change the site until the Kickstarter backers are integrated, which may take up to two weeks, otherwise we would be blocking thousands of backers from participating.

Updates and features will continue, returning to a regular schedule in the next few days. The team needs a few days to collect ourselves and reform before jumping into the immense task ahead (after the last month, our husbands, wives, children and yes, pets, miss us!) We will also be launching new sections which have been in the works for some time: the Galactapedia will tell you more about the Star Citizen world, Engineering will introduce you to game mechanics that are being planned and Holovids will offer you video footage from the game as it takes shape.

What about pledges? Good news: those of you who got in on the ground floor are covered. Your ships have lifetime insurance policies and for the next year you will have the ability to purchase further tiers or upgrade existing ones at the initial prices. That's not true of everyone else: if you want to back Star Citizen and participate in this amazing community, you still can. but it's going to cost you a little extra as of now, and you aren't going to have as many extras (no lifetime insurance, for example.)

One issue which concerns us is what to do with the funding tracker. So we're going to throw the issue up to you: in two weeks, when the wall goes up, what do you want to see done with the tracker? Without the 'push' of the campaign it probably won't update very dramatically. but it's always possible it will go up enough to reach future stretch goals anyway. Should we keep it, remove it or put it somewhere else? We'll let the community decide.

We also have previously outlined the 'behind the screens' subscription plans available now. They're designed for users who simply want to give us a little extra support during the development - you're getting the whole story, regardless - but we will have some extra fun for our monthly contributors.

We can't thank you enough for everything you've done for this project. Please see the next update on 'The Pledge' for our promise to you. The next two years are going to be incredible for all involved and we're thoroughly happy that all of you are along for this exciting ride.",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_13gpqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13gpqx/rsi_postcampaign_text_wall/,

I've read that autopilot will be the primary means of movement in your ship--but this doesn't make sense to me. How will exploration work, and why would there be such a focus on customization, thrusters, etc. if you don't get to do those movements yourself?

Is autopilot only engaged in jumping from system to system--as in, you autopilot between jump points, and once you get to a location, say a planet and its moons--you can freely explore around it to look for hidden jump points or other things?

Or is free movement solely limited to dogfighting?",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_1chh9l,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1chh9l/confused_about_autopilot_versus_free_movement/,

Our task definitions would fall mostly under ""Rampant Exploration"" and ""Expedient Threat Response"". 

Arbiter Legion is our name, and our goal is simple. We want coordinated, captivating fun without the douche-baggery and bravado that often accompanies online gaming these days. We'll be dabbling in every aspect, including harvesting, crafting, bounty hunting; but especially wide-spread exploration and fringe combat with a focus on protecting our allies and eliminating those that prey on the weak (hence the name of the group). Our crew consists of about 20 extremely long-time, dedicated gamers (without violating our lives and turning it into a second job, as many of us have hectic work schedules), and we want people we can count on, develop real friendships with, and rely on to have our backs, as you can rely on us to have yours. 

Our current roster is headed by an Idris Corvette as our first base of operations, one Retaliator, 5 Constellations, and a varied wing of the smaller vessels.

If this appeals to you, please send me a private message or visit the link below, and I will respond personally with information and updates. We have a website underway, various voice chat programs, and will be active on Reddit to help establish this game’s already amazing community.

If character customization options (I’m talking the physical appearance of your character) doesn’t suck, and the game delivers many of the features planned, then we are going to see some crazy shit.

In WoW I successfully ran an information brokerage, buying, selling, and trading information for in-game currency. At first I was doing the footwork myself, but later grew my guild and had many spies working for me. I would negotiate contracts with the customers, then assign and pay my people to gather the intel. At the height of our success we were making plenty of gold and having a pronounced effect on the politics and inter-guild relationships within the RP community. We planted moles everywhere, hired mercenaries for protection, and I’m positive it can be done again.  At its dirtiest, we matched clients with assassins to carry out wetwork. I swear just reading the feature list for this game I can already tell that all of this and more will be possible in Star Citizen.

* Can you imagine the value of a planned trade route that a mercantile clan is going to take through low security space to a pirate gang?

* What do you think a bounty hunter type player will pay for solid intel on where their target likes to hang out or who their friends are?

* That law enforcement guild (trust me, some people like to play the cops) will pay bank for the location of the secret pirate asteroid base and the weapons configuration of their cruiser.

Personally I would kill to see several large clans at war, and all the politics, intrigue, and awesome space combat that might result. I’ve never played EVE Online but I’ve always been jealous of how they were able to make an actual impact on their game world (way more so than WoW at least). I know in EVE that there’s all kinds of corporate espionage, scamming, and vicious backstabbing, and I expect we’ll see some of that in this game, but probably not prevalent.",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_13e7qi,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13e7qi/commentdiscussion_about_rp_potential_of_this_game/,

I played several hundred hours of flight and space sims as a kid, and several hundred hours of Escape Velocity (if you remember that one), and Star Citizen looks fantastic. It seems like it combines the two genres into one mega-awesome thing, which is great.

But it's also, seemingly, heavily monetized. People gave Marvel Heroes a raft because heroes cost upwards of $20... ships here can cost over a thousand! The cheapest ""entry level"" ship is $25. 

You all know a lot more than I about the game, I'm sure. But doesn't it seem a little excessive to you? Don't you think that's a pretty steep barrier of entry? And what about post-July 6th, when lifetime insurance is no longer an option, and some kid buys a ship for $40, flies it out of the hanger, and gets immediately blown to bits and is out $40?

**Edit:** Thank you for the facts and discussion, all! I didn't make this thread to argue or try and convince anyone the game is bad; rather, I wanted to be convinced myself since I was on the fence of whether or not to pledge. I am still unsure, but I have definitely learned a lot from the discussion here that I didn't know. 

One thing I can definitely say is that you lot are very confident in the makers of Star Citizen, which is great! I hope, whether or not I personally decide to pledge, that the game turns out wonderfully and validates the investments you all made.

Alrighty. Please correct me if I'm wrong:

As far as I know, SC is mostly about moving through space in your spaceship. If you imagine truly being inside one and controling it, the view you would have would probably consist of a window/transparent forcefield and some kind of 3D-representation of the surrounding Space.

The videos I saw, on the other hand, show the **ship in third person** - probably for a good reason:

just seeing what is going on inside the ship's bridge/control room wouldn't be as playable/fun as the 3rd person view. Being in a bigger ship and fighting another player while sitting in the captain's chair: I don't think this works. So how can 3rd person be kept without breaking true space-sim immersion?

(you may see by now: this is purely ""how to not break the fourth wall""-talk, or trying to find a way to legitimate a necessary game asset)

1. **camera drone**. A little thingy, flying around your spaceship, showing you what it sees (think cloud-guy in super mario 64). This would legitimate 3rd person, but probable itself become unrealistic (drone following through jumppoints? what happens when destroyed? moving as fast as ship? having to be refueled? etc.)

2. **Player view = 3D-representation**. As mentioned above, I'm imagining a hologramm on the bridge. Now what if whatever the player sees in 3rd person is a ""render of all ship-sensor-information"".

3. **Matrix uplink**. Similar to 2: A way to acces the ship's output directly, via neural network.

What are your thoughts? Worth discussing? Too insignificant to matter?

Please don’t take this post as some entitled gimme gimme post. It’s simply a fun idea that I hope is good enough that some dev might throw it in a file to use later.

Chris Roberts has said he’s a fan of other games like Dark Souls’s multiplayer features. I have not played it myself yet, but it’s my understanding that players are able to leave messages which other players can see in their own game. I think this mechanic is perfect for Star Citizen in the form of message buoys and beacons.

These devices would be of varying quality and sophistication, but at it’s most basic, the player could input a message into the message buoy and leave it in a system. The buoy would then broadcast it’s presence, and other players could locate it (by scanning) and read the message. These messages could be anything; warnings about pirate activity, other dangers, decoys, and traps.

Perhaps they could also broadcast to a more targeted group with encryption, like only to people in your guild, or only to non-pirates. To make things even more interesting, equipment could be used to hack and retrieve the encrypted messages (or edit them). Hacked buoys might fool some people and not others, depending on the quality of their scanning equipment and how smart the pilot is.

Decoy beacons could broadcast fake ship signatures to make it appear (as an electronic reading) that a ship was there. Decoys could also fool some types of missiles (obviously an image recognition missile isn’t going to be fooled by an electronic signature, but other types might be).

I think it’s obvious how interesting and exciting things could get with this type of mechanic in the game. It makes scanning equipment very important, provides huge potential for setting traps, sneaky escape tactics, and who knows what else.

To summarize, buoys are stationary messages that can be programmed and dropped. Decoys are mobile electronic countermeasures that broadcast fake ship signatures to fool long distance scanning.


Quick summary:

Message Buoys can broadcast messages, be encrypted and hacked.

Decoys can broadcast fake electronic ship signatures for tricks and ECM.

So, what are you going to use? The [Oculus Rift](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game) definitely looks like a fantastic piece of tech for this game, and if it lives up to its hype I'm sure plenty of us will be getting one.

What about HOTAS peripherals? I'm kind of hoping you guys can help me out here, as I bought a Logitech joystick for BF3 last year, and about 5 days after purchase the Z-axis bugged out. There seems to be a really ~~wanky~~ cool looking HOTAS system on [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1M995Mqr67E#t=572s) - does anyone know what it is?

On to my question: The kickstarter page clearly says ""No Pay to Win"", but when I take a look on the store page of the game I see there are ships for sale. What am I missing here?

**Edit:** It seems I sparked a discussion about ""what exactly Pay to Win means"". This was not intentional.

P2W isn't 1 specific model. P2W isn't inherently bad. I wasn't judging the decision to use this as means of funding the game.

P2W in its purest form means ""Money = Advantage"" in any way, shape or form. The only F2P transaction model that isn't P2W is going purely cosmetic. (like TF2, Dota 2)

I want to make clear I am a fan of ""grind reducing""-purchases like how eve works where you can get isk by buying ingame plexes, so I can get a new Hulk without having to mine for 15 hours. 

The reason this works in eve is because the game works in such a way that once you've progressed enough, the advantages you get by spending money become smaller and smaller up to a point, spending real money becomes useless unless you're making purchases for a few k at a time (this happens on eve, but won't be possible through the monthly-cap system Star Citizen will have).

The game seems designed to make death pretty painful from a credit standpoint.  If you don't have insurance you lose everything, if you do, you still lose all upgrades (unless you insure those as well) It sounds as if there could be significant waits to get your insurance ship replaced as well.
   Will the effect of this be that everyone is afraid to fight unless they have an overwhelming force behind them?  Will people attempt to flee combat as soon as they feel that the fight has turned against them?  While this is more realistic, it just doesn't sound like it will be fun.   I would like most encounters to end with ships being disabled or destroyed, but it seems that people are realistically going to try to avoid fights, especially pvp.  If people do engage in Pvp will there be a majority of players out of ships a few hours after the game releases waiting for insurance vessels to be built? Is that good for gameplay?

Since it seems a lot of people on this subreddit have sunk a good amount of money into ships and pledges. I'd like to know what your thought process was, how/why you decided to spend as much as you did, and in your opinion is the rear admiral pledge worth it.



~~Also I see that the pledge includes 10,000 credits. Are these only available when the game launches or can they be spent in the meantime.~~



 The starfarer is a tempting affair as well, I love the idea of being a space fueler for my friends/guild and making a fair amount of credits in the process. But $175 dollars for just a ship is a bit harder to swallow. ~~But if I could use my credits to supplement that I would jump right in.~~ **Edit 2.5** Would it be possible to melt down the connie you get in the rear admiral package? (Sacrilege I know but hypothetically)



~~Lastly are these ship prices going to remain at their level when the game comes out? I can understand higher process now due to early backers and the LTI but if these prices are steady for the released game then we would be asked to continually spend more on most ships then full games cost and I don't see how the credit to dollar ratio could support that.~~ **edit: Thanks for clearing that up Subhorror** That actually makes me feel a lot better about the finished product.

I bought the conny because I intend to crew the ship with the family - wife and two kids, boy 8 girl 10 ala Lost in Space style. The question came up about how much flexibility is there on who pilots the ship given that it will be bound to my account? Obviously if I'm not there they wouldn't have access to it - unless there was some sort of clan/guild/squadron hangar with free access to  ""clan"" ships. But if we were all playing and I needed to drop into the P52 could one of the other crew take over piloting? 

The other question was related to docking and switching ships in space - if we were on an escort mission and we had the conny and a couple 300i's of various flavors, and we had the proper equipment, would we be able to transfer ships?

And Option B has seen a fair share combat, has a few nicks in the paint, parts replaced, etc. Do you think there will be as much of a difference between these two ships as their history shows or will it go the simpler route where a ship is a ship.

I don't know the actual ship-to-planet size ratio is going to be, but I have an idea on how to make it work regardless.

**TLDR: Make planetary combat instances accessible via mission taken from planet/space-station**

As cool as it would be to fly directly from space into a planets atmosphere and do tasks/missions similar to that of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, it would require models of these planets to be literally as large and as detailed as a planet in real life... meaning totally impossible.

My workaround for this would be to have something similar to instances in mmo's. Basically you pick up the mission from the planet and instead of leaving for space from the docking bay, you get the option to go to the location designated in the mission dossier. Then it will have a much smaller and limited map where you will need to complete the objectives like in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.

Now there will have to be some function to keep the player from leaving the mission zone, either it be from going too far or too high. I suggest giving a warning saying that they are leaving the combat area, then when they do go too far, it simply warps them out of the instance. Spawning them just outside of the flyable zones in the persistent world of space around the planet.

Now, it may look like this feature will only work for fighter type ships. WRONG. Transport missions should also be developed. Whether they are troop transport missions or supply drops, they still sound rather fun . Also adding a multiplayer functionality to it would be awesome. Think of flying as a fighter escort while your friend is piloting the troop transport. Also adding a player operated opposing force would be cool too, but I can't really think of a way to incorporate that as the enemy player would first have to make it into the opposing forces airspace. And they would have no incentive to go there because what is happening is instanced, thus it has no real impact on the persistent universe.

Was hoping you could help me out with a few questions I had... I've never been as excited for a flight sim before as I am with Star Citizen, and I'm looking to get into playing some of the older ones to sort of ""train"" myself on a HOTAS before SC comes out. Here's the issue though:

I don't have a setup (or ""simpit"" if you will) ... I already know which HOTAS I'm going to buy, did a fair amount of research and settled on one that I think fits me well. Now the only problem I'm having is where to put the thing. As it stands right now, my PCs main display is a 46"" TV in my room, and I use my bed as a chair. I'm sure you can see how uncomfortable that would become using a HOTAS setup... Odd angles, unstable surfaces, etc. So obviously I'm going to need something [like this.](http://www.playseat.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/20/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/_/1_13.jpg)

Except since I'm not an absolutely insane person and money *is* an object, I'm not going to buy one of those. So I stumbled upon [this guy](http://www.gettington.com/product/pedestal-video-chair/nq123.uts?CTid=1131&amp;CTKey=GTNPLA&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=4NQ1230000010) and thought ""Wow, the price is great, it looks comfy, it sits high enough off the ground, looks great!"" Except then I realize that I'd still have nowhere to put the HOTAS. I'm trying to find something similar to that, but with trays on both sides instead of armrests so I can put my throttle/joystick on each side.

After countless hours of searching, I've found **absolutely nothing**. I can't even find a damned *office chair* that has optional tray attachments, even if I have to buy them separately.

Do you guys have any suggestions on something I could get? It's worth noting that I've already got a decent surround sound setup in the room, so I would prefer something that *does* ***not*** have speakers built in, since I would assume that'd drive the cost down a little bit.

So, how about it? What've you guys got?

Chris Roberts:

Everyone please bear with us. We're very committed to making the RSI site an awesome community experience. We know that things have been hardly rosy of the last few days, but we've been switching out servers and will be moving over to both more robust forums and will probably ditch Wordpress in favor of a faster solution (just not yet). While this is happening there will be some instability, but its for the right reason! Having a robust and strong community site is really important for me.

On the Kickstarter issue - I love Kickstarter and have backed quite a few projects on it. It wasn't about the 5% at all, which I think is very reasonable for the service they provide and I love that they put crowd funding of games on the map. The reason we made the choice we did was twofold -

1) So the 30,000 members of RSI at the time of announcement wouldn't have to go to a separate site to pledge and then have to connect that account to their RSI account.

2) To allow the sizable contingent of fans outside the US to have other options than having to use an Amazon account, which can be a roadblock for a non US resident.

At the end of the day it was all about trying to make the experience as seamless and friction-less as possible. It didn't work out that way and for that we're sorry. If you would like to also see us on Kickstarter we're happy to provide that as an option as well. Its really about making everyone as comfortable as possible.

Does anyone know if we will be able to test fly prospective new ships in some fashion or another? I can think of some ways it could be implemented, and I'm sure you guys have better ones.   

**Dealership**: Go to your local Origin Jumpworks or whatever, and have some Slick Willie salesman take you out for a spin and let you perform some rudimentary controlling of it in designated space.  

**Dealership:** simulator... same as above but they sit you in a mockup cockpit in the showroom and walk you through it and then let you drive it as hard as you want without risk to yourself, others, or hardware.   

**Shipboard simulators:**  for those larger ships with onboard pilot lounges etc  

**Planetside entertainment establishment/arcade:** also could use simulators or dealers could have them set up there too  

**Private sales:**  allowing someone interested in buying your ship to fly it first     

**Offline mode/non PU:** available in the store to buy ships, the ability to fly them first in a static offline/non PU envirionment to get a feel for the controls etc    

**others?**

Of course, NPC's are going to have a lot of Starfarers - but it will be just as likely that the economy is going to need container ships (big ones) to keep itself moving.  Now, I'd love to own a Bengal... but just think about the power you would wield with a Emma Mærsk class container ship - 397.71m long x 56.40m wide x 30m from deck edge to keel.  With a capacity for 156,907 DWT you could break the economy of just about any system with a single run.

Are ships like this going to exist in the game?  It would make sense to have very large cargo ships, after all.  If ships can be built on the scale of the Bengal for warfare, then a ship less than half the length could easily be built as a merchant.

Of course, it would probably need a fleet of escorts...",,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,t3_1idbls,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1idbls/an_observation_about_the_economy/,
