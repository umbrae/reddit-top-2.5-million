1370629386.0,91,self.selfimprovement,1fvlk8,"How my Dad taught me to be angry all the time, or how to teach your kids how to be angry all the time.",109,18,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1fvlk8/how_my_dad_taught_me_to_be_angry_all_the_time_or/,"My Dad,

I remember my Dad pointing to a breadcrumb on the table and saying there are millions of atoms in the smallest crumb I could see, I remember after failing to teach my 5 year old younger brother to recognize yellow he dumped the yellow bowl of Cheerios on his head, mostly I remember my father’s anger. 

He was always passionate about something from the way other drivers obeyed the rules of the road to perceived slights to his authority. His anger came out in everything he did. 

-He framed a closet in our first house. Something upset him and he threw a 2x4 through the newly hung sheetrock. 

-My mother upset him over something. He had her on the couch choking her until I came up and slapping him said in my best 5 year old anger to not hurt my mommy. He stormed out and drove away.
 
-From my earliest memories, my Dad was a horribly aggressive driver. Often screaming “Fuck you Fred”, his pet name for other drivers,. He always took turns very fast, passed people uphill on two lane roads in the dark, around corners. The road between his parents’ house and where we lived invariably went through Noel Missouri. This road was two lanes, carved into the side of very steep cliffs, always at night, always hilly, always would have someone driving at a reasonable speed to slow us down and anger my Dad. I would handle this by sitting white knuckled trying to keep my eyes on the road looking for danger until I realized I was of no use in this situation. I then began curling up on the floor board of the back seat with a blanket over my head to try and stop thinking about how dangerous this situation was. This part happened while I very young, possibly 5 years old, every time we drove to my grandparents home.

-Responding to what he rightly perceived as me bullying my younger brother, my Dad picked me up over his head and body slammed me on the living room floor. Maybe 6 years old. N. 28th street.

-After telling me I couldn't string Christmas lights in the bookshelf, I did anyway because I thought it would look nice and he would like it. He grabbed my hair and pulled me up the stairs to my room holding only my hair then whipped me with his belt. Maybe 8, Wallace court.

-My Dad said he had mentioned he wanted me to sweep the leaves off the cement back porch. I had never been tasked with this before and did not do it. At 11pm I was woken up by my Dad whipping me across my back, butt and legs with his leather belt. I was wearing only the white brief underwear we commonly wore to bed. After sufficiently punishing me and putting me into an extreme degree of panic, he sent me outside with a broom to sweep wind-blown leaves off the cement back porch. It took only a few minutes. 9 yr old Wallace court.

-He didn't want the next door construction site to use our water, so he cut the water hose into 1 foot pieces and brought it over to the foreman in a box, looking for a fight. His finger was crushed and had wire wrapped around it so the pieces would heal together, this left him with an index finger with a bit of the wire sticking out the tip constantly pointing. In a bar he became upset with someone and punched them with that hand. 12 years old, Louisville.

-I was failing multiplication and had a skewed view of the importance of math at the time I was 11. My Dad whipped me, then put me in a room for an hour with the 1-12 multiplication table and said if I didn’t have it down in the next hour he would whip me again then give me another hour to correct my failure. This would repeat until I learned multiplication. I was only whipped twice. 11 years old, Louisville.

-My parents fought a lot. I was never able to discern who started or caused it. However my Dad became angry easily and often. At night I would hear them screaming at each other. It made my stomach hurt. I tried the hide under a blanket thing like I did when he drove but it didn’t help there either. 

-My mother had just made dinner and brought it to the table. Dinner was often uncomfortable when Dad was angry. Whatever it was that angered him I have forgotten. I am sure it was a disagreement with my Mom. He picked up a ceramic bowl holding the scrambled eggs Mom had made and threw it across the room at a high rate of speed. It exploded like a bomb, glass fragments and egg everywhere, only a few feet from me. This scared me very much. 11 yr old, Lousiville. 

-He became angry at his girlfriend who he had slept with while married to my mother and his best friend’s wife and while driving punched out the windshield of the car (actually got his hand all the way through the glass), while it was moving. 

-My next youngest brother were in a canoe side by side with my Dad and youngest brother on a small river float trip. The sun was behind my Dad, I turned to him and squinted my eyes to see him. He leaped out of his canoe grabbing me by the head. He pushed me underwater and rapped my head against a rock, then only holding my head threw me back in my canoe. He told me no son of his would ever look at him that way. 

-While returning from a New Year’s eve party with his nieces, after leaving me at 13 in charge of 11 children, he came home very drunk. Talking insensibly and very aggressive, he put me in a headlock in front of everyone. No one stopped him from choking me, he eventually loosened his hold but maintained the headlock for 20 minutes or so. When I escaped crying I ran outside into the night and promptly got lost for 2 hours in the unfamiliar neighborhood. Returning I found my father asleep on his host nieces bed with his pants around his knees. He had urinated on her bed then fell asleep on the same bed.

-When driving back with my Dad from the funeral for his mother (Oklahoma to New York state), I asked to stop to call my girlfriend who was kind of along the way, perhaps a 5 mile detour. He agreed. We stopped, I called from a payphone, she wasn’t home. I returned to the car to say I would just continue with him back to the house. He became angry and peeled out of the gas station, shifting from 1st to 3rd before we were out of the parking lot. We had his 17 year old pregnant stepdaughter and her boyfriend in the car as well. I asked him to please let the kids out then he and I could accelerate into a bridge as far as I was concerned. Or he could stop, or he could talk about his feelings, or any fucking thing else but he was going to let the kids out right fucking now, however the fuck he chose to go about it. He did slow down. An hour later, he mumbled the only apology I have ever received from him about anything. I was thirty something.

-Getting whipped by my Dad was made up of a few steps. One I was made aware it was coming usually. Two he was very angry and scared me with the overt hostility on his face before he touched me. Three he would grab me by a wrist and pick me up in the air. Four he would unbuckle his heavy leather belt with one hand pulling it quickly through the loops. The sound is distinctive. Five he would begin striking me with the belt typically between the middle of my back and my knees. Sometime with clothes on, often only in my underwear that was my common uniform. Six depending on how angry he was I would be struck 10-20 times with a force great enough to leave welts and bruises. Only occasionally would the impact draw blood.

-Being struck by my Dad would usually include an open hand or whatever he was holding at the moment. This was usually a knee jerk reaction due to how he perceived my insult/ignorance/lack of attention. Typically would number less than 10 strikes, 30 minutes of verbal direction before and after.

These are significant pieces of my past that shaped the person I am. The distance I have come from the delusion this is normal to semi lucidity is huge.  I have had to redefine myself so many times I have lost count. There are parts of my past I emulated these behaviors, I am too ashamed to think about now. 

I am always angry, about everything, all the time, every single day of my life. Some of it helped me when I had to work through tough times while in the military or in the war on everything my twenties and thirties became. Rage was a huge asset then. It has taken a large portion of my life. I don’t trust or respect authority. When I do react to authority, I have to fight the urge to cower to them or undiluted hostility with no grey areas. I am bad at relationships. I am hyper sexual. I am hyper aware of my surroundings, other peoples moods, unable to relax and get drunk in public or just hang out with a group without identifying the first person/threat I will mitigate if the situation merits it. 

I am angry with how he treated me and the effects it had on my life. I am angry how he hurt my brothers, my mother and others. I am angry no one stood up to him for us ever, except once by my 90 year old great grandmother that I experienced directly. 

This began as a list of things I remembered. I don't know what it is now. But it needed to be written down once. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I will not be surprised if during treatment it was due to this man. 

These are things that came to mind over a day and a half between tasks at work. I am positive there were many more. I have no idea where, how or if this information is relevant. I kind of want the reddit light to shine on my little piece of darkness and get some thoughts. 

I am not seeking pity and have coping skills now, for varying degrees of coping. I have just never spoken of this with anyone other than those involved and to a lesser degree each of my three ex wives. 

Thanks for reading my wall of nonsense.

1358650315.0,60,self.selfimprovement,16wrm2,The eye opener - my story and what has been working for me. ,71,11,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/16wrm2/the_eye_opener_my_story_and_what_has_been_working/,"SelfImprovement, I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post this, but Hell, I'll share it anyway. I apologize for any length or rambling, but I'm motivated now. 



I originally decided to organize the reddits I was subscribed to in order to make my life just that, organized. I went over a list of things that I knew I didn't like or want to see(ex: gaming, atheism, politics, pics, etc) and started browsing around for things I knew I would love to see that would make me enjoy spending my time on the internet(ex: movies, TIL, Bestof, etc). 



I found something on /r/QuotesPorn that legitimately changed how I viewed life. Let me tell you something, at my wise old age of 23, I didn't think that anything on the internet could change how I viewed life. It was a quote. 



""Someone once told me the definition of Hell: The last day you have on Earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become."" - Anon




That quote went deep for me. It made me realize I was depressed and that I wasn't living life, I was waiting to die. I didn't have a job because all my self worth was tied in a job I had been laid off from nine months ago. On the back of that, it made me think about who I could be. I've been employed for about a week and a half now. It is just at a coffee shop, but fuck, I feel so good being on my feet for five hours a day and I find myself thankful that sitting down is now the best part of the day instead of the only part of the day. I'm slowly becoming more social and I was walking home from work yesterday afternoon and I had the biggest grin on my face because I realized that I was getting better and that my life just started to click. I can honestly say that it was the best feeling I've ever had.  




Anyway, I thought I'd share a list of things that I've started recognizing and doing over the past three months. I want to note here that this is just a list of things that worked for me. Since you're probably way different, it might not all work. You know, it is personal or something. 



1)Recognize all the negative impacts in your life and be thankful for them. All the asshole roommates, past friends, exes, bosses, whatever. They've given you more character than you could ever imagine. Those fights where you really had to stick to your moral guns have given you character. They've tested your metal and you've survived. After those encounters you realize what you want in all of your relationships – personal, professional, romantic. Because you know what you want now, you can search for it and attain it. You can now confidently say what you like and you know how to defend it.



2)Be Humble. You're no better than anyone and no one is better than you. This is always true. You don't get to decide who is better or worse than you. Life treats everyone equally, you should try to do the same too. 



3)Let the journey happen. Don't get caught up in the big picture as you'll end up painting it no matter what.  The little things are what make life worth living. The three in the morning coffee from a diner with friends. The five minute conversations on the bus, at bus stops, waiting in line, before class, are all worth it. Your scars, crooked smile, and little imperfections aren't imperfections at all, they're what make you perfect.



4)Talk to everyone. Fucking everyone. Those five minute conversations? They really are worth it. People aren't scary and not everyone is going to try to murder you for asking how their day was or for seeing if they are enjoying the weather. I think a good example of this is something that happened to me the other day. I was waiting for the bus and someone came up. I asked him “What's your major?” He says “Marketing.” and looks at me like I should ask another question. I just say “that's all I had man.” and we start laughing about the single question and then he asks me about my major and he replies to me with the same. 



5)Find what you enjoy and fucking immerse yourself into it. Hobbies are pretty killer and help keep it real. No one will have time to judge you if you're passionate about something. If you can talk about something with passion, anyone listening will listen to you like they need to start doing what you are. Why? Because if something can inspire you that much, chances are it can inspire someone else. On the back of that, everyone is passionate about something. That alone connects everyone.



That depression I mentioned earlier? It is still there and I'm still working on it. I hope one day it falls into just memories of things I'm thankful for, that helped make me a better person. 



That's all I have for you. I'd like to thank one of my friends for inspiring me to write this up. Without him saying “we need more lexington_steel's in the world” I would have been an asshole and kept this wealth of information to myself. 



Thanks Reddit, I love you guys.

1363331788.0,54,self.selfimprovement,1ac7jy,My complete lack of self-control is ruining my life. How do you improve on such a fundamental flaw?,59,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ac7jy/my_complete_lack_of_selfcontrol_is_ruining_my/,"Ever since moving back home after graduating from college (9 months ago) I've been in a terrible rut. I need to find a job, keep my programming skills sharp, lose weight, and break a few pesky habits. Instead, I spend most of the day on the internet doing nothing productive. I'm probably being about 5% as productive as I could be, and the effects are really starting to accumulate as the weeks and months pile on. 

The thing is, I know what I need to do to succeed, and if I saw someone else posting this, I'd probably tell them to take their goals more seriously, break them up into manageable chunks, record their progress, etc. I know all that. What I don't know is how to control myself in the moment and resist the temptation to just go on YouTube or Reddit instead of doing something productive. 

Let me take you through a typical day. I set my alarm for 9:00 AM, but my sleep quality is usually so bad that I hit the snooze until 11 or 12. I reluctantly get up, check Reddit and a variety of other sites, then take a shower where I vow to do some serious job-hunting, eat right, etc. It all seems so easy and attainable at this point. Then I go straight to the computer where I'll surely do something productive, but first, let's check the news, and maybe some tech sites, and maybe Reddit again. All through this time, I know in the back of my mind that I need to be doing other things, but I'm always under the illusion that I'm going to do them ""in a little bit"". By the time night comes, I realize that I've wasted most of the day, and I spend an hour or two finally being productive. I then realize I should go to sleep, so that I don't make my sleeping habits even worse, but I can't fall asleep for hours, because I keep stressing about how unproductive I've been, how I've wasted the last 9 months, how the future is so uncertain, etc. Because of how crappy my sleep is from worry, I of course hit snooze for 2 hours the next morning, and the cycle repeats. It's really a nightmare, and the worst period of my life that I can remember. 

As you might have guessed, right now I'm in the ""stressed out at night"" phase of the day, which is why I'm writing this. Tomorrow morning, I'd like to think that I'll do some programming, apply to some jobs, stick to my diet, and do all the right things, but I know my state of mind too well to be that naive. How on earth do you solve a problem as fundamental as poor self-control? How do you break a daily cycle like this when you have the weight of a hundred failed days behind you to break your confidence in succeeding? 

tl;dr: How does one tackle the problem of poor self-control? 


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great advice! I didn't expect so much. My friend needed me to help him with his house today (which was a great change of scenery and really lifted my spirits) but that's why I didn't get a chance to read and respond to everything. I will do that tomorrow and maybe compile a list of the main ideas brought up here, for my own reference, and for future readers who might identify with my problem. 


**2 months later EDIT:**

I'm not sure if anyone will come across this post anymore, but here's an update anyway. I started running every day, about 2 miles a day average, and going to the gym. I've been doing this for the past month. I haven't lost any weight, but I haven't gained any either, so that's good. More importantly, running has helped even out my mood throughout the day and I just generally feel better for doing it. I also dug up an old programming project I was working on and have been working on that for a few weeks. The biggest news, however, is that exactly a year since graduating college, I got a job offer! I don't start for another couple weeks, but it's a pretty good job with good pay, and it's a two hour drive from home, so I'm moving away, which I really wanted to do. 

Overall, things have improved greatly, and I wish I could sum up what I did in a single thought, but these things are always hazy in retrospect. I did notice that starting a good habit takes alot of initial energy, but once you get going, it gets easier and easier. I also was suffering from the mentality that my real life hadn't started yet and I needed to improve myself in all these ways in order for it to begin. That's a horrible and destructive way to think, because you imagine yourself in a prison and can become consumed by helplessness and despair. Embracing the present and its flaws put me in a much healthier and more productive state of mind, where I was not too overwhelmed to make real changes. 

2 months ago I would not have imagined it possible that things could improve, but they did. I really didn't think I had it in me, but apparently I did. Keep that in mind if you feeling that same despair and hopelessness.

* Don't live in the past or in the future, for they are illusions. Only the present moment exists.
* Don't identify with material possessions, physical body or thoughts, for to identify is to create separateness between you and the whole.
* Don't judge anything that happens, for the outer world doesn't determine your happiness or unhappiness. You do.
* Don't take life too seriously, you will not get out of it alive anyways.
* Always stand up for what you think is right.
* Always see the good everyone, every living being has an entire hologram of the universe within them.
* A warrior may worry and think before making a decision, but once he makes it, he is on his way, free from worries or thoughts.
* A warrior takes full responsibility for his acts, the most trivial of his acts.
* Trust the process
* The secret to fulfillment is to grow and give.
* Let your ambitions, passions and sense of adventure determine your every move!

So I hope this post gives someone else encouragement. I've recently decided to change myself in many ways. The other day I noticed a rather unlikely couple and my first thoughts were all negative. She must have poor taste, he must have something going for him big time (pun intended). My thoughts were jealous and petty. 
I thought how can I not be so jealous? But i realized that jealousy is a human response to things, it's normal. It's how you deal with that jealous energy that defines you. I've never considered myself to be a good looking person. I'm muscular and fit , but to my eyes i'm goofy and awkward. It's that self image that caused me to have ill feelings for that couple. I'm finding new ways to channel my anger, and turning my doubts into confidence. 
It's a pretty simple catharsis I think. When i'm very angry instead of swearing and getting belligerent, I compose an insult but replace the swears with fruit names. This is the silliest thing but it can snap you out of a rage real fast calling someone a cantaloupe sucking apple hat. 
I've also added various work outs to my anger spells. If I get upset over something stupid, like a video game I do 25 push ups or some crunches jumping jacks etc. 
I'm laughing more, smiling more and most important i'm happier and my friends see that. I'm also getting some looks from the girls that I never got before. 

I can't say that this will work for every situation and each person is different but i'm finding inner peace with this silly routine and I thought I would share it with the world.

The last few nights I've been out drinking, I've found myself sneering at a lot of people and making biting comments towards them; just treating people as inferior in general. It got really bad last night. I almost punched out my friend's brother because he teased me lightly, and I basically changed the entire mood of the room from happy to deadly serious in about two seconds. The girl I've been seeing was pretty shocked because she thought she was getting a really nice guy, and I'm shocked too.

I apologized profusely that night, and we're cool now, but I have to tone down my drinking to make sure I can still think before I act and keep a handle on my emotions.

**How do I identify and fix what needs to be improved upon in my life?** I'm not talking about the obvious things like study habits and working out.

This prevents me from telling stories because i just lose everyone's interest. sometimes i start a word, say it again, say a synonym then give up completely and never finish my sentence. mostly i just put up with it but the time that it really presents a problem is in one of my classes which is virtually all presentations and i lose a lot of points in the delivery aspect whenever i do mine. it makes me seem nervous even when i know i'm not. to throw another wrench in the gears, if you get me talking about something i'm really passionate about, like guitar or music or something and i can talk fine.

As many of you all know, I have been deeply immersed in self improvement topics for the past year or so. Through my blog, I have tried to reach as many people as possible, but alas my writing style and lack of experience often do not provide as much assistance as I would hope.

Therefore, I want to work WITH the Reddit self improvement community in order to develop a valuable quarterly magazine that is filled with submissions from you all. It would be a group project for the Reddit self improvement community and anyone who wants to help is welcome.

The next step for this to become a reality are as follows:

1.	Garner enough interest among the Reddit community to choose a name for the publication, create a website, and prepare to accept submissions (finalize what this magazine will be)
2.	Open up submissions for self improvement topics, such as willpower, meditation, diet, and a variety of others
3.	Create the first issue with Reddit contributors (designers and content providers)
4.	Start a Kickstarter project to raise money for the first printing
5.	Print and promote

So everyone knows, I have no stake in this with no advertisers lined up or any way for me to personally benefit. I’m going to make this as democratic as possible, though I will play a significant role in editing as I will spend a considerable amount of time writing and reading submissions in order to organize them. 

If you guys are interested in this, please either message me or post here and we can create either a subreddit for ourselves or a skype group to hash out the specifics. Thanks!

TL;DR: Collectively, you and I are creating a Reddit self improvement magazine composed of submissions from the community that will initially be funded by Kickstarter. (No monetary gain for myself)

I've recently really been focusing on the areas in my life I want to improve, might have slight inferiority complex",21,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/156xch/just_found_this_ive_recently_really_been_focusing/,"Mainly all my troubles revolve around love/relationships/sex/etc.

I grew up in a single parent home as an only child. I saw both my parents but being raised by my mom who never really dated, and neither did my dad, even when they were separate, left me with just about nothing to imitate as far as relationships, I also had several friends with split families and some with normal marriages. 

So seeing as I've pretty much had to learn everything on my own by trial and error. This area has never been very easy for me. As a result I've developed some insecurities, some social anxieties and even a slight inferiority complex. And I want to change this. I also have a problem linked to all this stuff in porn and masturbation but I won't blab on about that because I already go to r/noFap for that

So, I guess to mainly speak out on my main 3 things I mentioned. 

I've always been insecure, physically and mentally, more mentally. It started as a kid when I would get made fun of for being a little fat in elementary school. I got picked on and bullied a lot starting in the 2nd or 3rd grade. Mainly 3rd. In the 2nd it started because in 1st grade they labeled me as ""above average"" in how I learned, so they wanted to move me up a grade, so I went to a second grade class and at that age even a year age difference makes everyone seem eons older. So I ended up bitching out of the class and staying in first grade. Then when I went to second grade I had the same teacher and in that class was this kid was was still there because he got held back and I guess he remembered me from I got pushed up and I guess he felt threatened by me or something. Anyways, he didn't pick on me much then but that's when stuff started. Then in 3rd grade a bunch of random kids in my class really started to lay in to me and I honestly can't remember why. But they messed with me all year and that was probably the start of much of my problems in the head. I eventually started going to see a family counselor because as nice as my mom was she didn't know how to deal with everything. I still go see him once in awhile these days and I've talked to him about my problems too. So being tormented early on caused me to just retreat and hide away and always made me shy towards people and women too. And ever since I've always had these terrible anxieties about people. Even though I stand 5'11 and 160lbs. I feel at times that people just stare at me every where I go and that everyone is judging me and looking down on me, or like everyone can see all my deep dark secrets, it's not every where but being in public can be very gut wrenching at times. Not that I'm a shut in but I worry way too much about people around me

This ties in to anxiety. I really worry way too damn much about what people think about me, whether it be strangers, my mom, my best friends, anything. Not that I do everything to impress, but lately I find I can't have fun with some of my most treasured hobbies and free time activities because for some shitty reason I worry too much about how someone might think about me doing said activity. Kind of a split mindset inside. I don't want to turn in to an asshole and just forget at all about considering others but I am definitely not considering others in a good extent. This anxiety has been so bad that it rubs off on my relationship mind sets as well, maybe I'm more shallow then I'd like to admit or maybe watching too much porn has warped my mind but there have been some instances where I have turned down women who I actually found attractive and had great personalities, the kind of girls I would easily go with and could be happy, just because I have this horrible deep fear that people will judge me because that person doesn't meet their standards of attractiveness or standards or personality and that's horrible. I shouldn't at all worry about that. In those cases, my opinion would be the only one that mattered. And yet my mind gets so cluttered with all the thoughts of ""what if he thinks"" or ""what if they look at me funny"" when in reality, when I come out to my friends about something I think they would judge me for, they are usually very encouraging and feel that I just worry too much so I know it's not just me.

The last thing is the inferiority complex. With all this avoiding stuff and thinking too much about others, I think I've started to worry too much about sacrifice and just pleasing others, and as a result, i've started to view pleasing myself in anyways as bad. ie: ""oh i like this, or ive done this thing I think is good but there's probably someone out there who has a negative opinion towards what ever this thing is so I shouldn't feel happy about it""

That's stupid, I want to stop this and all this backwards overthinking bullshit in my head. I want to retrain my mind to just be happy with what I do and like what I like and while I can accept and try different things. I don't have to bend to personal differences just to appease people I may never even meet that's just stupid and I definitely don't have to please my friends, that's why they are friends, we all accept each other for the way we are and that's that.

That's all I have right now but maybe others can relate. Good luck to anyone else trying to improve",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_156xch,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/156xch/just_found_this_ive_recently_really_been_focusing/,

How does one improve?,26,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/14wx50/issues_with_low_selfesteem_and_clingyness_how/,"I grew up with the real-life equivalent of the asian father meme. My parents began trying to teach me math, reading, and science at a fairly young age. They had high expectations for me throughout school: if I got an A, why didn't I get an A+? If I got a 98, why did I get something wrong? Up until high school I would spend Sunday-Thursday studying, reading, and putting way too much time and effort into projects. If something needed to be done, why was it not done already? While I appreciate that they wanted me to do well, almost two decades of this before they began to ease up has really worn down my self esteem.

Whenever I try to do things, these expectations permeate my thoughts. I mentally beat myself up over every single mistake. I have trouble enjoying the things I want to do because I'm so critical of myself. The ""journey, not the destination"" phrase is something I'm seemingly incapable of embracing as I try new things.

A few months ago, I got into a relationship with the person who I thought of as my best friend. We got along well... until my low self-esteem caused me to feel that I wasn't good enough, and so I'd start clinging more and more to them. Obviously this is annoying, and it eventually got to the point that we completely stopped talking. Having pushed away someone who was once my best friend has made me realize that I really need to change.

It seems like this all stems from that low self-esteem. My thoughts that I am not good enough cause me to cling for validation. I get paranoid that people hate me and avoid me, only being nice when around me because of my fragility. And no matter how much they seem to do or how much I try to convince myself otherwise, I cannot seem to avoid these fears. As such, I'm unable to trust my friends on these topics and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.

I'm really not sure how to deal with this. It's not like learning a form of math or other academic subject, and so I am confused how to improve myself. I'm not happy with how I constantly feel, and I am not happy with how I am thinking about and treating those who mean a lot to me.

If anyone has suggestions on how to deal with my self-esteem and clingyness issues, I would be very thankful to you.",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_14wx50,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/14wx50/issues_with_low_selfesteem_and_clingyness_how/,

Let us compile a list of things to do for yourself!,21,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/uov5x/happy_this_subreddit_is_here_let_us_compile_a/,"So I am starting on a journey of self improvement. I am young, I still have much time I think. So let us compile a list of things you can and should do for yourself, sorted by importance and difficulty with links to important material. But let us avoid unnecessarily long texts. I start!

**Elementary**

* Eat healthy - You are what you eat, that is, you should eat lots of fresh vegetables, fruit but spare the carbohydrates

* Exercise - It does not have to be a gym, but strength training, endurance training or even going for a long walk are excellent for your health

* Dress well - You want to look like the person you are or want to be. Looks are, like it or not, the first thing people see of you.

* Read - Be it a newspaper, a fictional book or a non-fictional book. It expands your mind, presents you new viewpoints and improves attention.

* Sleep well - This means sleeping enough, sleeping in a good bed and going to sleep at an consistent time. Sleep helps you in every way and almost anything you do for your health is also good for your sleep.

**Intermediate**

* Meditate - By no means necessary but very good for your mind. It will literally change your brain.

* Voice training - It is much more enjoyable to listen to a nice voice, be it male or female. I mean here really only your voice, not your speech, that is a matter of its own.

* Time management - Your day only has so many minutes, learn how to use them properly.

* Assess yourself - That means tracking how well you do, be it your finances, weights you lift, miles you run or whatever.

* Learn to cook - It may be nice to make noodles or something, but a nice meal made yourself will be really tasy and can be made to suit any tastes.

1351218930.0,19,self.selfimprovement,123qiz,I ditched some terrible people and influences and have nearly completely changed my life around. ,20,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/123qiz/i_ditched_some_terrible_people_and_influences_and/,"Hi Reddit. There is a TL;DR.

I play the guitar. Religiously - as if my life depended on it. My best friend for a decade introduced me to the instrument and it is as important to me as breathing or as smooching my girlfriend. I need to play guitar. I need to be creative. It is the most viciously passionate thing about me. 

A year ago I released an album that did as poorly as could be; but with the help of this decade long friendship. Recently, this buddy, we'll call him Bean, started using pot again and not just recreationally. Full blown addiction? Yeah - in the way that he is self-medicating. I tried to reach out, tried to be there for him for months at a time, and finally decided I'll jsut talk to him in six months. It turns out he was talking about me behind my back to other friends asking them if they think my dream and goal of being a famous instrumental virtuostic guitar player is unrealistic, putting seeds of doubt in them too about my career path. 

They all go to school studying things that don't make them feel anywhere NEAR as passionate as I am about the guitar; but they think they are better than me even so. 

So I decided to abandon this friend. Because really? He did the same thing to me a few years ago. Six to eight months of no contact. And this was during one of the worst times in my life. Thankfully my psychiatrist was a great one and I'll never forget how she helped me overcome my obstacles in life at the time.

Anyhow. 

So I got rid of that relationship; at least for the time being. Then out of no where another friend of mine starts speaking to me as if he is disciplining me on being 'financially stable' and having a 'backup plan' and being 'smart' about things. This is a person who goes to business school. He has been in debt for the better part of 4 years. He knows only about money it seems; as he tried guitar and ended up pawning off all his gear to buy the next big purchase. 

I realized then that the friends I had made, no matter how good they were to me once, were not a fan of me and of my personal choices and were no longer relevant to me. 

So I dumped his ass too. I don't hate him, but the way he phrased his words to me was so cold and so bitter and nearly jealous and resentful that I thought better not encourage more words from him. 

At this point in my career; where I still had those two friends, I had been unmotivated and without a record deal or big show to worry about or much happiness in terms of my career.

THEN I SAID FUCK IT ALL. HOW DARE MY FRIENDS MAKE ME FEEL NEGATIVE ABOUT MY CAREER CHOICE.

I got viciously passionate again. I rediscovered who; and how I am. And now? I have a potential deal for my 2nd album, the potential to open for one of my idols, and a potential show in Copenhagen. All of which will become a reality.

Victory is mine, and it is sweet.

All I had to do was change my affiliations and relationships and to focus on myself. That $13,000,000 bank note that got so reddit famous? That's my background on my cell phone. I will prove everyone who has ever had the idea that musicians make no money wrong. I will succeed. 

Alt F forward.

Some of the famous, productive and capable people thought so. Many 'greats' have credited a life centered in idleness (or the contemplative life) as the key to their success.

There is a substantial body of literature and essays written in defense of idleness. Other famous authors have written about our right to be lazy and the benefits we should expect from being idle.

Examples include:

Aristole,
Robert Louis Stevenson,
DH Lawrence,
Bertrand Russell,
Arthur Conan Doyle,
Soren Kierkegaard,
Lord Byron,
Victor Hugo,
Jerome K. Jerome,
Tom Petty,
Dr. Samuel Johnson,
Robert Burton,
Henry David Thoreau,
Paul Lafargue.

...and many, many others recognised as highly productive and successful folks.

Our current societal construct despises idleness. I think this stem from the fact that in the global economy you must either produce or consume. If you do neither the assumption is that you must be doing something bad or wrong.

I've have been introducing increasing amounts of idle time into my week and have noticed a number of benefits.

Interested in your thoughts on this.

Is it because of exercise? I stay at home most of the time during the weekends but I really don't have anywhere to go because it's winter.

Unfortunately there isn't anyone in my world who can help me - so can you lend me an ear?,18,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10bwxy/i_dont_think_i_can_go_any_further_without_some/,"I set up a new account for two reasons: my main account is fairly prolific and I don't want to drag any of that into here; and I want to be open.

Actually, I'm not sure where to start. At 24, I'm *incredibly* downtrodden, and have been for the last two years since being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. That event straight-up blasted every spiritual/religious pillar I had been carrying and sent me down a dark path that badly messed me up. I moved to another town, wrote off most of my friends, and spent most of the time not eating and living in depression and solitude.

Before I get into my present situation, I'd like to elaborate on *solitude* a bit. I've always been lonely. I've never had a girlfriend, minus that ""happy"" month with the known-cheater of a girl who I pursued just because I knew it would be easy and because I'd never before done so. She was a liar, a cheater, the opposite of the sort I'd prefer to be around. But I was just so tired of being alone that I allowed myself a lapse in judgment, if only for a few weeks. That was last year. There's been nothing else, before or since.

What I tell myself is that I have very modest standards and, seemingly, that everyone is just that terrible nowadays. I know I'm far from perfect - I'm neurotic, paranoid, sloppy - so where do I get off thinking I'm better? I'm exceedingly-average in the looks department, I'm too thin, I'm short, I don't know how to dress nicely and I can be a social ape at times.

And now I'm getting off track, I think. Presently, I have a dream job working with the underprivileged. I have my first house. Financially I'm doing fine. It really is the *core* of who I am that's disrupting my only dream: to not be alone anymore. The events of my recent past have twisted me into this existential, bitter, pessimistic husk of a man - and the worst part is that I truly believe these thoughts I have that it doesn't matter how happy I am, it doesn't matter if I die alone or in someone's arms, it doesn't matter if any of my dreams come true. Yes, it's that bad.

I didn't come here with any questions, but I guess I have my first one now: have any of you fallen into a deep cycle of mental anguish that felt simultaneously **wrong** and yet was obviously so **right** that you couldn't see yourself mentally moving forward? Does any of this make any sense?

Please give me a hand here, everyone. I'm not sure where to go. Ask me whatever you want an elaboration for; I'm an open book.",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_10bwxy,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10bwxy/i_dont_think_i_can_go_any_further_without_some/,

Your advice would be appreciated.",24,8,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1fjm5r/i_got_into_my_first_fight_yesterday_and_im_trying/,"Hi all. The title pretty much says it all. This is not meant as brag, I'm trying to learn from this experience. Last night I was at this frat party and was pushed by a guy who was standing with two of his friends; I guess I accidentally stepped on his shoe or something. He starts bad mouthing me, we're all drunk, and naturally things escalate quickly. I knock one of the guy's hats off (stupid), they all come at me, we tussle for a while, it dies down, and the biggest guy backs me out of the party with his hand on my shirt. Instead of continuing the fight I put my hands on his head gingerly while he's backing me out and give him a big smile and laugh my way out the door. I didn't get hurt, but the three guys find a friend and me later, with three more guys in tow. The big guy tries to get me to throw the first punch by egging me on. The other guys don’t want to fight, I tell him I don't want to fight while standing up to his strong man intimidation attempts. It's obvious neither of us is getting anywhere. Our friends pull us away and we go our separate ways. 

Thinking back on the whole ordeal, I have two sides of me at war with one another. My ego is going nuts thinking of techniques I could have used to fight them (I study martial arts, more for its emphasis on self improvement than actual fighting techniques) and is hurt because those guys thought they could just walk all over me. Contending this is the rest of my psyche screaming, ""You're an idiot! You tried to go up against three frat boys in the middle of a party. You're lucky you didn't get seriously hurt."" 

I'm trying to process everything that happened, why it happened, and what it can tell me about myself. I used to be an introvert and was bullied when I was a kid. I guess as a result I feel that violence is the ultimate way of proving that you're better than someone. In that moment when the guy who thought you were inferior is swallowing blood on the pavement, you've proved yourself superior. I'm considered a sweet personable guy, a good guy, but I'm very aware that there is this dark wolf inside me that would have torn that guys ear off. This is a terribly destructive and pernicious mentality that will one day get me in a whole lot of trouble. I guess this fight made me fully aware that that aspect of my personality, despite my best efforts, is still ever-present, and that a lot of my insecurities about feeling inferior haven't been dealt with. Have all my efforts to escape the shy skinny kid perception, efforts that have ultimately led to me being happy with myself and lead an awesome life, been fueled by insecurity and are therefore fruitless? How can I even begin to deal with these demons?

Thanks for listening. I don't really know what I want from this or if you guys can offer me any advice, but your thoughts would be appreciated. I'd love to hear your advice, even if it's as simple as ""stop being a ___f-ing angry drunk b___"".

Pretty much my whole life, my social coping mechanism has been to rip on myself. I guess it was my way of avoiding being the kind of arrogant asshole I hated so much. Basically I adopted the strategy of saying the worst things I could think of about myself before anyone else could. Wierd way of dealing with insecurity, but hey, I was damned good at saying horrible things about myself. My only talent, I would say.

Well around 24 years of age, I realized that people HATED me because of this. The only person who hated me more than they did was me. But  a very good friend helped me talk through the whole thing. Somehow he was able to get me to open up not only to him but myself. After that, I basically just decided to BE FUCKING HAPPY. Or at least act like it.

That shit was amazing. It was hard work. Its very difficult to completely reverse your normal behavior. Self deprication is a hard habit to break. But I did it. In no time, people noticed. I made lots of new friends, actually started getting laid once in a while... Shit was great.

Well lately Im pretty much worse off mentally than before. I feel useless at work, every project I work on on my own is total shit. It seems like I cant touch anything without amazing myself at my comlete inability to do anything right. I dont remember the last time anything I did actually worked.

Basically, Im the shittiest person I know.

I lnow what I need to do, but when youre as pissed off as I am, its pretty hard to stop and decide not to be angry. Not to punch a hole in the wall, etc. 

Im sorry for the wall of text, but what Im getting at is that no matter how far you get on the road to personal fulfillment, you can always slip. Its like an addiction.

1356892744.0,14,self.selfimprovement,15ojzf,"Anxiety, distractions, loss of focus and over-excitment",15,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/15ojzf/anxiety_distractions_loss_of_focus_and/,"tldr - I've been practicing meditation for about two weeks. I got an insight over my behavior and I wish to correct it, yet I have no idea how. I have uncovered the following four issues which seem connected. This is the first time I realized they exist.
* the anticipation of social events triggers anxiety and restlessness, regardless of how simple they are
* and to deal with that, I distract myself with various unproductive behaviour, which a lot of times is one of the following:
* I lose focus when reading, learning or working, almost anything can trigger some small mental masturbation episode
* I get overly excited on technical stuff, I start a project, and later dump it

I wish to correct all these four issues. I'd like to know your opinion over such behavior, and what one can do to correct it.

Here's an elaborated version. It took me five rewrites to write it coherently - thank you if you took the time to read it!

I was doing dishes this morning, and I entered a state of weird mindfulness - swipe, swipe, swipe, wash, dry, store, repeat. I am doing dishes. Repeat. [...] I am doing dishes because I have to keep myself busy. I have to keep myself busy so I'll have a good reason to be tired. If I'm tired, I can postpone talking to A. (A is some chick I exchanged a few messages with on some dating site - I do this sort of regulary, to improve my social skills - initial messages exchange went great, but I was always a bit drunk and invested time into replying with something witty and smartass. Asked for IM, exchanged a few lines, always promised myself I'd start a real conversation). Hm, A. The idea of talking to her makes my agitated. Hmm, so that's why I've been cleaning and doing chores and watching TV.

Now, I'm trying to let this thought slide and trying to regain mindfulness over washing dishes, when I get a mental movie that shows me it's not the first time I'm avoiding social interactions, or getting restless before an event.
At this point I stopped doing housework, went back to my meditation place, and immersed in the thought, which - sure enough, went away, only to reveal how I escape from said anxiety - video games, watching tv, house chores, surrounding myself with work.

Reading and learning about various topics is how I always spend my free time. The thoughts progressed and it dawned to me that another escape strategy is a clicking binge on Wikipedia, after looking for the definition of a new word, or reading something up to a reference, finding the original reference, and repeating. It happens quite a lot during said escape pattern, and I retain close to no information from my material. And there's another pattern too - any interesting scenario will suddenly have me daydreaming into it (can you say mental masturbation?), thinking outcomes, sometimes even having imaginary dialogues out loud.

And this leads on to another form of escapism - one through work. I find something interesting, then another thing leading from it, then something incredibly awesome yet obscure. And I start a silly project on that, with mixed results (I have a prototype for a browser based game I made around 17, I turned a complete chess set by hand, I designed and manufactured a part of my furniture, I wrote various software for all sorts of sillinesses, which was later abandoned). I find myself much more susceptible to this sort of behavior if I'm going through sleep deprivation or lack of sleep. This looks uncomfortably close to mania.

I believe all these issues are somehow connected, yet I fail to realize how, or what to do to fix them. I think that any move towards fixing them will enable me to become more productive and more socially aware, and maybe even lead me to more insight.

Needless to say, I am amazed and a bit afraid of what I just uncovered. I recall the patterns being there 10 years ago, at the very least, yet only today I noticed them.",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_15ojzf,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/15ojzf/anxiety_distractions_loss_of_focus_and/,

1363035220.0,14,self.selfimprovement,1a3q8p,I feel like my realistic view of human nature is causing me to be skeptical towards a lot of beautiful things.,17,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1a3q8p/i_feel_like_my_realistic_view_of_human_nature_is/,"Hi Reddit. I'm having trouble with social opportunities in my daily life. I'm not a social outcast or someone who is lacking friends by any stretch. I'm just aware of a certain facet of myself, which I'll be opening up to you about shortly.  
  
I'll start with the very basics. I'm a 22 year old guy who is currently enrolled in a university to the south of me. Before I locked into a university, I lived in a big city. Here I held a part-time job and engaged in another activity many men can nod their heads to… picking up girls. This is where my story would begin.  
  
I think living in the city and practising seduction has taught me a lot. Before I started learning how to efficiently convince women to go home with me(I've slowed down on that skillset now, not to mention I'm in college), I used to really be into psychology. *This* was around the time I was a social outcast, where back in high school I spent hours in my darkened basement seated in front of a small TV with a controller in my hand. Around this time, I started shallowly pursuing psychology to explain the unfamiliar world around me. Behaviorial psychology snagged me like a branch and I continued to learn about it as I got older.  
  
After awhile, I was able to understand why people behave certain ways(to an extent; I did not study behavioural psychology academically so I am a little biased here). I am not a cunning manipulator but I know everyone tries to manipulate their environment. I know that everyone has an ego and I feel that it's impossible to remove it from us(despite the number of self-help books that say otherwise) because I feel our egos and by extension, our emotions are a part of being mammals. I know that when people make up rules around outstanding stories, those stories are not the norm but the exception and should be heavily disregarded.   
  
This has led me to doubt a lot of role models. People like Tiger Woods, for example, are great people I'm sure. But everyone is human, and if the right situation presents itself, people will do irrational and often destructive shit. How can you trust someone or learn from someone like Woods knowing what they did? I feel life experiences and everything we do is not a singled-out mutually-exclusive event; what we do, we apply to other parts in our life. If you want to learn golf from Woods, how can you be sure that his teachings would be trustworthy then?  
  
This perspective has also led me to focus discipline more lightly. I want to change some really exhausted habits of mine but I often roll back into them, knowing that other people would do the same. It's also a challenge for me to take motivating messages the same way, because I end up suspending my belief.  
  
There's more of course but I'm trying to offer up a general overview. People who have been in or are in this situation, how do you feel and what would you do?",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_1a3q8p,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1a3q8p/i_feel_like_my_realistic_view_of_human_nature_is/,

I work occasionally for my wife's business, which happens to be a cleaning service specifically for hoarders/excessively lazy. Yes, they are as bad, and often times worse then what you see on the television program (think: perfectly able people too lazy to go to bathroom, so they fill up soda cans with urine, soda cans pile up in the hundreds in the corner).

Now I've gotten to the point that all messes can be cleaned within a minute's time, and the lack of messes leaves me bored. I then must find something  to fix, a chair or a toy for example. That doesn't last long, so I just reorganize things for better efficiency. This is fun for me, a game, I must hunt down something to clean/fix/re-organize, but it wasn't always this way.

I used to never want to clean, and when I didn't clean the task seemed more daunting as it became worse. The mood of people in my house would be affected by mess, a conversation sours faster when you can't get a cup of water from crowded sink or flies from the overflowing trash can land on your food. No one wants that, no one wants to sit down in your home when it stinks. 

And it stinks fast in a small home with a large family! My wife and I have three children, a mother-in-law, a sister-in-law, two brother-in-laws who stay frequently, and two large dogs. I make myself more valuable, especially as someone who hates wage-work, by being the cleaner/fixer.

I'm usually soft spoken and easy going, I rarely have angry outbursts around my friends and haven't had many in the last few years while I've been in college. After graduating however, I moved back in with my parents and that's where things started getting bad again. 

I imagine it's because I feel more comfortable around my parents and allow myself to emote freely, but ever since I've moved back I've realized I'm insufferable. Around my friends it took a lot to get me angry, at home I get livid at the tiniest thing. 

Now this wouldn't be a problem if I could just contain my emotions like an adult, but for some reason whenever I'm angry I become this horrible, emotional monster. I say really hurtful things, I swear at really inappropriate people, I start crying hysterically if things aren't going my way in the argument. I'm basically like a child throwing a tantrum. I've always known I'm like this but I think both me and my parents figured I'd grow out of it, and when my outbursts subsided in college I thought I was getting better but I seem to be regressing now.

My mom pointed out how bad it was getting a couple days ago, and I've been thinking about it ever since. My dad is quite the angry yeller himself, so he never says anything to me, but having my mom actually sit me down as an adult to tell me I need to work on this was a real wake up call. I decided I was going to consciously control my temper. Today, I had to call my landlord to make sure he was sending my deposit back and he rattled off a list of (mostly bullshit) charges he was deducting from my deposit. I pretty much flipped a shit, and probably embarrassingly tried to argue with him. I barely even remember it now, and when I think about it calmly I realize there's no reason to freak out, and yet even though I was consciously trying to control myself I was unable to. The second I start getting angry it takes over my reasoning skills and I don't know what to do about it. 

I've never talked to anyone is real life about this issue except my mother who had no advice to give, and I'm embarrassed to do so because it kind of goes against other aspects of my personality that I am proud of. I know anger issues aren't uncommon and I'm hoping someone on Reddit has some advice/motivation or anything really, It's a problem I want to deal with but I just don't know how to start. 

TLDR: I'm usually pretty mild but when I get angry I'm like Mugatu on crack. Consciously trying not to get angry doesn't work as all of my self control seems to fly out of the window the second I'm mad.

-----------------------

I am getting better at staying in the present.

I am becoming more compassionate and selfless. And non judgmental.

I am improving my posture.

I am learning to speak more deliberately.

I do my best to exercise and meditate daily.

I eat healthy.

I am getting much better at ignoring distractions.

I am happy, have good friends and family, and am doing well both school and career wise.


The only thing I'm not in the process of improving (which I am beginning now), is trusting my feelings more. Getting out of my head and more into my heart.


All of the above will require work and improvement for the rest of my life. But what else is there? I've engrained all of those well enough into my life that I don't need to think about them too much to do them.

How else can I improve myself?

FYI, this is the result of the past 2 years being very focused on self-improvement.


Maybe I should try writing about myself and something may become apparent. Maybe I should find a life coach.

I believe I have achieved this full state of awareness and being in the moment, but sometimes every now and then more often that not I seem to struggle with issue of worrying about the future. 

I have, however, minimized the scope of what it is I worry about though. I used to worry about many things, but now the only thing that continues to haunt me is the thought of getting fired from my job. And I know there isn't a damn thing I can do about it until it actually happens. 

But I worry about it to the point where it takes a large percentage of my attention span. To rest my mind, this I had come up with a game plan if I do get fired, just so I can sleep at night. For example, if it does happen I am going to move out of where I am living currently because I won't have the resources and possibly resort to living in my car (which I'm fine with if it is necessary, I've done it before). And I will make my living by selling cold water bottles off the freeway exits. As for my girlfriend, I might have to let her go, because I don't want her to be worrying about me, she needs to live her life. The only problem with this scenario is that I will cause distress to my family. I can't just let my family go. They will always be harping on me to find a job, to get back on my feet. But you see, I can't live like that. I would rather live in my car and be free.

You see how ridiculous this is? This is ALL imaginary! And I KNOW THIS! So why the hell am I still paying so much attention to this?
And for those who are wondering why I fear losing my job, it's because I work at a theme park with strict standards on customer service and every now and then a guest will get mad at me for whatever reason. And my fear is that since I am on a probationary period, any complaints about me may result in termination. I really don't like this feeling that someone else could possibly hold the fate of my job. Perhaps this isn't the place for me to work, but I do like working there. My co-corkers are the coolest people I have ever worked with.
But the reason for me worrying about the future is besides the point. No matter where I work, there is always something I seem to worry about.

This also applies for email threads - recently, I had volunteered to draft a letter reflecting some demands made by the staff. I sent the letter out for suggestions (a strategy we'd discussed prior) but no one replied until one of the more vocal members asked if anyone had read it. Then the replies poured in. What can I do to make people pay attention to my words beyond a cursory listen?

1367461233.0,10,self.selfimprovement,1dixcs,The Jade Master,12,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1dixcs/the_jade_master/,"This story is paraphrased from the first time I heard it. Had a big effect on me when I first heard it, was 18 at a pub and this dude I'd just met says ""WANNA HEAR A FUCKING MAD STORY MATE."" I said ""Sure, I love stories."" And this one has stuck with me and had a huge impact. Take whatever meaning you want from it.


One day, a farmer in a small village on the side of a large hill, was sweeping the front porch of his parents home. He thought to himself as he swept, ""What do I want for myself in this life?"", ""Where do I wish to be?"". He looked around at the farm he had known his whole life and the beautiful jade landscape unfolding around him and said to himself, ""I'll become a jade master.""

He knew there was a jade master that lived on a small precipice on the opposite side of the large hill under which he lived. He set out climbing up the hill and then down and around to front door of the jade masters home. As he knocked the door swung open and he was greeted by a small smiling man. The mans smile so radiant that no one could have challenged it, a man who looked so comfortable with himself it was hard for the farmer to maintain his gaze. But he was there on a mission and knew that it was time he stepped up and did what he wanted. 

""I want to be a jade master,"" said the farmer. The Jade Master looked him up and down and said, ""But of course, why else would you journey here but to learn from a master."" The farmer shuffled uncomfortably into The Jade Masters abode. A jade home for a jade master, the boy thought to himself as he looked around. The walls were painted a deap teal and all the upholstery was purely jade. As the boy walked deeper into the house the Jade Master taps him on the shoulder and hands him a peice of Jade. 

""Take this Jade, and hold it the whole day while you are here."" The boy looks at the man and says, ""And what would you have me do?"" The Jade Master grab a broom, passes it to the boy and says ""Please sweep the floors."" The farmer, angered by this, says ""I came here to never sweep again. I came to learn the way of Jade and too become master."" ""Too become the master you must listen to your master."" The boy so angry with this idea of sweeping, leaves the Jade Masters home and returns to his farm. Once again though, he finds himself sweeping for his parents. Saddened by his own lack of commitment he returns to the Jade Master and becomes content with the idea of sweeping for himself.

When he returned to the Jade Master, the man had the same aura of power surrounding him, the farmer said ""I wish to learn, and I will do all it takes."" The Jade Master once again handed the boy a piece of Jade and a broom and told him to sweep the floors. Dutifully, the farmer began to sweep. Each day that he returned to the Master, he would have a piece of Jade in his hand and he would sweep the floors. This continued for a few months. The farmer queried the Master often on when he would start his training with Jade and the Master would reply ""You've already begun."" 

One day the farmer entered the home and was handed his broom and the Jade put in his hand, the farmer felt the Jade in his hand and noticed something strange. He looked at the Master and said ""This is not jade, Master."" The Jade Master smiled, looked at the farmer and said, ""You are correct, this is not Jade."" The Jade Master walked to the front door, opened it and started to leave. The farmer exclaimed ""Where are you going, Master? What do I do now?"" The master looks at him and says, ""You wait for the next pupil."" The farmer smiled.",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_1dixcs,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1dixcs/the_jade_master/,

Have you ever looked at something that you see every day and realized that you never really saw it before? I do this with people.

Today I saw people that I see all the time in a different way. I appreciated them more. I felt a level of deep respect and love for them that I could not feel just a short time ago.

**They haven’t changed. The change is in me.**

I know this is directly related to opening my heart more. It’s not easy for me to do, and I even tend not to want to, but when I do it’s always better.

There are many layers to who we are and most of them are relatively false. Habits and personality are like a layer of cheap paint that hides the beauty that is inside.

I need to be a better detective.

Why focus on shadows, when we can choose the light?

I'm sitting here at work and I'm bored. I've done all of the work around here that needs doing and now I'm just waiting on customers. My job here is at a gas station, I stock the shelves, clean the store, and do the paperwork to close up at night. This morning I went into my first job, which is monitoring the computer labs at school. I do that for a couple of hours, from 8am to 10am, and then head to my one class for the day until 11am. I go home and take care of my dog, read, go for a walk, watch tv, finish homework, I do something to fill up my time until 4pm when I head to the gas station where I don't get out until 12am. 

I am a busy person, my busiest days are Mondays where I leave home at 7:30am and don't get back until 9/10pm. This is the busiest I have every been in my whole life. Two jobs, straight A student in college, I've finished reading more books than I ever have before, I've lost weight in the past couple of years, I wake up early and work late, my room is clean, I put in the extra effort to do little things to improve my life. I even have hobbies like brewing beer.

Up until a couple of years ago all I ever did was do drugs and sit around watching television so my life now is a big improvement for me. I am a very busy person but notice that I use the word 'busy.' I don't feel like I'm actually getting anything done. Sure I'm doing jobs that people will pay for someone to do and I'm doing well in school, but is this productivity?

If this post is misplaced, please tell me and I will post it somewhere else. 

I think I may be obsessed with winning the lottery. This all started a couple months ago when I found out my parents were getting a divorce. I thought it was no big deal at the time, and it was something that I could handle for the remaining few months before I went off to college (I am currently a senior in high school). I found out they were getting a divorce in the beginning of February, and I started buying lottery tickets for the first time since I turned 18 in November. I had never bought lottery tickets before this, and I had no real desire to, seeing as I knew the odds of winning the lottery and it seemed like a waste of money. For the last month, I’ve spent almost $20 a week on lottery tickets that all turn out to be losers. After checking the numbers online, I just rip up all my tickets and go to bed disappointed until I buy more tickets the next day and that excited “I could win” feeling returns. I’ve become so obsessed with winning that I always fantasize about what I would do with the money, how I would leave my house and not go back to my parents again until they got their divorce sorted out, and how I would just reinvent myself. This all seemed like a healthy way to blow off steam for a while, but I don’t think it is anymore. What can I do to help kick my lottery ticket addiction before I need professional help?

1364188658.0,9,self.selfimprovement,1ayil0,self-improvement seems a lot more difficult than it is,9,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ayil0/selfimprovement_seems_a_lot_more_difficult_than/,"The phrase often leads nowhere, or, at other times, it leads to: well, I want to improve myself, but now what?
At this point, it's easy to come up with a laundry list of things you don't like about yourself or high aspirations. I'm not saying that self-interrogation and pursuing high ideals aren't helpful, but I think these are great first steps.

First, ask yourself what makes you happy. What types of things do you enjoy- what do you like to do in general? If you think about these things, you'll probably find patterns in your habits; from here, you'll have a better idea of what new habits to adopt. Being happy is crucial to self improvement. 

Second, ask yourself what makes the people around you happy. It's important to take note of other people, and to synthesize their ideals with your own if they seem compatible. Keep in mind, however, that you don't need to live up to others' expectations. 

Third, and lastly, ask yourself what you like to see in other people. You'll probably have similar desires in people as others, so this is a good way to see what people enjoy being around. If you enjoy being around well-read people, then maybe reading more is a good way to improve how you feel about yourself. If manners and politeness are good qualities in others, they'll probably reflect positively on yourself too. 

In short, self-improvement begins by thinking about what types of improvements will make you a happier, more functional person. ",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_1ayil0,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ayil0/selfimprovement_seems_a_lot_more_difficult_than/,

Today I stayed home from school because I didn't have all my homework done, and it's indicative of a larger problem: I can't get any work done at home. The reason my homework wasn't done is because it had been piling up for days and I waited to the last minute, like I always do.

It's a vicious cycle and no matter how much I keep telling myself I'm going to change I don't. No amount of inspirational quotes or trying to change my habits (like writing everything I need to do down) are helping. I'm preparing for college, going into a tough field, and I know I'm going to get killed if I keep these bad habits up. I've tried ""getting rid of inhibitions"" but there's always the knowledge in the back of my head that it won't get done because I've broken so many promises to myself I can't trust myself anymore. After school I often fall asleep because I'm so tired, only to wake up much later, then stay up too late trying to get my homework done, then fall asleep after school the next day because I'm so tired. And the days I do stay awake I keep telling myself I need to get stuff done but I ignore it. I'm one of those ""smart"" kids who in actuality is lazy and a procrastinator.

1341094752.0,10,self.selfimprovement,vuwba,How to address narcissism and identity? (cross post from /r/selfhelp),11,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vuwba/how_to_address_narcissism_and_identity_cross_post/,"(Pardon me if I am not following the correct procedure for cross posts...I don't even know if this is considered a cross post. But I am posting what I posted in /r/selfhelp here since I did not get any responses for several days now and would like to see if I can get some response here):

In my previous posts in /r/socialanxiety and /r/socialskills, I have found that my thoughts that other people may be malicious towards me (non-physically) or exhibit a haughty attitude about themselves/others.

This made me think about elitism and exclusivity. I am often bothered by the fact that sometimes groups or people categorize others as ""wannabe"" whatever or ""oh, you only do x? How can you justify yourself to be a X if you only do x? I do u,v,w,x,y,z and you're calling yourself X?"" (Essentially, a condescending tone which denounces others for not being a ""hardcore"" or ""pure"" (or following rigid standards of what X is). Also, some people try to one-up each other in order to ""prove"" their identity.

So often, I find it difficult for me to ""claim"" interest/knowledge of something unless I can ""profoundly"" back up my claim of interest and knowledge, in preparation for such elitism (which is impossible).

From my impression, this form of ""defense"" is to preserve what one has associated his/her identity with the certain group/interest/activity that they have affiliated oneself with. I understand the human need for identity and belonging to a group is important for, I guess, ""self fulfillment"". Also, I believe that in general, people have a natural tendency to think more about themselves than others.

Additionally (as a side note), I find that my thoughts about worrying about other people being judgmental or negative towards me is a form of narcissism, as I am thinking that people actually would take the time to bother with vigilantly assessing me, when no one could give a fuck anyway.

In a way, I believe that I may be projecting my own sense of elitism, which I would find preferable to eliminate, as it is a negative trait that does not really benefit anyone in the long run.

So...

**How do you develop a sense of identity and belonging without the need for thinking you're better than someone and/or being self-centered?**

**How do you balance the idea of accepting yourself as ""you"", a unique individual, and the idea of belonging to a group?**

**I understand that by constructing a label (I am me. I like ___.), you are already limiting yourself to constrained set of qualities that you are adhering to, so it is difficult to try to have a sense of self if you don't, to some extent, subscribe to certain qualities. I guess a solution is to think that everyone is unique, and has their own experiences and upbringing, and therefore, no one has the right to categorize you as whatever...but I guess I am still not satisfied unless I could somehow develop a ""self-sustaining"" identity.**",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_vuwba,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vuwba/how_to_address_narcissism_and_identity_cross_post/,

You can use this for any situation, but I recommend major ones where you sense a lot of the negative outcome falls on your hands, or repeating patterns. I also recommend saving them for review. I hope this helps!

Is this too much to tackle all at once? Sometimes I feel like I can't adequately focus on any of them to make meaningful progress but part of me thinks it can still be done. Also, finances are starting to become an issue. I recently dropped $180 on a pair of boots and building muscle requires buying more and more food. I'd also like to go skiing (trying new things as to be a somewhat more interesting person) and I'm planning a potential 5 week backpacking trip across Europe this coming summer. I've quickly learned that better one's self is not a cheap process. 

Is there a better way to do this? Can it be managed better? Or should I simply focus on one thing at a time?",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_15v2d0,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/15v2d0/attempting_to_improve_nearly_every_aspect_of_my/,

I find growing up to where I am now I've always had ideas that were ""outside the box"" and I have recently taken my old love for role playing games to DM a few games for my young kids.   This has tapped me back into my imagination and creating worlds and situations and characters.  I enjoy this greatly.

While on my last vacation I was talking to the wife how I could come up with ideas that I think could rival book and movie worlds such as harry potter and the matrix.  Putting me on the spot she challenged me to do it.   After being taken aback I stopped and shortly returned with 3 broad senarios of ""worlds"" and brief ""storylines"" without actually fleshing out major characters.  She had to concede that she had not heard of them before and they each had merrit.  (I will not type them here as I dont know what I will do with the ideas)

Ok now to the point.  I'm no writer, this text probably contains typos and grammatical errors and doesn't flow like a top selling book so writing my idea's and trying to refine them would be overwhealming.  Is there an outlet where I can pour my idea's to a writer who is much more skilled so we can both profit from this?  Surely there are writters out there who are looking for idea's.  I need to know if this is possible and if I should continue to flesh out idea's and put characters and scenes in my worlds or if I should stick to my day job and look for something else to do with my life.",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_w3d9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/w3d9k/i_have_ideas_but_i_need_a_writer_for_mutual_profit/,

I don't know if this is appropriate or not, so if it isn't I'm really sorry and please downvote to oblivion.

I have just come out of a very difficult time in my life and I've really started getting into living life with a positive outlook, and I want to be able to help others change their mindsets too, because far too many people don't realise how great their lives are and live in constant doubt and worry.

So, I created a Facebook page where the goal is for everyone to write 3 good things that made them happy each day in the hopes that it might put their lives into a bit of perspective, and hopefully create some positive energy. 

I am a strong believer that positivity feeds positivity, and I think that even just reading other people's 3 good things can help in some way.

But anyway, if anyone's interested in joining please visit it here and like the page:

http://www.facebook.com/3ThingsThatMadeYouHappyToday

It's only a newborn baby with less than 100 members.

And like I said, if this isn't appropriate, downvote away!

Hope to see you around :)

I have recently took over this subreddit and made changes to the overall look, I hope it is pleasing enough.

The vision I have for this subreddit would be a place to share and discuss information that would improve the mindset of everyone and help people grow into becoming a person with a prosperity mindset (whether money is your purpose or not), a positive attitude, an open-mind, and passionate drive in life.

Since the subreddit is still relatively small, your contribution to insightful content is much appreciated!

I am currently working alone behind the scenes and I am looking for candidates to be moderators in promoting, growing, and organising this subreddit. On that same note, any suggestions or feedback to help grow this subreddit is welcome.

Currently, I am proposing an initial idea of putting tags such as **[MOTIVATION], [WEALTH], [RELATIONSHIPS],** etc. in front of posts to help categorise posts (with self improvement being a broad subject). This is still an evolving concept and there is no obligation to do so, however, it is encouraged.

Thank you for reading and I hope we can all keep learning and improve as a person!",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,t3_pfzt5,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/pfzt5/announcement/,moderator

1357525070.0,8,self.selfimprovement,163f7s,Could use some advice for my relationship and self worth,9,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/163f7s/could_use_some_advice_for_my_relationship_and/,"*sigh*, so here we go.

My question is half relationship, half self Improvement.

I've been dating this girl for a little over two months now (not including the time apart over this christmas break). We've known each other since freshman year and while she's got a great personality and traits I slowly found myself liking her  a lot more than she likes me. Or so I thought. The thing is it's always me asking her when she's free over the weekend or if she wants to do something ""alone together"". While we are together and  I sleep over her dorm occasionally on weekends we always hang out in a group setting. I've been feeling like I want her to want me. Now all my past relationships were in high school but whenever I've been in a relationship I've always wanted to spend time with that person whenever possible. I'd wonder what they were doing as I wrote a paper or etc. She doesn't seem to do that. And it's great because it means she's not dependent on people which leads me to my next problem. 

I feel like I may be too emotionally dependent. I'm not sure if I'm being needy because I'm unhappy being separated for so long over break and she rarely PMs or calls me. And I wouldn't be as bothered if she did this to everyone but she's been having a conversation with her ex boyfriend, my current suite-mate pretty much everyday since break. Now I'm like 80% sure she has no feelings for him but hell my ability to discern how i feel and others feel is so different. I understand we may have two different compatibilities but how can i tell when we've only been on 1 date.

When she's got sick I bought her a card and some chocolates. I just feel like she hasn't shown any commitment to this relationship and that hurts. But then again maybe I'm at fault because recently I've joined this forum and I realized I have little self worth and I read this article and figured I might be emotional dependent. http://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/2449/healing-emotional-dependency.html

Ugh, I don't know how to approach this relationship or my emotional dependency and lack of self worth. I'm a film student so all my esteem usually comes from others :/.

I had considered breaking up with her after talking to a buddy but I don't know if I want to do that. I also don't want to stay in a relationship though because I fear being alone. I also don't want to break up early and realize I made a mistake and I'm a goof.

Any advice would be much obliged. Thanks.

I need to learn how to make my voice sound kinder, friendlier, warmer. I believe I originally got it from my father; I grew up with a stern male voice at my back. My mother would always tell me ""that's just the way dad is- don't take it personally because he doesn't mean things to sound that way"" and the truth is, my father is a wonderful man. I, on the other hand, feel like I'm a far cry from what I could and should be. It's holding me back in so many areas of my life and it's starting to get to a boiling point. When I think I'm speaking normally, people have told me I'm being rough, rude, abrasive or even borderline shouting. I know it's not up to me what other's think of me and after hearing so much negative feedback I realize I need to bring about some changes. 

I feel like it's not just my tone of voice, but my entire demeanor.

If there's someone out there who could point me in the right direction, I'd be eternally grateful. I feel like things are spiraling out of control (it's affecting my family life, my living situation, potentially my job) and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'm prepared to accept the reality that I have more serious personality flaws, too, and I want to find them and work them out. Would anyone here know if there's any specific kind of therapy that could help me? Can anyone discern anything from the way I wrote this and point me in the right direction? Is there another subreddit I should crosspost to? I'm baring it all and I'm ready to say, I need help.

And I know that this may be premature/overreaching/assuming, but I'm in the EST time zone if someone would grace me with a phone conversation and could make some quick pointers. I'm at my wit's end and I need to make a change.

I fucked around a lot in high school and even my first year of college and I feel like I'm on the pain train to nowhere. Although I have the internal motivation to go to school and finish my degree, society seems to shut me down (I was denied financial aid and I can't afford to go to school otherwise- even loans are a pretty risky stretch for me) and I'm working a painful dead end job that pays me less than $300 a month, and currently working on a second and third job to help pay my bills. My mental health has been in question for some time and everyone around me (friends, family, therapist, counselors in school, etc) believe the smartest and safest move is to leave my home and try to branch out on my own- problems is New Jersey sucks, and I'll need be able to afford living on my own in Jersey- and back to the school topic I'm already almost 3 years behind my graduating class.. Do I really have any hope left? 

Tl;dr:
 CONS- sucked in high school and start of college. Looming depression/anxiety. Semi-lazy nature. Painful local economy.

PROS- supporting family, friends, girlfriend. Desire to actually GO to school/work. Possible multiple part time incomes.

Well, usually. For the most part, I can talk to just about anyone. But it's a matter of that conversation actually beginning that always throws me off. Lemme explain.

I just moved to Pennsylvania from Colorado last week, at a brand new college. I don't know anyone here, and I'd like to change that. But it's tough.

For me, the problem is the first impression. Looking at it logically, if a stranger comes up to you and starts a conversation, the first thing that person is gonna notice is how I look. And in the edges of Philadelphia, where people with less-than-benign intentions aren't exactly uncommon, an overweight college student with messy hair isn't exactly going to provide the best image. Now, I like to think I'm a pretty alright person, but I'm also pretty sure my results may vary. Plus, I don't know if the kind of people I'm looking for are the kinds of people who would respond well to that. I get along better with introverted, quiet people. Ya know, nerds.

Now, I know people with similar interests are out there, I just can't find them. The main thing would be join a club, but the only one I'm really interested in only meets during one of my classes (evening class on Wednesdays FTL), and while I signed up to attend meetings for a couple others, it's not with very high hopes.

So I buy a game, and play it for fun or leisure. But sometimes, it will run across my mind that ""oh, I am subjecting myself to the consumerist culture and only submitting myself to the capitalistic nature of society. Why should I partake in such an action if it only seeks to support such a society?"" Or something along those lines...

I find that it is difficult to apply the social commentary in practice, and it's not like I want to anyway (at least vigilantly).

I wanted to play a game for self-satisfaction and just to chill and stuff, but I feel like I am putting too much thought into such actions at times. 

So if I am to have some sort of inclination to some social commentary idea, is it necessary for me to adhere to such ideas fervently, particularly when I am not seeking to do such analysis (to avoid acting as a hypocrite)? Or do I need to differentiate between leisure and ""intellectual"" analysis? And I guess these questions have different answers depending on the person and their values?

Are You Living In The Moment?


Written by Steven Griggs | stevengriggs.com

“Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.”                                                                                                      Buddha

“I know that the purpose of life is to understand and be in the present moment with the people you love. It's just that simple.”                                                         Jane Seymour
 
We’ve all been advised by well meaning friends who tell us: “You must learn to be present “, “You have to live in the present moment”.

This is absolutely correct and being reminded is a good thing but usually the person “advising” us, while meaning well, probably has no real concept of what it actually means.

It sounds good and I’m sure they mean well but if you are telling other people what to do or how they should conduct their lives you are probably not really “living in the moment” yourself. You are coming from a place that may be a bit tinged by ego.

Living in the present is not easy, it is extremely difficult.

Our culture actually leads us in the opposite direction. We find ourselves either day dreaming of the future or reminiscing about the past.

When I say reminiscing I am being generous because usually when we look back it is not generally with a warm, fuzzy feeling, it is more often than not tinged with a little regret or remorse. We are mostly rehashing the past, not looking back with satisfaction and acceptance.

And daydreaming about the future is a handy way for our ego mind to assuage itself and vicariously taste the future without actually having to make the effort or take the action needed to make it happen.

Some may say they are not daydreaming or reminiscing but that is not necessarily living in the present. You may find that you are just cruising along on autopilot. Looking out at the world from the safe, familiar rhythm of day-to-day routines.

Living in the present is not automatic. It takes practice.

It is the conscious, and that is the key word, the conscious act of being in touch with what is happening right now, at this very moment, and keeping that feeling as long as you can.

It is paying attention.

Being here.

Right now.

It is the focused attention you put on your friend’s face as they are telling you about something that happened to them or some important issue that they are dealing with. It is listening with all your senses. It means turning your phone off and putting it away.

It means really hearing the words they are saying and diving deeper into the emotions that lie underneath the words. It is not waiting for them to stop so you can talk about yourself.

It is keeping your mind from wandering off into parallel thoughts that rise up as you listen. It is the ability to push those thoughts to the side and stay focused on your friend.

It is paying attention when you are walking down the street or hiking on a mountain path.

It is feeling the wind on your face, seeing the branches moving in the trees. It is noticing the animal tracks in the dust, the ants moving through the pebbles on the trail or in the cracks in the sidewalk.

It is hearing the sounds of the birds in the trees or their calls in the distance.

It is feeling your heart beating, feeling each breath enter and leave your lungs.

It is smelling the scents on the wind, the smoke in the air, even the exhaust from a car.

It is all this.

It is the feeling, hearing, seeing and smelling of life around you.

It is simply being aware.

The worst of it was designing an over smart species called Humans. As soon as our asses landed on this earth we made a fascinating invention called ‘TIME’. Then there were stone ages, BCs, ADs etc. etc. Everything was still under control until Mr. Benjamin Franklin, one fine day, came up with a million dollar concept of ‘Time is money’. And everyone knows what happens when we say the word ‘money’ in front of any Human, our extra large tongue starts hanging out of our mouth in greed……Nice story Check it out at

2. Eating: I eat 4 meals a day, all of about equal macronutrient profiles (18g fat/70g carb/26g protein). (this is just me being anal, I don't usually count everything. lol).

3. Drinking: I drink hella fucking water.

I seem to get very emotionally attached very early on which causes me to act strange and be filled with anxiety and a lack of confidence, which quickly results in the girl not liking me anymore and me feeling hurt and rejected.  Sometimes I feel this way even when I don't even necessarily like the girl in question, yet I still have this ""need"" for her to like me, or else I feel rejected.

Anyway, what kind of therapist should I seek for this problem?  Anyone with any good (or bad) therapist experience?  Where can I find good resources to help me?

Other problems I could use help on are

* Understanding women
* Respecting women (reality respect, not cliche TV/movie respect)
* How to date
* How to attract

I am successful. I am young. I have trouble judging my own looks, but from my perspective, I'm at least not bad looking.

However, I literally maybe have one or two friends at max. I rarely talk to girls. I usually don't go out to bars/clubs to meet people that often. Why? I'm not particularly nervous about it, I just have the weirdest propensity to say the absolutely most inappropriate things ever. It also happens at work some times, but mostly just in social situations. Now for the extra problem. I don't even realize that I've sad anything inappropriate until someone explicitly says that it was. I have no idea what this problem is. You might say that ""Oh, just think about what you say before you say it"". It does not work. I simply can't differentiate between what's appropriate and inappropriate. You could practically tell me the most disgusting story you've ever heard over dinner, also, and it wouldn't even phase me, so it goes both ways. In fact, I'd probably laugh at it while eating a burger.

It might not help that, when I don't like a person, I tend to be unable to hide it, and I just don't like most people...

And granted, my humor might always be different from others', and my life experiences have a lot to do with shaping that. However, I need help on this. Staying at home on the weekends is boring. I'm wondering what advice this subreddit can give.

Undergoing a bit of an exploration into self-improvement, but I'd really like to turn this into something I can track as data related to a few specific variables (things like intelligence and happiness). I'm sure people have developed tools (surveys) which are pretty good at tracking these, but I'm not sure how to sort out what is good and what isn't. 


I imagine some people in this subreddit have some pretty good ideas related to this. 

Alternatively: has anyone done something like this before? I've broken my days down into productive habits/unproductive habits, and attempting to create the life I would like to be living, rather than the one I find myself accustomed to. If I can measure it (I know it's not exactly scientific, but it's just interesting and for my own personal knowledge), then I'll have a better idea of what makes me happy and how I'm improving myself.

Objective advice welcome.,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/w9myh/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_place_but_i_thought/,"Hey guys. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. Right now I'm sitting at home, I have €40, no income, I owe rent that my housemates are coving for me. I am due some unemployment money, but that's not where I want to be. I am however optimistic, stoic and ambitious if a little directionless.
I'm a computer programmer, a good one if that's not being arrogant. I had very very poor social skills that have vastly improved with gradual hard work, to the point where I can banter with pretty much anyone, but there is a huge gap with talking on the phone, if the phone rings sometimes I have a mini-breakdown. That's one of my targets for self improvement, I don't have money tough to call anyone, If I did I'm not sure who I'd call to practice.
I'm doing what I can from the position I'm in, looking at online courses in machine learning. I've tried volunteering, but they're taking months processing things, I tried volunteering to make an iPhone app for the Cancer society but never heard back. Recruiters ring once in a while but I either can't answer the phone, freeze or go into an uncontrollable stutter. I'm absolutely fine in face to face interviews but you can't get those straight away now a-days.
Like I said I'm still optimistic but it's very frustrating, I'm one of those people that actually dreams of getting paid a pittance pulling an all nighter at a scrappy startup.
