The group will reveal the identities and real motives of the ""narco-warriors."" According to Anonymous, narco-warriors are the men, women and groups that benefit from keeping medical cannabis illegal. They are corporate lobbyists, politicians who accept payoffs, big pharma, prison contractors and anyone else that takes advantage of the dark, seedy side of our system's medical marijuana legal standing.

Seemed sketchy so I drove on by. Went to another dispensary and there were federal narcotics agents out front, people in handcuffs (I assume employees), and a bunch of unmarked trucks.

Not sure what's going on but it doesn't appear good.

Edit: Not a raid by Federal agents. Rather, San Diego police department. My bad. 

Edit 2: Appears DEA is acting in a supporting role to SDPD.

Edit 3: ""The police raids on numerous San Diego County medical marijuana dispensaries that took place throughout the afternoon are the culmination of a five-month investigation, CityBeat has learned. A law enforcement source close to the operation and familiar with the details told CityBeat the investigation revealed that many of the marijuana collectives and co-ops were functioning as for-profit businesses, and thus lost the protection granted to them by voters under Proposition 215 in 1996.""

More info in text.,298,51,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/926cj/here_is_the_link_to_the_canadian_medical/,"[Here](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/marihuana/how-comment/applicant-demandeur/forms_complete-eng.pdf) (pdf) is the direct download for the forms you need. Print them off and fill them out. 

Think of why you want your doctor to sign these and think of a good argument for him to sign them. Mention the fact that you already use marijuana and it helps, and you don't want to buy marijuana off of criminals. These forms also contain authorization to produce, so make sure to apply for that too.

Category 2 of these forms allow the doctor to sign for whatever he thinks it will help with. Some doctors have signed for minor arthritis and anxiety. **You have nothing to lose by asking, don't be a bitch**. If your doctor says no, go to another one, you have nothing to lose. 

**If you have no medical condition you can still use this program**. Print the forms and find family members who may be willing to get them signed (for whatever medical reason) for the program and have them designate you as their grower (YES THEY CAN). 

Failing that, find an AIDS or Cancer patient and have them get the forms signed (you will have to give them free weed). 

This takes determination. **Don't bitch out and whine that your doctor won't sign, find a work around, find another doctor, find someone else**.

Good luck gentlemen.

1255423739.0,244,self.Marijuana,9tiaj,LA City Attorney trying to shut down MMJ Co-Ops with LIES.  Please help get to the front page. ,298,54,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/9tiaj/la_city_attorney_trying_to_shut_down_mmj_coops/,"LA City Attorney, Carmen ""Nuch"" Trutanich, has been all over the media trying to convince Los Angeles that a pesticide used to kill Mexican fire ants is evidence that medical cannabis provided by dispensaries is poisonous and supporting Mexican drug cartels. Having abandoned the flawed interpretation of the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Mentch, Mr. Trutanich and LA County District Attorney Steve Cooley have now latched onto toxic reefer as their latest justification for shuttering LA's pot shops.

According to Trutanich, three samples of medical marijuana from ""controlled buys"" by undercover LAPD were tested by an FDA laboratory. On these samples, Mr Trutanich said the lab found high concentrations of an insecticide used to kill fire ants in Mexico. Trutanich claims this Mexican fire ant insecticide is evidence that LA medical cannabis is being supplied by the Mexican drug cartels.

Except...

There are no Mexican fire ants. There is the notorious red imported fire ant - solenopsis invicta - but that's from Brazil, not Mexico. Those fire ants were accidently imported into the US in the 1930's then spread across the southern United States. Fire ants were never found in Mexico, until they crossed the Texas border into northern Mexico a few years back. But even if expatriate Texan fire ants have decamped to Mexico, what does that prove about the origin of marijuana in Los Angeles dispensaries? If a cannabis dispensary uses chopsticks to pull marijuana buds from jars does that mean that the marijuana is being supplied by Chinese spies?

Pesticide testing is not a trivial exercise. It requires big, expensive, exquisitely sensitive machines that are capable of detecting just a few molecules. More importantly, pesticide testing requires a large plant sample to produce precise results. EMA, the largest testing lab in California requires a minimum 200 gram sample. So, did Los Angeles dispensaries sell Mr. Trutanich's undercover cops three half-pound bags of weed? That's an interesting scenario... ""I'll take a brownie, an eighth of Kush, and... throw in half a pound of that Sour D."" It's more likely that Mr. Trutanich would have had much smaller samples tested, with a much higher risk of error in the testing.

But what's this insecticide poisoning cannabis patients in LA? Well, it's a bit more complex than Mr Trutanich would have you believe. The insecticide that Nuch found in his big bag of herb was bifenthrin. Bifenthrin belongs to a very common class of insecticides called pyrethroids. The most common pyrethroid is pyrethrum, which is made from chrysanthemums. Pyrethrum is considered safe enough for use on organic fruits, herbs and vegetables throughout the world, including cannabis. See, most pyrethroids aren't all that toxic, except to fish and some insects. However, they're not that good at stopping fire ants. Nothing is.

What's with this whole Mexican angle? Mr Trutanich claims that bifenthrim is not used in California and by implication that its use is restricted to less enlightened places, such as Mexico. But Mr. Trutanich is dead wrong. According to pesticideinfo.org, California farmers used 107,000 pounds of bifenthrim on their crops in 2007. They used it on corn, almonds, strawberries, even wine grapes. Fifty tons of it.

What messages should we take away from Trutanich's Cassandra call? That the City Attorney and the County DA will say anything in their attempt to close LA's medical cannabis collectives and that you might wish to keep medical cannabis away from your aquarium. Remember that in June 2009, state drug warriors had their budgets slashed 20% in Sacramento. Medical marijuana remains the lowest hanging fruit for prosecutors and narcs to make cases and boost their stats. Certainly easier than busting those Mexican drug cartels.

Trutanich stated to FOX NEWS ""it's not enough to say conclusively that this dope is coming from here (Mexico), okay. but? but, you know, if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, you know, chances are that if you look a little closer, you may be dealing with a duck.""

Well... if it thinks like a duck, it might be the LA City Attorney.

California cannabis patients should be protected from contaminants in their medicine. That protection comes from intelligent regulations, something that the City Attorney's office has been stalling for two years. Perhaps it's time we stopped wasting tax money busting legitimate medical marijuana facilities and started researching how cannabis can be used more effectively as a medicine.",,False,self,t5_2qhhn,False,,,True,t3_9tiaj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/9tiaj/la_city_attorney_trying_to_shut_down_mmj_coops/,

Even natural tobacco (no fertilizers used, no additives, no chemicals added) is more harmful than natural marijuana. I'm not gonna argue that you're better off smoking than not smoking... but I would say that if you're gonna smoke anything, make it marijuana before tobacco. Nobody has EVER died from a marijuana overdose.

""It's a gateway drug"" - Terrible argument. Marijuana is not a gateway drug. If someone is gonna do cocaine or something, marijuana isn't gonna make them want to do it. Marijuana and cocaine are different drugs completely. One is a stimulant and one's a depressant. Marijuana also doesn't have any physical withdrawal symptoms.

""If you smoke marijuana, you're a pothead"" - This one really makes my blood boil. I smoke almost everyday and I'm a student at a pretty good University. TV has made everyone believe that marijuana makes you lethargic and unambitious and it's convinced people that all marijuana smokers do is sit around and laugh at each other. That only happens if you're completely blazed. That's completely wrong. When I smoke, I watch TV, do homework, go on my computer, etc. I pretty much do the same things that I do when I'm sober. The only difference is that I do these things feeling less anxious and open-minded.

Last month, after 1 1/2 months of depression and anxiety, I decided to self-medicate with marijuana (I don't trust pharmaceutical anti-depressants. They have terrible side effects that can make things even worse). Today, I feel almost 100% better. A month ago I couldn't get out of bed in the morning, now I'm not only out of bed, but I'm participating in class more often and hanging out with friends again.

TL;DR - If anyone can give me a good reason to keep marijuana illegal, I'll stop smoking today. Otherwise, I'm gonna keep using marijuana to treat my anxiety and depression without paying any extremely high therapy, medical or pharmacy bills in the process.

Edit: Did I miss anything?

I know I don't need to tell you this, weedit. We already know this. But I was wondering if there is a legitimate reason to keep marijuana illegal.

I smoked a few times a week while my wife and I were dating, but since we've been married, she hasn't been too keen on MJ being on scene.

I tried to stop when we first married, but I noticed that I was dealing with insomnia and anxiety that never seemed to surface when I was smoking at least once or twice a week.

Rather than shoot myself in the foot and get some diagnosis for anxiety/depression/whatever that would up my insurance rates for life, and get me on a pill-popping regimen that would eventually eat away my liver, I decided to play the medicinal card.

We live in Utah (no compassionate use in the foreseeable future) and it's illegal, so that's one her main beefs with my use. Luckily, there's been no shortage of good stuff, but she's always worried that I'll get busted. I'm pretty good though, never carry it with me, never have a piece on me, and I use Foodsaver sealed bags when I need to transport it.

Well... long story short, even though she's not down, she's been hurting for the past few weeks, sort of a chronic pain. Her mother has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and we think she may have it too, based on all the symptoms she's been having lately. In my research, I found a few articles online, but the most intriguing one showed that the #1 preferred treatment for this ailment is MJ.

She passed this info on to her Mother in so-cal, which alerted me to the fact that she may be looking to this as a possible relief.

The other night, she was in so much pain that she couldn't sleep. We didn't have any painkillers (which was typically how she would deal with such pain) and so I asked if she wanted to see if it would help.

Within 5 minutes, the pain disappeared and my wife slept better than she had slept in weeks. The next night before bed the symptoms were showing again so we tried our little ""experiment"" again.

In the words of Borat - ""Great Success!""

It's nice to have the better-half on board.",,False,self,t5_2qhhn,False,,,True,t3_9ouzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/9ouzd/how_i_got_my_wife_to_finally_appreciate_the_herb/,

Trailmix, chips and salsa, fresh vegetables, fruit salad, peanutbutter crackers, whatever leftovers happen to be in the fridge, etc. It's a big deal in my circle. All the rage. 

And as it turned out, my mom wasn't completely oblivious to these late-night kitchen raids. One day I'm bringing the empty trays down from my bedroom, and my mom sees and goes, ""There's one of those food platters! Or, as I like to call them, *weed trays*."" My dad, who is in the room, laughs, and I just stand there, facing the sink, frozen for a few seconds. My mom has hinted that she knows I smoke before, but this is the first time she ever directly references marijuana. I don't want to deny it, so eventually I just turn around, flash a smile, and retreat. She coined the term ""weed tray"" with that episode. Previously we were just calling them food trays.

Two nights after this, a few of my girls and me come home from an outdoors smoke-session and head straight to my room, but my mom stops me at the staircase and asks if we would like any beanie-weenie (sliced turkey dogs in vegetarian baked beans). She makes it, sets into colorful bowls, lays out spoons, and provides napkins. Another night, she drops off some potato chips and french onion dip at my door; another night we get assorted fruits, breads, and cheeses. Now it's a regular thing.

In conclusion … I love my mom.

The media seems to miss mentioning this fact.


I know you guys know it used to be legal, but is it common knowledge, amoung non smokers??

The news was followed by a poll that showed a slight majority is AGAINST legalization.

I wonder how the poll would have turned out, if it used the words ""make it legal again""

SO stop calling it legalization, it is relegalization..

we dont want something new, we want something that was legal for most of the worlds history.. not to mention most of Americas.

Unfortunately, although I think legalization is inevitable, I think it will be a long, drawn-out process. The federal gov't will abandon all laws against it, but then the individual states would have to decide their own laws. If my state keeps it illegal, or is slow to clarify it's own position, then that will delay the fun. Hopefully there will be a clear day when **boom** it's simply legal for you to already own some and smoke it publicly. At that point I will visit all the dealers I know, buy them out, and it's party time!

(""Publicly"" is probably limited to in your own house, but at least not having to hide. I'd put up fucking flyers.)

When I was a kid my dad used to grow Marijuana, he had two really big plants in out house. He didn't deal the drugs, he used it for medical purposes. He worked a dairy job, all night and it helped him, especially when a cow kicked him and he really screwed up his shoulder. 

Regardless of this, its against the law. One of the neighbors found out and he decided to call the cops. I was in the 5th grade at the time, I remember waking up at 7am, getting ready and about to get out the door to go to school when the Police where outside asking for my dad. I looked at them and told them I'd get him, he worked all night and was sleeping in his room. They said ""No, we have to come in with you."" 

As I opened the door to his room, the cop pushed me away and ran at my father, holding him down telling him to stop moving, which he wasn't.. he didn't even wake up when I opened his door. They got him out of bed and took him to the kitchen where they asked him to call someone to 'take us to school'. He picked up the phone and called his brother, he didn't answer his phone. Then the cop said ""Look, don't make us embarrass you in front of your family"" while holding a baton, seemingly ready to use it. I couldn't believe these people would say something like this to my father. I mean, he didn't kill anyone or wasn't trying to defy them. Why is it his fault that someone didn't answer their phone? 

He ended up calling my mother to come out of work. I will never forget that day, it was the day I stopped seeing cops in the 'positive' light that they portray themselves at those school events. Not saying all cops are like this, of course. I didn't really smoke pot growing up, in high school I did it a few times, nothing special. But I was always for legalizing the use of marijuana from that day forward.
