In this guide I will go over the very basics. From buying your weed sufficiently, to smoking it with your new ent friends like a boss. (This guide assumes you know nothing of cannibis culture)

First, let's start from the beginning: **buying / getting the weed.**

* Don't buy from random street dealers until you know who's sketch (sketchy / nervous), and who's chill - some ""chill"" dealers may also screw you over, so make sure you can trust your dealer wiith your goods.

* Never by all means buy shake (pre-ground weed). Any scumbag drug dealer will tell you: ""I ground this to save you time and to, **insert absolute bullshit here**."" Reason being - preground dank looks like ""a lot"" but it isn't necessarily the amount it appears to be. Always buy the weed full bud. (Full bud is when the marijuana is intact, if you don't know what it looks like, google it) - you can always break / grind it all for yourself, and store it safely. Although when you grind it, the smell may be abit weaker, some say it reduces potency since the oils are released when ground. I myself keep it intact, and grind it when needed.

* If anyone is trying to sell you coco-puffs (marijuana laced with cocaine / crack) you shouldn't be buying from them in the first place. 

* When contacting a dealer, don't talk about buying weed, or text about buying  weed directly. It's risky, and unintelligent. Use short-cuts like: hey man, can I buy 1 for 10, etc. Don't directly talk about grams, ounces, or anything along those lines. - it's good to know how much one ounce is - 28 grams is one ounce. Each gram should roughly cost ten dollars, so one ounce should usually cost from anywhere to $200 to $300 depending how good your dealer says it is. Never buy anything for more than that. **(this depends on location, I used that as a reasonable guideline)

* If a dealer tries scamming you get the hell out of there, most marijuana based dealers won't do this. But people who sell **HARD** drugs you should try to avoid.

* If your dealer likes to sell from their vehicle, don't just stand there, ask the dealer if you can get into the car **discretely**, and do your business there. 

* Get a friend who grows, just because they don't deal, doesn't mean they aren't willing to sell you some, and maybe give you a sweet deal too ;)

* If you're going to mooch from your friends when your dry (out of weed), expect them to mooch off of you when you have weed. And always remember: Don't be mean, share your green. 

* Learn the prices of weed locally, ask friends, get your friends to introduce you to their dealers, find one that you like.  Dealer will always be happy to sell you weed... Some may even share.

* Figure out how much one gram looks like if you're buying a lot of the same strain, if it looks like less, ask your dealer if it has been freshly cropped, because it may be water weight that your paying for. Don't ask for extra, just ask if the dealer has more strains if he / she doesn't catch on and add more.

* Start by buying lower quantities of weed, if you're going to buy a lot of weed, be prepared to face the risks: moving it, cops, and possibly a worried parent.

* Make sure your dealer isn't listing off a strain that is complete lies. Google some popular strains, and since they have sweet names they should be easily identifyable. Some strains your dealer names off may be fake, doesn't mean the weed is bad. Always ask for a sample. (But be careful if you have to drive home)

Now, let's talk about Marijuana preperation:

* There are 3 primary options for grinding your weed: **Grinders, Scissors, Your hands.**
Don't burn a whole bud, that's a bad idea, and you'll be wasting.

* If you're going to consume your marijuana by rolling it into joints google it. I suggest ""Ehow"" Tutorials. Youtube has a few good ones too. You can also ask an experienced friend to teach you / help you out.

* Don't try to be fancy when rolling, try rolling as simply as possible, it'll make life easier. Also, using a piece of thick paper as a roach (typically to filter out weed when smoking) 

* If you have nothing to smoke your weed, you can always use random objects to create bongs, or lungs, or even pipes, I myself created dyi bongs and pipes. Some materials may be hazordous to your health, so always be careful.

Here is a list of materials **unsafe** or **hazordous** to smoke off of / out of.

* Any type of plastic unless certified (extremely rare)

* Fibre glass

* Bottle glass, this includes pop bottle glass, drink containers, or anything not made for the use of smoking

* Metal is usually a no-no, nowadays I don't even think of doing that again - some metalls are okay though, you can find out by googling, or by talking to an Entspert (depending on the metal)

* Silicone would most likely be hazordous, although I have no clue why you'd be smoking out of silicone..

Now, for a list of safe dyi bong / pipe materials

* Apples

* Carrots

* Oranges

* Melons (if you're willing to put the time into it)

* If you have a friend who's sharing their weed and you want to roll for practice, do anything in your power to keep the weed from falling onto the floor. Anyone who's sharing will get pissed if you waste their weed.

* When packing a bowl for the first time, place small amount of weed into the bowl, use your thumb to lightly pack it, and keep doing that until the bowl is full. Over compressed weed doesn't have enough airpockets to smoke sufficiently.

* Lighting a bong with a piece of burning wood works extremely well, since butane adds a noticable flavor to your weed. Matches are also a good option. - be careful, since matches do have harmful chemicals when they begin to burn (the tip), wood matches are prefered since they have burn-time.

* There is usually a hole on the side that you hold onto on a bong, this is commonly called a shotgun, carberator, or rush. If you press your thumb on the hole the smoke inside of chamber gets inhaled, if you let go and inhale, the chamber fills, you can easily take many chambers full of delicious smoke by coordinating your thumb / finger off the hole

* ALWAYS bring an extra lighter, people get high, and lend them, and forget about them.. A lot.

Now let's review stoner culture

* Bring water, or anything to drink.. When you're high you get hungry, and extremely thirsty, so always be prepared

* If you're going to bring food you better be ready to share, noone likes watching a person eat while they're high. Trust me.

* As I noted in one of my previous posts, don't play with fire while your high! Body parts may be set ablaze.

* Treat a bong like a baby, don't drop it, and please, don't punch it, or kick it.

* Weed will not in any shape or form make you noticibly unintelligent -  many intelligent **successful** people smoke weed daily.

* Weed will change your perspectives, in a good way. So don't sweat it. Don't worry. Be happy.

* Don't salivate all over the joint, make sure you use your lips, not the inside of your mouth / tongue to smoke. And of course don't wet your lips.

* Once the bowl is lit, you don't need to continue lighting it, trust me, you don't want to inhale butane fumes.

* Storage is key when dealing with marijuana, avoid moist containers / areas, or anywhere that is above normal temperatre, you can freeze marijuana but it may effect the bud. I highly suggest pill bottles, tupperwear, or double bags (try to suck out air).

* Eyedrops will clear the red eyes

* Learn as much lingo as you can, you can even make some with your group of friends if needed, here's some to get you started: 



* **Cash** - when the weed in the bong is finished

* **Dry** - Out of weed, also known as ""Fuck!!!""

* **Shake** - Preground / broken up marijuana.

* **Blunt** - a marijuana cigar

* **Mole / Spliff** - a tobacco marijuana joint / cigarette

* **Roach** - the very end of the joint / the ""filter"" of the joint.

* **Bong** - a device that uses water put into a chamber, and a crevice to hold the herbs / essense to be smoked. The water acts as a softener to keep the smoke from burning your lungs far less.

* **Lung** - a device that uses suction, and oxygen to pull in smoke through a bag, you inhale the contents from the bag, contents usually contain toxic plastic fumes.

* **Bubbler** -  another name for a different style bong, still a bong however, it usually has spherical chambers. (With sweet designs)

* **Vaporizer** - a device used to heat the marijuana to a temperature under burning point, thus no harm is done to your lungs, and you get more out of your marijjuana

* **Swamp / Swamping** - Wetting the joint with your mouth

* **Couch lock** - when you're so high you can't move / get up. Usually associated with indica marijuana use

* **Indica** - A type of strain known for putting people to sleep, and making you relaxed, also knwon to give you a ""body high""

* **Sativa** - A type of strain known for it's effect on making you alert, giggling, and a lot of munchies.

* **The munchies** - when you get high and you constantly crave food, you'll do anything for food, even try to kill someone... 

* **Body high** - A type of high that can be explained as your body is going through a sensation.

* **Dank** - Extreme pungency

* **Skunk** - weed that smells like a skunk

* **Sticky Icky** - a nickname for marijuana derived from the natural stickiness that marijuana has

* **Green** - another nickname for marijuana

* **Cotton Mouth / The pasties** - When you get high, bring water. Reason being: your mouth gets dry rapidly. The cotton / paste feeling in your mouth is where the names derived.

* **G** - also known as Gram

* **O** - also known as ounce

* **Slice** - also known as an 1/8th of an ounce

So yeah, that should be enough lingo to get you started within this beautiful stoner culture us Ents have. This concludes my guide.


Happy toking my fellow Ents, and stay out of trouble!

I tried this earlier and could only think of ways to not get in trouble, but I feel better just posting some tips for enjoying your weed for now...so let us begin...

* Single hits are king. Get a bong or bubbler, get a grinder, get a tray, and make a pile for every session everyone can throw down and you smoke until the pile is gone (unless you don't want to). It's not good for outdoor smoking or when you have a huge group, but if you're like me and you smoke either alone or with just a few people, this is the best. Everyone gets greens and everyone gets as high as possible with the least amount of weed. If you have kief, sprinkle some on a single hit of weed and you'll only need 2 or 3 hits to get stoned.

* Take a good 15 minutes between tokes if you can, you'll smoke less since people usually smoke a whole bowl before it ever really hits them. You'll be surprised at how much weed you save this way.

* Get a dealer you know and trust and go to just that person as much as you can. It's safer and you'll get better deals and you don't have to worry about getting ripped off...which leads to the next tip...

* Get a scale...even if you don't sell. You can check bags, split bags up if a friend wants to buy a bowl or if you guys split an eighth, and you can also divide your weed up evenly and ration it out for the week if you're trying to conserve. 

EDIT: REMEMBER TO NEVER BRING YOUR SCALE WITH YOU ANYWHERE, LEAVE IT AT HOME AS IT WILL GET YOU IN TONS OF TROUBLE.

* Clean your glass. It seems like the r/trees community and the like understand this, but for real, clean your glass at least once a week.

* Don't make it your life. Work hard and smoke weed. It makes a great incentive to get things done: finish your homework, smoke a bowl. Do your taxes on time, smoke a bowl. Use it as motivation. 

* Be generally awesome. Let's make stoners look good, people.",,False,self,t5_2u279,True,,,True,t3_tk9j0,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/tk9j0/tips_from_a_seasoned_pro/,

1339760245.0,333,self.StonerProTips,v3a6f,Regarding holding in hits.,375,42,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/v3a6f/regarding_holding_in_hits/,"So I've been seeing the odd post/comment here or there saying to hold that hit for anywhere between 6-10 seconds to increase the high. I've seen this statement thrown around a number of times without sources of any sort, making it no more than mere conjecture. So I did some snooping around to find some scientific sources that help to validate the view that you should **not** do this, but rather aim for around 3 seconds. The THC is absorbed pretty rapidly by the body, within roughly 3 seconds. By holding in the hit longer than this is just allowing more of the tar and other carcinogens present in the smoke to build up in your lungs and be absorbed by your body. Obviously this is not a good thing.

Here are some of those published articles dealing with this topic. I would like to give you guys direct links, but I'm not sure if you would have access to them or not:

* Zacny, James P. &amp; Chait, L. D. (1988). Breathhold duration and response to marijuana smoke. Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior, 33 (2). Participants were split into 3 groups, each group holding the hit for either 0, 10 and 20 seconds. Mood, heart rate and carbon monoxide levels were measured before, during and after the hit. Results showed that the actual breath holding time did not have a significant effect upon the intoxication levels of participants.

* Zacny, James P. &amp; Chait, L. D. (1991). Response to marijuana as a function of potency and breathhold duration. Psychopharmacology, 103 (2). Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups; either placebo and marijuana group. These groups were again divided into either 0 or 20 seconds hit-holding, with mood, heart rate and carbon monoxide levels being measured the same way as the previous experiment. Results were again similar to the previous study.

* Tashkin, Donald P. et al. (1991). Effects of varying marijuana smoking profile on deposition of tar and absorption of CO and delta-9-THC. Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behaviour, 40 (3). In relation to breathholding time, results interestingly show that longer BHT's appear to enhance THC absorption. However, longer BHT's amongst the marijuana condition's participants contributed to greater blood carboxy-hemoglobin levels and greater amounts of inhaled tar. All this is also in comparison to *tobacco* smokers as well, so you can only imagine the bad shit going on in there while holding that hit in.

* Block, Robert I., Farinpour, Roxanna &amp; Braverman, Kathleen (1992). Acute effects of marijuana on cognition: Relationships to chronic effects and smoking techniques. Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behaviour, 43 (3). 
Over the course of the study, there were some hints that prolonged breathholding did increase marijuana's effects under some test conditions, but in general it did not. However, it could not be determined whether these effects were brought about by physiological or psychological reactions.

* Azorlosa, J. L., Greenwald, M. K. &amp; Stitzer, M. L. (1995). Marijuana smoking: effects of varying puff volume and breathhold duration. Pharmacology and Experimental Theapeutics, 272 (2). Over 2 studies, the first concerned with the quantity of the hit and the second concerned with breathhold duration, it was found that holding one's breath for extended lengths of time when taking a hit does not enhance the high.

**TL;DR: count to three-Mississippi, not 6-Mississippi when holding in those hits, kids. Scientists tell us we should!**

Hope this is of some help to you guys. Play it safe, and toke on!",,False,self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,t3_v3a6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/v3a6f/regarding_holding_in_hits/,

Ents! Please, for your own safety, don't do this. The ""high"" you would feel from this (or other odd and/or zany methods of getting higher) is only a blood loss to the brain. Techniques like these trick the users into believing their getting higher when they're only feeling a blood loss to the brain, or lack of oxygen (holding hits abnormally long). If you want to see if a method of getting higher is a hoax or real, give Google a go. And I'm sure the folks at /r/DrugNerds would love to help you out. 

Please, be safe, and use common sense. The only way to get higher is to get more THC in your lungs. Hold your hits 3-5 seconds at the most, and exhale fully before coughing :)
*And I mean no offense or disrespect or anger or that negative stuff that people hate each other to the commenter. 

tl;dr: don't use crazy methods to get ""higher"". IT""S A TRAP YO!! [7]

Before I started smoking weed, I didn't eat particularly well. Whole grain tasted like cardboard, vegetables pissed me off- the typical stuff. When I was around 15 and started getting high, of course like everyone else I would get the munchies and go for fruit roll ups, orange juice, cheeseburgers, ice cream, etc. Then I started wanting to lose weight, exercise more, and feel better, and I had an idea:

Taste and memory are very closely related. When you eat something new and delicious, you're more likely to enjoy it again, even if it isn't prepared as well. Same goes the other way, if you eat a bad batch of something, you're more averse to trying it again.

Weed makes everything delicious, so why not try to harness the taste-memory relationship through getting high? I would set out things like whole wheat bread and hummus, carrots and salsa, apples and peanut butter, and more before my sesh.The bliss of pistachios and clementines while high will remain with you, until-

After following this behavior for several years, I eat entirely different now when I'm sober. Healthy foods have an allure which I can't quite describe. I'm kind of a health nut. 

TL;DR - Set out healthy food before the munchies kick in, improve sober eating habits by harnessing memory-taste relationship!",,False,self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,t3_x5ve9,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/x5ve9/using_the_munchies_to_improve_eating_habits/,

Here are some easy, simple, but useful rules!

1. NEVER tell a non ent, that you have weed on you

2. Do NOT smoke out of plastic (such as pens made into pipes) aluminum (such as pop can steam rollers) copper, or full brass pipes (as some may be coated or made in a poor manner), unless absolutely necessary! It's very dangerous. After awhile aluminum is ok, but only if with the correct knowledge of how to use, or with an elder who can assist!

3. Make sure when you get a stash box it isn't too suspicious. Keep something very common in your room that no one will touch, or toss on you. Here's an example http://imgur.com/a/Bqh8b

4. When smoking with people, don't be a dick, this gets you kicked out of sesh's and lose friENTS. 

5. Don't spray too much cologne, body spray, or any other deodorizer on yourself before leaving the house as this is very suspicious!!!

6. NEVER carry your stash box with you, unless going to a smoke spot/sesh! This is how people get caught, without the intentions to smoke.

7. Make sure you have cough drops, eye drops, and lighters with you at a sesh. Always carry extras.

8. Never allow other people to ""hold"" your weed, if you don't know them. I know many ENTS who have gotten their stuff stolen this way.

9. Always listen to the elder ENTS unless It seems ridiculous and you know it's not right. They are always willing to help

10. The most important one is DO NOT be afraid to ask
questions! ENTS help ENTS! Do not be shy, we want people to be educated correctly!",,False,self,t5_2u279,True,,,True,t3_tesuw,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/tesuw/stp_new_ents_very_important_rules/,

Yesterday, me and my girlfriend plus 3 of her friends picked up 1/8 of the dankest bud I've ever seen. One of her friends had already prepared a gravity bong, and we had a good time. We only ended up splitting half what we bought between 5 people, and everyone was too damn high. One girl,  let's call her Sarah, was a major lightweight but she smoked the most by far. She went down to get some water. As I was finishing up rolling what we had left, I heard some yelling from downstairs. 

When I went to check (Which was several minutes later because I was baked), I saw Sarah standing in the kitchen and she said she was having a panic attack. The night very quickly went downhill from there. I'll skip most of the details, since it lasted about an hour. Basically, she couldn't stop screaming, laughing or crying the whole time. I was the only one sober enough to help her, so I spent the whole time trying to relax her. Even just watching it was one of the most horrifying experiences of my life, so much so that I almost quit trees altogether right then and there. 

In the morning, my girlfriend told me she had been seeing things as well. I went to clean up the gravity bong, and I realized what had happened. The random guy who made it had used a Clorox tube as the outer container, and didn't even clean off the chemicals. Luckily, everyone was okay, but I learned a few things I'm never gonna forget.

Actual tips:

1. Know your limit, if you're a lightweight don't try and smoke more than you can handle

2. ALWAYS make sure you're using a safe smoking apparatus

3. Make sure you trust who you're toking with, make sure they know what they're doing.

4. Look up how to handle a panic attack, right now. It's not as easy as just calming someone down

Here is how!,248,39,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/uo92x/free_at_home_vaporizer_works_extremely_welljust/,"Have a coffee maker with a glass pot? All you need is the coffee pot, some weed, some scotch tape or electrical tape and a stove. I have used this method countless times with superb results. Even though i have an actual vaporizer, i still use this method from time to time because it gets you super blazed and it's a fun experiment when smoking with ents without a vape on hand. LETS GET STARTED!!!!

1. Clean and completely dry a glass coffee pot.
2. Insert about a tsp of ground up weed inside.
3. Tape up all openings on the lid and spout of the coffee pot EXCEPT the small hole on the very top and a small opening at the tip of the spout that you can easily cover with your fingers.(top hole on lid will be your mouth piece, and small spout opening will be your toke hole)
4. Turn your stove top on medium heat.
5. Place a finger over the top hole and spout hole and place pot on the stove burner.
6. Shake the coffee pot every several seconds while its on the burner to keep the weed from burning.
7. Keep a close eye on the weed inside the pot as you look for a clear vapor to start emanating from it and gathering inside the pot until it starts getting a little foggy.  (This should take only a few minutes. Depends on the stove.)
8. Take the coffee pot off the burner, remove fingers from the top holes and VERY SLOWLY breath in the vapor that you have gathered in the pot. It smells and tastes like slightly burnt popcorn (which is what actual vaporizers smell and taste like as well) I can't emphasize enough to take slow tokes. The vapor will be very warm and may cause burning sensation in your throat and lungs if inhaled quickly.
9. Once the foggy vapor is exhausted from the coffee pot, repeat steps 6-8 until the weed is completely browned. You can still smoke this already vaped weed in a joint or pipe later on.

Enjoy this highly effective vape method, and don't forget to share!

EDIT!!!!!!:  DON'T FORGET TO TURN YOUR STOVE OFF WHEN FINISHED!

Edit: For those confused on how to tape up the coffee lid...The only reason for this is to create an airtight seal so no vapor escapes and leave two small holes that can easily be covered with one finger each.  If your pot differs from [THIS COMMON MR. COFFEE POT](http://www.nelsonappliance.com/images/catalog/MCPLD12.jpg) then you will just have to get creative with your taping method.  

Edit:   Don't place the coffee pot on an already hot stove top.  Heat gradually to guarantee you wont shatter coffee pot glass.  (Out of the countless times i have used this method, i have never even seen or heard any type of glass cracking.)

However; this method is rendered useless when smoking a joint because of all the smoke that comes off of it. that said, make sure you don't ""cherry"" your bowl so that no smoke escapes. This method is most effective with bongs/bubblers because it is easy to contain the smoke, but is effective for pipes as well.

I don't have a credit card of my own to order an mflb, so I find this works best. I've used it in public bathrooms without anyone noticing. that said, I usually try to use some sort of smell diffuser (body spray, incense etc.) in tandem with this method. Happy smoking!

It may not be the best idea for some, but for those of you who want to talk to your parents about smoking, here are some tips.

1. Do NOT start the conversation like a lecture. Be as casual and open as you can be. Simply saying ""I smoke weeds lul"" is not the best choice. Start by telling them you spent time thinking about the decision to use trees, and know the facts.

2. Try not to bombard them with statistics. If they need to be used, by all means do so, but they are not the point of this conversation. You are the point. Your parents want you to not fuck up, so show them you're capable of not fucking up. Continue helping around the house, working hard, and communicating with your parents.

3. Tell them it will not change who you are. Because if it does, you should not be smoking. Let them know that if your grades slip/job performance decreases, you will get off of the stuff until you fix it.

4. Never be defensive or aggressive, that's simply just explaining things from your point of view instead of yelling when they do not agree with you.

5. Tell them you are always SAFE wherever you are smoking. All they want is for you to go through life without a criminal record or a serious injury.

It may seem like a big step, but the payoff can be massive. ",,False,self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,t3_u1vwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/u1vwe/some_tips_for_telling_your_parents/,

 * Step 6: Place it in your car with the tools that you should have to repair a puncture, or just in your bag for the festival, no one would think twice.

I've used this method for a long time and i've been pulled over twice by the feds and they've searched my car, only to find nothing!
It also worked near sniffer dogs at festivals, they couldn't smell a thing!
Obviously tweak this method to best suit yourself, wrap your bud tighter or whatever just to be secure!
I hope this helps a few ents out!

- Do not hold your breath for longer than 3 seconds after the rip

- While exhaling and you run out of breath and the smoke is still coming, or you feel like smoke is still inside, burp once

- Make it a challenge to get a successful hit with the least amount of applied fire. With proper skills you can pull a fat bowl with only 1-2 seconds of lighting

- If inside, blow your smoke upwards

- To blow rings you need a calm environment (no wind or coolness), create an upside oval with your mouth and let out quick sighs

- Always attempt to grind your weed, burning a nug requires too much flame and inhaling

- If using plastic, have 2 different layers to inform you when the first one has holes

- Resin can be smoked. It's not as potent as bud but it is smoke able and will deliver a high similar to hash. Resin collected from pipes, or other paraphernalia that it heavily torched should be tossed. The less heat applied to your bowl, the more THC content in the resin. There are numerous techniques to purify the resin using 99% iso alcohol. A resin high produces a more ""stoned"" effect as cannabinoids are converted from marijuana to resin.

- Clean your paraphernalia occasionally, you'd be surprised how clear your piece can be after even months of use

- Try to smoke on an empty stomach: Better high, less chance of vomiting, and more room for munchies (cause let's be honest, you can eat 3 dinners and still get munchies, but the morning will be tough)
Some people report a better high after eating, so try both out before deciding!

- Always torch the corners first, bowls typically form a V shape for the flame to carry throughout the bowl

- If buying an expensive water pipe, try and aim for the ones with numerous attachments, built-in stems break way too easy and is a hassle to repair

- Understand the difference between Sativa and Indica, these are two different highs you can choose from.

- Always say you're bringing a scale when buying, even if it's a bluff your dealer will likely give you the proper amount. Although you shouldn't deal with dealers that cut corners.

- Do not share weed, always carry your own bag. Relationships can turn sour over a missing gram or two. By this I mean financially having 1 bag of weed with a friend or two.

- Never ever ever swallow your smoke

- If you're looking for a complete head-rush with a small amount of weed, try and hit a 'popper', this example will be using a water bottle:

Materials: 1 Bottle, 1 Stem piece, 1 Lighter, Marijuana, Tobacco

    - Set-up a water bottle water pipe with just the stem
    - Place about 1 inch of tobacco inside the steam, you may put more if you want
    - Place the equivalent, or less amount of Marijuana on top of the cigarette, keeping the marijuana flush with the top of the stem
    - Ensure proper air flow, do not push or jam anything inside the     stem, try and be delicate when packing your popper
    - Once ready, light the bowl like you'd regularly do and inhale very hard
    - You should get a very dense stream of smoke, try and inhale as much as possible, but DO NOT SWALLOW, YOU WILL BE SICK AND VOMIT
    - As soon as the stem is empty, or you've had enough, quickly exhale the smoke and burp any remains
    - Make sure nothing is in your hands, you will be completely fucked for a minute or more

Finally, my personal opinion on the different highs received from different tools (very subjective):

Bong: Gives a boss feeling, awesome for just sitting, relaxing and takin hits from da bong. I love taking bong tokes then strolling around town feeling badass.

Pipe: Mellow, eye-redening high. I always enjoy listening to music and am very focused on a single task after hitting the pipe

Pail (or bucket): Honestly I prefer the bong or pipe over a pail, I find the smoke enters and exits the lungs way too quickly.

Popper: I don't enjoy poppers, I've always found myself being a strictly weed only person. The headrush makes me feel shitty and I usually end up with stomach aches. I have popper fiend friends who praise poppers so don't be turned off. 

Hookah: Don't like it, I'm a traveling person that always carries a bong in the bag.

Joint: I love rolling joints, I usually roll 3-papers joints (or bloints we call them), only if I'm in a popular area.

Blunt: Badass of badasses, blunts zone me the fuck out and just look so god damn cool and fancy.

Hope you enjoyed reading!

After this, most of the THC will be absorbed in your lungs, and holding it in further is just allowing more smoke particles to stick to the inside of your lungs, which sounds kind of gross. By the way, I love this subreddit and all of you :)

First, THC Carbohydrates in your fat cells have nothing to do with tolerance. 
THC Plays on two receptors in your head, and they are CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors. The more you smoke, the more you inhibit those CB2 receptors. And less CB2 receptors, means less THC doing fun things to your brain. To get rid of tolerance, one simply has to recover those CB2 receptors. And, that only takes about one to two weeks. So thats it. To completely rid yourself of a tolerance, it only takes one to two weeks non smoking. After that, its mostly mental.

First off, this guide will (hopefully) inform you on how to keep your smoking stealthy. This does *not* mean I am encouraging smoking behind parent's or roommate's backs.

1. Never brag. - This means, only talk to close friends, who don't mind, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky, don't smoke! This can lead to panic attacks and anxiety. Just wait till no one is awake or whatever your situation is, too smoke.

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are, always have a plan B.

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is, is a toilet paper roll stuffed with dryer sheets. 
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative, and it probably works better.
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common, then light one after a smoke sesh. It personally mellows me out, and covers the smell.
 
 * The ""[Bathroom Method](http://i.imgur.com/ZxaDe.jpg)"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, steamy shower, and let the room steam up. If you have a window, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful, as they leave almost no smell. You could make your own [lightbulb vaporizer.](http://i.imgur.com/Mzgwv.jpg) The [Magic-Flight Launch Box](http://magic-flight.com/) (MFLB) is also a good option.

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, Lysol, Cologne, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room, a wet towel placed against the bottom of the door is helpful. This blocks all smoke from going out that way.

 * Even with a sploof, if you are using a bowl or pipe, the bowl can ""cherry"", or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and when it is safe, smoking outside is nice. It doesn't leave a smell, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots, too. - Closets keep most of the smell inside, and not lingering around your room/house. Just be sure to air it out good afterwords.

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window, and aim the fan out it, and it will pull most-all of the smell.

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, so always have it open when toking! Be careful, if a breeze is blowing in from outside, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, Kroger, etc.) and usually work. Make sure only to use them when you need them, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

These are all my tips for toking stealthily, so I hope this helps you all!

EDIT: I'll add user suggestions here:

* Don't let that towel stick out too far, or else it'll look funny from the outside!

* Wash yo' smelly hands. The smell sticks to your hands.

* Wash yo' smelly mouth. Gum or mouthwash works well.

* Make a super safe sploof by poking holes in the bottom of a water bottle and stuffing it full of scented dryer sheets. I've heard stories from people who used TP rolls and it didn't work out so well...

* Microwaving popcorn is a great way to make an overpowering smell to cover up other ones

* Cover your bowl with your thumb, or a coin, when you're done hitting and it is still burning. This stops smoke from escaping.

* [Hogwash](http://www.amazon.com/Hog-Wash-Organic-Hogwash-1oz/dp/B0036QOV4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365092945&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hogwash+1+oz) is a good spray to help remove the smell of weed.

* Roast some coffee. The smell will help mask it, and, well, coffee!

* People swear by [Ozium](http://www.amazon.com/OZIUM-SANITIZER-OZM-1-ORIGINAL-SCENT/dp/B000CSWCAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365093079&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ozium).

This does *not* mean I am encouraging smoking behind parent's or roommate's backs.

1. Never brag. - This means, only talk to close friends, who don't mind, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky, don't smoke! This can lead to panic attacks and anxiety. Just wait till no one is awake or whatever your situation is, too smoke.

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are, always have a plan B.

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is, is a toilet paper roll stuffed with dryer sheets. 
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative, and it probably works better.
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common, then light one after a smoke sesh. It personally mellows me out, and covers the smell.
 
 * The ""Bathroom Method"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, steamy shower, and let the room steam up. If you have a window, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful, as they leave almost no smell. You could make your own [lightbulb vaporizer.](http://i.imgur.com/Mzgwv.jpg) The [Magic-Flight Launch Box](http://magic-flight.com/) (MFLB) is also a good option.

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, Lysol, Cologne, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room, a wet towel placed against the bottom of the door is helpful. This blocks all smoke from going out that way.

 * Even with a sploof, if you are using a bowl or pipe, the bowl can ""cherry"", or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and when it is safe, smoking outside is nice. It doesn't leave a smell, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots, too. - Closets keep most of the smell inside, and not lingering around your room/house. Just be sure to air it out good afterwords.

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window, and aim the fan out it, and it will pull most-all of the smell.

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, so always have it open when toking! Be careful, if a breeze is blowing in from outside, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, Kroger, etc.) and usually work. Make sure only to use them when you need them, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

Looks like when I clicked edit it deleted everything . . . that's great. so here we go again. 

1) Try applying direct pressure and rubing your fingers together like you are saying ""I've got cash money"" to grind up the weed.

2)Use your already rolled joint or what have you to vacuum the remaining weed crumbs by sucking through it like a straw. Works really well and it's just fun.

1) I like residential streets because they are often unpopulated after dark, and also they are one-way streets. This means that if you walk against the direction of traffic, you will likely see a police car coming your way. Even if people are out in their backyard they aren't likely to investigate the smell of weed. Go to a neighborhood where they don't know you and walk around.

2) Light a cigarette. If it's broad daylight, I'll hold my joint or one-hitter between my thumb and forefinger so it's hidden by my hand. Then I'll hold a lit cigarette between my index and middle finger. If somebody sees me out the window, they'll just see the cigarette. This is obviously only really effective if you are of smoking age, but even if you aren't it may be better to get caught smoking a cigarette than smoking a joint.

3) Don't dress like an idiot. We are looking for roommates right now, and a girl came by with crazy dreadlocks. At the end of the interview, she was like ""Oh btw, I smoke weed, FYI (common to clear up on roommate searches)."" My response? Of course you do. Nobody has ever had dreadlocks who didn't like smoking weed. If this is the image you want to present, more power. But if a cop sees a guy in a t-shirt with a pot leaf on it, smoking a cigarette, he's more likely to try and catch a smell of the smoke.",,False,self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,t3_u11sr,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/u11sr/hide_in_plain_sight/,

",156,22,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/tfdz0/tips_for_young_ents/,"Alright, listen up.
Now i know most Ents don't approve of underage smokers,(like me, 15) but here are some helpful tips.

1: Be educated. Knowing things will help you understand the lingo older Ents will say during a sesh. But also be educated on smoking etiquette too.

2: Be smart. If you start smoking, do go brag to your friends about, or to other people. Anything you say might run you down the drain. Also, DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT bring your stash box, weed, lighter*, pipe, piece, bong or whatever to school. These things can start to smell and you could get caught.

3: Grades. This is the thing that will separate you from not being able to smoke, and being able to smoke. I started smoking in January of this year. I knew my parents both smoked, so i thought it would be alright  if i did too. I finally asked them about it, and the said the only thing we want you to have is great marks in school. If your marks drop, you wont be allowed to smoke. 

4: Listen to your parents. Just do it. Help around the house, clean up, and be respective of their choice of letting you smoke or not.

5: Pitch in. This is a tough one. I get paid 20$ every two weeks for helping and doing chores. It is quite hard for people under the age of 17 to find jobs. Jobs=Money=Weed,Bong, ect. Use your money wisely. But you cant be the one who shows up to a sesh dry, with no money. Try to pitch in.

(a lot of these vary with different people)

Naturally this works only with blunts, jays or spliffs, but the tip still works. This is basically the only way I smoke now - I walk in places that are heavily trafficked by cars, but not many pedestrians and smoke jays. If you roll them properly, they will look like regular cigarettes [try to avoid cones because that looks suspicious as hell].

The place I usually go is on a bridge that passes over a railway - it's kind of steep so a lot of people don't typically like walking over it - perfect - but cars can easily go over it. Most people would think to avoid the bridge because it's a pain in the ass, but if you ""decided to walk up there"" and smoke, it's the perfect place to do it because :

a : no pedestrians, but still in public (the logic is, who in their right mind would do this? Therefore, you would, because people would automatically assume you wouldn't smoke chronic in the public eye)

b : you can easily toss the jay over the side, and pretend it was just a cigarette.

c : the smell is easily dissipated because bridges usually have high wind situations (or at least the one I go over does!). This makes it a little more difficult to keep the cherry lit, but that's just an extra excuse to roll more to practice better, tighter rolls that will stay lit longer.

The best place to hide is wide out in the open - go places that are generally away from the smelling public nose, but go where eyes can still see. 

**Another tip** : If someone is passing by, just simply keep walking straight - the less paranoid you look, the less paranoid *they* will be. As they pass by, take a big drag - this will suck in the smoke and the smell, (make sure you take it into your mouth and NOT your lungs. You do NOT want to hold the smoke for &gt; 3 seconds!! Headaches happen because you breathe in and hold in carbon dioxide!) and once they pass, you can inhale/exhale. Pretend you're looking over the bridge or something.

When I read it, it struck me as odd at first and you will understand why here shortly. 
 &gt;
""...there is an accepted and irrefutable phenomenon which defies the conventionally known laws of supply and demand.  ...the Law [of Diminishing sacks] cannot be avoided through any conceivable corrective measure. It is simply an unchangeable fact that an uptick in supply will be met by an uptick in consumption, thus negating any perceived supply-lengthening benefit from increased supply purchase.""

Basically this is referring to weed, we smoke 1 ounce as quickly as we would smoke a half ounce because of periods of liberal consumption and periods of conservative consumption balance out the sack in the end.  It's a really neat article that I thought was a true stoner pro tip - you might save money.  If you guys find anything to add - post it.

1337734908.0,118,self.StonerProTips,u07w8,Complete Stealth Guide,135,17,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/u07w8/complete_stealth_guide/,"First off, this guide will (hopefully) inform you on how to keep your smoking stealthy. This does *not* mean I am encouraging smoking behind parent's or roommate's backs.

1. Never brag. - This means, only talk to close friends, who don't mind, about your smoking. The more people know, the more likely you are to get caught.

2. Don't be stupid. Be patient. - If it's risky, don't smoke! This can lead to panic attacks and anxiety. Just wait till no one is awake or whatever your situation is, too smoke.

3. Don't get overcomfortable. - No matter how safe you think you are, always have a plan B.

4. Scent is a very large indicator for smoking. - Smell is very important. Here are a few ways to reduce smell.
 
 * [Sploofs](http://i.imgur.com/3hsBD.jpg) are very helpful ways to reduce the smell. All it is, is a toilet paper roll stuffed with dryer sheets. 
 
 * [The Smoke Buddy](http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Buddy-Personal-Filter-Purifier/dp/B00478UIB2) is also a helpful alternative, and it probably works better.
 
 * [Incense](http://i.imgur.com/ZsNWT.jpg) are also *very* helpful for masking the scent. Just introduce your room/home to them so they can become common, then light one after a smoke sesh. It personally mellows me out, and covers the smell.
 
 * The ""Bathroom Method"" is one of the most flawless ways to smoke. Start up a nice, steamy shower, and let the room steam up. If you have a window, open it, and if not, it isn't a big deal. Put a wet towel under the door of the bathroom, closing off the escape route for smoke. Blow your hits into a sploof preferably, which is also better if you aim it at the air vent or window. 
 
 * Vaporizers are VERY useful, as they leave almost no smell. You could make your own [lightbulb vaporizer.](http://i.imgur.com/Mzgwv.jpg) The [Magic-Flight Launch Box](http://magic-flight.com/) (MFLB) is also a good option.

 * Spraying with FeBreeze, Lysol, Cologne, or using something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Ona-ON10061-Pro-Gel-Quart/dp/B002JLGMEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337743546&amp;sr=8-1) will be very helpful for masking the smell.

 * To keep the smoke in a room, a wet towel placed against the bottom of the door is helpful. This blocks all smoke from going out that way.

 * Even with a sploof, if you are using a bowl or pipe, the bowl can ""cherry"", or continue to smoke. I always hav ea water bottle cap nearby, to put on my bowl to stop the smoke. A coin also works with this.

5. Smoking outside is good. - When you can, and when it is safe, smoking outside is nice. It doesn't leave a smell, and you can enjoy the outdoors. 

6. Closets are good spots, too. - Closets keep most of the smell inside, and not lingering around your room/house. Just be sure to air it out good afterwords.

7. Fans are life-savers. - Fans are one of the most effective ways of removing the smell. Open a window, and aim the fan out it, and it will pull most-all of the smell.

8. Windows should be open. - Windows are the only way for the smoke to escape your room, so always have it open when toking! Be careful, if a breeze is blowing in from outside, this may just blow smoke further into your home.

9. One of the most important things is eye drops. They cost less than $4 at your local store (Walmart, Kroger, etc.) and usually work. Make sure only to use them when you need them, as your eyes can become ""addicted"" to them, which isn't fun.

These are all my tips for toking stealthily, so I hope this helps you all!",,False,self,t5_2u279,1337750520.0,,,True,t3_u07w8,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/u07w8/complete_stealth_guide/,

1375364569.0,116,self.StonerProTips,1jhrdo,Check wind direction with your lighter flame before smoking in a room that can't smell. It makes a HUGE difference,140,24,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/1jhrdo/check_wind_direction_with_your_lighter_flame/,"From a year of smoking in a college dorm, I learned that wind direction has WAY more to do with smell than I ever imagined. All the fans and spray in the world don't do much if the wind is blowing inward. So hold your lighter up to the window before smoking and see which direction the flame pulls. It comes down to these four levels:

**Pulling hard toward the outside:** You're in great shape. I'd just smoke near the window, not even use a fan or anything and it'd get sucked right out.

**Pulling slightly outside:** Still pretty good! Lean in toward the window before exhaling, maybe spray a little, but otherwise you're good.

**Standing still:** Doable, but be more cautious. The wind has no direction, so the smoke will stay in place/float up. Exhaling near the window won't be good enough. Really put your mouth up to the screen first so it all gets outside and you'll be fine. Still spray and maybe set up a fan as a precaution

**Pulling inward at all:** DO NOT SMOKE. If you are in a room that can't smell, please trust me on this. Even if the flame's only slightly bent inward, the room will still get stanky. And that's with anti-smell tactics. Just wait or find a different room, but don't smoke in this condition because you run a very high risk of getting caught.

One last thing, remember to recheck the direction every so often because it changes, and you don't want to find out by watching your exhaled smoke rush into your room. Other than that, enjoy your toking!

Is putting different liquids in your bong a bad idea? Never really see people do it so that's why I assume it might not be a good idea. Also if the liquid makes no difference, what are some things besides water that you like to use. I know this sounds dumb but I'm baked and want to try something different. Might try it with some of the Arizona mango tea I'm drinking.

EDIT: holy shit guys thanks for all the responses. I was only expecting maybe a few legit answers, and a bunch a people saying I was a dumb faggot but instead I got a ton of legitimate answers. So what I have gathered is basically anything is cool to use except alcohol because it will filter the THC. And if I use something with sugar I need to wash that shit promptly after smoking, which is fine cause I do that anyway.

2: Kind of the same thing as the one over, but if you smoke outside, try closing your eyes the whole time you smoke, and open them when your done. Its amazing 

3: put a little tobacco at the bottom of the joint, so you dont have to smoke it all the way down to the filter. 

4: Sunglasses...

5: use a Frisbee instead of a plate when you work with weed, its really easy.

This post is concerning lighters. The best, the worst, how to buy, and what ever else.

**CLIPPERS**
The original weed lighter. A roach clip, an easy to remove safety, a poker, awesome graphics, doesnt torch the bowl, cheap, easy to hide, and just amazing. Buy theese over anything else!

**BICS**
The next best thing. They are also cheap, small, dont torch the bowl, an easy to remove safety, and just iverall great.  If you can master lighting them with your pointer finger, you will never have a burned thumb again. 

**Stick Lighters, also known as grill or charcoal lighters** 

Theese are typicly used by kids who dont own any bics. They are used for cooking, fireworks, and known as the lighter for non smokers. People dont smoke with them. But hey, it can light a bowl, and it wont burn your thumb. Also stores will sell theese to minors (*especially* at dollar stores) 

**Torch Lighters**

Theese shoot a hot flaming torch of butane and cause extreme heat. But they are wind proof, the flame doesnt bend, and the fuel is cheap (10$ for a big refill canister, refills tons!) Theese are found at home improvment stores on the welding isle. They are considered ""mini hobby torches"", but are used by meth smokers. They torch bowls if not used carefully, because unlike bics or clippers, you dont suck the flame into the bowl, you just put the torch to the bowl and suck. Keep the flame about 1 to 1.5 inches above the bowl. I only bought these for hobby-ing and lighting fireworks on holidays. They work well for lighting fuses on firecrackers. Theese are also good on blunts!

**Zippos**

Theese are not or smoking. They cannot be turned to smoke a pipe. They taste bad on joints. They are generally used by badass action movie heros, and are not good smoking tools. 

**Matches**

Matches can be great, or suck. It matters. Wind makes them useless, when you run out, your done for, and can add a bad taste. They are hard to work with when lighting a bowl. If you have a choice between theese and a lighter, always take the lighter.

**Buying lighters** 

1. Minors, try buying from the dollar store. The ones on the bad side of town are great. If you must, buy stick lighters, because people dont relate stick lighters with smoking. Always say you are buying them for fireworks, or candles, or picking some up for an upcoming BBQ if the clerk ask. Gas stations are also good. 

2. **ALWAYS** GET BICS OR CLIPPERS INSTEAD OF THOSE SHITTY CLEAR LIGHTERS! The clear ones might cost a dollar for 8. Good deal right? Yeah, until it runs out after 2 uses, the flint breaks, or it leaks or overheats. 11 cents a lighter may sound good. But Bics outlive theese lighters by weeks, months, even possibly years. 

3. If your a minor, Buy 2 or 3 if the clerk will let you. Dont buy those fancy curve ones or anything. Just a bic with your favirite color or the 7/11 symbol (i have tons of theese)

Comment with any other tips! Id love to hear more!


**EDIT**

As you guys know, most headshops, despite the blatant advertising to stoners, will have a blanket restriction of terms that the government or their own management consider indications of intent to use for illegal activity (tl;dr, you're gonna smoke weed with that). 

Here is a (not by any means full) list of terms that must replace or be replaced.

* Bong: It's not a bong, it's a water pipe

* Bowl: Different headshops have different restrictions on this one, but I'd play it safe and call it a pipe.

* Chillums: Unless labeled that, those are tasting pipes mister.

* Anything with a hose or whip, despite having a bong type bowl will probably be called a hookah.

* Keif is pollen

*Not really for weed OR tobacco useage:*

* Those odd little things shaped like novelty vacuum cleaners? That's an ""insufulator"" used for snorting your poisons. 

* Hide-Away tins are what you'd call those stash cans, or just ""that cool tin"" might work as well.

* Shake and Vape tends to be what they call those meth/crack vaporizers.


Also: The athletic socks are for huffing paint, the shoelaces are for heroin addicts to tie off, the whipped cream canisters are for huffing NO2, those roses in glass tubes? People smoke crack out of those, and speaking of which, that copper steel wool is used as screens by crackheads who don't understand (or don't care) that when copper is heated, bad things happen to your lungs.

Just posting this for any ents who have not seen this. It's saved me so many times when I don't have a grinder handy. All you need is an empty pill bottle (i.g. Advil, ibuprofen, etc.) and two pennies.

Then it's just a couple simple steps to finely grind your weed without having to get your hands too sticky.

* Clean out pill bottle and coins.

* Place coins in pill bottle.

* Place weed in pill bottle. Put in enough for one bowl pack. If you put in too much weed, then the coins won't be able to bounce around hard enough to break weed.

* Shake really hard for about 30 seconds or until ground to your liking.

* Now just pack a fat bowl and spark it up.

I know it's simple and kind of obvious, but I used to always question what to use as a makeshift grinder. Weed will require more shaking if super dank. When putting in weed, make sure buds aren't too big. It's common sense...

**Explanation and disclaimer:** I'm totally new to this subreddit, so I'm sorry if this is a re-post. I live in LA, where I can smoke with impunity, but I went to school in Boston, and making spliffs out of cigarettes helped me tremendously. Here's what you do:

1.) **Roll the tobacco out of a cigarette**: This is really easy. All you have to do is grip the cigarette with your thumb and index finger about a half inch before the filter and start rolling it between the two. Work your way down the cigarette and tobacco should start falling right out of the end. 

**2.) Use an unsharpened #2 wooden pencil to pack your spliff/joint**
I recommend using a mix of tobacco and weed, but I also smoke a pack a day, so to each his own. The #2 pencil (unsharpened) is key though, because it fits absolutely perfectly into a cigarette. All you need to do is add a little bit of weed, then a little bit of tobacco, then ram it down with the pencil like you were loading a Civil War cannon full of good times. (Note: I prefer a Ticonderoga ""soft"" pencil, but that detail is irrelevant). 

**3.) Pack that thing tight:** Finish off your spliff with a wedge of tobacco at the top and pack it down such that you can turn your cig upside down and nothing will fall out. I also recomment leaving that 1/2 inch of tobacco at the bottom of the spliff so that way you know exactly when the weed is finished.

**4.) Filter Removal:** Cigarette filters kill the magic of weed in my opinion. I don't know if there's science behind it or if its in my head, but I can't have them in my cigarette-spliffs. You can remove the filter with tweezers, but a more seasoned/desperate hand will use his or her front teeth to just bight the thing out. Bite it right in the middle, and you'll get that sucker right out. 

**5.) Make a filter out of business cards:** Or whatever you normally make filters out of. I prefer business cards b/c when I started this method, I had a business card of a campus police officer who busted me for weed possession, so every time I lit up, it was a tribute to him. 

**6.) Don't be stupid:** Obviously. Even though it will look like you're smoking a normal cigarette, but weed still smells. 


Anyway, I hope this is useful to someone, somewhere. Though I will say, the best way to smoke weed without getting caught is to move to California, get your card, buy a piece and a lighter, and then proceed to smoke weed. 

Edit: Hey guys, thanks for all of your comments and what not, particularly the advice on cig rollers etc. As far as the people who think this is a stupid tip are concerned, I agree that it's not efficient, nor is it by any means the best way to smoke weed. But when the situation calls for it, or you're in a pinch, it's a decent solution. That's all, much love to everybody!

**Things you'll need:**

1- joint

1- Camel Crush (yes the ciggarett) 



**What to do:**

Step 1. Roll your fatty.

Step 2. Smoke your Camel Crush but DO NOT crush it (note:if you don't smoke skip this step)
 
Step 3. Rip through the filter of your cigarette until you locate the uncrushed mint/menthol ball thing.

Step 4. Crack the mint/menthol ball thing. 

Step 5. Evenly spread the liquid from inside the ball over your joint and let it dry 

Step 6. Light and enjoy


If done right the mint/menthol flavor shouldn't be to over powering with mint/menthol and the taste of the weed should still be noticeable.

It got a little out of hand.  

DISCLAIMER:  I am not guaranteeing you will pass, only trying to help increase your chances.  If you are looking for work, or know you will be looking for work soon, just stop.  These days even the lowly Walmart employee get tested going in and most traces for most users will be gone in a week.  Exhibit some self control people.  Since I know I'm talking to stoners, lets just call it a month (don't you just hate fat soluble metabolites?).  If you wan't to know how long for you specifically I suggest buying the drugstore cheepos and do a test run. They are reasonably accurate and will tell you when everything is out of your system.

For those of you who choose to live dangerously passing a drug test is all about diluting the metabolites of interest to minimal levels without making it look suspicious. This means drinking as much fluids as you can, while still having your piss come out yellow.

1) Cranberry juice, certain types of Gatorade, and anything with vitamin C will help maintain that yellow color. Not perfectly, and sometimes labs have the equipment to tell if you are doing this, but its better than nothing. Start doing this 2 to 3 days or so before the test to help flush your system. Cranberry juice is best because it is also a diuretic (helps you piss like a racehorse).  There's no need to go overboard, don't force yourself to drink gallon upon gallon because it will put undue stress on your kidneys, just try to drink a little more than you should for your body weight (which is probably a lot more than you do now you magnificent under-hydrated bastards.)

2) Get moderately (or super if you got the balls) drunk the night before.  Alcohol is a diuretic and it's not illegal to test positive for booze. If anyone says anything (and they won't) say it's not a common thing, you were just out celebrating your new employment with friends.

3) Right before you leave take a piss in the comfort of your home. There's nothing suspicious about not being able to piss on cue and it will help clean out your system. This is especially important if it's your first piss of the day since that one will be the most concentrated. NEVER let them test your first piss.

4) If you're only worried about cannabis take the maximum recommended dosage of aspirin 24 hours before the test. There is SOME MINIMAL evidence the metabolite interferes with antibody based tests, you know those generic strips you can buy in drug stores. Which brings me to my final recommendation.

5) If this test is for a high paying or high security job, do not expect any of these methods to work. In all likelihood your employer has shelled out the extra $50 or so dollars for gas chromatography or mass spec, which in either case can detect very minimal levels. I've worked with both methods and can tell you first hand how sensitive they are (I do research on chemicals and these are two common methods of analysis since they are relatively cheap). It's better to just quit and try to push the date of the test back as much as possible.

Any other suggestions would be welcome. ",,False,self,t5_2u279,1376317282.0,,,True,t3_1k7h5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/1k7h5y/how_to_increase_your_chances_of_passing_a_drug/,

When you're rolling the joint, put the crutch so that it's sticking out about 1/4 to 1/2 it's length from the end of the paper. Roll it like usual, and don't worry about how tight it is where the herbs meet the crutch. Then when you're done rolling, push the crutch all the way in (I prefer it so that it's JUST past the tip of the paper, so that it's about a millimeter inside the joint.

2) Smoke mostly in the late afternoon/early evening if you have anything to do that day. This keeps you productive, and saves your trees for when you will enjoy them most (Not that doing daytime activities aren't fun high).

3) Don't buy extra amounts when you first get paid, you will only end up smoking all of it to fast. Buy a gram-eighth at a time and save some cash in a hiding place until you need to buy again.This way when you actually run dry, you will still have some money for another bag.

4) Use a vape, MFLB, one-hitter (sneak-a-toke) rather than a joint/blunt as your primary method.

1) pack the bowl.
2) take a strip of electrical tape or masking tape, and stick a dime or other coin (depending on the size of your bowl's opening) right in the middle of the sticky side.
3) align the strip of tape over your bowl, sticky-side down, so the coin sits right on top of the weed.
4) wrap the tape securely around the pipe, while leaving a little bit unstuck for easy removal later.
5) the coin holds your weed in place while preventing it from sticking to the tape!

OldHippie put up [this](http://beyondchronic.com/2012/04/medical-marijuana-dental-hygiene/), it's regarding dental hygiene and basically says that cotton mouth = bacteria. This plus sugary snacks, soda, and candy will ruin your mouth. once you're not under your parent's insurance anymore, dental is hard to cover and can cost a lot of money that you could be buying weed with. 

 
What sucks is that the only drinks that aren't bad for your teeth are water, beer, un-sweetened tea and coffee (although those leave stains, but can be brushed off) and milk. I've learned to enjoy these things, ice water when you're baked is amazing, milk is delicious with meals, and good beer, when consumed slowly, is heavenly. So embrace these things, for your mouth's sake.


As for food, try to still eat 3 meals a day. Don't replace lunch with gummy worms...you'll stay full throughout the day and when you do get the munchies, if you time it right, you could eat a whole meal. If you do want to snack, go for fruit, it's delicious. Also steak and chicken are both pretty good for you and delicious.

This technique helps retain original flavor and moisture. 

Turn on your broiler. The level (low, med, high) will depend on a few factors: type and size of food, how quickly you want to eat, and current temperature of the food.

Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and lay out your spread. 

Determine the best rung for the rack by considering these factors: shape and size of your food and how close you want it to the heating elements. Placing food close under the heating elements will offer up excellent crispy results. Great for fries, wings, pizza, and the like. 

Leave your oven door slightly ajar or the intense heat of the broiler will cause your food to burn before you can say, ""oh shit!""

Check often and give the food a chance to cool slightly. Plate it up and enjoy!

It's odor free, the (lawn) grass won't die, a place to hide it forever, inconspicuous, dogs can't find it, police won't bother, not difficult to dig up especially for a good high, and parents won't ever suspect it.


If you need to remember where you left it, leave a landmark of your choosing, draw a map that only you can understand, or dig the hole close to something you won't forget.

- Hide it in a hole under a stepping stone.

You'll never forget where it is, odor free, and not to mention that nobody ever lifts these up, nor would they ever dream of finding weed under them.

- Hide it in a blank disc holder (example photo: tinyurl.com/9bfuhv4).

Hide the ganja in the tube that runs up the discs. There should be an open hole at the bottom. Seal the bottom with something of your preference.

- Hide it in an old PC game box.

These never get picked up. A great place to hide it in the box is behind the manual or discs if there's enough room. Odor seal obviously not guaranteed.

- Drill or carve a compartment in an old Apple wall charger.

- Hide it inside of an old Sharpie magnum.

Take off the top, stuff the product inside the open chamber, put the cap back on. Odor seal guaranteed. ",,False,self,t5_2u279,1351054136.0,,,True,t3_11zolp,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/11zolp/never_get_busted_again/,

Simple as that. With a mflb 90% of these protips become irrelevant. 
Too expensive, you say? Compare the price to glass. Amazon sells these puppies for $77 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0029NRM2U/). Buy a grinder for $3 +s/h (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0023X32MA/). When you're done, sell it on Craigslist.org at original cost because most head shops sell it for $120. If you're wise you could be enjoying this phenomenal device at no cost, not to mention the money saved from all of the herb you conserve. 


To name a few advantages:
Never lose a lighter again. 

You can't imagine how much weed you conserve. An eighth lasts me two-three months of getting stoned daily. 

Stealthy like no other. Stick it inside a Capri sun and even a cop couldn't tell if you were toking right in front of him. 

Almost zero smell. Literally undetectable with high quality herb. 

No smoke. Vapor dissipates quickly and won't be visible if you mix dilute it with enough air. 

Healthiest way to get high. Saves your lungs. 

Produces cooked herb (avb) ready for a tincture (golden dragon) or edibles. 

And the list goes on and on. 

It's seriously life changing to realize you can get high any time, anywhere.

Oh holy shit I almost forgot my rule #1 - something I've not seen elsewhere. 

If you're not regularly cleaning your catcher, do not, under any circumstances, allow the grinder to maintain - even for a second - an upside-down position. Ever.

...

So here's what we've got: 

kief is a special treat that after a very long while;
           like receiving that unexpected gift.

add a coin into your grinder;
        ideally you need to get the lightest.

put the whole thing in your freezer over night;
         use a coin to shake around in the main chamber.

Grind up ya herbs and then put your grinder in a plastic bag;
        put it in the freezer for about half an hour;
  All of your trichs will freeze and fall to the bottom.

when cleaning it, put your grinder in the freezer for 20~30 mins;
         bang it on something hard.
the cold makes the crystals not stick.

Take your time to consider the ultimate stash spot: Stashing in socks or in a backpack that could get dug through isn't smart. Speaker cabinets, musical instrument cases with locks, and secret pockets in jackets are some of what works the best from my experience.
2. Don't be cheap when making choices that could cost you: never talk yourself out of buying eyedrops, spray, gum, or any needed item to keep yourself looking and seeming straight. It may hurt your cash flow, but consider it as necessary as buying the product itself. (a few of my friends wouldn't do this and it drove me nuts at the school I went to)
3. Be extremely careful when texting. Know your friends and whether or not they keep their phones on them. Getting caught for conversations pertaining to smoking and not even actually smoking blows. In the words of fellow ent Scott Weiland (stone temple pilots) conversations kill:)
4. Leave no paper trail. Keep your stuff stashed unless you intend to use. Spray down, use drops, spray where you hung out after blazing, clean up any traces of bud or suspicious items together (ie lighter, drops, spray. each of these can be stored separately even in the same backpack and their distance makes them non-sus). On a related note: check out how to make a 1 hitter out of steel zebra pens is cheaper than buying disposable ones, and works extremely well!! Pitch when done.
5. Get some in the field training before being around parents or unapproving family members after toking. Acting natural takes practice.
6. Find excellent spots. Taking a few scope out walks might be worth the reward of a smoke spot that puts the others to shame. Take a break from toking to nail down select spots that will be the least dangerous/ suspicious. Wooded areas, behind buildings with little traffic flow, and graveyards work great.
7. Enjoy the ride: I may sound like I'm overacting to play it super safe, but I only do it because I'm willing to make some sacrifices and work at it to be able to enjoy this great activity. If you find covering your tracks to be too much work/ get overnervious around parents or authority figures, it might be worth taking a break.

Some people use acetone, some people use specialized chemicals, some people boil it, but a surefire way to get your piece clean is isopropyl alcohol.

You'll find iso probably anywhere that you can get bandaids, really. The supermarket is a good idea but I always prefer to go to a drugstore like CVS, Walgreens or Rite Aid. They're more likely to have the higher concentrations.

You wanna get the highest concentration you can find. 91-~~98~~99% isopropyl alcohol is best. ~~98~~99% will clean your piece out like Chipotle on my intestines. That's the best you can get, albeit very rare. I've never actually seen any ~~98~~99% in stores, only online. 91% is good enough though. 70% will do a mediocre job but you have to be careful about what *kind* of alcohol it is.

There are two different kinds of isopropyl alcohols you'll find in stores. When you find the alcohol section, you'll see some bottles labeled ""Isopropyl Alcohol"" and some bottles labeled ""Rubbing Alcohol"". At my local drugstore, 70% comes in both normal and rubbing alcohol. Anything above is straight iso, anything below is always rubbing. ""Rubbing alcohol"" is fantastic for cuts and shit because it burns less and has some kind of oil in it to prevent over-drying your skin.

I think apple pipes are perfect. No noise, no suspicious trash. Just a little red ball you can toss into a bush and it will give back to the earth in a matter of days :)


Making them are as easy as hiding them too.
 First, take a pen and remove everything off of it. Keep the tube. Now drive it trough the middle of the apple and make sure it makes a clean tunnel through it that you can take a hit in. 

Then twist out the little stem thing on top and force a toothpick/paperclip from the middle until it hits the tunnel you made with a pen.  

You now have a pipe. Simply load the weed into the top where you poked the hole with the paper clip, put your finger over one of the holes and put your mouth on the other end. Light, suck, let off the hole to clear it, and you have just hit an apple pipe. 

Also, if you get caught, just throw your lighter and weed bag into an spot that isnt visible, and say you wanted to eat an apple out where it was calm and silent in the night.

Many methods have been heard, a few new ones I hope. From friends and weed forums and such. 


No smelling, no seeing, no hearing Stoping the senses from detecting weed

Weed, ofcourse, has a very noticable scent. Its what defines weed. It reminds you of fun times, but can get you caught just as good. You need to worry about containing it before you even think about smoking it. If your like me, a mason jar doesnt appear out of thin air, and doesnt hide well. I have snoopy parents who like to dig through almost everything. But i have yet to be caught. 
Pill bottles are life savers. They are air tight. Youve seen them on here, with the clear yellow bottle and white cap. They can slip into the corner of a top shelf in a closet behind junk and just dissapear. 
Other great containers are: small plastic casings for containing ear plugs, sealed in hi-lighters, and in small plastic bottles you can easily seal up and slip it under any trash you have in a closet (sunny D bottle= containers of champions) 

But my all time favorite is in video game boxes. Unlike console games, pc games get installed and the boxes are never to be seen again. You can put a small amount snug behind the disk, or in a box like diablo 3 box, under the little cardboard tray in the bottom of the box. I put some in my bioshock box or ect. and put it up in my extremely messy closet (i have 2 closets, a clothes closet and a junk closet) 

Also, in cd players, the empty battery compartment underneath that probably wont ever get used works wonders as well. I like to put some in an iphone box and put that in my closet as well. In fact, all of my stuff is in the closet. If you have an xbox 360 slim, the unused memory compartment (sliding thing on bottom, opens up but invisible) is also great, because my parents are techno-impaired. 

If you put weed in old jackets, use common sense. A gram in a coat pocket during winter is just asking for being stumbled upon. Swim suits are a big no-no during summer OR winter. Forget it, which is unlikely but possible. But youll regret it when an old bag of weed floats up at a family swim. 
I have some old pictures that i can put a little behind the picture. But the weed has to be a little flat.

Remember flat bud isnt very pretty, but it gets you high the same. As long as the bag doesnt pop, its ok. A thick, nice nug is good to look at, until your parents are holding it in disbelief as you stutter out a weak excuse that it isnt your weed.

Weed at school is awful and very very stupid. Do not bring any weed, lighters, or peices to school unless you love getting expelled. But lets say you want an away bag or what ever. The under armours with the zipping shoe holder id best. You can open the shoe thing, which is pretty much a bag in the bottom of the backpack that you can only get to from the shoe thing. Put it in the very end of the shoe thing, then fill the bag with clothes, ect. Its pracicly invisible if the bag has some stuff over it. 

Well after a mile long lesson, i hope you learned atleast 1 thing. comment with any questions or any other tips you know. Thanks.

*EDIT*

The bag I was talking about

The shoe bag part unzipped. You can see that it is a bag within the main bag part of the back pack.

I read so much about how high it gets people and how it'll help you conserve weed, so i had to buy it. I smoke a little more than a quad a week and my tolerance is pretty high. IF YOU ARE A HEAVY SMOKER, (like more than a quad a week) YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THE MFLB. It won't get you nearly as high as you thought and therefore you won't conserve as much weed, cus it takes a lot of weed to get high and takes so damn long to get high from the thing. It takes me about 5 or more trenches to get a decent high, but with the short battery life, that takes like a fuckin hour, so by the time you're done, the effects of the first few trenches have already worn off. The high that i get from the thing is very short lived and not that powerful. Seriously guys, if you are an experienced smoker and are considering buying this, either get a stronger desktop style vape or just keep using your bong/bowl/papers etc. I know this seems a little harsh, so my apologies to those of you who love your mflb. I'm sure it's the perfect device for some people, but if you're a big boy smoker, there's sooooooo many better ways to spend 80 bucks towards paraphernalia. Sorry it's a little long guys.

Things such as sploofs significantly reduce smell, but the smell is still very apparent to anyone who isn't in the room or has adjusted to the smell. Febreze/Ozium help mask the smell, but it doesn't eliminate the smell. Even vaporizers smell. Within an hour in a ventilated room all the smell will be gone, but not before that.

Also keep in mind that just because you don't smell it doesn't mean that somebody else can't. It takes less than a minute for you to adjust to a room's smell. People that don't smoke will also immediately recognize the smell, as they aren't used to it. 

There is no foolproof way to not smell. Just be smart, and don't do shit like smoke in your room with your parents home. If you have to question whether or not it's safe to do it, DON'T DO IT.

1) towel under the door

2) turn on the shower as hot as it can go and let it steam up the room 

3) turn on the fan

4) squeeze a bunch of shampoo into the shower where the water is hitting. the smell gets into the air and makes the room smell nice. fruity shampoo works the best (i like to use 'Axe Heat' because of how strong the scent is) if you can't smell the shampoo, then break it up in the shower using a loofah or something. that usually does the trick

5) make a sploof. for those that dont know what that is, just stuff some dryer sheets into a paper towel roll and that's it.

6) don't use a joint or blunt because they give off a lot of smoke and if your vent is weak, it might not do the job

7) when lighting your piece or using your vape or whatever, do it under the vent. if you are using a pipe, hold the pipe as close to the vent as possible after you take your hit so the smoke from the cherry goes up into the vent. blow your smoke through your sploof and into the vent.

8) once you are done smoking, do the shampoo thing again to get rid of any smell that is left in the room, then let the room sit for a few minutes

9) when you leave the room, exit as quickly as possible and shut the door. keep the vent on just to be sure.

that's it. my parents are very against smoking and i use this method nearly every day and i have never been caught. I know it looks like a lot of stuff to do just to smoke a bowl, but it really doesn't take that long and it's worth it to not get caught! 

happy toking!

I've recently been in the habit of enjoying $40 quarters of nice club mids. Due to easy access to this and our gravity bong, my tolerance has been pretty damn high lately.

That shit got me high in less then half the amount of bowls it would have taken with my other stuff. 

I'm planning on taking a T break after that crazy 4/20, but my question is this, in the long run, do you think it would be worth it to keep shelling out for the top shelf bud?

I've been using baby food bottles for a long time, Beechnut, not Gerber. I needed something to put the bud in because I was tired of the plastic bags - let's the smell out and does shit for keepin the moisture level stable. That was years ago. 

While I do have mason jars, today, I still use baby food bottles for smaller quantities. 2.5oz bottle will hold an 1/8 oz comfortably and a 1/4 oz tightly. 6oz jar will keep a half-ounce, easy. ,  It's that lining in the caps that really keeps the smell down. Shit just works.

And, if there's a smell, I usually put half alcohol, half water and just let it sit overnight. Shake it up a few times on the way. Rinse it all out. Boom, easy jar to keep your bud!

1346310046.0,56,self.StonerProTips,z2es2,[Long] My guide to toking while living at home ,72,16,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/z2es2/long_my_guide_to_toking_while_living_at_home/,"Some of you might say these are not all pro tips, and I am willing to agree. Some of the stuff here is common sense, but some people need nice concise guides to look at when it comes to this kind of thing.

As a reference, I do not live in a city or in an apartment but rather in a smaller town near a bigger city. You can somewhat modify this guide depending on where you live. This guide is also not optimal for people who want to wake and bake or smoke every other day. This is supposed to be a secret; the more times you toke, the more likely you are to get caught.

In this guide I will be going over three stages of toking: the Pre-Toke, the Toke, and the Post-Toke. To successfully not get caught, it is crucial to minimize risk in each stage.

Supplies Needed

* *A nice pipe (recommended) or a joint (not recommended)*

* *Lighter*

* *Eye drops*

* *Trees*

* *A CD or flat surface*

* *Car* (Optional)

* *Munchies* (Optional)

* *Ozium* (Highly recommended)

* *Box fan*  (Optional)

* *Dirty/sweaty clothes* (Optional, but recommended)


**The Pre-Toke**

You are not high yet; you have all your abilities at 100%. This stage should involve the most preparation and time.

1. * *Time*: As this guide is aimed toward college students who are home from break, at a community college, or living with parents post graduation, it is safe to assume that the most optimal time to do this is the weekends. I always recommend waiting until after your parents go to bed. This could mean 9-10 or a bit later.

2. * *Place*: I cannot stress this enough: Smoking inside is VERY risky, so do not try it. Find yourself a place near your house that is shielded from most angles and is not frequented late at night. As an example, I go to the corner of my backyard. There are some bushes there that I can blend in with and the sight lines are cut down. Other times I take a short walk to a park and go in between some conifers. If you combine this with #1, you will be virtually impossible to spot. It will be dark, you will be shielded, and people should not be coming by.

3. * *Food and Drink*: You are going to be hungry later. You are not high right now, so choose your food wisely and get it ready to go. Choose something that does not take much preparation. If you need to prepare something, make sure you do it before toking up. I personally use a pizza pizzaz and just buy a frozen pizza. The pizzaz has a timer (so you don't forget), and it can stay in your room so you aren't out wandering around the house.

4. * *Trees* Have your weed preground if possible and in a baggy. Put the baggy inside of a small pill bottle, and if possible, put a silica packet in with it just to be safe. You are going to be loading the bowl in the next part of this guide. For now you just need a small, air tight bottle for transport

5. * *Pipe or joint*: I will say right off the bat I recommend a pipe over a joint. Joints are easy to conceal, yes, but the smoke that comes off of them is way more than from a pipe. Choose a one hitter or a nice small pipe that fits in your pocket.

5a. * *OPTIONAL AND NOT RECOMMENED: Pre-Loaded Pipe*: I do not recommend this method, but I have used it before early on. Grind up your weed and load your bowl while at your house. Put a penny or quarter over the bowl and rubber band it there (double it over the top and bottom). Now you don't have to fiddle with it at your spot, but it is a much more obvious smell.

6. * *Optional: Sweaty Clothes*: What is this, you ask? Sweaty clothes? Yes, that's right. If you are a workout fiend like I am, you might have some pretty gross sweaty clothes sitting around waiting to be washed. These will come in handy later. Put them in your car if possible.

7. * *Optional: Car*: No, not to drive. Use the car to store your items after you are done. Get a small backpack or bag and put it in the trunk with a car freshener in it. Save this for later.

This ends the pre-toke stage. Everything should be set up to make your life easy when you get back. After all, it's nice to not have to think about what to do when you are high.

**The Toke Stage**

1. * *Gathering Supplies/Finding Spot*: Your pipe, lighter, eyedrops, and pill bottle full of weed should fit in your pockets. If you brought a CD along try to fit it in your pockets; otherwise carry it. Since you should not be going very far from your house and it is dark you should have no problem getting to your spot discretely. Take caution and look around to see if others are outside. If so, walk casually by and find another spot or take another way to your original spot.

2. * *At Your Spot* Start by organizing your items and making sure you are under the maximum amount of cover.. Keep your eye drops in your pocket for now. Get out your weed from the bottle and your pipe. If you brought a CD, this is where you use it. Put the opening in the center of the CD above your bowl. Carefully dump your trees on the CD and slide them into the bowl. If you have no CD, use the pill bottle cap to dump your trees onto, and then carefully load the bowl.

3. * *Enjoy your spoils* But first, take off your shirt so that the smoke does not soak into it. Take care to hold the bowl away from you if it is still lit or there is too much in the chamber. Alternatively, you can bring a penny or quarter with and cover the top of the bowl with that. Blow smoke away from you and into the wind if possible.

4. * *Leaving your spot* Put eyedrops in first. Check your pockets at least three times for your pipe, the pill bottle, the eyedrops, and the lighter. Now walk back to your house (remember, this shouldn't be very far away, but it should be far enough that most of the smell is left at the site.

**The Post Toke** 

1. * *Arriving back home* You still probably smell, even with the added precautions. This is where your car is very helpful. First stash all of your stuff in the bag you put there in step 7 of the pretoke. This will eliminate some of the odors coming in with you to your room. Just remember to get everything out before you travel the next day.

2. * *Changing clothes* In your car you should have a change of clothes. As noted in Pre-Toke step 6, sweaty clothes will at least help with covering up the smell. Put these on before going in the house. Sweaty clothes also help if there's a chance someone else is still up/got back up. If they ask you where you were, just say you were out for a quick run. It helps if you workout regularly so that the excuse is more plausible.

3. * *Showering* Boy, you should be tired from that long run you just went on. You NEED to hop in the shower somehow. I know it will make noise, but the beauty about this whole guide is that it fits with everything else. Nobody will question you showering if it's 1) Late at night and 2) You smell like sweat/came back from running. Have fun, showering is awesome!

4. * *Fuck Bitches, Acquire Snacks* Remember those munchies you had ready earlier? Grab them now. Go immediately to your room. This is why I like the pizza pizzaz. You can have a hot pizza made right in your room (plus the smell of the pizza helps).

5. * *Ozium* Spray Ozium in your room to neutralize any lingering particles. It's $4 at Walmart by the car fresheners.

6. * *Eat food, masturbate, play video games/watch funny videos* No explanation needed. Put some fans on for air circulation


Hopefully this guide helps some people. Not everyone can apply this guide to them. If you toke up often it's almost useless because someone might notice a pattern. If you are someone like me who only wants to have a relaxing Friday or Saturday night, this has worked out for me. It is by no means perfect, but I feel that it has a good synergy to it. Everything is for a reason, and every step assists in other steps.

It's not a great vaporizer, but does the trick, and is pretty cheap.
 
I have been trying out different heats/amounts of weed etc. and was just wondering if anyone else has any tips on using it/a similar type of vape?
 
Here are a few tips I'd give when vaping:
 
- Don't turn it to the max, the vape I use burns best at about half-heat (knob turned half-way). So try out different heats to see which burns the best.
- The weed should come out a dark brown colour, not black. If it comes out black, you have it too hot, or have been burning the weed for too long.
- It's better to do 2 small bowls instead of one big bowl - One big bowl usually doesn't burn all the weed.
- It can be quite harsh on your throat, so have a glass of water handy.
- The weed usually lasts for around 8 - 10 large hits. It has run out when you can no longer see any steam/vapour when you exhale.
- Have a stick or something handy to poke the vaped weed once you have finished - It sometimes sticks to the heating element. Don't try getting the weed out with your fingers, it's very hot!! (learnt this the hard way!)
- Clean it regularly - It tastes much better after it has been cleaned. If you are struggling to clean the glass, try using a toothbrush to get to the bits you can't reach, or fill it with water and a bit of lemon juice and leave it to soak.
- The vape I use usually needs about 3mins to warm-up before it is ready to smoke. It will vary depending on which vaporizer you are us using, but a good rule of thumb is leave it heating up, and when you see  smoke starting to seep out, it's ready to go - This is only for the cheaper vapes, more expensive ones will have their own timer/way of knowing when it's ready.
 
Anymore tips please feel free to post and I'll add them to this post.

I'm a fairly new smoker and had a few questions.  Maybe this is better suited on r/saplings but I think it fits in here as well.  So here is my situation.  I got a new bowl back in March and took it back to college.  There we would smoke it all the time.  It holds a lot of weed so at times if I was just sharing this between myself and one other person it was almost like too much for us to handle.  

But now I'm home for the summer and 2 things have changed.  The first is that I am now smoking much better weed.  It is obviously grown  much better, no seeds, good color and its nice and sticky.  The other change is that I now have a grinder.  When I use my grinder with my bowl, I've been turning the grinder until I can't hear the weed being ground anymore and the product is considerably more broken up than I could with my fingers but its not like its dust either.  Then when I go to smoke, Ill plug with an ungrounded bit and add the rest in.  I've also been packing it down pretty hard.  The problem is, this seems to be burning very fast.  Sometimes I'll only get like 2-3 good hits from it where this bowl has been able to do the same for 2-3 people from one bowl pack.  

TL;DR:
So I have several questions:
Can the weed be ground up too much so that it burns to quickly?
Does the way I press down make burning it away easier?  
I've also been getting better at cornering.  Is there any technique to this or is it just as simple as only exposing small sections to the flame?

Here's a pictorial guide, and I'm going to have to apologize for the lack of trees. I'm currently smoking through a couple grams of hash and let myself go dry on trees for the first time in a long time so that I can finish the hash.

**What you will need:**

* Papers.

* Something to pack with, the end of an identical pen works, but whatever you can do that will fit and wont tear your papers works too.

* Grinder (Well, you don't need this, but it's highly recommended to be efficient. You're going to want the consistency a grinder provides for this style of rolling)

* Marijuana

* Pen (Something that has one side that's an uninterrupted cylinder)

*Crutch optional, but I prefer them because I can smoke a joint without leaving a roach.

Alright, I'm going to illustrate this in text the best that I can.

Take one paper from the pack and wrap it around the end of the pen with as little of the paper in contact with the pen as possible. Think of it like your pen is wearing a really tall paper crown, or you're using your pen to make a base to an empty cylinder.

Instead of lining the end up perfectly, offset it slightly to make a cone.

I'm interjecting this here: Don't take the pen out until you've put your weed in, it acts as a base and gives you something to pack against.

Now get a bit of saliva worked up, put it on the tip of your tongue, and very delicately go down the gumming on the paper to seal it to the paper. If you're having difficulty, get a second pen and put it inside to give you something to apply pressure against. Use a liberal amount of saliva but don't make your cone soggy.

Now you have your shell, and it's ready for some trees. Grind 'em if you got 'em and stuff it in there. Pack it down with your preferred tool, repeat until full.

Spark and enjoy!

A lot of people think they're safe when cruising, because a cop can't tell which car it is if they smell it.  Fair enough, but if you're unlucky enough to be SEEN with it, then the cop will be on your car's ass pretty fast. 

Here's some tips to avoid any trouble at all.

**1. If you're going to cruise bring ONLY what you need: lighter, eye drops, mints/gum, and of course, the joint/blunt.**  

Don't be carrying around all of your weed, or some extra pieces.  If you get pulled over, it's much nicer to know that the cop has nothing on you (besides suspicion), and that even if he does search the car (which he can't) there isn't anything incriminating.

**2. Know your rights, don't let any officer search you or your car.**

Cops need a warrant to search your car, even if they tell you otherwise.  Chances are if you smell like weed, and if the officer thinks you still have it on you, and you are rejecting a car search, they'll threaten you with the k9 unit.  Obviously, if you have no weed on you, you are fine.  But if you still have some, you need to work on how to get it out of the car or ditch it.  

**3. Eye drops.**

They'll save you a LOT of trouble.  The cop will flash his light in your face, and he'll be checking out your eyes (mostly to make sure you're not drunk, but if they're fire red, he'll probably become suspicious of you being stoned).  If your eyes are pearly white, it's less suspicious. Just an obvious heads up.

**4. If you have friends in the car, which you probably do, make sure they shut the fuck up.**

It's easy to forget what's going on when you're baked, even with a cop right next to the car.  Believe me, I've seen it happen.  Tell them straight up as you're getting pulled over to keep their mouths shut, play on their phones, text people to keep occupied..but not to be running their mouths.  It's easy for someone to forget and just mention weed, and cause a huge fucking problem if the officer hears the conversation.  Just have them keep quiet, and keep you, and themselves out of trouble.

**5. Get your parent's (or your lawyer's) number ready to dial on your phone.**

In the event that shit is about to go down (i.e. you have weed on you and they're going to bring in the k9 unit, or they'regoing illegally search your car and your friend has weed) you can still put in a quick call and either let your lawyer or your parents know where you are, and what is about to happen.  Keep your cool, tell them which police department you're with, where you are, and if you're going to be arrested.  Keep it brief and to the point.  After that, (even if you're not arrested) you have the right to remain totally silent.  Enjoy that right.

Basically you put one hook in/on the ceiling in the corner, and then one above the smoking area. The lazy way is to get a box of dental floss, use it as the counter weight in the corner of the room, run it up through the corner hook and through the hook over the smoking area. Attach your lighter and seal the box of floss once you have a good length worked out, and the lighter will hang there. The video is my shitty attempt at explaining it. It's pretty self explanatory, but I haven't heard of anyone else who does this. I'm here for any questions you have :)

For you new ents out there, I am here to have you learn from some stupid things I did when I first started out.

1. Don't use A LOT of eyedrops. If you are anything like I am when stoned, it is hard to actually get them in your eyes. It takes practice. But if you put a ton in your eyes and you miss a lot, and then you go to wipe the eyedrops off your eyes, it will leave them redder than they were to begin with.

2. You do need to wipe your eyes after you are done. Whether you are stoned or not. But always be sure to do this with a soft and clean tissue. Don't make the mistake I did and dry my eyes with a bath towel.

3. This one is probably the most obvious, but still a hard one to do when high. Make sure that when you are going to put the eyedrops in, your eyes are ALL THE WAY OPEN. Use your pointer finger and thumb to separate the eyelids and then gently drop a drop or two of the eyedrops into your eyes.

4. Finally, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE EYE DROPS. Obviously this is an opinion here, but I personally really like using eyedrops when I'm high (if it is necessary) because it really is a cooling feeling on your eyes, and it feels *very* nice.

NOTE: I don't have an opinion on what eyedrops are the best to use for this. I just use whatever is cheapest or on sale at the time, etc. due to the fact I am on a low budget.

as fas as sexiness goes with smoke, its all in letting it out slooooooooow and not inhaling too deeply, to keep the smoke nice and thick keep it in your throat, or take a monstrous hit but good luck not coughing ;)

now onto my favorite smoke tricks!

smoke rings! 
i saw an ent on here describe doing a smoke ring as a VERY light cough, at the back of your throat, you know? and have your mouth in the shape of an O, obviously.
if youre lucky enough you can make a heart by snapping just above the smoke ring a couple seconds after it comes out, this creates a higher air pressure where you snapped, pushing the smoke down into an (almost) heart shape. i havent had much luck with it but hey, why not try it? :)

french inhale! (also called the irish waterfall, uptokes for anyone who can tell me why!)
this one seems really simple to me, but for some reason people seem to always screw it up when i try to explain it.
alright.
the key to this one is NOT to inhale directly from the joint/blunt/hookah/what have you. the idea is to suck the smoke into your moth by increasing the volume in your mouth, exactly like you would a soda through a straw, before swallowing. do this slowly for optimum smoke thickness. 
you want the smoke in your mouth and you wanna block off your airway to your mouth with your tongue so you breath exclusively through your nose.
now, youve got a mouth full of REALLY thick smoke, the idea now is to empty your lungs completely through your NOSE. since youve blocked off your airway to your mouth, youre breathing out exclusively through your NOSE.
now heres the hard part: you want to gently inhale through your nose while very slowly closing your jaw, forcing the smoke out. you wanna do this gently because it 'puffs' out more from your face and doesn't just go straight up into your nose (looks a lot thicker too).
a variant of the french inhale is to do everything the same but when you inhale through your nose, do it just a second after you start closing your jaw, and inhale just a little harder. its almost like a ghost inhale... but french for some reason. name suggestions for this trick will be uptoked! 'french ghost' maybe?

thats all i got time for now, but those two tricks are the most popular, most impressive, and simplest for me! try em out!!

It works great for producing consistent finely ground bud and can be purchased fairly inexpensively. Only draw backs: poor portability as it relies on electricity.

To use a coffee grinder effectively hold down the pulse button for only a second then check your bud. Repeat until you achieve the desired consistency. Once you have used the same grinder for a period of time you can just count the seconds to the exact coarseness you prefer. I go for about 4 seconds with mine. 

Special hidden gem: Get an unused toothbrush to clean out the keif, oh yes, there will be lots with this method.

If by some chance the cop does think you're high, at least you haven't been caught with weed/paraphernalia, and he can't make you go back to your car or ask to search your car.  Obviously you don't want to panic and run out of the car high off your ass if you see a cop in the distance, but just make it look like you are going on a peaceful walk or something (it helps if you smoke somewhere where going on a walk wouldn't be weird).

Pack a whole bowl. Then, while smoking the bowl, take a hit and wait 5 to 10 mins. Take like 3 in a row, and then wait in between. You will most likely feel high before the bowl gets cashed. Just put the bowl back in a baggy (it may be slightly burned. Its still good if you can pull smoke off of it) then do the rest later. You see, your probably getting high enough before the bowl is completely gone. That way your not burning a whole bowl, but your getting high. 

Also, ALWAYS HOLD IN YOUR HITS FOR 6 SECONDS. You should ALWAYS do this when smoking weed. You need to give the thc the time to be absorbed. 6 seconds is what I do. And not a fast 123456 rapid fire. I mean 1 mississippi, 2 mississippi, and so on. 


GET SOME OXYGEN. If the pipe has a carb, let off and then re-cover it quickly while you take your hit. That way, there is more oxygen, which will help get you higher. 


MANGOS. Its been posted 1000x times. I dont think I need to say anything else about it because you are going to eventually find it very quickly on here if you havnt already. 


DONT LET THE BOWL CHERRY. This is only for saving weed. After you hit the pipe, cover the bowl to stop it from glowing and burning. That way, while you recover from the hit, the bowl is not just burning away. Seal the carb and top completely to seal it. 


COUGH AFTERWARDS. Save those coughs for after you exhale the smoke. Coughing up while holding a hit will prevent you from getting the hit to its full potential. 

Have fun and remeber to be safe.

Hiding Your Weed

I personally had somewhat nosy parents when I was a teenager, but not too bad. I couldnt just toss weinto a drawer with my socks or tape it up somewhere. Mostly from paranoia, I had to hide it in clever places. I always hated the ""Hide it in plain sight"" stuff, because things out in the open get messed with, and when that happens, eventually the nosy parent/nosy sibling will find it. Having a brother or sister down with it can be greatly to your advantage, but we will discuss that later.

1. Under carpet
If you have a closet full of junk, and your room is carpeted, you can go into said closet and find any corner to your liking. Take a knife or pen or anything else, and work with the carpet until you can peel it up off of the tacks. Only pull it a few inches, and cut away a small amount of the padding underneath. Slip your bag/pipe/lighter/what ever ito the spot if it will fit, move the carpet back over the corner, and make sure it looks normal. Throw some junk over it too. Be careful when getting things out of this spot, becase you can easily be pricked on the hand by one of the carpet tacks. 

2. Deoderant stick

This method is easier, and also useful
for transfering small amouts of weed. I reccomend getting a stick you dont use often, and spin the thing on the bottom until the deoderant thing can be pulled out. There should be a holder thing under the deoderant. Remove that too. Put the bag down inside, and put the stick back in but not the holder. Then if you need to get to the weed, instead of sitting there spinning it, just like swing it outwards and the deoderant should slip outwards. Pull it out and grab the bag. 

3. Computer/xbox slim

Most windows computers can be opened. Simply place the bag inside and put the computer back together. Very easy and secret. 

If you have an xbox 360 slim, the top of it can be pryed off and then another layer pryed out. Be careful so that you dont damage the hardware. Just set the bag safely inside and reseal.

1336882505.0,42,self.StonerProTips,tkkhx,Pro Tips For Outdoor Inner City Toking,43,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/tkkhx/pro_tips_for_outdoor_inner_city_toking/,"As an outdoor toker for several years in NYC, I feel I should share some tips.

I can't smoke in my parents’ house, I'm not at my frients' house on a daily basis, I don’t have a rooftop or backyard accessible to me, so I'm forced to walk around public and populated places while toking. My usual spot is literally a block away from a police precinct. Here's what I've learned as an inner borough and city smoker:

1. Only bring out the stuff you're going to smoke, pre-rolled. Rolling up in public exposes you, diverts your attention, and is the most dangerous part of the outdoor smoking experience. Bowls with resin are too incriminating. If you suddenly find yourself in a pinch, all you have to do is eat the stuff and walk away free.

2. Find a secluded spot where you can toke and not be noticed. Roofs and backyards are great, but oftentimes those options aren’t available. Dark alleys make for good spots, but most of them have stupid motion detectors that light up the alley like it’s daytime. City parks and schoolyards are great at night since they’re mostly vacant (the dog people don’t even notice me there). Whatever your spot is, make sure you have a good vantage point where you can spot cars and people before they spot you. If you have a 30 second advantage over the cops, you have time to swallow your stuff.

3. Darkness is your friend. It sounds obvious, but there are levels of darkness. The night is darkest when there is no moon or clouds. When the moon is out, it illuminates the areas normally covered in shadow. It's suggested you wear navy instead of black at night, because of the bluish hue of the night sky. Street lights don't normally illuminate dark areas when the sky is clear, but when there is heavy cloud cover, the street lights reflect off the clouds, turning the clouds into orange blobs which illuminate the ground and shadows. If the moon is out and it's cloudy, it's extremely difficult to use cover of darkness as an advantage.

4. The human eye is a wonderful device, but has many flaws that you should take advantage of. First of all, the eye searches for light, which is why your spot should be in a dark shaded area. Cell phone use will blow up your spot. So will flicking your lighter, and even the little cherry at the end of your joint can be spotted in pitch blackness. When in a dark area, your pupils dilate to allow more light, ie you see better at night. Conversely, your pupils contract when exposed to light, so less light is allowed in. Put together, if you’re in a spot that’s dark, and someone is standing by a lit area, that person is able to see far less into the night than you can. At the park I smoke in, you can spot me if you’re inside, but not if you’re outside because of the street lights. Lastly, the human eye is designed to track movement and largely ignore anything standing still. If you’re being approached, don’t freak out and scramble. Just freeze, and it’s likely they won’t know you’re there until they’re a few yards away. However, if you know they’re specifically approaching you, standing still won’t help. Swallow your stuff or run.

5. When driving, people look at the road. Sounds obvious, but this can definitely be used to your advantage. Stay off the roads. The ideal spot, again, is inside a park or schoolyard if no other options are available to you. Only police, on patrol, will look out the side window into these areas. It is a little known fact that police vehicles have stealth engines. They do not rumble or make noise when driving. This is extremely important to know because my friends wonder why cops appear suddenly out of nowhere. A way around this stealth is the “shucking” sound the tires make on the pavement when the car is in motion. That, too, is muffled on police cars, but when the ground is wet you can hear a car coming from several blocks away.

6. Know police behavior. Know how to spot an undercover car (the antennas and heavy tints are a giveaway).  I personally know the patrol routes in my neighborhood. If they’re coming up a block they don’t normally patrol, chances are they’re coming for me. Also, cops are itching for an arrest. Sometimes I get spooked when a car stops a few yards away from where I’m smoking, but no one gets out. If they were cops, and they seriously thought they spotted me smoking, they would jump out of the car in a heartbeat. 

7. Neighbors are not cops. Snitches exist, but when I’m spotted by a normal citizen I just keep toking. If they ask you to move, be polite and respectful. The worst they can do is threaten to call the police, and in all my years no one has done that, because it’s totally futile. By the time the cops arrive, I’ll be done toking and not have a single nugget on me.

This guide is tailored for inner-city types like myself, and these techniques have helped me avoid arrest for several years. I wrote this because I felt like I should share what I’ve learned so that my fellow ENTs can avoid incarceration.

1336596331.0,37,self.StonerProTips,tfad9,A few tips regarding Red Eyes,44,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/tfad9/a_few_tips_regarding_red_eyes/,"Red eyes: we've all had 'em, we all hate 'em. They give away our highness, draw attention and in general don't look so nice. Fortunately someone invented eyedrops. Here's a few tips.

1. If you smoke weed for long enough without using eyedrops, your eyes will eventually stop getting as red as they once did. This might not work for everyone, but I can say from the experience of my friends and I that it does happen. My eyes pretty much don't change at all when I smoke now. Obviously the big problem here is that most ents don't have time to build up an eye tolerance, because they can't afford to let people see them with red eyes. Once you are in a living situation where you don't have to worry about that, you will see the change.

2. There are two big factors that make your eyes red when you smoke weed. The first is the [vasodilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation) effect of THC. THC causes the normally thin and hidden blood vessels in our eyes to swell up and become visible when we smoke(it also makes all the bloodvessels in your body swell, which you may have noticed in the form of a [stoner-boner](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stoner%20boner)). The second factor is the smoke acting as an [irritant to the eyes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis). Just like sand or eyelashes cause your eyes to turn red, so do the hot particles of smoke. It is important to remember than even if you have smoked for a long time and no longer get red eyes due to THC, irritation from smoke will still cause red eyes. So be careful when you are hotboxing(bring goggles?)

3. Lastly, we all know how hard it can be to put eyedrops in. It's like playing darts, except the board is your eyeball. So I whipped up a little diagram to show you how I do it. [How to use eye drops.](http://i.imgur.com/bopVu.png)

After seeing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIHa4Jm3kWU these Ryo Cones, I decided to make my own.

**Step 1**: Take 1/2 a piece of regular piece of printing paper and roll it into a cone shape and tape it. Like so:

 http://imgur.com/D5sRKMi 

Try to roll it smoother than mine. You will notice there is a bunch of paper bunched in your cone. Hence, the next step.

**Step 2**: Roll another half piece of paper over your first cone and tape it. Like so: 

http://imgur.com/lZzxTy4 

Remove your second cone, this time it should be hollow.

**Step 3**: Take your hollow cone, and cut a slit at the pointy end about a 1/2 inch. This will be where you slide your crutch. 

http://imgur.com/1iZx3Qd 

**Step 4**: Trim away excess paper, leave enough for a king sized paper.

Final Product Should be a hollow cone with a slit at the pointy end of the cone.

**How to use**:

1. roll crutch and insert into slit, with end sticking out. http://imgur.com/28Idq4m 

2. Roll a king sized paper around the cone, lick gum from outside. http://imgur.com/dcYRYQc 

3. Poke the crutch out of your rig with something narrow and long. The crutch should expand once pushed out.

Result: prerolled cone. http://imgur.com/1IVL9Zr 

Now, all you have to do is fill and pack.

It hurts sometimes, and can really ruin your high. Plus noone likes to smoke with a kid that coughs after every hit, so for those who tend to cough often during a sesh, heres a couple tips
: 1. Have a teaspoon of honey, or a halls right before you smoke, it lubricates and soothes your throat so the smoke isnt so irritating

  2. Joints and blunts have the harshest smoke, followed by dry peices, then water pipes, then vapes.

  3. If you do cough, have a drink of water and just sit out for a minute or two to let your lungs rest.

  4. Dont take a hit that you can't handle, its better to take 3 moderatley sized rips than one mega bong hit that will just make you hack up a storm.

Question to those who are living in a condo/apartment. I will be living on the first floor of a 4 story building, my GF and i are both tree smokers. We're in good ole Canada(MTL) so it's pretty lenient towards that kind of stuff, however moving into a new building i don't want to cause any problems with my neighbors.

SO, fellow Ents, what are your tips/tricks/methods on keeping the smell within your place? I normally smoke joints and i know some ways of masking it (incenses/towel roll with dryer sheets)
i'll take any help i can get!

* Don't bogart (hold) the joint for too long or (1) it will go out or (2) people will get tired of your long story and interupt you to pass or hit it.
* Match whenever you can, or thank whoever smoked you out
* Don't purposefully steal lighters
* remove the safety of lighters (so everyone knows you're an ent!)
* Finally, please don't brag about how much you smoke. No one gives a fuck.

Just some basics new ents should know. I taught by brother these things recently when he began to smoke, and people think he's been smoking for awhile just because he knows what he's doing.

Next time you're out and about, hit the dollar store and grab a cheap kitchen timer.  Grab a couple, even.  Keep them handy in your smoking room and use the timers to remind you to check on the pizza in the oven, the water boiling for ramen or mushroom tea, or the Coke you put in the freezer.  This simple and cheap safeguard may save you from a fire/smoke damaged kitchen or a sticky mess in the freezer.

1. (Super obvious) Just lift that J above the window, and keep it there unless you're toking obviously. Smoke goes upwards, and it won't brush back into your room. Toke with your head tilted upwards so that all of that goes up too. I know it's basic but it took me even a while to realise.

2. Use a towel/shirt/clothing to cover the bottom crack of your door. It helps both block the light (If you want to appear to be asleep maybe) and prevent a smell from getting out. Which gives you an opportunity to spray the shit out of your room and/or opening up all your windows to air out.

3. Keep some windows open all night. Keeps a circulation going, meaning by the morning the smell will all be gone.

get a bottle of isopropyl alcohol [91% or higher] and some sandwich baggies [the ones that seal].

place one piece in a plastic baggie. fill baggie up to choke hole of piece with iso. close baggie. don't worry about getting air out of the baggie, some air is actually helpful.

place this sealed baggie inside of another baggie. this helps prevent leakage in baggie #1. close baggie 2 around baggie 1. shake gently. let sit for ~30 min. shake a bit vigorously. let sit an hour. shake. let sit for a little longer, then shake and take your piece out.

run it under warm [NOT hot] water and shake the water around until all resin is out.

strain the now-brown iso through a coffee filter.

pour liquid onto a non-porous surface [I use a small glass plate].

let sit in airy area. cracked windowsill is very preferable, but on top of a dresser or something works. just make sure it's not low to the ground because that iso is going to evaporate and then everything is going to smell like rubbing alcohol.

now, this is a very important step. wait. it's going to take some time depending on amount of liquid and location and surface. in an ideal and airy location, it takes about 12 hours. it can take up to a week.

when it's pretty much dry, with just a bit of dampness left, it's time to grab an old gift card or student ID or something that you don't use any more. now, start scraping. it's going to take time and it's going to be a bit frustrating til you get a good scraping technique down, but you will.

some scraping tips:

    don't try to get any off of the card for a little while. let it build up

    don't get discouraged if you can't get it all off. just wait til the end, pour a little iso on it, scrape the liquid to the middle and let it sit again.

next, you need to collect it. stick the hash-heavy card into a fridge or freezer. let sit for about an hour. make sure the hashy bit isn't touching anything, by the way. it's gonna be very sticky.

after an hour, get some wax paper and scrape the now-hardened hash off of the card using something like a razor blade or your coke nail or whatever onto that paper. pause to roll the bits together between scrapes so that it builds up without giving you sticky fingers.

once it's all collected, fold that ball up in the paper nice and flat. any time you want to use it, stick it in the fridge or freezer for a bit, and then pull bits off as needed.

I might have little knowledge on some things but, hey better than nothing.
Ready, set, go.

For the ents with steamrollers:

Hit the pipe like normal, hold it, remove the bowl, and exhale back in the pipe. Once done with the first hit, inhale from the pipe again. This one is good for ENTS that are forced to ration bud. I've gotten to an easy [3] this way.

Joint/blunt tokers:

These tips could be used in theory for joints and blunts so, I've grouped them.

Tip 1:
While smoking, lightly press the cherry end with the metal part of your lighter flat. The compressed cherry will cause the smoke to condense and as a result, smoother smoke.

Tip 2:
Might be a given but, try not to get the opposite end (The one your lips are on.) Wet. ~~Nigga-lipping~~ ""Swamping"" won't get you many kudos when co-opping a J or a B. Nigga-lipping causes the tar inhaled to mix with saliva and become liquid. Not fun, tastes horrible.

Tip 3:
Try to keep the leaf (The paper that wraps around the bud; be it a J or B) from becoming anything else than cylindrical. It's easier to hold and smoke.

Tip 4:
Don't flick a B like a cigarette to ash it. Blunts smoke slower so, keep smoking until the ash is about as long as the tip of your pinky then, VERY LIGHTLY tap it to ash it. That way, you don't lose the cherry, or any usable bud.

Tip 5:
When smoking and down to the roach, use something similar to a bobby pin to hold the roach to smoke. Or, throw the roach into a bong.

Speaking of bongs,

Bong tokers:

Tip 1:
Some tokers I know have long lamented about not knowing how much water to fill the bong with. I've experimented with different levels of water with different bongs. Fill until the stem is about 1.5 to 2cm immersed in water.

Tip 2:
When lighting the bowl, the air being sucked into the bong should draw the flame of your lighter, hemp wick, whatever into the bowl. If you put the flame too close to the bowl, you risk torching (actual BURNING of the trees) and having the side of your thumb singed. Let the bowl properly light by itself. It should light sufficiently enough to hit it but not cherry.

Tip 3:
More as a rule of thumb, ONLY under VERY EXTREME circumstance should you EVER drink bong water.

Thanks for reading, I'll post smaller .self posts with everyday tips on smoking. I just wanted to post the bulk of it now.

Also, any more tips in the comments are appreciated and encouraged. I hope to merge all of the protips into one mega-post as a sort of ""Helping hand for new ENTS rulebook Vol: 1""

1337651640.0,32,self.StonerProTips,tyjh8,A (not so) brief guide to cleaning glass,39,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/tyjh8/a_not_so_brief_guide_to_cleaning_glass/,"Hello Ents! There's nothing that matches the feeling of taking a fat rip out of a brand new piece of glass. But what about when your piece starts to stink? Slide gets clogged? With these steps, you too can have your pipe or bong looking like it just came home from the head shop.

**If you want to skip all the theory and get right down to the nitty gritty, please advance to number four or the tl;dr section below**

**1. Why is this so hard to clean?**

If you've ever tried to clean a piece before, chances are you reached for water and dish detergent. Wash your bowl just like all your other bowls, hm? While this method will perhaps mask the scent coming off your piece and remove a bit of brown liquid, the brown and black gunk will remain stuck on, no matter how hard you might pry and scrape. This is because resin, due to its chemical makeup, is not water soluble. Water is useful for breaking ionic bonds, like those found in salts, but not so great for weed related chemistry. This is similar in concept to why one must use oil or fat when extracting weed.

What DOES dissolve resin is alcohol. All different kinds of alcohol, whether it be isopropyl rubbing alcohol or the vodka you find in your liquor cabinet, are effective in removing resin from glass. And the results are quite dramatic.

Look for something that has a high concentration of alcohol, because as we've already established, the water in the solution isn't going to be effective. 99% isopropyl alcohol is very effective, and relatively inexpensive (I picked up a litre for $10 CAD, but your mileage may vary). **However, I found that alcohol based mouthwash is the best substance for cleaning resin off of glass.** With that in mind, let's establish some basic tips.

**2. A warning**

This process is messy and very, very smelly. I mean it. Isopropyl dissolved resin will stink up a house or dorm room like nothing else. Wait until you have a few hours away from anyone who you don't want to know, and don't clean in a place where evidence will be found. I recommend a well ventilated area with access to sink or other type of drain, as well as a nearby garbage. Outdoors or in your garage are good.

**3. Materials**

* Alcohol based solvent. As I already mentioned, mouthwash is my secret weapon. It cleans better, masks the smell of resin and isn't as harsh to the skin as isopropyl. Scent is up to personal preference.

* Rice. Alcohol isn't always enough to get your gunk out, you'll want an agitator as well. Rice works well for larger chambers, like bongs. A word of warning, though: rice is sometimes very difficult to remove from glassware, and I would avoid using it for pipes, bubblers and percolators.

* Pipe cleaners: as some have pointed out here before, this was the very purpose for these bad boys long before they were being twisted into arts and crafts. Go to a tobacconist and look for the kind actually designed for cleaning pipes. They are more sturdy and will clean better. Watch out, though, some contain copper fibre that MAY damage your glass.

* Cotton swabs: great for detail work, like bowls and stems.

* Containers of various sizes: this will be used for submerging smaller items. For best results when bong cleaning, find something large enough to submerge your bong, as well. This will require lots of alcohol, but it will be worth it.

* Rubber gloves: optional, but a nice luxury. I recommend the CSI style latex gloves, but heavy duty rubber gloves will work as well. You may run into a problem with these breaking apart in alcohol, but I used latex gloves and Listerine, and I was fine.

**4. Okay, let's do this already!**
I agree.

* If you're cleaning a bong, disassemble it. This means remove the bowl and the stem and any other pieces you may have.

* Place the smaller items in a container and fill with mouthwash. Fill bong with mouthwash, as best as you can. You may need to plug various holes with something. Cork or carrot work well.

* Let sit for a bit. Go watch an episode of South Park or My Little Pony or whatever.

* For bowls, stems and pipes, use a pipe cleaner or cotton swab to scrape out the inside.

* For the bong, add rice into the mouthwash. I start with about half a cup, but amount required will vary by size of piece. Cover all holes and shake the fuck out of your piece. Be careful during this step, lest it slip and break. The idea is that the rice rubs up against the walls where the resin is most concentrated.
*Repeat as required until the resin is gone.

* Clean the piece with soap and water. This will remove any alcohol or resin scent left over after the cleaning process.

**tl;dr To clean your glass, soak it in alcohol based mouthwash and then agitate the shit out of the resin. This can be done with pipe cleaners, cotton swabs or rice. Repeat until clean. Watch out for narcs because this process is very conspicuous and smells a lot.**

There you go, everybody! Just my personal method that I've had a lot of success with. I'd also like to take this opportunity to spark up a conversation about your own personal tips and tricks for cleaning pieces. Something I've got wrong? Something you want to add?

Something I've found to make it easier if you're finding it a bit tricky:

Roll the horizontal joint with a roach as well.

Obviously take the additional length of joint into account when deciding how far you push it through. Then once you're done, chop off the roach with some scissors.

Happy smoking!

EDIT: Something I forgot to say, you'll want to make the roach a little thicker than you normally might. When I normally roll a joint i have a relatively thin roach, to make for a nicer cone. However, you're gonna be wanting to roll the second joint nice and straight; a cone's no good.

I know a lot of the younger Ents like to speed around in their sweet tricked out whips, but that just makes you a bigger suspect for speeding, reckless driving, and more reasons for the cops to pull you over.

- Look up the law, see how tinted you can make your windows before it's a crime. Tinting your windows can also cause suspicion, so watch out. 

- no fancy body kits, crazy paint jobs, or massive spoilers.

- while tricked out rides are suspicious, so is 4 kids piled in a rusty pile of doo doo butter. Keep your car clean and presentable. 

- Try to keep it as stock as possible.

- Subwoofers do nothing but draw attention for no reason. In wisconsin you can get a disturbing the peace ticket for music that's ridiculously loud.

- Don't put ""legalize it"" bumper stickers or any drug/anti-establishment advertisements on your car. If I were a cop I'd pull over the car with ""fuck the police"" across the bumper way before I pull over the clean car with 4 guys smoking cigarettes and laughing. 

Ok, so that's my wisdom for saplings when it comes to exterior appearance of your car. My personal experience:

I drove a ford focus with underglow, tinted windows, a body kid, and a spoiler. I also had 2 500 watt subs in the trunk. I got pulled over for illegal tint level and ended up getting 3 different tickets for my car and a possession of paraphernalia ticket. I now drive a 2001 minivan. It's probably the best vehicle I've ever owned. It gets decent gas mileage, it comes stock with tinted back windows, and no cop suspects a guy driving a minivan (guy driving a minivan=kids=dads don't smoke weed... where theres kids..). I also took out the back row of seats, so there's room for 5 people, plus there's a space in the back to make a hookah circle. 

Ok now I'm just gonna throw down the Wisco rules for cruising in case anyone doesn't know yet:

- Driver picks music

- Shotgun packs/rolls

- If you don't know how to pack/roll, don't sit shotgun

- Whoever calls shotgun gets it, unless the driver picks someone else

- Puff puff on joints/blunts, PUFF on pipes.

- If you don't get a good hit, you fix the problem (ie. pack it down, ash it, cash it out, etc.)

- If there is one bit of slobber on the joint/blunt/piece you get punched in the arm, but never skipped.

- Don't cry wolf, only say cop related things if theres a cop in sight. 

- Don't fuck with people in the car, you're all high there's no need to talk down to someone who's higher than you.

- Stay active in the group. If you're in the car, you should be talking with everyone. 

- If you feel sick, say something before it's too late. 

- Don't bring alcohol in the car. Cops can give the driver a ticket for having open containers in the car.

- No matter how many rules someone breaks, they do not get skipped in the rotation. If they did something bad enough to miss a turn, they shouldn't be in the car in the first place. 

- GOLDEN RULE - Driver makes all rules. If the driver has rules about his car (ie. no hot boxing, no cigarettes, etc.) you follow those bastards like they're the ten mother fucking commandments.

Now all you have to do is load up your nugs into the removable top section then put the lower section of teeth on top with the holes facing upwards so nothing fall out. Grind for 10 minutes with it upside down then knock out all the bud onto a piece of paper, to get all the tiny pieces use your brush that came with it. The best way to ensure that you get super fine grind is throw in more bud then you're going to need for 1 trench. I usually grind up 3-4 trenches worth just to get it ""powdery"".

You are getting drug tested soon. You're probably nervous and scared. Well don't be dammit. Don't waste money on expensive detox kits that will work, but are priced exponentially more than my method which has aided my friEnts and I for 6+ years. I keep seeing posts of people freaking out when they should relax. (Please sticky this friggin post or something bajeezus).

Firstly, go scrounge up some loose change from your couch and piggy bank and swing by the nearest grocery store and pick up Sur-Jell or Certo from the ""jello"" aisle. Either or, doesn't matter, both are one and the same, different type of matter (gel/powder). Now swing by the juice/drink aisle and get yourself two powerades/gatorades. Pay the cashier/clerk a whopping $6-8 for your makeshift detox kit.
Drug testing day. 2 hours before testing, mix 1 packet of your gel/powder with 1 drink. 1:1 ratio...not that hard. If you workout and take supplements it shouldn't be a problem swallowing down that delicious mix. Tastes like diluted thick gator/powerade. Finish your first drink, mix another, same as before 1:1 ratio and hold that precious urine inside you until after you finish your SECOND drink (drink both without peeing). Urinate after you have finished both drinks and an hour before your test, 30 minutes after that glorious dirty first pee, force some more pee out before you start driving then head on over the clinic/urine people. Piss freely and trouble free. I hope this helps. If you want some scientific jargon to prove this works fcking google.
Toke on.

TL;DR Sur-Jel/Certo, drink 2 gatorades with 1 packet in each gatorade. Don't pee until after drinking both and before drug test. Pee twice before the big finale so urine that's coming out at testing facility will be coated with gel.

Heres how I sneak out for a bowl or 2. 

The day before or when ever:
Find a door or window that is silent when your parents arent home. 

Find a tree or spot that has a place to put your trees and lighter if your parents come out. Make sure there some distance between it and the house so the smell.

That night:
Use dirty laundy and pillows to make a figure in your bed. If you have brown hair, put a brownish or dark shirt up and make it hardly visible when your standing at or just inside the door (unless your parents walk straight up to see if your asleep.)
 If you sleep with the tv on, keep it at the usual volume at night. Maybe turn the tvs brightness down so you cant tell the bodies are fake. 
Then pack the bowl or roll the joint and get the lighter. Set the pipe down and silent walk out to make sure your parents are asleep. Then get the pipe, put the side of the lighter over the bowl (keeping the weed from spilling, and stopping wind from blowing it away)
Gently unlock and open the door. 
Open it up only enough to get through, and, with the handle still turned on the outside, close the door (where it doesnt snap when the door closes.) then walk to the tree that you chose. Turn your back to the wind and quickly smoke. Occasionally look at the door. 
Return inside, put everything back in its place, remove your clothes, and lay down or what ever you do while high. 

IF YOUR PARENT WALKS OUT WHILE YOUR OUTSIDE: Immediatly seal the bowl with your thumb. Quicky and carefully set the stuff in the spot you chose, and say its you to your parent. Tell them you heard there would be an eclipse or meteor shower or something and tell them you didnt want to wake them up (if they ask about the fake bodies, say you didnt want them to worry because you would only be in the yard) leave the stuff outside and go back in with them. Way later, run out super fast and grab the stuff and return quietly, or get it the next day.

I hope theese tips help.

If you are new to rolling and think you suck or have never attempted before, I have a nearly foolproof/newbproof/almostidiotproof method. You start out with a dollar bill. Fold it along the middle, the opposite direction you would if you were breaking up tree on it. Place some finely ground weed on it and begin to even out the pile. Roll the weed back and forth a bit with your thumbs. it will start to form a cylinder that is all stuck together. Place a joint paper with the gluestrip facing you right behind the pile/weed cylinder. use the same rolling motion as before, and than begin to use this rolling motion upwards all the way up the dollar, with your thumbs never leaving the soon to become joint. Make sure that your paper is never scrunched up because this will cause your joint to run.  When i notice my joint has a bunched up part I roll it backwards a bit and pull on the top of the paper to even and straighten it out. when you get your joint all rolled up to the glue strip. like it and roll it all the way up. When done correctly, this method gives you a perfect J every time. Make sure not to roll it to tightly, as it is easy to do so with this method.

Now, I know alot of people here advise against smoking in your dorm room, and rightfully so as there are plenty of serious risks, depending on how strict your school's drug policy is. This is simply for those willing to take the risk, as I believe it is the safest way to do so. My frients and I successfully toked almost everyday of last semester in a very small room without a single run-in with RA's or law enforcement. Here are my tips:

The Set-up: Put a fan in your window, facing outwards. Make a sploof by stuffing dryer sheets in an empty paper towel roll. Towel the door.

The Toking: The most important part of the operation: PACK SNAP BOWLS. This means pack just enough greens for your own hit and make sure you snap it through (but without sucking too hard and snapping still-green trees). This step assures that nearly no smoke is released into the room, thus minimal smell. Once you've finished your hit, exhale through the sploof, into the fan facing out the window (or ghost it if you're a badass). 

Aftermath: Spray some febreze for good measure and do whatever it is you love to do when you're stoned. Personally, this means turn on some chill music and play super smash bros. Most importantly, enjoy the high and don't sketch out- if you did everything right, you won't get caught.

P.S. don't get lazy and skip a step

TL;DR: Pack snap bowls, blow smoke out sploof, through fan, through window, febreze and of course don't forget to bring a towel.

First, you need a length of plastic tubing or garden hose.  About a yard should do the trick.  Wrap tape around one end so you know which end will go in your mouth.

Next go into your bathroom.  If you want to be extremely careful, put a towel under the door and turn on the fan.  Take the non-mouth end of the tube and shove it down the toilet.  (just trust me on this, it works)  Try blowing through the tube. If the water bubbles, you need to go deeper.  When the tube is far enough down the drain, (and don't worry, it's not that hard to do) you will be able to breathe freely through the tube.

At this point, the tube has gone past the gas trap in your toilet.  When you exhale through the tube, the smoke goes into the drainage system of your house.  Since all drains have gas traps installed, ([that U-shaped pipe] (http://www.structuretech1.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P-trap-explained.jpg) under your sink) the smoke will not come through other drains.  It will simply flow up through the vent on your roof!  

No smell whatsoever, it all exits the house/apartment/whatever you live in through the pipes!  Cool right?  Perfect for hotel or dorm rooms",,False,self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,t3_1kbo8f,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/1kbo8f/the_most_fail_proof_way_to_smoke_indoors_with_no/,

1. Use incense to mask the smell of pot after smoking... (you will be amazed how well this works!!)

2. When cleaning a bong, use a methylated spirits/terpentine and some (uncooked) rice. Swish it around. Then use bi-carb soda to get rid of that foul taste.

3. If you spill the mix on the carpet, do not fear. Take a tea towell and cover the end of a vacuum cleaner, you will be able to pick up all of the weed. Remove hairs before smoking.

4. If you have a lot of weed, keep it in the fridge. This will prevent it from going mouldy (trust me, it sucks). 

5. A roach is the heart of every jay. Take your time to roll a decent roach!

6. Invest in some Clear Eyes (or other general purpose eye-drops) if you don't want to look like a red-eyed tree frog after smoking. Can be bought at any chemist.

7. Share your weed! Pretty sure it was made for sharing.

2. for bong with a carb hole (bongs with a slide too i suppose), you can put 2 fingers over the bowl after you hit it, thus cuting off the oxygen and instantly preventing the weed from continuously cherrying and burning (also why you dont get burned even when its red hot).

3. Invest in a GLASS bong with an ICE CATCHER, you wont regret it.

4. To clean a glass bong, just throw in some rubbing alchohol and coarse salt, cover up big openings and shake away, you can get looking brand new in no time.

5.  The water in a bong should never be so cold that you cant handle it, this can lead to a cracked bong***

6. Seperate your hit into 2 parts if you dont want to take an extreme hit that you just went for over-ambitiously, inhaling until your lungs are decently filled while leaving some smoke in the bong (cover bong while exhaling to keep smoke in), and quickly clear it with your second ""hit""

7. Invest in screens or a narrower slide if your weed always pulls through prematurely

A plastic bag is worthless at storing dank for a long period of time, use them only for transportation if you can, though this tip will still help if you have to use a plastic bag. A hard container protects your buds from getting squished and otherwise damaged so you'll end up with less shake and more of the THC crystals staying on the buds as opposed to rubbing off and sticking to a bag. Note that when you squish buds (think of weed that's been compressed into a hard brick), you're squeezing out moisture so it'll dry out faster and be harsher to smoke. Mason jars are the best container because they are air tight, sealing in smell and moisture, this in itself will help keep your weed fresher than would be otherwise. The next step is to take a slice of an orange peel (just the skin, not the actual orange) and put it in said jar. There is just enough moisture in the orange peel which serves to humidify the mason jar a bit as the peel dries out. This way, it's the peel that looses its moisture, not your weed. It'll stay moist and sticky for a lot longer than it would normally and will give it a hint of an nice orangey smell, which is also useful if you need to be cutty and hide the smell of your dankness. Just be sure to keep an eye on the peel, it is perishable so will need to be replaced from time to time. This is especially useful if you're buying large quantities (like an O) of tree that will take a while to burn through. This has even helped me in the past when trying to re-humidify buds, though it wont be perfect  Happy *fresh* tokes ents.

As for food, I would probably eat anything you put in front of me if I had the munchies but if I had a choice my favorites are as followed: anything with whip cream on it or just the whip cream, moist cake, apple/pumkin pie, soft pretzels, strawberries, pineapples, green grapes, french fries, pizza, and anything else I normally would enjoy like BBQ, burgers, steak etc. Oh and probably my favorite, FAST FOOD.

Since this is a pro tip subreddit I guess you need some tips:

1. Always make sure you have something available to eat before you toke up. Nothing worst than munchies and no food.

2. Chew some gum after you finish eating. It helps cotton mouth shit tons.

3. If you haven't had good cake or fruit to fix up your munchies, try it. It just feels good in your mouth. Dat cake.

4. If you're on a diet make sure you have some healthy munchies around for snack time. A helpful link: http://forum.grasscity.com/recreational-marijuana-use/250946-best-healthy-food-eat-while-high.html

5. This one is off topic but watch out for sliding glass doors...

There are times where I wouldn't smoke for a month. This has been going on for roughly a year now and it's come to the point where I want to be conserving my weed. So I'm thinking of buying either a pipe or a bong. 

I just have a few questions if you could be kind enough to help me out with:

* What's more efficient to smoke with in terms of saving weed and getting about the same or even a better high? a joint? bong? pipe? etc.

* If I do decide on buying a bong, what's the difference between a tall one and a short one? I just wanted to know because even though I'm not tight on funds, I'm not one to splurge out cash, especially since I don't have a high tolerance to weed.

* Why do some prefer keif over a regular bud? (I apologize for the lack of knowledge if I had misused these terms)

Just dip a q-tip or piece of kitchen paper in oil and lightly smear around the outer edge of the inner piece of the grinder....can't think of a better way to describe this.  This makes it feel brand new and only needs doing every 3 weeks to keep a nice smooth grind.

5. Don't complain about what your guy has that week. For most dealers, there's not a farm market where they can go and pick out what they want. It's usually take it or leave it. If your guy ends up with a shitty bag, hopefully he hooks you up on the price, but sometimes that's not possible.

Basically, If you are 18 or older (In the US) buy a pack of cigarettes, unwrap them, and carry them with you when you toke in public. This is especially helpful when smoking in cars. If anyone approaches, light up a cig, and puff it hard and fast, but dont inhale. Basically try to produce as much smoke as possible to cover the odor of weed. Its isnt guaranteed to mask the smell totally, especially if hotboxing, but the odor is strong and as long as you hide any glass or weed it has potential to get you out of what could be a sticky situation.  

For example: 
Just the other day me and a fellow ent decided to blaze before a movie, sitting in his car in the far side of the parking lot when suddenly a security personel started walking our way (with mighty haste I might add) at which point I lit up a stogy, ziplocked the bowl and herb. By the time he got to us, It appeared we were enjoying our cancer sticks before attending the movie, when the security guy stopped to ask what was going on, we said we told him just enjoying a cigarette, and he went on his way. 

TL;DR: Keep a pack of cigarettes with you, as they can mask the smell of weed, and if at bare minimum can be used as an excuse for seeing smoke. 

That being said dont get hooked.

TL;DR: Use cold eyedrops or ice cubes.

The theory: Smoking reduces the pressure inside your eyeball; this causes the blood vessels in your eyes to dilate and become visible. Usually, eye drops like visine contain something that contracts the blood vessels making them go back to normal. Problem is, this is not good in the long run and even more problematic with contacts.

But blood vessels constrict also if exposed to cold.

So, get some 
# single dose (you don't want to get an eye infection)
# unpreserved (no unnecessary nasty stuff)
# saline
and keep it in the fridge. If you need relief on the go, freeze it and use when thawed. Downside is, you need more than a few drops in each eye.

For emergencies and stubborn redness: Massage ice cubes on closed eyelids. 

The effects are not as lasting as with visine, but it reduces the redness by a significant amount and you don't get that shiny white cokehead eyes, but a more natural look.

Bonus: Saline drops are not as suspicious as visine and the likes and a lot cheaper. ",,False,self,t5_2u279,False,,,True,t3_12ntk3,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerProTips/comments/12ntk3/get_rid_of_red_eyes_in_a_safe_way/,
