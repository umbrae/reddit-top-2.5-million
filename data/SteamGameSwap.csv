Just come chat and have fun to win! More Info Inside!",427,43,328,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/16s11u/giveaway_48h_of_live_giveaways_gameplay_including/,"Link to stream below.

Over the next couple days we over at Unity Gaming Network, JC(Me) &amp; Giving Gamers have started a 48+ Hour Giveaway Marathon to try and give back to the amazing gaming community and those over on twitch and reddit who helped SpeedDemosArchive.com raise over 450k for cancer prevention.

Some of the games I will be playing on and off a lot are Chivalry, Dark Souls as well as TF2, Amnesia (First time playing), and many others (Viewers Choice?). We will also be giving away several copies of each of these games throughout the stream. We're doing giveaways based on how many people show up to the stream so the more people the more stuff we can give out.

I also have an NVIDIA GTX460 and two GTX550Ti's to giveaway as well but we need your help and support in getting the word out for this otherwise it might end up being canceled or at set back.

I really hope to see some of you there, and good luck with the prizes if you do stop by! You don't have to do anything to win except be in the stream. The people most active in chat will have a better chance at winning. I don't even want you to follow me unless you genuinely enjoy the stream and what I'm trying to do :)

Stream - http://www.twitch.tv/unitygn

For those only interested in winning something here, I will be giving away a few copies of Chivalry and maybe more/something else depending on how this thread turns out.

What To Do To Win Here?: 
1) Please upvote this post. I receive no Karma for a self text submission, and it's on the sidebar so you are supposed to do it anyway. It's just common courtesy. 
2) Make a comment that includes your Steam ID A number between 1-1000 And which game you're interested in.* And that's it.

I will use a random number generator (random.org) to pick the winner(s) and it will be done live and recorded so you can watch it happen if so desired.

Please help spread the word about this if you like what I'm trying to do. The more people the more things I'll be able to giveaway!

I apologize for the self promotion with my stream, it's just how I like to do my giveaways because I enjoy interacting with people. Any feedback would be GREATLY appreciated as I hope to do this a lot more in the future!

**EDIT** 
Wow! You guys are amazing. I **never** expected this kind of response. I feel like I should do something special for you guys but not sure if I have the money for it, but we'll see what I can pull together. Thank you so much for the support all those who came by the stream.

I will be doing the giveaway(s) today or tomorrow. I've been so busy with the marathon and everything else going on I've barely had time to breathe, but I'm doing my best! :)

Again, thank you all and hopefully I can make several people very happy.",,False,,t5_2skv6,1358716239.0,,,True,t3_16s11u,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/16s11u/giveaway_48h_of_live_giveaways_gameplay_including/,
1345286304.0,316,self.SteamGameSwap,yf9q0,[GIVEAWAY] The Cakeday Giveaway (90+ games!),377,61,223,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/yf9q0/giveaway_the_cakeday_giveaway_90_games/,"### The Intro:

Hey everyone! I'm blueshiftlabs, your friendly /r/SteamGameSwap moderator. Today's my cakeday - the one day of the year where it's acceptable _(and almost obligatory!)_ to karmawhore like there's no tomorrow. Seeing as how I don't know any celebrities, I can't use MS Paint worth a damn, and my cat wouldn't sit still long enough for me to glue a caption on him, I thought I might try something a little bit different.

My definition of _different:_ I'm giving away [my entire Steam inventory.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueshiftlabs/inventory/#753) The whole thing. 93 games in all, and one could be yours.

_Why,_ you might ask? Maybe it's that I love this community. Maybe I'm feeling exceptionally generous. Or maybe I've gone temporarily insane. (If it's option #3, you should totally take advantage of this before they show up with the straitjackets and the happy pills.)

No matter what the reason is, you - yes, you! - could be the proud owner of one of these fine examples of modern PC gaming:

***

[*] Anyone who enters for the Double Fine bundle will automatically be entered for Psychonauts. If you already have other games in the bundle, and just want Psychonauts, you can enter for it on its own.

[&amp;dagger;] There are 2 copies available - one Complete Edition and one base game. The first person to be drawn for Frozen Synapse will win the Complete Edition, and the second will win the base game.

***

### The Procedure:

Because managing a drawing over Reddit comments is a royal pain in the ass, I'm doing this over a Google Doc instead. **Don't enter in the comments!** _Yes, you! No clicky button!_

In order to enter, you should:

* Go [here.][form]
* Fill out your Reddit and Steam account info.
* Pick up to *10* games that you don't already own, in order of most preferred to least.
* Click the big ""submit"" button at the end.

***

### The Rules:

To make sure everyone gets a fair chance, I've set up a few rules:

You can qualify to win by **either** of these methods:

* **Method 1.** Gray flair or better on /r/SGS, **or**
* **Method 2.** A Reddit account that is at least **2 months old** _and_ has at least **300 combined karma**.
* **You don't need both!**

_Sorry, new-account people. I'm afraid you're out of luck on this one. Yes, I will clear the flair backlog before I do the drawing._

If you already own a game, or any game in a bundle, you're not eligible to win that game or bundle. There's 92 other things - I'm sure you can find something else that you'd enjoy.

Drawings will be done automatically, via a semi-magical Python script I've written for just this purpose. If you feel that you deserved to win, but didn't, go yell at the guy who created Python's random number generator.

The drawing script will draw a user's name. That user then wins whatever game they want the most that's still in stock. The game they won is taken from the stock, and it draws another user. Lather, rinse, and repeat until out of games or out of users.

The drawing will happen on **Monday, August 20, 9:00 PM EDT.**

***

### The Fine Print:

_Incomplete, typo'd, or otherwise FUBAR'd drawing entries may be interpreted in whatever way I find most entertaining. Double-check your username! Your Reddit and Steam account information will be checked, and you will be ineligible to win if you are listed on the Shared Ban List, are marked as a scammer by any trade site, or are trade-banned, VAC-banned, subreddit-banned, SteamRep-banned, or Rock Band. In the event of multiple entries for the same username, the most recent entry will be used. Games will only be given to the Steam account listed on the submission form. Games are for your personal use only, and are not to be sold or traded. Not responsible for issues with SGS flair applications - please read the FAQ first. Professional driver, closed course. Your mileage may vary. These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and these games are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any disease. All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable compliance issues. No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject. No animals were harmed in the making of this post, except one who genuinely deserved it.

### The TL;DR: Click [here,][form] fill out form, ???, profit.

To successfully enter the giveaway, your reply should look like this:
-

1. Upvoted

2. Any number between &amp;#8495; (2.72) and &amp;pi; (3.14), to three significant digits.

3. The game you are entering for (you can only enter for one).

4. Your Steam profile (has to be public)

For the critics: I only ask you to upvote for exposure, so as many people can see and enter this giveaway as possible.

Winners will be picked using [random.org](http://www.random.org) either in 24 hours (10:30 PM PDT 6/18/2013), or when all possible entries are taken.

**There are not any requirements to enter this contest. However, I reserve the right to ""reroll"" if you win, if, for any reason, I feel you don't deserve the free game.**

Good luck to everybody who enters, and Happy Birthday to any of you born on this day, years ago!

This is not [/r/randomactsofgaming](/r/randomactsofgaming) or [/r/GiftOfGames](/r/GiftOfGames). This is /r/steamgameswap, where users SWAP GAMES. [/r/steamgameswap](/r/steamgameswap) is not a place to beg for crap, and it will never **be** a place to beg for crap.

For those users who don't spam up the new queue with requests for free games, I will say this: *I love you with all my heart*. The people who use this subreddit properly are a godsend to the mod team - I'm talking about you guys who report posts which break the rules, and downvote scammers. We really do appreciate your help. &lt;3

TL;DR: Report people who ask for free games (or say ""hurp, I'm going to draw a picture in exchange for a game"") and I will personally love you forever

**-&gt; Welcome &lt;-**

[Official Thread Soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ktbhw0v186Q) - Enjoy.

Please don't request a game unless you're actually going to play it. Nothing is more upsetting then giving away a game only to see the person redeem it and then not play it for weeks, if ever.

Also please don't downvote other users posts, when I randomly pick the users I load all the posts in the thread (reddit gold makes this easy). Then I use a random number generator to select the winning post; downvoting other people's posts do you no good and is simply a waste of your own time.

.

**-&gt; Instructions &lt;-**

First of all if you feel like leaving a message or thank you note for our donors when you're done then you can do so using [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBRTk9DM1NQOG84MDBHYjF2SEtSM2c6MQ#gid=0).

Go to the game list located [here (CLICK ME)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ammwcg89dPycdHJGemdROWRBNE5sNFM5Mmt5aGVLbmc#gid=5), scroll through the donor list (just do it) and pick up to three games, then post the title(s) here - that's it you're done. I'll randomly select some winners (not sure how many) in a day, two, or three, maybe even a week... depends on how lazy I am :D (apparently I'm 2 months lazy, sorry guys)

When you list your three games make sure they're in order based on which one you want most. The one you want the most that is available is the one you'll get.

If you don't have Flair in this subreddit PLEASE list your Steam account (link to it) to make the gifting process faster (we send the game via trade, not gift; for security purposes).

.

**-&gt; Donating &lt;-**

If you would like to donate a game to the list then please feel free to [add me on steam](http://www.steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018105926). Note that I can't guarantee how soon the game will be given out or to who, what I can promise you is that it will be given out in a public manner on Reddit and the winner will be randomly selected.

The super-cool guys at Dejobaan (the totally-indie developers of interestingly-named titles such as *AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity* and *Drunken Robot Pornography*) have kindly supplied ten keys for their latest game, **AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome**. Yes, that's a lot of A's. Here, check out [**some gameplay videos**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jSpjikiav0&amp;list=SPBA98596F00DD94B8) I recorded when the game came out, and you can also read [**the review I wrote of it**](http://theohmanifest.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/teeny-tiny-review-aaaaaa-for-the-awesome/). It's seriously fast!

Before I get to the giveaway part, though, I'm obligated to say something tangentially related in large capital letters.

(related to the previous paragraph but not really the rest of the post: DRP is pretty fun.)

Anyway, I suppose I'd better set out some ground rules to make sure that the giveaway is fair and all-

-------------------

##RULES!

* All entrants must have at least gray flair.
* Entrants must have a Steam account that is more than three months old.
* Entrants must not own AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome.
* Entrants should totally sign up for the Dejobaan Fan Club, though it's not a requirement.
* Entrants should also **upvote this self-post** so that everyone has a chance of seeing it and/or winning. It's good sportsmanship!

-------------------

I'm going to be using [RedditRaffle](http://redditraffle.com/) to conduct the giveaway, so if you want to be included in the giveaway, you must include the word **bananas** in your post. [](/celestia ""Do you like, mmm, bananas?"")

The winners will be chosen in a day or so, and keys will be distributed shortly after that.

Hi everyone! Celebrating my 50th confirmed trade by doing a giveaway to everyone who helped me get here. However one thing I ask before I start explaining is you will not try to trade/sell this game away if you win. I want you to either play it yourself or give it to someone. There is no way to enforce this of course but I'd like to think some people will stay true to their word.



This giveaway will last 72 hours, it will end at 8:00PM PST 4/13/2012. Rules are simple, list a number between 1-1000 and I will use a random number generator until a winner is found! Submitting multiple entries will disqualify all your entries. In the event of 2 people having the same number the one with the first post wins! So make sure to check if a number is taken before you pick it.




Here's where it gets interesting, as a bonus for those traders who make this subreddit what it is. Having a Green Flair (+20 trades) or above will give 2 you entries, Purple Flair (50+ Trades) will get 3 entries.

**.:EDIT:.** Some of you have already realized but for those who haven't, the prize tier you qualify for is at the end of this contest so if you have the chance for a Flair upgrade spend these next 72 hours doing it!

In addition to having multiple entries, higher tiered traders will receive greater rewards and more options.


**Zero Tier** *(Gold Flair)*

*Choose a prize from any Tier, must be an active redditor, will be checking karma/account age)*

* Age of Empires: All in Wonder Bundle
* Serious Sam 3: BFE
* Dota2x3
* ~~CS:GO~~ *(Sorry mods I solds it =[ )*


**Tier 1** *(No flair + Grey Flair)* 

*Pick one of the following*

* Space Pirates and Zombies
* Portal
* Capsized
* Ricochet
* Demigod



**Tier 2** *(Blue Flair)* 

*Pick 2 of the following*

* Space Pirates and Zombies
* Portal
* Capsized
* Ricochet
* Demigod
* Trine


**Tier 3** *(Dark Red Flair)*

*Pick one of the following or any previous Tier*

* Dungeon Defenders
* Blur
* Super Meat Boy
* Counter-Strike
* Trine 2
* APOX

**Tier 4**  *(Green Flair)*

*Any of the following or a previous Tier*

* Bulletstorm™
* Dota 2 (Giftable only)
* BioShock® 2
* Left 4 Dead 2
* Portal 2

**Tier 5** *(Purple Flair)*

*Pick any of the following or 2 previous Tiers (Can't pick a Tier twice)*

* Shogun 2 + Rise of the Samurai Campaign
* The Hitman Collection
* Sid Meier's Civilization® V + Civilization V: Korea and Wonders of the Ancient World - Combo Pack
* Dota2 x2 (Giftable Only) 
* Borderlands GOTY


Good luck everyone! And please up-vote to make sure this stays visible for the full 3 days. If we have enough participants I will consider doing 2 drawings.


**.:EDIT:.** Don't forget to upvote! This is actually a very expensive scheme for me to get karma!

Please don't request a game unless you're actually going to play it. Nothing is more upsetting then giving away a game only to see the person redeem it and then not play it for weeks, if ever.

Also please don't downvote other users posts, when I randomly pick the users I sort by ""oldest post first"" and load all the posts in the thread. Then I use a random number generator to select the winning post; downvoting other posters does you no good and is simply a waste of your own time.

.

**-&gt; Instructions &lt;-**

Go to the game list located [here (CLICK ME)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ammwcg89dPycdHJGemdROWRBNE5sNFM5Mmt5aGVLbmc#gid=0) and pick a game where the title isn't in grey (you can pick up to three), then post the title(s) here; that's it you're done. I'll randomly select some winners (probably 5 to 10) in a day or two and give out the games.

When you list your three games make sure they're in order based on which one you want most. If you win we'll check to see if your first choice is available, if it's not we'll then check your second and third.

If you don't have Flair in this subreddit PLEASE list your Steam account (link to it).

.

**-&gt; Donating &lt;-**

If you would like to donate a game to my list then please feel free to [add me on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018105926). Note that I can't guarantee how soon the game will be given out or to who, what I can promise you is that it will be given out in a public manner on Reddit and the winner will be randomly selected.

Hello SteamGameSwap denizens! I first created my reddit account so I could join the SteamGameSwap community, which makes my cake day also my one year anniversary of my trading career! It’s been a great year and to show my appreciation I’ll be having a fun little giveaway. The first “Traders Incentive” was a great success so here I am again with bigger and better prizes (hopefully). I hope the prizes given away would be played by the winners, but I do realize you are a group of cut throat traders, so feel free to add them to your trading inventory as well!

This giveaway will last 72 hours, it will end at 11:00PM PST 1/24/2013. Rules are simple, list a number between 1-1000 and I will use a random number generator until a winner is found! Submitting multiple entries will disqualify all your entries. In the event of 2 people having the same number the one with the first post wins! So make sure to check if a number is taken before you pick it. A quick addition to last year’s rules as well, if your post has been edited it will not count.  This is to ensure no one can steal your number by posting first and editing it to your number later. **Please remember to add your steam ID to your post.** *Will not accept private profiles*

So now that is out of the way, we’ll discuss the fun part.  As a bonus for those traders who make this subreddit what it is, and have consistently contributed towards the community. Having a Green Flair (+20 trades) or above will give 2 you entries, Purple Flair (50+ Trades) will get 3 entries. A Gold Flair would be counted the same as a Purple flair so 3 entries.

In addition to having multiple entries, higher tiered traders will receive greater rewards and more options.

**Tier 1** *(No flair)*
*Pick one of the following.*

* Metro 2033
* The Ship Gift
* Dota 2 (lol)

**RULES**

* May only enter once unless meeting certain Flair requirements .
* Entries are only valid on non-edited post.
* Winners are free to choose the reward and any of the previous Tiers.
* Supplies are limited. Lower tier users will claim their prizes first so high tier winners are not guaranteed games from previous tiers.
* Upvote this giveaway and I guarantee you a 5% higher chance of being picked! 
* To encourage individuals to play the games won; it is not stated which games come in key/tradable form.

 **Eligibility**

* If entering on a no flair account, account age must be older than 1 month.
* Must be clean on Steamrep and the Shared Banlist.
* Steam account must be older than 3 months.
* Steam account cannot have a trade probation or trade status banned.
* Must not be a jerk.

Good luck everyone! And please up-vote to make sure this stays visible in the coming days. I will be picking 3 winners (maximum 1 no flair and 1 grey flair), but if participation is high enough I will consider picking 5 total winners.  

A quick note before I leave, the giveaway will last somewhere around 72 hours! Use that time wisely to raise your flair and enter a new reward tier! (Sorry mods! Incoming flair request spam)

HELLO LOVELY STEAMGAMESWAPERS! 

Recently I've encountered quite a few newcomers to this subreddit that are confused on how to ""get your flair"". Problems that include,  ***""how do I fill out this pre-written message so I can request my flair?""***  and most commonly ***""how do I find my Steam ID? (not your custom ID, but one with the series of numbers)""***. I have created a clear and concise step-by-step (all done with pictures) on how to identify your SteamID64 (with troubleshooting resolutions) and how to complete and request for your flair.

Receiving your flair from the moderators may take up to a few minutes, hours or even days (completely dependent on how busy the moderators are at the time), and once you have received your flair you will now be able to trade game keys or codes! 

I have separated it into TWO albums(steps), each consisting of sub-steps.

**STEP ONE:** http://imgur.com/a/z63mh

**STEP TWO:** http://imgur.com/a/8YNvk

Yesterday, we passed the 13,000 subscriber mark, firmly establishing us as the largest game-trading community on Reddit. Congratulations to everyone for being part of such a fantastic community!

Since it's been so long, we do have some changes to announce - changes that will hopefully make your trading lives easier and safer.

***

### Welcome, New Mods!

First of all, give a warm welcome to [**Kataki**](/user/Kataki), [**ltra1n**](/user/ltra1n), and [**warheat1990**](/user/warheat1990), your new SGS moderators. They've joined us to keep a closer eye on trades, give faster responses to questions, and, most of all, get the response time for flair requests back down to a reasonable number.

That said, those of you with flair requests that have been pending for longer than a week - please **bump your request.** To do that, go to your [message outbox](/message/sent), find your flair request, and reply to it. That will bring your request up to the top of our modmail inbox, so your request doesn't get lost in the noise.

***

### Registration Soon Required

Those of you who have dropped by /r/tf2trade and/or /r/dota2trade lately may have noticed their new automated flair-assignment system, SteamBot. I've worked with /u/DrKabob, the author of that system, to implement that here.

In order to post, you will need to be registered with SteamBot, **regardless of whether or not you have flair.** Those of you who don't have flair will receive our new black-on-white 0-trade flair. Note that this means **hidden Steam profiles are no longer allowed** - in order to post here, your Steam account information must be visible.

To register:

0. Make sure your profile is public. _(You can change it back after registration is done.)_
1. [**Click this link.**](http://sgs.trade.redditgaming.com/start)
2. Accept the Reddit permission request from ""SGS Flair System"". We use that to collect your Reddit username.
3. Use the Steam Community signin page to log into your Steam account. This is a Steam page - we don't see any of your login information, just the Steam ID returned from that page.
4. If you have flair, your Steam ID will be updated. If you don't, you'll receive 0-trade flair with your Steam ID.
5. You're all set - start posting!

In order to register with the bot, your Steam account must be over 30 days old, not marked as a scammer on SteamRep, and not previously registered under a different Reddit account.

There will be a grace period of a few weeks to allow people to register with the bot. **After May 1st, registering with the bot will be required to post trades or comment on other people's trades.**

***

### Proposed Rules Changes

With the implementation of the SteamBot registration system comes a stronger ability to permanently ban users, and to mark scammers once they show themselves. With that added security, it is possible to loosen some of the more onerous restrictions we have on trading.

In particular, we're proposing these rules changes:

* **Paypal trades** would only require blue flair for the seller. Any user, including those with no flair, could buy games with Paypal.
* **Key trades** would be completely unrestricted. Any user could trade both Steam-tradable games and Steam-activatable keys.
* Other restrictions (accounts, bundle keys) would stay as they are.

Please feel free to discuss these proposals below, or propose your own changes. In a few days, we'll be posting a poll where people can vote on these proposals. Any proposals that are accepted by the community will go into effect **on May 1st** - after SteamBot registration becomes mandatory.

Note - **these are only proposals. The current rules still stand until they are changed on May 1st.**

***

### Wiki Page Contest

Our [wiki](/r/SteamGameSwap/w/index) is looking very sad at the moment. With the exception of the FAQ page and any other ""administrative"" pages, we've opened up the wiki to any SGS user with a Reddit account older than 30 days who wants to contribute. Feel free to make pages about a topic of your choice!

In particular, we're looking for:

* New-user guides
* How to spot scammers
* Information about Paypal trades, middlemen, and the like

Any new page created before May 1st will be entered into a contest. The best page, as voted by our users, will win the game of their choice from the Steam catalog, up to $60 USD. Runner-up prizes will also be available, as of yet to be determined. Go contribute!

***

Say hi to your new mods, [go register with SteamBot](http://sgs.trade.redditgaming.com/start), discuss our proposed rules changes, and go [edit the wiki.](/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/index)

1357112728.0,94,self.SteamGameSwap,15teby,[Giveaway] Pick a game from my list / [W] You to play the game you win! --- APPROVED VERSION!,106,12,586,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/15teby/giveaway_pick_a_game_from_my_list_w_you_to_play/,"**-&gt; Welcome &lt;-**

Please don't request a game unless you're actually going to play it. Nothing is more upsetting then giving away a game only to see the person redeem it and then not play it for weeks, if ever.

Also please don't downvote other users posts, when I randomly pick the users I load all the posts in the thread (reddit gold makes this easy). Then I use a random number generator to select the winning post; downvoting other people's posts do you no good and is simply a waste of your own time.

.

**-&gt; Instructions &lt;-**

First of all if you feel like leaving a message or thank you note for our donors when you're done then you can do so using [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBRTk9DM1NQOG84MDBHYjF2SEtSM2c6MQ#gid=0).

Go to the game list located [here (CLICK ME)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ammwcg89dPycdHJGemdROWRBNE5sNFM5Mmt5aGVLbmc#gid=5) and pick up to three games, then post the title(s) here - that's it you're done. I'll randomly select some winners (probably 3 to 6) in a day or two and give out the games.

When you list your three games make sure they're in order based on which one you want most. The one you want the most that is available is the one you'll get.

If you don't have Flair in this subreddit PLEASE list your Steam account (link to it) to make the gifting process faster (we send the game via trade, not gift; for security purposes).

.

**-&gt; Donating &lt;-**

If you would like to donate a game to my list then please feel free to [add me on steam](http://www.steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018105926). Note that I can't guarantee how soon the game will be given out or to who, what I can promise you is that it will be given out in a public manner on Reddit and the winner will be randomly selected.

1374951201.0,93,self.SteamGameSwap,1j68lo,[PSA] How to Protect Yourself from Scammers (+ a Convenient TLDR),110,17,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1j68lo/psa_how_to_protect_yourself_from_scammers_a/,"I've been seeing a lot of PSA's about being scammed in which the OP didn't see an obvious scam coming a mile away. I just went to the FAQ and sidebar to find the ""how not to get scammed"" I'm sure I've read somewhere before but noticed only one for PayPal, so perhaps a PSA will help some of our new traders.

**TL;DR Version:**

1. Obey the rules of the sub. Sometimes the flair may seem arbitrary but more often than not I see someone with no flair saying they were scammed in a key trade they weren't supposed to be making in the first place.
1. **Only trade with people who have identified themselves by posting in your thread.**  If someone adds you before doing so, request that they post in your thread before you talk turkey.
3. Be wary of people asking you to hurry, making excuses to not identify themselves, or otherwise being impolite or abnormal in communication.
4. Never ever trade with random adds who will not say where they added you from.
6. Knowledge is power. Ask questions, Google, take your time, and communicate with the trader.
7. Be wary of: New Steam accounts, low amount of games (or lots of free/bundle games), weird deals. (Weird deals: ""Offline"" games with no official offline mode, ridiculously cheap keys, etc.)
8. Be wary of *amazing* offers. It remains true that if something's too good to be true it probably is. Scammers will often try to overpay so that you will feel more pressure to make the trade. Is your game worth 20 dollars on Steam but they're offering you 30? Something's off.
9. **You are never required to perform a trade you are not comfortable with.** If the trader seems shady to you then move on and find a different trade partner.
10. If using PayPal be sure to read [this PayPal specific guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/rmt26/announcement_fatmanrisings_guide_on_how_to_do/) and follow it well. It's your money; be cautious and protect yourself!

----

It is unfortunate that there are scammers, both registered and lurking, in any trade community. They shouldn't scam you but, likewise, you should actively defend yourself from being scammed.  The flair system here can serve as some indicator of a trader's reputation but it is not an absolute. With every trade, be it from a new trader or a 50+ flaired trader, there are signs to look out for that can keep you from being burned.

Here are some that have served me well. First and foremost:


**Anyone you are trading with from /r/SGS should post in your trade thread.**

This is necessary for trade confirmation anyways and also allows you to see their flair, their reddit account, and their Steam account in one easy post. These will be the best source of information to protect yourself. Do not trade with random people who add you but are unwilling to identify themselves by posting in your reddit thread. (If they make some excuse like forgotten password you should probably avoid them, but at the very least you must be extremely cautious and never go first.)

---
**Flair and Trustworthiness**

Once you have their flair you have an idea of their reputation within the community. Note that I said you have an idea. Flair is not absolute. There are lots of new but trustworthy traders just like there have been a few rare cases of higher-flaired traders going rogue. A lack of flair should prompt you to look a bit more closely but high flair does not excuse you from doing your research and covering your ass.

---
**reddit Account and Trustworthiness**

Once you have their reddit name you can look at their post history. Did they make the account recently? Are their posts only in game trading subreddits (or places like PlayItForward and RandomActsofGaming, where beggars sometimes go begging-- I've noticed a lot of scammers are also beggars) or do they have a well-rounded account? An account just active in game trading subs isn't necessarily a strike, but the more you can see in their reddit history the more of an idea you can get of the person you're dealing with.

---
**SteamID64 and Trustworthiness**

Once you have their Steam account you can look into their activities on other trading communities. Follow all of these steps:

* Look them up on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/). - This is *imperative* if you doubt the trader. (For a quick guide to checking a trader's SteamRep check out /u/yuv9 's [imgur album here!](http://imgur.com/a/cEeal))
* Look them up on Google via their SteamID. On the SteamRep page from the previous step find the Search Engine Queries box and look for the one with their SteamID 64, [pictured here.](http://i.imgur.com/eFJNOhp.jpg) 
 Generally spammer reports will pop up here if they are a regular scammer. You may also find profiles from other trading communities that you can peruse.
* Look up their SteamID64 on the SteamRep forums. (You'll notice a bold search link a few lines above the Google link in the previous screenshot.) Sometimes scammers have been reported in the forum but are not yet registered in the system as a scammer. --added from recommendation by /u/Aitchy21

---
**Steam Profiles and Trustworthiness**

Analzying the trader's Steam profile itself can possibly show red flags. Let's take a look at mine and a few important things to take note of:

http://i.imgur.com/cuHoPiw.jpg

1. If you went to your new doctor's office and the waiting room chairs were busted, the clock on the wall didn't work, and there was no receptionist at teh front you probably would get a bad vibe about the doctor's credibility. A profile that looks essentially abandoned can indicate someone who is willing to throw their account away if they can find a sucker to scam. The ""lived in"" look of profiles always makes me feel more at ease with a trader. That said, not everyone cares about avatars, backgrounds, or fleshing out their profile. A lack of the lived in look doesn't necessarily mean scammer but you may want to look at other signs if their profile puts you off.

2. Badges are important for two reasons. If someone has crafted a lot of badges (Level 15+) they probably actually like Steam, care about Steam, and care about their account and thus may be a more reputable individual. May.  Also if you look for their Years of Service badge you can find their registration date. Older accounts aren't automatically trustworthy but brand new accounts are cause to look deeper.

3. Take note of how many games they have and what type of games they are. Many scammers will have very few games and the games they do have will be free to play games or lots of cheap bundle games. The more money someone invests in their account the less likely they are to risk it scamming you for a 5 dollar game. Granted, some people just don't spend so much on games but a low-investment profile is cause for more research.

4. +reps in comments mean nothing. Scammers flock together and these can easily be friends +repping each other to give the illusion of trustworthiness. Also you can remove comments from your profile, meaning any negative feedback from past victims would not appear here. Don't ever put any stock in the things you see in these comments.

---
**Behaviour and Trustworthiness**

* A legitimate trader will be willing to wait for a few minutes; they will not say hurry hurry rush. If they are asking you to make the trade before you are ready then simply say you are no longer interested, or tell them you can talk to them again when they have more time on their hands. The less time you have to research them the more likely you are to miss red flags listed above. Do not let others fluster you.
* If you have any doubts about something in their reputation or profile be sure to ask them. ""I see you only joined Steam last month. How did you end up getting into trading? Are you new to Steam?"" If they are unwilling to answer questions they probably aren't interested in being on the level with you.
* If you have something that's worrying you, explain it and ask if there's something they're willing to go first or use a middleman. They may not have any more reason to trust you than you have to trust them and so refusal to go first is not necessarily a sign of an impending scam. If both of you are unwilling to go first that means it's time for a middleman.

---
**Useful Tools**

* /u/blueshiftlabs has created the [Flair Linker Enhanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wvmk8/psa_flair_linker_enhanced_is_now_available/) extension for Firefox and Google Chrome that beefs up the flair in the subreddit (and other trading subreddits) to make getting in touch with (and doing research on) your trading partner much easier.

* [EnhancedSteam](http://www.enhancedsteam.com/) will, among other things, add buttons for things like SteamRep and SteamTrades to Steam profiles you view in your browser making it much easier to hit all the hotspots for researching other traders.

Anyways, that's pretty much it. I've seen a few ""How to avoid scammers"" posts in my time here but not a whole lot explain *why* certain things are red flags. When you know the reasons behind them it's easier to pick out abnormalities in behaviour, profiles, etc.

Comment to me on this post^page2. Praetor's steam page^page3. My email to Praetor192^page4. Praetor192 Reddit profile^page5. And page 8 is me adding Praetor on steam, and the game in my inventory. I will post more pictures of the actual transfer once Praetor adds me.


**My process** 
I wanted to find someone who had an Item on their wishlist that was in their 5 most wanted games for the longest time. I found a few people who had a few games from 2010 and even some that had beaten out the date of Praetor's November 24th by a few months, but I ultimately choose Praetor because he had, out of all of the other people with items from 2010 on their wishlist, he had more 2010, and less games than all of them. I just wanted to find someone who had wanted something for a long time and a low amount of games. Thank you all again I think I will have to do this again in the future just something a little different next time. Again I'm sorry for closing early! I hope you can all forgive me and just keep your eyes open for me again. Thank you all for your kind words and entries.


Also as for me choosing the game that was done at random also using a dice (6 sided I know) but I just assigned the numbers as to the order he wrote down his game so Fallout New Vegas was a 4 and I rolled a four. So there you have it.

Also please don't downvote other users posts, when I randomly pick the users I load all the posts in the thread (reddit gold makes this easy). Then I use a random number generator to select the winning post; downvoting other people's posts do you no good and is simply a waste of your own time.

.

**-&gt; Instructions &lt;-**

First of all if you feel like leaving a message or thank you note for our donors when you're done then you can do so using [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDBRTk9DM1NQOG84MDBHYjF2SEtSM2c6MQ#gid=0).

Go to the game list located [here (CLICK ME)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ammwcg89dPycdHJGemdROWRBNE5sNFM5Mmt5aGVLbmc#gid=5), scroll through the donor list (just do it) and pick up to three games, then post the title(s) here - that's it you're done. I'll randomly select some winners (probably 3 to 6) in a day or two and give out the games.

When you list your three games make sure they're in order based on which one you want most. The one you want the most that is available is the one you'll get.

If you don't have Flair in this subreddit PLEASE list your Steam account (link to it) to make the gifting process faster (we send the game via trade, not gift; for security purposes).

**-&gt; Donating &lt;-**

If you would like to donate a game to the list then please feel free to [add me on steam](http://www.steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018105926).

1375749139.0,83,self.SteamGameSwap,1js0xz,[PSA] **Sticky** Guide to Avoiding Scammers **Sticky**,94,11,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1js0xz/psa_sticky_guide_to_avoiding_scammers_sticky/,"**WARNING: BIG WALL OF TEXT**

There have been lots of instances of scamming/attempted scamming lately.  Here's a guide I found on tf2-trader.net ([Original Link Here)](http://tf2-trader.com/index.php?topic=959.0).

While it applies mostly to TF2 trades, it can also be used for trading steam games.  Paypal and game keys/codes are both outside of the trading window and can be treated similarly.

Please feel free to comment about any of the points below (additions or deletions, if needed) and I'll do my best to change it.

This will be stickied at the top of the subreddit, so hopefully newer users will be able to see it more often.  Any previous links to trading guides can be posted in the comments as well.

***

&gt;This guide will show you the many types of scammers, what they look like, what they do, and how to avoid getting scammed yourself.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, you need to get a certain philosophy I've learned over the few months of trading that ANYONE out there, no matter how ""trustworthy"" they might seem can pull off a scam. Sometimes staff on a shady website/server (such as admins and mods) can be the biggest scammers. Most people when given the opportunity to, they will try to scam you, no matter how large or small the trade is.
&gt;
&gt;Using Middlemen (commonly referred to as MM's): In my trading history (since it came out) I've only seen impersonated middlemen or untrustworthy middlemen scam, but not quite often. Using a middleman is almost always safe. Just make sure you verify it's them using the links on their rep page or checking their reputation on http://steamrep.com to make sure they aren't listed as any time of scammer and have few scammers on their friends list. If you're unsure about doing a trade, say for cash, and the person refuses to use a middleman, you should AUTOMATICALLY refuse to trade with them. They might say ""MM takes too long"" or ""I want a fast trade"" which means they are oh so more wanting to scam you out of your items. Take the other road, use a middleman when unsure. This will most of the time (excluding chargebacks) the best way to prevent a scam. Trusted middlemen have proved their worth in our trading community and I advise you use their service when doing trades for non-TF2 only items.
&gt;
&gt;Let's go through a list on the type of scammers out there!
&gt;
&gt;Before I go, here is a small thing I ask of you. Use your free speech! If you see someone trying to or attempting to scam a fellow trader, let yourself be heard! The scammers will probably be one of the below listed and if you catch onto them, please, post something on their thread, report it to a reputable admin on a fairly known website (SourceOP, TF2Trader, UTC, etc.) and get them banned or reported to Steamrep.
&gt;
&gt;Note: Remember that scammers, as I've said before, will scam for ANY amount. As long as they get a free item, they WILL feel satisfied and won't stop until they get more for free. Someone can scam you for as little as a reclaimed to as high as an unusual hat. Be cautious out there!
&gt;
&gt;1) I don't trust Middleman/No MM: The most common type of scammer. He/she will say that there is no need for a middleman and that using a middleman is a waste of time or that middleman may be untrustworthy. Most of the time both of you will have to agree on a trusted middleman (usually Trell, a UTC admin, SourceOP Trusted Seller, etc.) with viable rep in their respective forums. However, this time of scammer will say ""I don't care, I don't trust him"" and still try to avoid using one. You should immediately delete, take a screenshot, and report it right away! 99% of the time he/she will make you go first and run off with your items/cash/other before you get theirs. The other 1% is when he/she will go first for a small trade and may seem trustworthy, but run off with your belongings in the following trades.
&gt;
&gt;2) You go first: In most cases, threads will tell you that the original poster will not go first and insist on you going first. As above, you should recommend to use a middleman if they have little to no rep. There is not much explanation needed for these types. They will no matter what insist you go first and will never do. Use a middleman and if they reject middlemen, read the above.
&gt;
&gt;3) I am new: This is a lesser common scammer, but still a very viable scammer to be wary of. The person will say something along the lines of ""I am new to paypal trading and want to build my trust."" In all of these cases, they WILL ask you to go first. If they do, they're most likely a scammer. However, if they are honest traders, they will most likely go first if you have more rep. If someone says they are new and you are new as well, USE A MIDDLEMAN. You can't trust anyone who joined yesterday and wants you to go first with your hard earned money/items.
&gt;
&gt;4) I've been scammed: These guys are my favorite type of scammers because they're also the biggest idiots! They will tell you that they will not go first due to being scammed before in the past. Well, that's not YOUR problem is it? It doesn't matter who gets scammed because the past is the past and you two are trading now. They most likely ask you to go first because they want to avoid being ""scammed again"" but remember, they're still demanding you to go first. Use a MM, or read #2 type of scammer.
&gt;
&gt;5) 50/50 or increments: Some traders like to go into increments or do what most people call ""50/50"" meaning one person will trade over half of the items/money and the other person will send their half over. Now this could go in one of two ways. The other trader (potential scammer) will make you go first in a 50/50 situation. Once they get your items/cash, they will run off. As I've said, scammers are desperate to scam ANYTHING of ANY VALUE. The second situation is that you go first and they respectively send their half afterwards, but when it comes to the rest of the 50/50, they will run off, making it a 100/50 situation for them. This type of scammer is not that common, but they are lurking out there. This could EASILY be avoided using a middleman!
&gt;
&gt;6) Talkative: Not really easy to spot out, but when you do see them, it becomes more obvious. These people will talk about very stupid topics or bring up ideas about trust. The most common things they will say are ""People should trust one another such as myself"" or ""We're both (insert nationality here). We don't stab each other in the back!"" Then ask THEM to go first if an alarm goes off in your head. If they trust you, no problem with them going first right? If you bring up using middlemen, they will try their best to avoid it. Some lines may be ""They're a human like all of us and have desires, hence they will scam us my friend!"" or something. Don't forget that EVERYONE here is human and have personal desires. Don't fall for their attempt to word his way out of your scam alerts.
&gt;
&gt;7) Sent money: If I had a scrap for every time this happened. These scammers are indeed one of the most COMMON type of scammers. They only appear in Paypal trades so watch out. Most of the time they will agree to go first, trying to earn your trust. However, when you commence the trade, they will say that their money has been ""sent"". A big warning will be that they say something like ""$5 sent to (paypal email). It should be in your balance"" or ""Paypal's been lagging today."" After the above sentences are typed out to you, they will ask you to give you the items since they did their part. How to avoid this? Ask for a screenshot of their transaction details. Paypal lets you see details of a sent/received payment. After this, they will surely delete you from their friends list and run. The other times they use the ""sent"" method is after you've traded (I still advise you much to use a middleman) and say that they've sent the payment, etc. and that Paypal could be lagging or some sorts. Don't even remotely think about going first because this is a guaranteed scam if you give them the items first.
&gt;
&gt;8) Impersonator: The scammer database on SourceOP has nothing but these guys on there! They will often try to scam you by literally cloning a trusted person's Steam profile. Most of the time they will tell you before hesitating ""Here's my rep"" and send you a rep thread belonging to the user they're impersonating. The impersonator's steam profile link (displayed in the address bar) will somewhat resemble the user's profile link. They will be NEAR close, but you can always VERIFY their profile by clicking the steam profile link located on the rep thread they send you. ALWAYS and I repeat, ALWAYS verify it's the real person. Use the profile link to actually see if they're the true person in their rep thread. If not, add the person who's getting impersonated, and invite both to a chat. Screenshot that chat, and report them.
&gt;
&gt;Things to note:
&gt;
&gt;Their privacy is set to ""Friends Only"" or ""Private""
&gt;The profile link is VERY similar, but the SteamID is completely different.
&gt;Most of the time, they will have a scammer tag next to their name (SOP Scammer, UHC Scammer, etc.)
&gt;
&gt;9) I gtg: These guys are easily avoided and obvious. They will tel you something like ""I got to go, my mom is forcing me off the computer, let's trade quick!"". They're not really going, rather, they're going to delete/block you so their appear offline! Don't EVER fall for this as this is the possibly easiest scam to avoid. TAKE YOUR TIME. Your/Their items aren't going anywhere. This can occur when a middleman is proposed/used. Once a middleman is selected and contacted, they will quickly dodge the trade entirely and delete both middleman and you. No harm done, but easy to screenshot and report.
&gt;
&gt;10) Post Count/Member Length: Oh man, these, are just pathetic. They will tell you ""I have a higher post count"" or ""I've been here longer"". These two things do NOT and should NOT be EVER taken into consideration determining someone's trust. They have more post counts? That means all they do is spam threads with lowball/highball offers and have less of a life than you do. If they've been here longer it doesn't matter. Maybe they just knew about it before you do. These scammers are so easily avoided you should just delete them right away or ask to use a middleman.
&gt;
&gt;11) Overpaying: Not very common, but they still exist. These scammers will majorly overpay for an item, such as a green confetti coupe for $60 or so. The first thing you notice is that they're highly overpaying for a lesser valued item. Read 2 sentences before this one. They just said they wanted to buy a confetti coupe for 3 bud's worth. The hat alone can barely be sold for 1.5. The scam attempt will be that they ask you to go first since they ""have more at risk"" or ""overpaying"". If so, suggest using a middleman! Both parties are safe and if he doesn't go through with it, then he's a scammer and you can report/spam his thread.
&gt;
&gt;12) Quickswitches: Not really the easiest to catch, but easily to fall for. They will open a trade with your normally. Simple items for items right? What you don't know is, most of the time, it's too good to be true. Sure he may really want the hat, but I haven't seen a Bill's Hat go for a Cow Mangler ever. He will try to get you to believe it's a fair and legit trade. What YOU don't know is that at any moment before YOU click trade, he will ""quick switch"" the item out. Meaning he will replace his most valuable item(s) with (an) item(s) of lesser value. For example, you're trading 3 keys for a Bill's Hat and he switches the Bill's hat for a NV Demo Fro. The ONLY way to prevent this is to TAKE YOUR TIME and do not rush your trade. Once you catch them, it's pretty easy. Just click ""Cancel"" and you're set to go.
&gt;
&gt;13) Two Man Scam(Thanks Celebi!): Another type of scam I might add involves 2 people, say, one person trading a bills hat for a NV hat or weapon you don't have. He'll ask you to find the item and exit out of the trade. Right after, another person will trade  request you offering several items, including what the previous owner asked for. As soon as you buy the item, they will both leave the server, leaving you with an unwanted item.
&gt;
&gt;You can watch out for this kind of scam by using common sense, it seems a bit fishy that the second person is immediately offering what the other guy is looking for.
&gt;
&gt;Those are the 13 types of scammers I've come across my day. Here are some tips to prevent them:
&gt;
&gt;* Read the above guide! Congratulations! You made it through a wall of text. Here's a cookie.
* Check their SteamRep/search their name on a scammer database. You will surely catch them there.
* Read stickies! Stickies such as the Scammer Database thread on SourceOP and doing a quick search of their profile will save you a ton of time and items/money
* Take screenshots. You don't know how many little kids have been crying about being scammed on forums without any evidence. You'll get flamed and the scammer will get away with it.
* Use a middleman. I cannot stress this enough. This is one of the ONLY ways you prevent scamming. Make sure they have reputable vouches and you BOTH agree to using them. Scammers will often times suggest a middleman of THEIR liking that you find fishy. Don't agree to that, use a trusted one.",,False,,t5_2skv6,1375749979.0,,mod,True,t3_1js0xz,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1js0xz/psa_sticky_guide_to_avoiding_scammers_sticky/,moderator

A lot of people had/have a hard time in life and sometimes they are out of luck, broke or both, I had my share of problems too when I was younger (well, even today) and couldn't afford many things, including games, but had some good friends that could lend me some of theirs, so for that I am really grateful.
 
After I became older the problem isn't the price so much, and more about free time to enjoy it, so after that I had given to my friends and family games that they are looking for and could not afford.
 
So thinking about people in this situation and to give this community something back, I like to giveaway something here too, so I chose the Humble Bundle Deep Silver mostly because it help the Humble Bundle charity in the process, and has good games, so a win-win. I will give 2 copies of the BTA Humble Bundle here and 1 copy of Fallout New Vegas for someone else.

1346944135.0,85,self.SteamGameSwap,zgaba,[PSA] Estimating the value of your games: a rough guide to how the Steam game swapping market works,93,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/zgaba/psa_estimating_the_value_of_your_games_a_rough/,"This is my humble attempt at explaining how trading works and how you can roughly estimate the trading value of the game you have/looking for.

------------------

**Short version:**

Three main factors determine a game's value: time, supply and demand. **Time** meaning how long it’s been since the most recent sale; **supply** meaning how many copies of a given game or collection are available for trade; and **demand** meaning both the relative popularity of the game among Steam gamers and traders, as well as how much the other person wants a game you have in a trade scenario.

A few steps which you should take before making an offer.

1. **Check past sale prices** and regional prices (useful sites include: [steamprices.com](http://www.steamprices.com/), [steamsales.rhekua.com](http://steamsales.rhekua.com/), [steamgamesales.com](http://www.steamgamesales.com/), [isthereanydeal.com](http://isthereanydeal.com/))
2. Estimate supply and demand for the game you want/have by **[browsing current trades](http://rgameswap.com/steam/list.pl#/button/c/blue/)** or **using the search bar and sorting by most recent**
3. **Make an offer** and/or **[open a new thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/submit)**

Regular traders tend to value games according to past sale prices (and sale frequency), but a fixed scheme or guide doesn't exist on a free market. In fact, it really isn’t possible since people look for games for different reasons (playing, re-trading, collecting, etc), and since prices differ from one region to another, not to mention popularity and many other factors like boxed/other digital store prices, pre-order bonuses, inclusion in indie bundles; the list goes on. This is a game you have to play if you want to speculate on the value of games, but in the end, you should determine your own reasons for trading, as ultimately only you can decide how much a game is worth to you.

------------------

**Long version:**

Factors to consider when trading

1. **Price and value are different things.** This is another way of saying that games are not stable like a currency; they are a commodity. Any time there is a disruption in one of the three factors mentioned above (**time, supply, demand**), the value of a game shifts. One-time or non-regular traders who really just want a certain game right now will value that game highly, thus since the demand is very high, they are often willing to ""overpay"" from the usual trading value because they're still getting a discount from the retail price. Regular traders are more focused on comparative trading value, re-tradability, or ability to turn a profit. Just look at trading of CS:GO and Dota 2 betas to see that price is not the same as value.

2. **Regional pricing.** Prices vary by region, sometimes wildly, and that’s without even taking Russia into account. Though /r/SteamGameSwap is predominantly Americans, Europeans, and Australians, we really do have a broad mix. In any trading community there will always be a few regular traders who live in countries with cheaper prices who are willing to sell their games for 75% of the US retail price or less, because they're still making a profit.

3. **Supply and demand.** This plays into point 1, too, but games do not go on sale at the same frequency, and sometimes other events, like giveaways, seriously affect supply and demand. Take the Mass Effect games -- they were 75% off in December 2011, but have not been at that price on Steam since then. As a result, anyone who happens to still have one who would likely expect much more than just another $20 game for it, because almost every other popular $20 game has been on sale for 75% in the meantime. A good example of the opposite situation is when the developers of Nuclear Dawn in June 2012 decided to give a free giftable copy to everyone who owned the game. The supply skyrocketed, and as a result the trading value plummeted for many weeks. Regular traders pay attention to which games go on sale more or less frequently, which affects the potential supply (and thus either drives or stifles demand).

4. **People trade for different reasons.** Some trade to find something to play today/this week/this month; others are long-term traders who may not always be interested in a particular game but subsidizing their gaming, others still are trying to make a profit through Paypal, etc.

Lowballers are annoying, but they tend to fade away when no one accepts their frivolous offers. So in my opinion, the final word is this: reject bad offers, accept good ones. What this means to each person will vary, and that's the whole point. If everyone valued their games the same, no one would ever make a trade.

&gt; **Steamrep.com**
Before you even speak to a trader use [Steamrep.](http://steamrep.com/) Place their profile link in the bar at the top to see if they're a registered scammer. Also It's not a bad idea to use the [Copy Info](http://i.imgur.com/oFp27BS.jpg) button &amp; save it in a .txt for future reference. Alternatively, for a more integrated experience install [blueshiftlabs](http://www.reddit.com/user/blueshiftlabs) [Flair Linker Enhanced](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wvmk8/psa_flair_linker_enhanced_is_now_available/) greasemonkey script [Link!](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/145990) | [Preview!](http://i.imgur.com/hXx8x.png)- From [yuv9](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30xrm)

&gt; **Check their profile creation date &amp; that they have game purchases.**
To check this view their Badges &amp; see the [Years of Service badge.](http://puu.sh/3Dqw9.png) Courtesy of [Multicast](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30a7e)

&gt; **Confirm they are a reddit/SteamGameSwap user.**
Always ask the person to post in your thread, so that you can check his past posts/flairs etc. Courtesy of [Multicast](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30a7e)

&gt; **If it looks too good to be true then it probably is.**
Self explanatory, something we're all taught as a child.

&gt; **Exercise common sense.**
If a trader is in a rush or pushing you that's generally a bad sign, if they're being dismissive or an asshole that's generally a bad sign. Think about the situation before committing, there's no rush.

&gt; **The trader with the key goes first.**
~~I don't care how much 'rep' they have, if they've been scammed before or whatever they always go first.~~ My original comment is based entirely on my own trades of course, what works for me probably (definitely) isn't going to work for you. See below for clarification.

&gt; **Trading keys.**
There is always a debate on this subject (and rightly so) as it entirely comes down to experience. The flair rule of the subreddit is an excellent guideline and is generally very accurate. Steam profile 'rep' is easily faked and should be taken with a pinch of salt. From [Multicast:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30a7e) Trade according to the reddit rules. i.e People with lower-tiered flair go before people with higher-tiered flair. From [Jc36:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb3084r) Get enough flair to go second, and decline traders that don't follow flair rules. 

&gt; **It's ok to decline a trade.**
A lot of the scammer chat logs I've read seem to occur because a person was already committed to getting a trade even when the circumstances aren't right. So if it doesn't feel right, just politely decline the trade.

&gt; **Private profiles are nothing to be scared of.**
For some reason wanting a little privacy nowadays is seen as being a shifty character, if the trader is legit they will happily switch their profile to public for a moment so you can examine/screenshot it.

&gt; **Extra step: Screenshot everything.**
It doesn't hurt and you can always refer to it later. If you're on windows, [Greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org/) &amp; [Puush](http://puush.me/) are pretty good.

&gt; **Enhanced Steam.**
From [Jc36:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ic4j6/psa_not_all_key_traders_are_scammers_use_common/cb30d5c) It's very easy to use, and puts convenient shortcuts to Steamrep, Stearmtrades etc on every profile you visit. Just open the profile of the prospective trader, check out the Steamrep links and others, should save you a lot of times.

To end on a more positive note, here's the [last key trade I did](http://puu.sh/3DpPR.jpg) which was with a very nice fellow called [Boblert](http://www.reddit.com/user/Boblert). See, we aren't all bad (=

It's called Enhanced Steam, and it is an extension for Chrome and Firefox.  This is just a few things that it can do.  

**[HERE'S](http://imgur.com/EwqAUiA)** a picture of my Steam Profile.  As you can see, it automatically puts a clickable link on anybody's Steam profile to their Steamrep, Steamgifts, Steamtrades, and other accounts.  Before you trade with anybody, all you need to do is click on the links in their profile to see if they're banned or suspended.  From there, you'll need to make your own judgement call.  There are also many other great features to Enhanced Steam.  You'll need to find this out for yourself!

If you're interested, you can find the download links for them below.

Be on the lookout for scammer w8baby who is now back to his old ways and is targeting all of reddit's trading forums. Over the last year or so he has already scammed people out of hundreds, possibly thousands, of dollars in games, items, and money.

He uses the following aliases:

* w8baby
* spekkter
* adversesin
* nijix123
* w8babyplease
* Beemo
* Earl Sweatshirt
* simonsimonla
* spekktrum
* trumspekk
* djhellasick

* Ichigeki
* mapthesoul
* BuN136
* wiggumcollins
* elazulspirit

He uses these steam profiles mainly:

* http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040789977
* http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052979999

His most recent scams involve trying to charge stuff to your cellphone. He will ask for your phone number, a text will be sent to you with a code and he will ask you for that code. The code is a verification code authorizing payments being made to your phone. Do not fall for this!

**Now for the fun part:**

I have all of w8baby's personal information.

Before, I was too busy to do anything with this information. But since he insists on continuing to scam people here, I have decided to take action. He is still a kid and I don't want to do anything illegal, so most likely I will just go and tell his parents (he's Asian so his parents will probably be pissed). My goal is not to hurt or punish w8baby, my goal is to get him to stop. I believe his parents are best able to do this.

I have collected a lot of evidence against him but IF YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED BY HIM AND HAVE SCREENSHOTS OR EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM, PLEASE SEND IT TO ME so that I can present it to his parents. You can post it here or PM it to me. Thanks!

1342269008.0,79,self.SteamGameSwap,wjpha,"[PSA] /r/SteamGameSwap MASTER CLASS: How to utilize this subreddit to its maximum potential! (New users, check this out.)",84,5,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wjpha/psa_rsteamgameswap_master_class_how_to_utilize/,"Hello, new users! Welcome to /r/SteamGameSwap (or, as we like to call it, SGS). We've been seeing a lot of confusion lately about the exact procedures involved in making trades here, so we thought we'd clarify with this guide.

Trading here is a little more complicated than other places, but it's that way for a reason. We pride ourselves on being an easy-to-navigate and safe place for people to trade - but in order to make that work, we need your help!

_All right, enough introduction. Let's get started!_

***

### Preliminaries

Your first trade on SGS will need to be made through the Steam Trading system. This means that you'll need an extra game (or TF2/Dota 2 items) in your inventory. (Click `View -&gt; Inventory` in Steam to see what you have.)

In particular, you can't trade games you already own in your Steam account, Steam-activatable codes (from Amazon or elsewhere), Humble Bundles, or Paypal.

The list of Steam Trading items is essentially limited to:

* Extra (gift) copies of Steam games
* TF2 items
* Dota 2 items
* Items for some other F2P games that aren't very common around here.

_Once you have your items, let's look for a trade!_

***

### Posting Your Trade

So you have some extra games you want to trade. Maybe you got extra copies, maybe you bought a four-pack, whatever. There are games you have that you don't want, and there are games you want that you don't have. Excellent! You've come to the right place.

The first thing to do is to search to **see if anyone wants the game you have.** Use the search box, or the [Browse Trades site](http://rgameswap.com/steam/list.pl) (also accessible via the blue **Browse Trades** button in the sidebar to the right). If you find someone who has a game you want, and wants a game you have, great! Skip down to **Making an Offer** below.

If you can't find anyone, you'll need to make a post of your own. Click the purple **Start a Trade** button to open the submission page.

Titles are everything here - to help people find your post, make sure you follow **this exact format:**

**[H] `&lt;Games you have&gt;` [W] `&lt;Games you want&gt;`**

For example, if you have Portal 2 and Street Fighter, and are after Arma II, you could post this:

    [H] Portal 2, Street Fighter [W] Arma II: CO

If you're not sure what you want in exchange for your game, you can ask for ""Offers"":

    [H] Portal 2, Street Fighter [W] Offers

If you're willing to buy games for the other person, you can put down that you have that amount in Steam Wallet:

    [H] $5 Steam Wallet [W] Portal 2

[_For more information about posting formats, read the Posting Format Guide._](/sw72u)

**Now wait for a response!** Make sure to search every few hours for people who might have missed your thread and posted one of their own. If a response isn't one that you're interested in, respond ""No, thank you"" - **don't downvote it!** _Once a response comes in that you like, skip down to ***Making the Trade.***_

***

### Making an Offer

Making an offer is quite simple - if someone's posted a game that you want, make a new top-level comment to tell them what you'd like to offer in exchange. (Don't reply under someone else's offer!)

The poster should respond to you telling you whether the offer is acceptable. Feel free to continue discussion, but make sure to make use of the ""reply"" function when you do!

***

### Making the Trade

Once you've agreed on an offer, you and your new trade partner should exchange Steam account details. Once you're talking through Steam chat, you can use Steam's trading function to make the actual swap. [If you've never used Steam Trading before, watch this video to learn how it works.](http://youtu.be/fpLWqZRJNVU)

Congratulations! You're now the owner of a shiny new game. Wait though - you're not done! You still need to do a couple more things.

### After the Trade

There's a few things you should do after a trade is finished:

1. **Close your thread.** If you're done with a trade thread, use the ""close thread"" link to mark the thread as closed. This lets people know at a glance that the trade is finished, and that they don't need to check the thread. **Don't delete the thread** - the moderators need the details of the trade for confirmation purposes.

2. **Confirm your trade.** To do this:

    1. Click the **Confirm a Trade** button in the sidebar.
    2. One trade partner should create a new top-level comment containing the name of the trade partner, the games traded, and a link to the trade thread.
    3. The other trade partner should reply **to that comment** with ""Confirmed"" or something similar, to indicate that the trade actually took place.

3. **Apply for flair.** Flair is the Steam icon next to people's names that indicates how many trades they've done, and points people to their Steam profile for easy trading. Flair is necessary in order to make trades outside of Steam Trading. In order to get your own flair, you'll need to complete a trade, then apply for it.

    To apply for flair, click [this link](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade) and fill in:

    1. Your steamID64. To find this, go to [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com), enter your Steam account details, and copy the line that says `steamID64`.
    2. The **permalink** to the confirmation you made in #2 above. Make sure to permalink to the *parent* comment (the one with the information, not the one saying ""confirmed"").

    The mods will review your trade details, check your account age, and make sure everything is in order. Soon, you'll get a message back telling you to check out your shiny new flair!

    Congratulations, you can now trade keys, codes, and non-Steam-Trading items!

***Definition of ""wanker"":***

*Another word for tosser, which is usually reffered to when someone is being a tool or a complete dick.*

Dear /r/SGS users,

I (and the rest of the mod team) have noticed a bit of nasty behaviour between traders. Name-calling, hostile behaviour, and outright dickishness, even. 

I'm just posting this to inform you all that we *will* remove posts and comments which are written in an overly-douchey manner. It's rude, not polite, uncouth - whatever you want to call it, we're not okay with it. **The best way to get through to someone is politeness, and if they offer something that you don't want, a simple ""No thank you :)"" will suffice.**

Seriously, it's not difficult! It's a great lesson to take into the outside world\*, too. *Act unto others as you would have them act unto you*.

Love,  
The /r/SGS mod team &lt;3

1332528291.0,78,self.SteamGameSwap,rac0g,[H] 30+ Steam keys to give away; [W] to give back to SteamGameSwap ,84,6,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/rac0g/h_30_steam_keys_to_give_away_w_to_give_back_to/,"**Yet another edit**: With contributions from other generous moderators and users, we've given away an amazing ~~52~~ 72 keys so far, by my count, with ~~25~~ 5 various keys left to give. Thanks to everyone for participating in the giveaway, for the kind words and for really helping me have a good day. I stayed up until after 4am my time giving out keys and got like three hours of sleep, but I'm still having a great day today. Much better in contrast to yesterday. For now, keep the key requests coming!

----------Original Post---------

I had a kind of crappy day today, so I figured I'd try to turn it around by doing something nice. I have a hodgepodge of extra Steam keys from various bundles/promotions/trades, so I've set up this thread to give them away to other SGS users. Normally individual key trading is not allowed, but I received moderator permission to do this.

**The rules**:

1. Only one key per person. Please ask for a key you will use personally.
2. Make a comment below stating which key you want (maybe include a second choice, too, just in case).
3. I will **ONLY** give keys to users with SGS flair. I want to give back to the SGS community, and flair is how I will determine that you're an active member of the community. Apologies to the lurkers.
4. I'll distribute all of these keys by Reddit PM. I don't mind people adding me on Steam, but don't do it just to ask for a key, because I'm giving them out here, not there.

**Reminder**: Per the SGS rules, recipients of giveaways do not get flair, so there's no point in posting anything to the confirmed trades thread (I already have the highest flair, so it does me no good, either).

**FINAL UPDATE**

All that's left:

* Hacker Evolution (x1)
* Hacker Evolution: Untold (x3)
* Hacker Evolution: Duality (x1) (courtesy of user delacct)


**Note**: If the key I give you doesn't work, I probably just screwed up and sent the same key to two people or something. Let me know if that happens and I'll do my best to get you the game you asked for.

Post a comment with a number between **1 and 1000** and **what game or games you'd like**. You can only win once, so put the games in order of which you'd like most.

1354031436.0,74,self.SteamGameSwap,13vlfp,"[PSA] About the recent wave of downvoting and ""voting cliques""",89,15,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/13vlfp/psa_about_the_recent_wave_of_downvoting_and/,"The autumn sale was great, or shall we say a good warm up for the winter sale, at least. Hopefully everyone had the chance to grab a game or two for themselves or to hold onto until December 20th. :)

A couple of things:

#1. **Recently large numbers of threads have been systematically downvoted.** It could be anyone, really, from a disgruntled banned user to someone trying to promote their own thread by downvoting others.

The subreddit is growing constantly (we're almost at 10,000 subscribers!), and we’ve always been an opinionated group trying to make the best trades we can, so it’s no surprise that downvotes happen.

**I would propose this solution: make it a habit that if you see a thread with negative votes for no good reason, give it an upvote, until it's back at 1 again.** This will put everyone on a level playing field and thwart whatever troll is trying to damage r/SGS. Everyone deserves a chance to offer their trade.

#2. **[""Voting cliques""](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutescheating) are against the spirit and rules of reddit.** Upvoting and downvoting is already minimal on r/SGS, which makes the system that much easier to manipulate. Traders may have started or be tempted to start voting cliques, by asking their friends to upvote each time they make a new post. **Please don’t do this. It does not go unnoticed. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;**

Sure, on the surface it might not cause any harm, but it encourages others to attempt similar methods for visibility’s sake, and there's only a thin line between this and the ""mass downvotes"" tactic. Neither can really be policed, but it’s unfair to those who play by the rules, and in the long term, it creates a more negative and competitive atmosphere, rather than the friendly place we want /r/SGS to be. So please don't.

---------------------------------
In the long term both of these tactics drag down the quality of the community as a whole.

**TL;DR #1 Some bad actors are mass downvoting threads; please help combat this by upvoting threads with negative votes until they get back up to 1.**

**TL;DR #2 Voting cliques are against the spirit and rules of reddit; please don’t do this.**

1. People who **want** Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who **have** Dota 2 and want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment.
3. The post-closing function won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

## **If you have Dota 2, don't post a new comment. Only reply to other people's offers.**

Remember that our normal rules still apply:

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

Some people seem to think it’s crazy that someone would go and buy games and sell them off cheaper than what they paid for it. However, what these users may not know is the profit margin behind selling Steam games at a discounted price.

Steam Market Beta has allowed for us users the chance to add funds to our Steam wallets without actually spending the same amount that we get in return. How is this done? It is done through the sale of items in the Steam Market. The most popular and arguably the easiest item to sell are the Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys. These keys can be picked up from anywhere from $1.25 – $1.40 PayPal on the “gray market” and can be sold on the Steam Market for at least $1.85 Steam Wallet^1. That’s almost a guaranteed 33% discount on Steam Wallet funds. At its best, you gain $1.00 Steam wallet for every $0.66 you actually spend.

When you take this into consideration, it really isn’t a surprise as to why anyone would want to sell Steam games at a discount. Those selling at 20% off are making at best $0.15 per $1.00 Steam wallet spent. I realize that I am guilty of this and even went as far as to try and get others to do this at a 25% discount (I would take a cut of 5-10%), but that did not really go over so well. So, without further ado, let me present

***Part I. Pre-Requisites***

****

**Step 1: Create a PayPal account if you have not done so already**

You will need to use PayPal in order to buy Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys from the “gray market”. Other payment methods such as Moneypak or Bitcoins are also accepted by sellers, but since I have more experience with PayPal, my guide will be written accordingly.

**Step 2: Get your PayPal account verified**

This is extremely important. Most sellers that sell items to those without reputation require that at least your PayPal be verified before they consider selling to you. They also take other things into consideration (i.e. your Steam account age, the amount of games on your account, the current value of your TF2 backpack) before they decide whether or not they want to sell items to you so it’s not guaranteed that they’ll be OK with selling with you even if your PayPal is verified. If you do not know how to get your PayPal verified, you can refer to [**PayPal’s Help Center**](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/article/?solutionId=10568&amp;).

**Step 3: Create an account on SourceOP**

There are indeed other places you can go to in order to buy TF2 keys (like /r/tf2trade), but generally I buy most of my items from people who post on the SourceOP forums and so this guide will be based on that. In order to navigate and be able to post on the forum, you must visit their [**registration page**](http://forums.sourceop.com/register.php?s=3ccfb3e28c8a9d7a28e168cf958bf074). Once you verify your e-mail address, you should be able to create posts.

**Step 4: Create a SourceOP Reputation Thread**

After you verify your e-mail account and are able to post on the forums, head over to the [**SourceOP New Rep Thread Pre-Approval Forum**](http://forums.sourceop.com/forums/35-SourceOP-New-Rep-Thread-Pre-Approval) and post a new thread. The purpose of a reputation thread is to keep track of all your past PayPal trades as well as allowing others viewing it to assess how trustworthy you are. Even if you have substantial “rep” on your Steam profile page, no one dealing with actual cash trades ever takes it seriously because they can easily be manipulated and any negative comments can be deleted by the user.

The title of your thread should be “(insert SOP username here)’s Rep Thread”. For example, since my SourceOP username is ‘orijinal’, my rep thread is titled “orijinal’s Rep Thread”. In the body of the initial post, you must include at the bare minimum your SteamID64 URL.

The easiest way to do this is to head over to [**SteamRep**](http://www.steamrep.com) and insert the link to your Steam profile in it. Once you finish that, you can just copy the entire contents of the box containing your “Profile Identifiers” and pasting it into your post. From there, you may add anything else you would like. Submit your thread and you will be finished with the first part of the process.

**Note that this part of the process was merely just to lay the foundation for your endeavor to buy TF2 keys for PayPal. You will not need to do any of this again.**

****

***Part II. Buying keys from the gray market***

****

***Step 1. Find a reputable seller that is willing to sell to those with little or no reputation***

Head over to the [**TF2 Item Buying/Selling**](http://forums.sourceop.com/forums/32-TF2-Item-Buying-Selling) forum on SourceOP. Using the search function on your browser (CTRL+F), type in “no rep” without the quotation marks and see if any threads are highlighted. Here is an [**example thread**](http://forums.sourceop.com/threads/138393-%E2%98%A0-I%C9%B4%D2%93%C9%AA%C9%B4%C9%AA%E1%B4%9B%E1%B4%87-%E2%84%97%E1%B4%8F%C9%AAs%E1%B4%8F%C9%B4-%E2%88%9E-s-Exchange-Shop-for-Bills-Buds-Keys-etc-NO-REP-NEEDED)^**3** where a user is willing to sell to those who have little or no rep. Be sure to read the initial post for their prices and terms and conditions. Most users have a link to their reputation thread in their signature. If you agree with their terms and are comfortable with the amount of reputation that they have, add the person on Steam.

I would not recommend buying from that person in particular as that seller does not have much rep. Try to find reputable sellers with at least a few pages of positive reputation.

***Step 2. Discuss the details of the trade with the other person***

First, determine whether or not the other person will sell keys to you. The seller may request your PayPal e-mail so that it can be checked for whether or not the account associated with that e-mail address is verified. They may also ask for your reputation thread even if it has nothing on it. The seller will be inspecting your Steam profile as well as searching you up on SteamRep to see if you can be trusted. If the seller allows you to buy keys, the quantity you may purchase will most likely be limited.

If the seller agrees to sell you keys, make sure that you verify the amount of keys that will be traded as well as the amount that will need to be paid for them. The seller may also impose a set of conditions for the actual payment such as paying for fees or leaving a memo with the payment.

***Step 3. Sending the payment***

To ensure that you are sending the payment via the “Gift” option^4, please refer to the options selected in [**this image**](http://i.imgur.com/wnVOP.png). Should there be any fees, there will be an option that will allow you to pay for them. If you are from a different country than your seller, your fee will be 1% of the total assuming you are using funds directly from your bank account to make the payment. If you are using a credit card, it will be 5.9% of the total. Once you have sent the payment, inform the seller so that the person will check to see if it was received.

***Step 4. Wait for the seller to initiate a Steam trade***

It may take a few minutes for the seller to verify your payment so just sit tight. If all goes well, the seller will initiate a trade and all you need to do is accept the keys after the seller adds them all into the window.

In the event of a scam, screenshot the entire conversation and upload them on [**Imgur**](http://www.imgur.com). Do not close the Steam chat window. Follow the instructions on [**how to report a scammer**]( http://forums.steamrep.com/threads/howto-report-a-scammer-look-at-acceptable-format-before-posting.51/). Be sure to follow that format when creating a new thread on their [**report a scammer forum**](http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/).

***Step 5. Exchanging reputation***

Once the trade is complete, politely request for the seller to leave you rep on your reputation thread. Just send the seller your link and ask the seller to provide a link to their own respective reputation thread. The format for SourceOP reputation posts follows this basic outline:

**I [bought/sold] [insert item and quantity here]. [I/He/She] went first, then the [payment/item(s)] was sent. +Rep**

For instance, if you had bought 10 keys from the seller and you paid first, you would write something like,

&gt; I bought 10 keys from him. I sent the payment first, then received the keys after. +Rep

The exchange of reputation is important because not only will it make it easier for you to purchase from the gray market in the future, but once you have a good amount of rep, you should be able to buy from those who offer the lower end price^5 for keys.

****

**Part III. Selling keys on the Steam Market**

****

***Step 1. Navigate to the Steam Market under the Community Tab on Steam to see the current key prices***

Once you are on the [**Steam Market**](http://steamcommunity.com/market/) page, go on the “Popular Items” tab and look for the Mann Co. Supply Crate Key. At the time of me typing this out, the keys were starting from $2.12, meaning that you would be gaining $1.85 Steam wallet per key sold assuming you matched the lowest price.

***Step 2. Decide the price at which you would like to sell your keys for, then list them***

If you don’t want to wait, it may be a good idea to list your keys at $0.02-0.03 cheaper than the current cheapest price. Once your keys are listed, you just need to wait for people to buy your keys and you are on your way to gaining more in Steam wallet than you initially invested with your money.

****

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask me here and I (or others who are familiar with this) will answer them for you.

****

^1 *Your results WILL vary. As more and more people become aware of how the current market allows you to get a discount on Steam wallet, the cheaper these prices will be, meaning your profit margins will be lower.*

^2 *Should you decide you want to try this out, I am in no way responsible if you are scammed or if you do not gain the project amount of Steam wallet you thought you would receive. I am merely just explaining how one could do something like this and any attempts to replicate it are done at your own risk.*

^3 *I am in no way affiliated with that seller nor am I endorsing their shop. It was just an example thread with a title that would let you know that the seller was willing to sell keys to those with little or no rep. In fact, as previously stated, I would not recommend buying from that person at all since that person has little rep as well.*

^4 *The PayPal Gift option is not available in every region. If you are unable to send as a gift, let the seller know that you will be willing to send a normal payment and will pay for any fees that way. The fees are 3.9% of the total transaction plus an additional $0.30. The best way to calculate the entire payment is to add $0.30 to the amount that the seller wants, then divide the entire amount by 0.961. For example, if I wanted to sell 10 keys for $13.50, you would need to send me $14.36.*

^5 *Most sellers that sell to those with little or no rep usually price their keys at around $1.40, possibly higher. However, once you have a good amount of rep, you should be able to buy keys at around the $1.30 price range.*",,False,,t5_2skv6,1362557932.0,,tier4,True,t3_19radc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/19radc/psa_how_to_get_steam_wallet_for_cheap/,

### Da Rulez:

1. Entries close **Tuesday the 17th, 10PM PDT.** The drawing will take place at some point after that.

2. Users will be drawn at random. For each user drawn, they will receive a copy of whichever game is a) ranked highest and b) still in stock.

5. Winners will be posted in a thread, and winners will be notified by PM. Games must be claimed by the end of the Summer Sale, or they may be redrawn.

6. Please make sure that the Steam ID listed in your flair is accurate - games will only be traded to the Steam account on record.

People need to stop trying to scare people away from trades by posting unnecessary negative comments in others' trade threads.

If someone is making a bad offer, respond politely or don't respond at all.

If he is lowballing, feel free to make OP a better offer, or post a better one in a new thread if the OP is lowballing.

If it appears that he really doesn't know his offer is bad, try PMing the trader to educate him about usual trading values, and answer any questions he might have.

The reason I say to PM them is so people don't get scared away from trading with him. This way, he now has a 0.001% chance of making his trade, instead of a 0% chance.

This will help SGS grow in a good way, and not make us seem like a bunch of jerks completely intolerant of new people who just don't know how things work.

Yes, I know there are a bunch of people here who try to be helpful, but sometimes you guys assume people know more than they do. Politely educating inexperienced traders helps build the community.

If you can't resist posting, only make a post that points the traders in the right direction so they can do their own research.

It allows for individual games to be searched for and then list who has them and can send messages to those who have the games, which would eliminate the need for a limit to posting, and editing, etc. I don't know if anyone has brought this up before. If they have, sorry for bringing it back up. But, i'm sure if you posted a PSA asking for someone to help re-design the subreddit i'm sure they would help :D. Thanks for reading!""*

Now, we're not going to remove the limits on posting (seriously, once per 24 hours is plenty enough), but I would very much like to bring your attention to [**THIS EXCITING BLUE TEXT RIGHT HERE!**](http://www.rgameswap.com/steam/list.pl) Why's that? This is a site which automatically scrapes link titles and puts them into an easily-searchable interface! Boo yeah!

It's important to note that this is why AutoModerator removes posts without spaces in the titles - the spaces actually need to be there for the site to parse the posts properly. :)

-----------------------------------

###THIRDLY:

24 hour rule. Remember it. What's this, you ask? It's the rule where you're only allowed to post once per 24 hours to cut down on spam. Please stick to it, and if you see anyone violating it, report it and either **comment in the thread** saying why you reported or **message the mods** saying why you reported it - we really don't have the time to check every single poster's history.

-----------------------------------

###FOURTHLY:

Evading AutoMod will earn you a ban - specifically when evading AutoModerator in post titles. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: ""[H] DEFENCE OF TEH ANSHENTS 2 BETA [W] DERP"" is evading the AutoModerator wilfully and will earn an instant ban, free of charge. These rules are around for a reason - stick to 'em!

------------------------------

###FINALLY:

Please upvote this post for visibility; I receive no karma for it. 

Y'all are a pretty great group of traders - let's keep it this way.

Sorry for all the shouting. It pisses me off that this guy is scamming, but almost as much that people keep falling for it. Seriously, follow this checklist:

* How did they contact you?
* How old is their Reddit account?
* How old is their Steam account?
* How many games are on the account--are there expensive new AAA games on it or is it a couple of cheap indie bundles and free-to-play titles?
* Are they marked as a scammer by Steamrep.com?
* Did you check that any ""rep"" page they linked you to (a Steam profile, a Steamtrades.com profile, etc) was _actually_ the profile of the same user, and not just the same avatar and nickname?
* ARE THEY OFFERING SOMETHING TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?

* Useful quick links!
    * Add friend

***All right! I'm sold! How do I install this wonderful bit of technology?***

First of all, you'll need to be using Firefox or Chrome. If you can get this working on another browser, feel free, but I haven't tested this there.

## Firefox Installation Instructions

0. Uninstall or disable any other flair-linker addons you might have installed.
1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. Restart Firefox
3. Click ""Install"" on [this page][dl-firefox]
4. Click ""Install"" on the dialog box that appears.
5. Go enjoy your new fancy flair!

## Chrome Installation Instructions

Flair Linker Enhanced is now available on the Chrome App Store. [Install it here.][dl-chrome]

***

***HELP! It won't work!***

First, try these common troubleshooting steps:

* Refresh the page you're on.
* Restart your browser.
* Make sure that Steam Community and SteamRep aren't experiencing downtime. If they go down, the corresponding parts of the script will stop working.
* Reinstall the script.

If that won't work, try posting in the comments below.

Whose ideas were these? Did you guys think it was a good idea? No, they're not.

Honestly, this subreddit has gone down the shitter.

PayPal trades requiring Blue flair and above? Shitty rules. That doesn't prevent people from getting scammed. Every now and then you get a post saying [PSA] x is a scammer, don't trade with him.

Why don't you guys, as mods, step up and take some form of action instead of sitting back, and enforcing your shitty, useless rules? If you guys put half a fuck into managing this subreddit's users rather than thinking up ridiculous rules, this place would be so much better.

""Hey guise, let's make AutoModerator remove all posts that don't follow the [H] [W] format"". What up with this? It's not like /r/SteamGameSwap's users are robots that need a specific format to understand.

Instead of being such a dick and making people follow the rules like a bible, how about you guys promote safe trading instead of preventing bad trading? Let us contact the mods for middleman requests, instead of telling us NOT to trade with people.

This is probably going to get removed soon after, once one of you mods see it.

Missed some Daily Deal games? Don't worry - now's your chance to get a hold of them!

Today's features:

* [Mirror's Edge](http://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/)
* [Assassin's Creed II](http://store.steampowered.com/app/33230/)
* [Metro 2033](http://store.steampowered.com/app/43110/)
* [F.E.A.R. 3](http://store.steampowered.com/app/21100/)

***

### How to Enter:

Unlike previous giveaways, there is **no limit** on the number of games you can enter for. Please don't enter for games that you already own or won't play!

To enter, post a list below with the games you'd like to enter for, **ranked in the order of your preference.** If your username is drawn, you'll receive your most-preferred game that I still have available.

***

### Da Rulez:

1. Entries close **Wednesday the 18th, 10PM PDT.** The drawing will take place at some point after that.

2. Users will be drawn at random. For each user drawn, they will receive a copy of whichever game is a) ranked highest and b) still in stock. Drawings will continue until I run out of users or out of games. (Winners will be drawn automatically by [this Python script.](http://pastebin.com/uEj0viXD))

3. In order to participate, you must have **gray flair or higher** as of the time of the drawing. Entries without flair will be ignored until they go away. Yes, I will be clearing the backlog before I do the drawing. _(Go make some trades!)_

4. Winning one Lightning Giveaway will make you ineligible to win Lightning Giveaways on other days... sorry!

5. Winners will be posted in a thread, and winners will be notified by PM. Games must be claimed by the end of the Summer Sale, or they may be redrawn.

6. Please make sure that the Steam ID listed in your flair is accurate - games will only be traded to the Steam account on record.

7. You **must not own** games you enter for! If you win a game you already own, your prize will be redrawn.

*Fine print: Confusing, badly-formatted, or otherwise invalid entries may be interpreted in whatever way I find most entertaining. Not responsible for issues with flair applications - please read the FAQ first. Professional driver, closed course. Your mileage may vary. These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and these games are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any disease. Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball. This post may not be reproduced without the express written consent of Major League Baseball.*

**Good luck to all!**

Today I'll be offering everything I can at cost (or less, if at cost isn't cheap enough). The only catch is that you can't re-trade; these prices are for you to play the game. That means you can't buy at these prices if you have the game in your library. If you're buying for a friend, send them over. Also, you can buy any two games at first. If you want more, you'll have to wait (this is so the games get spread amongst as many people as possible).

I'm looking for TF2/Dota 2 keys (or ref for games I paid less than one key's worth for). Of course, I'll gladly listen to other offers as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**TradeStarter**

I felt it was about time I updated the post, for better overview. I've made a few changes here tonight, if you encounter any issues - please let me know, as you did earlier! Thanks :)

**Recent Update**

* Gifts are now marked by [g] instead of the **(!)** which was used earlier.
* Tuned down the megalomania, top left corner will now return you to the front page instead of my profile.
* Page title changed to TradeStarter
* Added alertmessages; User not found or private profile. Should clear on new searches. **Fixed**: Cleared before it showed the alerts. D'oh.
* Typing with a kitten walking on the keyboard is hard.
* Updated the copy function to unmark, whenever you change from the last thing you copied. Now you'll know if you copied the last change you made.
* Added 'Start Trade' to the top nav. Start Trade basicly does your job for you - and opens a new tab/window on SGS, with your selection already in the text field. All you have to do now is add swanky details and personal flair.


**What is TradeStarter**

TradeStarter is a simple system, which is designed to make it easier for you to create a sorted, linked and formatted lists of your steam inventory. You can either have the system list all the gifts/tradables you have in your inventory or just a select few (or many). It all depends on what you want.
TradeStarter is currently geared towards SGS - but I aim to make it usable for other sites aswell, with options for BB or truetype listings.

**Known Bugs**

* StartTrade: **The encodeURI in Firefox is acting up - and won't parse data to reddit properly.**
* The item counter can get a bit wonky if you have more than three of the same type of item. Steam doesn't seem to deliver the correct amount of JSON objects. I'm currently investigating this.
* If just one item in a stack of items is region locked or untradable, the entire stack will be marked.
* If you have a vast inventory, reddit blocks out the amount of data parsed directly. Which means that you won't be able to use the 'Start Trade' function directly from TradeStarter.


**How do I use it?**

* Go to http://runtyrobot.com/tradestarter/
* Put in your username or steamurl (it SHOULD be able to differentiate, again it's alpha - it may or may not)
* After a few seconds you get a checklist of your inventory. 
* You can now proceed to mark and unmark the items you want and do not want to put up for trade. 
* Once you're done, you hit 'Copy' in the top navigation and that bad boy should now be ready to be pasted **OR you can click the 'Start Trade' button to initiate a new thread on reddit** 

**Legend / Formatting**

* [R] Means one or more items in a stack is region locked.
* [g] Means one or more items in a stack is untradable/giftable only.
* x (n) indicates the number of items in a stack. *Still a bit wonky*
* All titles are linked to their store page, if they have a link attached in the inventory.

**Requirements**

* Public profile
* Publicly visible inventory
* Javascript enabled (default)
* Browser that supports Flash (for copying).

**Do you knick our datas?**

I feel it's only fair to tell what and if I keep any of your data. But the truth is, besides Google Analytics - **I don't save anything**. TradeStarter isn't even connected to the database. Although I might consider saving some data in the near future, it'll be focused around improving performance and use. 

**Any upcoming plans for updates?**

Why yes! You people have been more than kind and supplied me with plenty of ideas - and I have quite a few things to work with, amongst the things I expect to implement rather soon is;

* Selective formatting (Reddit / true text / bb)
* Selective sorting (Alphabetically, reversed, by number of items etc.)
* Save profile (cookie), so that it loads the last used profile automatically, when you enter the site. That way, you don't have to type. Hell, you don't even have to move your hand to the keyboard.
* Specified Region Lock information, so you have a chance of knowing which type.
* Find out why the iterator isn't working properly.
* Optional linking to item in inventory
* Automatically generated inventory link
* Your idea... :)

**Questions or comments**

* I love to hear your feedback, but if something does go wrong - please try to elaborate as much as you can. What happened - or didn't happen? Which browser were you using? Which OS? Feel free to add screenshots, if you think that could help me out. I'll take any help I can get, when it comes to trying to figure out how to fix the issues you guys encounter.
* Comments and ideas are more than welcome! I try to encorporate as many things as I can - but I do take it upon myself to decide which updates are to be made when. Is it easy to fix or a brilliant idea that would benefit everybody, then I'll probably add that before the larger changes that only benefit a few. I hope you'll understand :)

1333226304.0,55,self.SteamGameSwap,rmt26,[Announcement] FatmanRising's guide on how to do succesful trades when using Paypal (or alternatively not getting scammed by e-rascals).,60,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/rmt26/announcement_fatmanrisings_guide_on_how_to_do/,"Hello everybody,

Many of you probably haven't heard of me as I've been missing in action for a couple of months, but I've been a mod here in SGS since it started. 

I read *ahem* sgs_mods_are_pricks *ahem* post this morning and well, while it was a big boy's rant above everything else, I realized that our rules to ensure the safety of trades outside Steam Trade aren't sufficient enough, but also that no official rule will ever prevent scams, and that in the end, it's all about detecting scammers yourself. So, with that in mind, I decided to make a guide to help begginers and veterans alike. 

Before we begin with the formal guide, you may be wondering: Who the hell is FatmanRising? As I said before, I'm a mod, and have been since SGS started. However, I'm writting this guide not as a mod, but as a trader. I've been trading for a couple of years now, and with around 60 trades under my belt, with about half of them being Paypal related, I've never been scammed once. Because I don't like risking, I've most certainly missed a couple of good deals, but I've also avoided potential scams.

Was I lucky? Probably yes, but I was also cautious, and followed these rules in order to avoid scammers:

**Always make sure the Paypal account is verified. Always^always^always**.

Seriously, make sure the Paypal account you're dealing with is verified. What is being Paypal verified? [Here's a short FAQ on the subject by Paypal itself.](https://cms.paypal.com/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=security/verification_faq) Now, on how to know if someone is Paypal verified, it's simple, just log in to Paypal and then type this address in your browser:

https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=username@mail.com

Where ""username@mail.com"" is the trader's email associated with Paypal. So, for example, if someone tells you his email is average.joe@gmail.com, you should type https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=average.joe@gmail.com. 

If someone you're dealing with is not verified, ask them to prove legitimacy through feedback either on steam or other buy/trade/sell locations. If the trader can't prove legitimacy, then avoid trading with him/her.

**Analyze the other trader's behaviour.**

This one is the hardest, but you'll dodge a lot of bullets by learning how to analyze people's behaviour properly. You'll sometimes miss good deals, and you'll sometimes avoid scams. You'll have to trust your guts, but in the end, if you don't like losing, you won't.

Here's some examples of phrases you should look out for:

&gt;*Hey bro, can you go first? I don't trust you, and I don't want to be scammed lol*

Most probably a scammer, and a lame one. It's basic logic, you're in the same position of the other trader, why should you go first? Either avoid the trade or request a middleman. Regardless of flair, if you don't feel safe, request a middleman. Said middleman can be a mod in SGS, a trader you both trust, a mod of other trading subreddit (like tf2trade), etc. Just make sure it's a person of trust so you don't both get scammed.

&gt;Shortly after adding the guy to Steam and saying hi:

&gt;*Send the money to tough@guy.com. After I receive the money I'll give you your game. No questions please do as I say.*

Sometimes you'll come across this ""tough guy"". He won't say hi, he won't say thanks, and he will be rude overall. He can be a trusty douchebag but he can be a scammer as well. Personally, I don't like dealing with rude people so I avoid trades with them.

&gt;*Hurry pls, I have 2 go soon*

Most probably a scammer. He'll tell you to hurry up because he has to leave or has another deal. If he can't wait, he's not worth wasting your time.

&gt;*Hey I'm not home, can you send me the money and I give you the key/game/account when I get home?*

&gt;Alternatively:

&gt;*Hey I'm not home, can you give me the key/game/account and I pay you when I get home?*

Wait for the trader to get home. If he doesn't reply it means it was a failed attempt at scamming.

&gt;*Hey it seems I have some trouble with Paypal atm. Can you send the me the game/key and I pay you when I fix the problem.*

&gt;Alternatively

&gt;*Hey I don't have enough funds, can I pay you in a week? I'll even pay you extra.*

Don't be a Good Guy Greg. Wait for the other trader to fix the Paypal issues before you send anything.

**If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably isn't true.**

I always expect a max of 20% below the lowest sale price, and you should too. When someone is selling keys a lot cheaper than the normal value (new games/pre purchases) or the lowest sale price (older games usually) it's probably a scam. This happened with Dead Island keys for example, where people would sell them for less than $5 because they got them on a leak. Accounts with Dead Islands activated from these codes got their copies of Dead Island removed. Take note that I'm referring to keys, because tradeable gifts are safe to be traded, just don't fall for a guy selling you Darksiders 2 for $20 without proof and asking you to go first. Common sense applies.

It is also a good idea to check websites like [SteamGameSales](http://www.steamgamesales.com/) for current and past deals. This way you can have an idea of what games go for currently and also avoid bad trades.

Because SteamGameSales doesn't cover every single site, I suggest checking /r/GameDeals as well. I've been checking the subreddit for a long time and there's deals I wouldn't have heard from if it wasn't for them. Just search the game you want do a price check of, and if it has ever been on sale by legitimate sites, you'll find something. 

**When dealing with accounts, make sure the trader changes email and password**.

Most accounts, like League of Legends, Path of Exile, Battlenet and even Steam have options to change your email and password. Changing your email is the most secure way of cutting ties with the previous owner, and giving you the power to change everything else. Make sure the owner doesn't hesitate about changing his email (or lying about it), because if he does, he will probably scam you by recovering the password later.

**Here are some tips to determine how reliable the trader is:**

* Add the trader to Steam.

Even if the trade is not Steam related, it's easier/faster to trade and chat via an actual chat, and Steam has one. Plus, it gives you access to more information about the trader, allowing you to check the activity, games played, etc. The more there is in the table, the less chances there are for a scam to happen. Anonymity gives you power, so don't give the other trader too much power.

* Be a stalker for a couple of minutes.

Yepe, be a stalker. Know who are you dealing with. In addition to adding the trader to Steam, it is a good idea to check the first two pages of activity on Reddit. See where the trader posts. Frequently posts on /r/WoW or /r/Redditguild? Probably an active member of the reddit World of Warcraft community. If the trader is an active redditor it means the account is not a throwaway, which means the trader will rather not destroy its reputation so easiliy.

* Do a quick search of the trader with SteamRep

I've never used the site myself, but some users indicate that it's a good idea to check the trader's Steam account on the site  to make sure he/she hasn't scammed before.

Take note that these are some extra precautions but are not necessary in order for the trade to go smoothly. 

**Conclusion**

In the end, it's all about common sense and not daydreaming about the best deal of your life. Keep you head cool and analyze the other trader. If you don't feel 100% safe even if the other trader acts trustworthy, then, for the sake of both, request the aid of a middleman or don't proceed with the trade. As I said, I've probably missed a few good deals, but I've also avoided being scammed.

**TL;DR: Read the damn thing!**

Over the past few years I've occasionally created trivia games for reddit with the prize being a steam game. I have an extra copy of Chivalry, so it's time for another one! 


**The rules:** Go [here](http://reddittriviatime.wordpress.com/) and you'll see 4 password protected blog posts. Each post contains a riddle that will reveal the password to the next problem in line. Get through all 4, following the directions at each one, and if you're the first to solve them all, Chivalry is yours. 

In order to win, you'll need to tell me the answers to ALL the riddles AND how you solved it, so brute forcing the passwords isn't going to really help you.

That's about it. Good luck!

Oh, and the first password is ""chivalry"" (all passwords are lowercase)

EDIT: Oh, and if you follow the instructions in the riddles, you'll know when and how to message me the answers. Don't just post them in the comments!

EDIT 1: Here's a small hint (besides the hints I've been posting in the comments): Riddle #1 is the rosetta stone you'll need to solve the other 3 riddles in Problem 1. But how do they all connect?

EDIT 2: Because no one has won yet, but some have gotten close, here's a big hint for Problem 1: I really like movies...and villains.

EDIT 3: Going to bed. If you message me, I won't be responding until I wake up. (Duh). Thanks guys! Good luck to everyone! It really makes me happy to see so many people having fun!

EDIT 4: Problem 3 changed to make it less stupid

EDIT 5: A winner has been chosen! User /u/hexdroid has won! Answers coming later tonight/tomorrow when I get home.

EDIT 6: The Answers!

Problem 1: [They are all anagrams of villains that the actor Ralph Fiennes has played, but with a letter missing. 1. Voldemort 2. Lord Victor Quartermaine 3. Harry Waters 4. Amon Goeth. If you take the missing letters from each name, you get ""rlah"" which is an anagram of ""Ralph"" with a letter missing. So the answer to Problem 1 is ""p"".](/spoiler)

Problem 2: [The long sentence is a combination of movie titles with words removed. Each word that has been removed is a Class from Team Fortress 2. The only one missing is ""engineer"" so that's the password.](/spoiler)

Problem 3: [This one was stupid, my bad! Each riddle vaguely described an old flash video/joke from the internet of the 90s. 1. You're The Man Now Dog, 2. Homestar Runner, 3. Irrational Exuberance, 4. Zeeky Boogy Doog. So the password is ""yhiz""](/spoiler)

## Da Rulez:

1. People who **want** CS:GO, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who **have** CS:GO and want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment.
3. The post-closing function won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

## **If you have CS:GO, don't post a new comment. Only reply to other people's offers.**

***

Remember that our normal rules still apply:

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:
    * Gray to send non-Steam-Trading codes.
    * Blue **on both sides** for Paypal!

Have fun!

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

1334305956.0,52,self.SteamGameSwap,s7ogs,[PSA] STEAM TRADING EXPLOIT - DO NOT CLICK LINKS IN STEAM TRADING WINDOWS,58,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/s7ogs/psa_steam_trading_exploit_do_not_click_links_in/,"## From [BloopBleepBlorp at /r/tf2trade:](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/s0h1z/new_scam_do_not_click_links/)

&gt;This guy adds me: http://steamrep.com/search?q=76561198061569017
&gt;
&gt;Asks me for the price of one of my unusuals. Wants to check that my unusual is not duped and sends me a link, saying it's to check one's bp for any dupes.  We open up a trade,  he sends the link asking that I check if it's a dupe or not.  I click the link, less than 15-20 seconds pass, I re-open the trade window and see that it says ""trade completed"" and freak the fuck out, a split second later, he deletes me.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways, I have no idea how this works but when I clicked it, he logged in as me or somehow had control of the trade,  the thing is that it happened in less than 30 seconds between me clicking the link and him stealing my 6 earbuds and [Unusual Defiant Spartan \(searing plasma\)](http://www.tf2items.com/item/708322732) 
&gt;
&gt;Here's the conversation: http://i.imgur.com/qDFIq.png
&gt;
&gt;***TL;DR:  don't click on any links within TF2.***
&gt;
&gt;*Edit*:  To clear some things up:
&gt;
&gt;-I did not have to log into anything after clicking the link.  I just clicked it and a pop up window came up saying it was checking my bp and might take a while.
&gt;
&gt;-I did not have any items in the trade window.  He had to have added the items himself and completed the trade himself.  I am guessing that he tailor made a script to add the specific items I had (earbuds) and then complete the trade since it happened so quickly.
&gt;
&gt;-By the time you read this I hope he's listed as a scammer on steamrep,  he appeared clean when he first contacted me.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*Edit2*:  After talking with a few others I am going to guess that this scammer wrote a specific script that added the earbuds and unusual and completed the trade by itself.  The scammer was after my unusual Defiant Spartan which I have never advertised as for sale, either that or he was after my earbuds and took a liking to the spartan.  The reason he did not take other unusuals is because  I would have quickly noticed things were being added on the steam trade window.  His script added the earbuds and the unusual immediately, which is why he deleted me almost right after I told him I had clicked it.   This script has to work in the same fashion that certain links auto-friend someone or opens up a steam survey if you have steam open.  
&gt;

&gt;**Confirmed through derongan that this is his main account:** http://steamcommunity.com/id/datcaillou

This was PSA started by me when I was scammed for BL2 key and he also scammed another two members for AC3 and Hitman Absolution. I was advised to contact Steamrep, valve CS and GamersGate CS and so I did that. After that I was checking occasionally scammers status.

Steamrep marked him asap as a scammer. GamersGate said politely they can't do nothing about it (which I understand, they are reseller, don't intend any hate on them). 

Valve asked me for screenshot of the conversation and mentioned I won't be notified of any action. I took that as a generic response and didn't think much of it, but I still sent proof of my scam and another proof that was posted about AC3 scam. Today I see my scammer is banned by Valve from trading.

3. In order to participate, you must have **gray flair or higher** as of the time of the drawing. Entries without flair will be ignored until they go away. Yes, I will be clearing the backlog before I do the drawing. _(Go make some trades!)_

4. Winning one Lightning Giveaway will make you ineligible to win Lightning Giveaways on other days... sorry!

5. Winners will be posted in a thread, and winners will be notified by PM. Games must be claimed by the end of the Summer Sale, or they may be redrawn.

6. Please make sure that the Steam ID listed in your flair is accurate - games will only be traded to the Steam account on record.

7. You **must not own** games you enter for! If you win a game you already own, your prize will be redrawn.

*Fine print: Confusing, badly-formatted, or otherwise invalid entries may be interpreted in whatever way I find most entertaining. Not responsible for issues with flair applications - please read the FAQ first. Professional driver, closed course. Your mileage may vary.

* Trine 2 has been renamed to ""Trine 2: Complete Story"".
* Goblin Menace DLC has been renamed to ""Trine 2: Complete Story Upgrade"".
* Collector's Edition has been renamed to ""Trine 2: Soundtracks &amp; Artbooks"".
* The ""Complete Story"" update added bug fixes and some new features that were in the Wii U version. -- *In short, it's three things: 1) Bug fixes, 2) Combining base game with Goblin Menace (if you own the DLC) and 3) Dwarven Caverns level (if you own the DLC).* [[source]](http://frozenbyte.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=14876#p33510)

However, existing tradable Trine 2 copies has been renamed to ""Trine 2 Complete Story"" and they look almost identical as the proper Complete Story gifts. So I made made a few illustrating screenshots, demonstrating the differences between the vanilla and the complete edition.

**[Screenshots of gifts with identical name and logo:](http://i.imgur.com/VBYj13F.png)**

* Don't trust the logo or the name of the gift!
* Look for separate ""Trine 2"" or ""Trine 2 Gift"" titles in the description. As you can see, the ""Complete Story"" has the game's description **only** in the description field.

1363801847.0,47,self.SteamGameSwap,1aoc2y,[PSA] Valve has lifted 200-sale limit on Steam Community Market (the catch inside),53,6,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1aoc2y/psa_valve_has_lifted_200sale_limit_on_steam/,"The catch: US residents and citizens must provide information to Valve for compliance with IRS tax code in order to exceed the 200-sale limit. HOWEVER, Valve is not required to report your earnings to the IRS unless you also exceed $20,000 in annual sales. Non-US residents/citizens must simply fill out a form to confirm non-residency, as long as they have never used a US billing address.

From the FAQ:

&gt; **Is there a limit on the number of transactions I can participate in in the Community Market?**

&gt; Currently there is no limit on the number of transactions you can participate in. However, the United States Internal Revenue Service, under Section 6050W of the Internal Revenue Code, requires us to collect certain information from you if you engage in more than 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year. In particular, **if you are a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide us with your name, address and Social Security Number, and **if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide evidence of your non-U.S. status on an online form we provide to you. We will be providing a link to these forms and a process by which you can provide the needed information if and as you approach the 200 sales limit. We may use a third-party to collect this information. You can choose not to provide this information if you wish, but you will not be able to list any items for sale in the Community Market once you meet the 200 sales threshold, and any items listed will be removed. Note that, while we are required to collect this information from you, we are not required to share this information with the IRS under Section 6050W unless you exceed $20,000 in gross sales in the Community Market within a single calendar year. For purposes of calculating the number of sales you have made in a calendar year, all of your accounts will be treated as a single account.

And: 

&gt; **Will you be providing 1099’s based on my transactions in the Community Market?**

&gt; The United States Internal Revenue Service requires us to report gross sales for, and provide IRS Form 1099’s to, only those subscribers who are U.S. citizens or residents and who exceed 200 sales transactions in a calendar year and also exceed $20,000 in gross sales proceeds from those sales transactions in that same calendar year, from all of that subscriber's accounts. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident and exceed both of these thresholds, we will report the amount of gross sales to the IRS and provide you with Form 1099.

Hello r/SGS! I've got a little story for you. I recently bought a Spec Ops: The Line key in retail, being a little surprised the price dropped to €20 so soon (being only €33 in the summer sales). However, apparently the pricedrop was not restricted to that single store, as I see today that even the [Steam store price](http://store.steampowered.com/app/50300/) of the game has been lowered to €20. Unlucky me! The next logical step would probably be for me to activate the game and play it myself, but I'm quite sure there's someone out here who can devote a lot more time to the game than I'll be able to in the near future. Ideally, I'd love the winner to be someone that has relatively few games, enough so that he/she'd play the game immediately and enjoy it. Oh well.

**How to enter:**

First off, make sure you're a member of [the subreddit's Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RedditGameSwap). Once you've done this, head over to the [giveaway page on Steamgifts.com](http://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/ct2wR/spec-ops-the-line) and enter the giveaway! The Steamgifts site will randomly select a winner from the entered Steam Accounts, 24 hours after this post is created.

**Please note:**

The *rules* on Steamgifts.com indicate that, to enter a contest:

* You must not already own the game and
* You must add the game to your library instantaneously upon winning. 

If you've read my first paragraph, you probably figure I'm going to follow up on these rules. Please, only enter if *you have a genuine interest in playing the game, soon*. Thanks in advance for your understanding :).

Questions? Lamentations? Please do not hesitate to comment! Please keep the subreddit alive and awesome!




P.S. Mods: If I get the winner to confirm over in the confirmation thread, does it count towards flair? Pretty please?

Enjoy!

## Da Rulez:

1. People who **want** Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who **have** Dota 2 and want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment.
3. The post-closing function won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

## **If you have Dota 2, don't post a new comment. Only reply to other people's offers.**

Remember that our normal rules still apply:

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:
    * Gray to send non-Steam-Trading codes.
    * Blue **on both sides** for Paypal!

Have fun!

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

He was already on the shared banned list for using alts to avoid rules over on /r/playitforward and when people asked him about the allegations against him he abandoned his reddit account. He had 10+ flair and had been very active up until that point.

He disappeared for a few months and just now he posted in a thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1amolj/h_xcom_enemy_unknown_w_offers/). When I asked him about it, he immediately deleted his comment and presumably went back into hiding.

1366751752.0,45,self.SteamGameSwap,1cyo92,[PSA] Apparently even trading through steam is not safe now!,56,11,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1cyo92/psa_apparently_even_trading_through_steam_is_not/,"Few days ago a guy added me and offered me some games, I traded tf2 keys for two of his game, pretty big titles 20+ keys I traded him.

So today I notice that the games have vanished out my inventory. Done some further digging and went back to the guys profile to see a new comments calling him a scammer.

So I guess this guy maybe purchased the games in dodgy way or with a stolen credit card and steam have just removed the games without informing anyone.

Added they guy who commented also and found out he had traded a dragon hook for two games also which he added to his library. He got a warning yesterday of some kind and the games were removed.

Made a steam rep report and opened a steam support ticket.

Never came across this before in a year of trading, and Im down quite a few keys and no games.

So if this is how they are now cracking down on dodgy purchases how the hell are we to know who to trade with. Searched the guy and he was clean on steam rep and had a few games and a few hundred hours playtime.

Just kinda annoyed at steam for not informing or contacting etc

I feel that steam should not be removing items without even informing steam users that they have been scammed through steam trading, some of us traders and especially the ones who deal with tf2 or dota 2 items over the course of a week or two buy and sell a great number of items to the point if steam starts just removing stuff that maybe someone purchased through the steam market it would be easy to look over or not even notice steam have removed them. In my opinion just removing without any notification is just not right. After all its steam's trading function we are using. Yes they may replace items but that needs you to open a ticket and if we are talking small items then they could be overlooked.

They are basically just putting their hands in your pocket and taking what you paid for because you happened to get scammed through steam trading by someone using dodgy payment methods and bypassing their checks etc.

They need to re think how they deal with this kind of thing, either they toughen up payment security or they actually inform you that you have been scammed or have traded with a scammer and that they will be doing something about it, not just picking your pockets and leaving it up to you to notice and open a ticket.",,False,,t5_2skv6,1366781909.0,,tier5,True,t3_1cyo92,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1cyo92/psa_apparently_even_trading_through_steam_is_not/,

On a side note, that was a very disappointing winner selection. I had to stop counting after 20+ winning entries because they did not follow the instructions for entering. The main offending mistakes being


* Did not select a game/selected too many games
* Probably 10+ winners got thrown out for L4D2 because they didn't have a grey flair +
* Had to throw out a few key winners because they already owned the game

Prizes


* FTL: Faster Than Light (gift)  - Winner - /u/i_know_not
* Left 4 Dead 2 (gift) - /u/Ninja3047
* Hotline Miami (key) - /u/gliff159
* Torchlight II (key) - /u/G_Thirty

The tradable gifts, anyone with a grey flair can enter for. The keys only restriction is you do not own the game.

He scammed at least half a dozen SGS users in the past week or two, and likely many more elsewhere. He most likely purchased the Steam account from someone; it was created in 2003. This led a number of people to trust him and fall for his scam.

**Remember:** If you fall victim to a scam, _immediately_ gather all the evidence: record the permanent SteamID64 URL of the scammer, copy-and-paste the chatlog to a textfile, and save screenshots of it, screenshot anything else relevant.

It's been a while since I last posted an update, but the truth of the matter is that I've been extremely busy with the university, my two jobs and my company. I'm posting here, just to get the feel of the community and to involve you in the future plans of TradeStarter.


As I mentioned, I've been busy, and I unfortunately haven't had the time to implement the features I've had planned. But they're coming! But until now, I hope people will make due and use the system as is.


In the recent week, I've released a few very minor updates and fixes to the system, one of which was with inspiration from a fellow community members (Thanks dav3!), who pointed me towards a possible solution to the unreliable counter. This means that TradeStarter, as of today, now is able to count the number of identical items in your inventory - correctly.


Furthermore, I've added the option to add me via the site, if anyone has comments, questions or issues. Some people have contacted me via twitter - and I really forget to check that. But my Steam Client is on all my computers (work pc included), so there should be a chance of getting a hold of me. And furthermore I've added a paypal donation button, with encouragement of a few users who suggested I should do so. All donations are welcome, small and large - it's all **greatly** appriciated.
And lastly, I've reworked some of the serverside code - to lessen the strain on the server even more.



**What does the future hold?**

I'm doing the best I can to find time to create the new large updates, and this has resulted in me initiating a complete code revamp, to accomodate the new and expansive features better. An old friend of mine, Ezpharez, has decided to help out with the development of the 'new' TradeStarter - and his involvement is greatly appriciated. 
We're still aiming towards the light-weight feel and easy usability of TradeStarter - but working on far more depth and options, all tied to your Steam login. Among some of the function, I can briefly mention;

* Added customizability to your listing
* Customizable and reusable header/footers
* Friend Inventory Search (If someone you know has something you're looking for, it's just nice to know)
* CD-Key Storage - (So you can keep your CD-keys safe, encrypted and have them easily included in your listings)
* TradeStarter Search - (Search the recently created lists - and contact the user - optional participation ofcourse!)
* And many more.


I'm glad people like the site and hope you'll continue to use it!

Have a great night! :)

If you have never played it before (Or own it) I'd rather those people played it for this givaway.  
I've sunk lots of time into this (though Civ 3 was my most time spent) and would love to share it.  
I hate the whole 'I'll give this away but first you gotta be my plaything' thing.  

All I ask is you don't own Civ 5/gold (A given really)  
and  
send me a link to something you like, be it music a picture, video WHATEVER.  
I'm a random and open minded guy so nsfw is fine (if not encouraged). 

PS I will be cross posting this with /r/civ which should be checked out when you get it!

24 hours after this post I will decide a winner ;D   
EDIT - IF I DON'T SAY YOU'RE IN THE HAT, IT PROLLY MEANS YOU ARE AND I JUST HAVN'T MANAGED TO ANSWER YOU! I'M TRYING TO DO AT LEAST AN UPVOTE!

1347264781.0,44,self.SteamGameSwap,zn7rm,"[PSA] How to determine if a game is actually region locked, just tagged or completely region free",51,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/zn7rm/psa_how_to_determine_if_a_game_is_actually_region/,"Heya all, I see this stuff happen too many times. Someone trades an awful person for what seems to be a really good deal, only to find out later that the gift is tagged and region locked. To try and curtail this a bit I've created this little guide to check if a game from the another region's store (mostly russian since theirs seem to be the cheapest) is in fact region locked.

Important Websites:

http://cdr.thebronasium.com - Database website that contains everything that is and has ever been available on steam

http://store.steampowered.com/?cc=ru - Link to the Russian Steam Store

http://store.steampowered.com/?cc=us - Link to your region steam store (replace the us with your region initials)

Important Terms:
Sub ID - The identification number associated with any steam game. Found by visiting the regional steam store you want to purchase it from in a web browser (not the steam client), going to the game's page and mousing over the add to cart button. The Sub ID number will appear in the lower left hand corner like so: javascript:addToCart(SubID);. Search this number on thebronasium under subs to find more information about the specific game

onlyallowrunincountries - Found on the a game's Sub ID page on thebronasium under Extended Info. Presence of this line indcates that the game is region locked and will only be activatable/playable in the countries listed next to it. If this line is not present on the page, then the game is region free, even if it has a tag like RU or AU.

Proof:
Max Payne 3 is a well known region locked game on steam, with a warning on its page in the russian steam store that it will only run if being played from a russian ip. If you find the russian version's Sub ID page you'll find the onlyallowrunincountries line at the bottom with an RU next to it. In anyone's inventory, the game will also have an RU tag.

The presence of a tag does not mean that the game is region locked though. Take Sleeping Dogs for example. Find the russian version's sub ID page and you'll find no onlyallowrunincountries line. Ask around the net and you'll find that these RU tagged games are playable anywhere in the world, but that they only contain english and chinese so be wary of that.

As far as I know, steam has never altered a Sub ID. Initially Dark Souls was region free, but when steam decided to region lock it they created a new ID just for CIS countries, they did not alter the one already existing.

Info from 50lerp
If you go in your account details under ""Licenses and Subscriptions"" you can see the full subscription names of items added to your library. Not a perfect or efficient solution, but you should be able to scan through and see if you have any versions that list AU, RU, DE, etc.

I hope that clears up any questions you had about region locked games, feel free to ask more if you're confused about anything or comment below with additions or things I just got plain wrong.

I got this huge hankering for [gummy worms](http://www.amazon.com/Albanese-Sour-4-Inch-Worms-4-5-Pound/dp/B001ELL7T2/) right about now. Torchlight 2  would be really fun, but it's a month or so later, and damn... [gummy worms](http://www.amazon.com/Albanese-Sour-4-Inch-Worms-4-5-Pound/dp/B001ELL7T2/).

So yeah, [the gummies](http://www.amazon.com/Albanese-Sour-4-Inch-Worms-4-5-Pound/dp/B001ELL7T2/) are about $15, and so is T2 at its lowest when you buy a 4-pack. You get me a $15 Amazon gift card, and I give you T2 in case you can't find 3 other enterprising fellows to pitch in with you.

because of my missing flair, he told me to go first, I agreed because he had red flair on this subreddit, so I gifted him the game, he then went off and blocked me on steam.

I then, messaged [03ddruler](http://steamcommunity.com/id/03ddruler) and [Red Inferno](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Red_Inferno) and to contact him that I give him a second chance to work things out, to either give me back my game or my gold.

You may know me, maybe you don't - I'm a moderator here, as you can all see, and I was one of the mods who made the first steps towards having a flair system and shaping what /r/SGS is today. I have also seen great changes and great problems.

But this thread serves other purpose: to express my gratitude to this community and to the mod team.


This subreddit has grown so fast it's almost magical. And we do have a wizard here, you all know blueshiftlabs and the way he makes everything work so well and smooth. But not only him, the core group on this moderation team is always very toughtful on the changes, on the way we treat the users and mostly, on the way we can be fair to everyone. 


And the results are awesome: I have to thank you all for helping us, for reporting when needed, for criticising when there's need to and to make this place so damn cozy. It's because of you we do this, and it's great to have such a reward.

Now is the time I thank the users and I want to single some names on the moderating team: Mossy, SKAS, FatManRising, Deman, blue, Pointaska and rikker. Thanks for all the progress and work you put on this community. I, as a user, not as a mod, can only thank you for that.

1345182938.0,46,self.SteamGameSwap,yd4fq,[PSA] Beginner Guide - How to value your games and prevent getting ripoff,55,9,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/yd4fq/psa_beginner_guide_how_to_value_your_games_and/,"##INTRODUCTION
It's been a while since Valve introduced Steam trading feature on Steam. The amount of lowballers is too damn high lately(I'm calling it, 80% of the traders you met is looking for profit which is fine, but most of them are lowballers so you might never got a fair offer if you didn't know how things work). I made this Guide mostly for beginner to let you guys know how to value your games to make sure you didn't get an unfair/ripoff trade. If you don't really know how things work in trading, continue reading. Otherwise, leave now.  
  
**Note : This Guide is based on my experience in Steam trading, and this is how I value things and this is also how I saw most of traders value things, you are free to disagree and give your opinion and thought. Feel free to add me as friends if you have something to ask/discuss.**  
  
##You and your trade partner games value
First things first, your games value isn't based on base price(full price), instead its value is based on the lowest sale price. For example, your Fallout 3 GOTY doesn't worth $20 and your Skyrim doesn't worth $60 because Fallout 3 GOTY is on sale for $5 which is 75% off and Skyrim is on sale for $30 which is 50% off.  
##UPDATE :  
1. I forgot to mention that some games hold more value if the games hasn't been on sale for a long time, for example Mass effect series.  
2. Games are on 4 pack hold less value, for examples Borderlands GOTY is $7.5 lowest, but 4 pack is cheaper than that, so the value goes with 4 pack value / 4 which is less than $7.5.  
3. BETA GAMES : Some beta games doesn't have any price on the store. At the moment, beta games that are on high demand is Dota 2, the ongoing market price is around $5 or $10 highest, more than that, you got ripped off.  
  
##UPDATE 2 :  
1. I never think that I'll get many response here, thanks for that. Some of the respond tell that the games worth more lowest sale, which is not always the case. It is demand vs supply which I already stated above on Mass effect series. So to make this simple, if a games hasn't been on sale and there are not ton of copies floating around, it might hold more value than lowest and vice versa.  
2. Games that appears on bundle will have less value. You can see the list on this link www.steamgifts.com/bundles/list  
  
##How do I check the lowest sales value on my/trade partner games
There is several sites that provide a track on Steam games price. I personally used www.steamprices.com, so this guide is based on that. Open the site, put your games name on the search bar, for example Fallout 3 GOTY(http://www.steamprices.com/us/app/22370/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition), on the bottom page, you can see that the lowest value on that games is $4.99(US Store). So, you should always check your games and your trade partner games value to make sure you get a fair trade.  
  
Note : this site also provided price on different region like EU, Russia, Ukraine, etc.  
  
##Fair trade example  
2x Witcher Enhanced Edition(lowest $2.5) with Titan Quest Gold(lowest $5).  
Darkness II ROW (lowest $12.5) with CIV V GOTY (lowest $12.5).  
Skyrim (lowest $30) with Max Payne 3 (lowest $30).  
www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ycl8s/h_entire_inventory_w_paypal_offers/ (sorry if I haven't ask permission to OP for posting his link, but his thread is a perfect example of fair trade)  
the list goes on...  
  
##Few Exceptions  
Now that you already grasp the basic on how to get a fair trade, there are few exception you should know. Russia/Ukraine store usually provide cheaper price on games, usually around 30%-50% less than US price. Games that are **cheaper in Russia(&gt; 50%)** and **not region locked** will have less value. For example : Street Fighter X Tekken, Binary Domain, etc. Lowballers will get mad and usually tell you that they bought their games in US Store, but believe me. most of these games came from Russia store. So you shouldn't value it that high. Note that you can check every region price on www.steamprices.com.

Also note that the ROW version of AAA games that are region locked in Russian will hold more value than not region locked. For example : Borderlands 2 (region locked in Russia), the ROW version of Borderlands 2 will hold more value than COD Black Ops II(not region locked even if you bought it on Russia) even if they had a same price.  
  
##Never ever accept giftable games offer  
Never ever accept games that are only giftable(not tradeable), especially when the deal is too good to be true because there is a high chance that the games are fraud(bought with stolen CC or the buyer plan to do a chargeback) which will cause your games to get revoked and you won't get your games you give to your trade partner back because you are not trading the games on Trading window. Use common sense, when a deal is too good to be true, it is probably a scam. This apply to paypal trade and key trade as well.  
Note : From my experience, high flair member in /r/SGS are usually safe to trade with paypal and keys.

##CONCLUSION  
Remember there is a difference between profit and lowball, I'm all about profit sometimes, but giving something like CS:GO beta for Skyrim or SR3 Franchise pack for Borderlands 2 are different story, if you are new to trading, take a couple mins to read this wall of text.  
  
If you need help to if your trade is fair or unfair. You can post it here, I'll let you know if your trade is fair/unfair/getting lowball'd/rippoff. Format : My &lt;your games&gt; for &lt;your trading partner games&gt;.

That is all, happy trading.

1332245261.0,45,self.SteamGameSwap,r4yyp,[H] IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING DOTA 2 - 2 pack gifts !! [W] moderators help,50,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/r4yyp/h_important_announcement_regarding_dota_2_2_pack/,"Dota 2 - 2 pack is single Dota for only 1 person

yes, it does sound weird, and I have no f-ing idea why Valve called it that way, but its reality.

I am little tired of all traders who are merchandising their Dota like : ""you will get extra invite in inventory when you unpack it""

NO :)

I tested 2 copies yesterday on friends account, and few more people also activated and reported to me that it is single.

Dota 2 - 2 pack gift is just 1 dota for 1 person and does not give any more additional invites, 100 % tested 

Back in December there were some versions, called : Dota 2 + 2 gifts, or Dota 2 hardware survey + gifts, and yes they were giving 2 additional invites once you activated them.

I know, because I started to trade Dota 3 months ago.

Feel free to bump because its bad to people trade and than feel bad when they dont get extra invite.

Also, person who trade, meybe he also dont know, so dont put blame on him.

And I hope Valve can fix this mess 

ps. just bonus for people who dont know :
you can win key (like letters and numbers 354535-dfggdfgg-545456456), on playdota forum :

http://www.playdota.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=160

in this thread (read the rules):

http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=549077


In past, once you win key and activate it, you would get 2 invites, but from 2-3 weeks ago, keys are also single, so watch out for that. And its not recommended to trade for key anyway.

Also 1 thing that confuses many people, if your account is new and you dont have purchased games, you will get 2 not-tradable invites (if you find key that have + 2).

If you have new account (Im not sure whats restriction, 30 or 90 days), you will get not-tradable invites.

You can send them as gifts, true steam or on someones email, and he can activate them, but you cant trade tham using Steam trade screen.

Gifts become tradable after 30 days from point they were created.
Same rule is applied for purchasing.

If new account wants to buy game for trading, and buy and store game in inventory, that game will become tradable after 30 days.

If you have more useful suggestion regarding trading, write them, I can update 1st post, or bump this untill most people learn about Dota 2 - 2 pack gifts

I hope you're enjoying your Square Enix pack from Amazon! Or whatever brings you here.

I'm seeing this question asked very frequently in the past day or so, and the policy criticized:

###Q: Why doesn't /r/SteamGameSwap allow new users to trade keys, even if they agree to go first?

A: Three reasons I can think of:

1. **_To protect our existing users._** We require all users to make their first trade using Steam's built-in [trading interface](http://youtu.be/fpLWqZRJNVU) to establish a minimum level of reputation. **Once you do that, just request flair and you can trade keys, and pretty much anything else digital and non-Steam tradable.**

2. **_Because you are an easy target_**. We have enough of a problem with scammers as it is. If we let inexperienced traders come in here with giant bullseyes on their foreheads, the honeypot gets bigger, and the scammer problem will increase. Scammer takes you up on your offer, you give the key first, scammer goes offline and cackles all the way to the bank.

3. **_To prevent key spam._** Every time there is a giveaway of beta keys, a developer does a 10,000 key giveaway on Reddit, or there is a killer deal on a site like Amazon, we get an influx of users. It's not that we don't want you. But due to the _other_ reasons listed above, we need you to play by our rules and contribute positively to the subreddit, and not just be part of a tsunami of posts for the same handful of games, which washes over us and drives up the workload for moderators and the signal-to-noise ratio for everyone else, without really increasing the quality of the subreddit.

Edit: These are simply my thoughts and interpretations as one of the moderators. Other moderators may disagree with me on some points.

###Addendum 1: How you as a user with flair can help:

Politely explain the policy to new users and point them to this PSA. When you do this, please also click the ""report"" button on the post. You can also help walk someone through the process for claiming flair if you were their first trading partner.

###Addendum 2: If you have an outstanding flair request:

Find your flair request in your outbox and reply to yourself to ""bump"" it to the top of the stack. It's okay to do that, and it's easier for the mods to deal with than just resubmitting. Due to the high volume of requests, which is higher than usual at the moment, it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to get your flair. Your patient is appreciated. (If you have flair and are waiting for an upgrade, you may need to be extra patient for the time being.)",,False,,t5_2skv6,1350289725.0,,mod-rikker,True,t3_11i2tb,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/11i2tb/psa_why_doesnt_sgs_allow_new_users_to_trade_keys/,moderator

Oh, and I recently found out Germany has laws requiring low (read: no) violence versions of games like L4D2 and Bioshock. What the hell? 

I mean, guts and gore is a human right, right? Right. So same deal goes for you guys if you want it.

Trade hijacking is when someone has offered a trade to the OP, and you accept the trade before OP has the chance to accept or refuse.

Example:

&gt; **[H] Half-Life 2 [W] Offers**  
&gt; posted by *User1*

&gt;&gt; **reply from _User2_**  
&gt;&gt; Would you take Portal for it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; **reply from _User3_**  
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can do that, add me.

User2 proceeds to trade Portal to User3 in exchange for HL2.

In this instance, User3 has hijacked the trade.

To prevent hijacking, follow these procedures:

* **OP** should reply to each offer in the thread, accepting it or rejecting it.

* **People making offers** should ignore any other counteroffers until the OP has the chance to respond.

* **Other users** should not offer to complete a trade in the place of OP, *until OP has posted a refusal.*

In our example above, User1 should reply to User2 accepting or rejecting the offer. User3 should *not* post until User1 has rejected User2's offer.

~~Trade hijacks may be removed without notice.~~

**EDIT:**

Some users have brought up some good points about trying to regulate this. With those points in mind, we won't remove threadjacks.

However, threadjacking is still **incredibly rude** in most circumstances. If the OP has had time to respond, and hasn't, that's one thing, but make sure that they have had that chance.

Just as in every other form of social interaction, the underlying theme for trading is **don't be a dick**. Threadjacking is, in general, dickish behavior.

### How to Enter:

Unlike previous giveaways, there is **no limit** on the number of games you can enter for. Please don't enter for games that you already own or won't play!

To enter, post a list below with the games you'd like to enter for, **ranked in the order of your preference.** If your username is drawn, you'll receive your most-preferred game that I still have available.

***

### Da Rulez:

1. Entries close **Monday the 16th, 10PM PDT.** The drawing will take place at some point after that.

2. Users will be drawn at random. For each user drawn, they will receive a copy of whichever game is a) ranked highest and b) still in stock. Drawings will continue until I run out of users or out of games. (Winners will be drawn automatically by [this Python script.](http://pastebin.com/uEj0viXD))

3. In order to participate, you must have **gray flair or higher** as of the time of the drawing. Entries without flair will be ignored until they go away. Yes, I will be clearing the backlog before I do the drawing. _(Go make some trades!)_

4. Winning one Lightning Giveaway will make you ineligible to win Lightning Giveaways on other days... sorry!

5. Winners will be posted in a thread, and winners will be notified by PM. Games must be claimed by the end of the Summer Sale, or they may be redrawn.

6. Please make sure that the Steam ID listed in your flair is accurate - games will only be traded to the Steam account on record.

7. You **must not own** games you enter for! If you win a game you already own, your prize will be redrawn.

*Fine print: Confusing, badly-formatted, or otherwise invalid entries may be interpreted in whatever way I find most entertaining. Not responsible for issues with flair applications - please read the FAQ first. Professional driver, closed course. Your mileage may vary. These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and these games are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any disease. Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball. This post may not be reproduced without the express written consent of Major League Baseball.*

Good luck to all!

Rules are similar to the coupon-trading thread:

1. People who have Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment. **Don't post a new top-level comment unless you have Dota 2.**
3. The post-closing markup won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.**

**Remember that our normal rules still apply:**

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:

So I'm here to warn you guys that he is not trustworthy.

Edit: unfortunately, he might have blocked me and so I have no way of verifying his steam name if he changed it, I will attach the files necessary from my report that may help identify him.

Edit: So i accidentally switched his name in the title, his Steam ID is actually WangGolf
Here is the link to his profile: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079657824

So the explanation basically is, I'm looking for a game called fortune summoners and he tells me that he is able to trade it to me.  I tell him that I have some cards and Tomb Raider Underworld available to trade.  So he adds me on Steam and invites me to a trade.  He then tells me to place my items in the trade box which I do, and I am ready; however, I don't see anything in his trade box and so I ask him if he has it.  He then tells me that his client is glitched and so I made the initial mistake of taking his word and blindly traded those items.  I did not receive anything, and he proceeds to up the ante by requesting a Borderlands 2 Skin Pack and so I buy it and offer it if he has proof that he has Fortune Summoners.   I suggest a screenshot, and 40 minutes later he returns with a screenshot (which I should've assumed was photoshopped).  Regardless, I just go with the trade hoping for the best, and he gets the DLC while I still received nothing.  I ask him where Fortune Summoners is and he goes offline, removes me from Steam, and from then I filed a report and provided images of the conversation.",,False,,t5_2skv6,1373868889.0,,tier0,True,t3_1ibmvh,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1ibmvh/psa_golfwang_scammed_me/,

***Edit: Hey, I've got to run. I won't be back for at least the next five hours it seems, so leave your offers/claims in the comments. I'll work on a first come first served basis, so if you ask for something that's already been asked for, and I only have one copy of it, you probably won't get it.

Alright, you guys clearly liked this format last week, so I'm doing it again, with some tweaks. Offering everything I can at cost (or less, if at cost isn't cheap enough).

Same deal as last time; these prices are for those of you who want to play the game, and not for re-trading. You can buy any two available games at first, and more if you'd like after 24 hours. This is to spread the games around amongst everybody, rather than having just a few people clearing out most of my stuff.

Again, I'm looking for [Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key), and/or [Treasure Keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key). Refined Metal/trading cards for games I paid less than one key's worth for. If you'd like to pay completely in ref, six ref=one key.

If you have another offer, I'll listen, but likely decline. I'm more interested in getting keys for the imminent summer sales.

When he first friended me on steam he told me he was interested in my Borderlands key and offered me BF3 keys, when I responded telling him I was interested in the trade he said he didn't want to go first because he had a 5+ flair count while I was only holding 1. I fell victim to the scam and traded first, he then made up some bull excuse that the key wasn't working, when I called him out saying his game-count went higher on steam he said it consumed the key, when I asked about his half of the deal he went offline... 

I feel like this could of been avoided if I was smarter at the time and tried Google'ing his steam name, because this wasn't the first time he made a BF3 scam.

Description: I had posted on the steam forums about a spare Don't Starve key that I had. The topic was quickly closed down by the mods because it was to do with keys. I had a load of friend requests come in with people interested to trade the game for what I wanted (A Valley Without Wind). DarkNova messaged me saying he had the game as a gift, and couldn't trade it. With me having a key I thought it would be okay as we didn't have assurances on both sides. When I pasted him the key he said it was in use and to get in touch with support. Saying to message him when I get a reply. After I go offline and come back on I find he has removed me from friends and also blocked communications. I attempted to re-add him to get an explanation, but he has rejected. I was willing to give him a chance to come clean and give me the game but clearly he would rather I report him.

This is a copy of the report filed to steamrep. He is on the prowl on the main steam trading forum. I have extended the olive branch asking him to explain why and to finish the trade but he is willing to take the hit for something which costs less than £10.

Reddit please be careful on all forums, not just on here.

I've decided to do a giveaway of **TWO** orcs must die copies. You might ask me, what's the occasion? Well, generally, this community has been great with people like memske who helped people buy mirror's edge cheaper at no cost at all and the mods who do regular giveaways. 

I wanted to help people buy high violence versions copies of left 4 dead 2 when the sale was up. Unfortunately, I have a very rough work schedule and as such, wasn't able to help. Figured to do this giveaway instead.

Anyway on to the giveaway!

My conditions of the giveaway are as below :

* 1. **You must not own the game.** I would preferably like to see the winner activate the gift on his/her account. But I trust that the winner will do it. I know many people here are out to make a profit, but I'm hoping this game will fall into someone who wants it but can't get it/afford it.

If I find that you own the game, your number will be redrawn for another person.

* 2. Pick a number. Any number from 1-999. I'll do a draw through random.org and pm you if you've won. I'll also announce the winner here.

My contest ends when the weekend deals end. I might add more copies if I'm feeling even more generous, or if someone decides to donate more. 

**Good luck everyone!**

**EDIT 1** --&gt; I've found a few people posting here who've already own the game. Those entries are automatically DISQUALIFIED. I'm sorry. But I am hoping this copy goes to someone who doesn't own it. 

**EDIT 2** --&gt; Carry on. No number 1s found. But I would prefer if you'd just enter your number plainly. Reddit has some formatting issues.

1. Watch for these red flags:
    * Private profiles.
    * Brand-new Steam and/or Reddit accounts.
    * Pressuring you into going first.
    * Approaching you directly on Steam, without posting a comment in your trade thread first. _(This doesn't necessarily mean that someone's a scammer, but it should certainly make you slightly suspicious, since they might be banned from /r/SGS.)_

2. Always check your trade partners on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). Enter your partner's Steam profile URL into the search box, and check the results. **Do this yourself - don't trust any links that they give you.** If they have any of these, you should be suspicious:
    * A scammer or caution tag.
    * A large percentage of scammer friends. (They might be an alt of a scammer.)
    * Listed trade bans or trade probation.

    To get your partner's profile URL, look at their profile through a normal web browser and copy the address from there, or, from the Steam client, right-click and select **""Copy Page URL""**.

3. Use your common sense - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

4. Don't hesitate to ask for a middleman! [Contact the mods - we'll be glad to help.](/message/compose?to=%23SteamGameSwap&amp;subject=Middleman+request)

**EDIT:**

_If you get scammed:_

1. **Take screenshots immediately.** Any supporting evidence you can provide will get people marked that much faster.

2. **Get your partner's steamID64.** You can get this from SteamRep - follow step #2 above.

I'm not sure if you guys remembered a certain reddit thread. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ys4gw/h_40_w_a_kind_soul_to_purchase_dishonored_for_me/

This started on 25th August 2012.

I was the kind soul who helped this guy who has now deleted his account, purchase dishonored. However, it was stored in my GMG account. 


He claimed to have a trust issue. I, understanding where he was coming from since GMG doesn't deliver an activation key straight away, assured him that I will give him the activation key once the game comes out. He was still paranoid. So in my foolishness yet kindness, thought to lend him my GMG account, since a purchasing account doesn't have much information anyway, I changed the password to a more user friendly one for him. He then claimed that he left the $40 prepaid visa code at his mother's house. I said it was okay and he can take his time in giving it to me. 


2 days down the road, I messaged him for the $40 visa card. He said that he misplaced the card and that he can pay me by the 31st. I, being understanding again, was okay with it. 


Today, I tried to log in to the account again. Apparently now he has changed the password and also the email. Right now, there's no way to recover the account. From my end of course. I've put in a ticket with GMG and hopefully they return the account to it's rightful owner. 


His steam profile is  :

Formerly known as GamerEnt. Please Beware.

**EDIT** : GMG has replied me. They unfortunately understand that the inquiry could be sent in by an impersonator trying to regain control of this account. They unfortunately have locked out the account. But I perfectly understand their stance. They also have refunded me the amount for dishonored. So it's like I didn't help him at all :)..

Valve inadvertently re-labeled all vanilla copies of Dead Island that existed in people's inventories as ""Game of the Year,"" as well as changed the associated logo. This has led to a lot of confusion, and people not getting what they expected in trades.

I believe I have the answer. I imagine this has been covered elsewhere, but I haven't seen it yet.

**[Here is an illustration that I made](http://i.imgur.com/xnZoY.png)** demonstrating how to distinguish between the two.

**Don't trust the logo or the large font title.** As you can see, the true GOTY version **lists the DLC** in the description.

If the Dead Island in your inventory is one you purchased, and you're still not sure, take this short survey I have written:

* Did you purchase Dead Island on or later than July 26, 2012 (when GOTY was introduced)?
* If no, sorry, you do not have Dead Island GOTY.

Hopefully this helps clear things up, and if I am missing something, corrections or additions are welcome. :)

 **How should I browse the community**

It is heavily suggested that you search by new. This is the most effective way to scan the subreddit when looking for trades. This way you see all the newest posts and discourages any kind of bias using downvotes and upvotes. Downvotes and upvotes are essentially useless in this subreddit, they will get you nowhere. We have a special theme in SGS, the goal of this theme is to streamline trading and simplify navigation of the subreddit.

 - Open trade threads have a blue arrow icon
 - Closed trade threads have a red do not enter icon
 - PSA and announcement threads have a yellow exclamation point icon
 - Other threads have a green plus icon


----

  **Is there anything specific I should know about these icons?**

Closing a post does not prevent people from commenting, let moderators know your trades are complete or anything else. Closing a post will only change the icon as to notify members that the trade is no longer active. This format is purely aesthetic. Closing threads is accomplished by marking it NSFW. If the stylesheet is not available, closed thread will appear as NSFW. In the most likely of cases this will happen if:

 - You're subscribed to /r/SGS and you are viewing from the frontpage
 - You have subreddit CSS turned off in your global Reddit settings, or through [RedditEnhancementSuite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/)
 - You are browsing through /r/all or a multi-reddit.


----

  
 **Is there a format I must follow?**

Yes. Posts must follow the correct format to be recognized as a trade thread.

**The correct format for trades is as follows:**

*[H] what you have [W] what you want*

Anything different is incorrect. Spacing is **very** important.


----


**PSA threads should follow this format:**

*[PSA] Information people should know*


----


*[ANNOUNCEMENT] is reserved for mod use, any posts using this format will be removed.*


----


**How do I complete a trade?**

After you have finished the trading process with your partner, you should head over to [the Successful Trades thread for the month](/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wfzfn?limit=500&amp;sort=new#/).

**Once there make a top-level post in the thread with the following information:**

 - The name of your trading partner
 - The names of the games you traded
 - A link to the original trade thread - if possible link to the comment that started the trade by using the permalink button in the lower left corner of the comment


----

The final step is to send the link to the comment you made to your partner. Have your partner confirm the trade by commenting.


----


**What is flair? Why do we have it?**

There are 7 kinds of flair:

Grey, Blue, Dark Red, Green, Purple, Gold, and Bright Red. They are primarily for notoriety in the subreddit, but can also be used to link your Steam profile for streamlined trading. Each color represents a tier you can reach by trading. Keeping in mind each tier comes with it's own prerequisites which you can procure by increasing your karma level and account age.


----

**The criterias which must be met for each tier are as follows:**

* Gray: 1 trade, 30 day account age or 3 trades and 3 day account age
* Blue: 5 trades, 30 days
* Dark Red: 10 trades, 3 months, 200 combined karma
* Green: 20 trades, 6 months, 400 combined karma
* Purple: 50 trades, 6 months, 400 combined karma
* Bright Red: Retired Moderator
* Gold: Moderator





**How do we get flair?**

We'll need a couple pieces of information from you to update your flair successfully.

**A permanent link to your Steam profile. You can find this link on:**
                 
* [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/)
* Enter your Profile Name.
* Find the line that begins with *steamID64*. This is the URL you need.

*(Please note that providing this information is optional. If you don't want your Steam profile linked from your flair, please say so in your message. You will still need to provide the info to the mods, who will exercise full discretion)*

**To change or receive flair you MUST click [this link](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade).**

----


**Proof of your completed trades.**

If you already have flair, and are just changing your profile, your old flair is sufficient proof.

If you are getting flair for the first time, or are upgrading to a higher tier of flair, please include links to completed-trades threads for all of your completed trades.

**Please note that by completed trades we mean links to your confirmed trades in the successful trade list of the month, which is linked in the sidebar.**
        
**We accept trades from the following subreddits:**
            
* [/r/SteamGameSwap](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamgameswap)
* [/r/gameswap](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap)
* [/r/SteamTrade](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamtrade)
* [/r/SteamTrading](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamtrading)

----
**Once again to change or receive flair you MUST click [this link](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade).**

Note that posting in the completed-trades thread **WILL NOT GET YOU FLAIR AUTOMATICALLY**. You **MUST** follow these directions to receive flair.

Basically i traded him a bunch of games and some coal during the winter sale for his Origin account with BF3 limited edition in it. I was playing fine until he decided to get in contact with EA support and have the account email/name/password changed and i couldn't do anything. I know account trading is against the ToS but i wanted to play BF3 really bad and its not available in my country.

A month before that i traded for a BF3 key for 2 bills hats which i had worked so hard for getting and EA removed that game from my account because the guy who sold me the key made a chargeback on his cradit card , i've been scammed for BF3 twice :( whereas i've traded for many steam gifts/tf2 items and never been scammed on steam trade. So thats why steamtrade FTW.

Please be careful and DO NOT trade for an account or EA/Origin key.

Regardless, he wanted Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon for Dishonored, and wanted me to go first because he has been 'scammed 3 times'. I'm generally a trusting person, so I gave him the key. He said he wasn't willing to complete the address, but the key was invalidated when I tried it on my end. I just assumed the key was used when he entered it, not completed the transaction. I told him this, and he offered an extra copy of Magicka for compensation. In return I would give him Portal 2 and Anomaly Warzone Earth. He contacted me the next day, but I was wary.

* A person who acts as an intermediary between the two traders who have agreed on a deal.

**How does middlemaning work?**

* The two traders give the items they've agreed to trade to the middleman, who then delivers the games to both traders.

**When should I ask for a middleman?**

* When a trade you've agreed on involves an item which can't be traded through the inbuilt Steam trading system (cd-key, money, account, etc), and you're uncomfortable 'going first'.

**Why should I ask for a middleman?**

* In case of any problem occurs -- the cd-key is invalid, or the other guy doesn't have the game he said he has or was never planning on giving the game in the first place -- the middleman can return the items to their rightful owners, eliminating scam.

**Who should I ask to be a middleman in one of my trades?**

* The [mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/modlist) are always at your disposal as a middleman or contact any of the official middlemans at [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/list/M).

----

However, it has been brought up several times in the past that /r/sgs could use a few middlemans.

So if you're an experienced trader who has some spare time, are trustworthy and willing to help out others as middleman, please volunteer and include every info which can prove your trusthworthiness (how long have you've been here in /r/sgs, sop rep, noteworthy position in another trading sub, etc), and ofc when you're usually available.

**It is no way an official 'sgs middleman service' announcement, so use it at your own risk, but I'm hoping it will arouse some attention and will make most scammers 'job' harder.**

----

As for the volunteers, I'll try to edit this post accordingly with every volunteer's info who deem trustworthy^* - so they could be connected directly through Steam.

Let me know what you think, or if you have any suggestions that will help.

Hi everyone!

Missed some Daily Deal games? Don't worry - now's your chance to get a hold of them!

Today's features:

* [Bioshock](http://store.steampowered.com/app/7670/)
* [Space Pirates and Zombies](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/)
* [Legend of Grimrock](http://store.steampowered.com/app/207170/)
* [Double Fine Bundle](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/13701/)

### How to Enter:

Unlike previous giveaways, there is **no limit** on the number of games you can enter for. Please don't enter for games that you already own or won't play!

To enter, post a list below with the games you'd like to enter for, **ranked in the order of your preference.** If your username is drawn, you'll receive your most-preferred game that I still have available.

***

### Da Rulez:

1. Entries close **Tuesday the 24th, 10 PM PDT.** The drawing will take place at some point after that.

2. Users will be drawn at random. For each user drawn, they will receive a copy of whichever game is a) ranked highest and b) still in stock. Drawings will continue until I run out of users or out of games. (Winners will be drawn automatically by [this Python script.](http://pastebin.com/uEj0viXD))

3. In order to participate, you must have **gray flair or higher** as of the time of the drawing. Entries without flair will be ignored until they go away. Yes, I will be clearing the backlog before I do the drawing. _(Go make some trades!)_

4. Winning one Lightning Giveaway will make you ineligible to win Lightning Giveaways on other days... sorry!

5. Winners will be posted in a thread, and winners will be notified by PM. Games must be claimed by the end of the Summer Sale, or they may be redrawn.

6. Please make sure that the Steam ID listed in your flair is accurate - games will only be traded to the Steam account on record.

7. You **must not own** games you enter for! If you win a game you already own, your prize will be redrawn.

*Fine print: Confusing, badly-formatted, or otherwise invalid entries may be interpreted in whatever way I find most entertaining. Not responsible for issues with flair applications - please read the FAQ first. Professional driver, closed course. Your mileage may vary. These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and these games are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any disease. Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball. This post may not be reproduced without the express written consent of Major League Baseball.*

I've gotten a lot of sweet deals from this community and this is just me wanting to give back some. If you have a reddit account eligible to be used at PlayItForward, I'd love for you guys to participate as well.

I hope this isn't too big a violation of the subreddit rules and you fine mods will allow this one infraction.

Concluding edit: Thanks for the upvotes, guys. I've concluded the giveaway and boy, that was hard work. Glad to have been able to give some back - this is a great community :)

First of all, you are all doing an excellent job with pretty much everything! We've been removing hardly any posts (and those are usually due to traders without flair trying to flog off keys), and I, personally, have been very impressed at the calibre of traders here - you are all classy as all hell!

Secondly, I'd like to remind you guys of something minor about the formatting of post titles.

I know it seems kinda pedantic, but:

&gt; **[H]Viddo Gamz [W]Itemz, Viddo Gamz**

as a title is not alright. Why's this? 

You see that orange ***""Browse Trades""*** button on the right? That takes you to a custom website that our code ninja [blueshiftlabs](/user/blueshiftlabs) whipped up - basically, it scrapes post titles to make it easier to sort through trades.

However, it requires a space after the [H] and [W] tags, as such:

&gt; **[H] Viddo Gamz [W] Moar Viddo Gamz**

It's just a little thing, but it makes a big difference to everyone who uses the website!

Stay awesome,

*Your loving mod,*

He added me on Steam asking to trade a CS:GO Key for my Just Cause. In retrospect it was obviously a scam. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Anyways I figured *what the hell* since I got it for $0.27. So I spent $0.27 to rat out a scam artist. Worth it? I don't know.

Sorry for the disappearance everyone, I originally took a break to start prepping for midterms. Once midterms where gone and past I realized just how poorly I was doing in my classes, I made the choice extend my break until the quarter was finished.

With summer quarter quickly approaching I’m hoping to take this time to clear the backlog and (hopefully) be able to keep it to a minimum during the next school quarter.

So there you have it, I’ll be working hard to clear the backlog. If there’s any confusion or dispute, feel free to respond to the mod message or pm me directly. I have been out for a while, if I am using old out of date rules don’t hesitate to point them out to me.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

Dear Members,

Over the holidays we had a few problems with our site that affected some of you who bought or tried to buy the Bethesda New Year Collection and the Borderlands 2 Four-Pack.

We mistakenly advertised these packs at a price much lower than intended.

Many customers were quick to purchase the bundles at these low prices, in fact so many that our servers buckled under the pressure resulting in additional technical problems.

What does this mean for you?

If you have managed to access at least one serial key
This means that we were able to complete your order. As difficult as it is for us, we will be honoring the price that we advertised and you will get to keep all of the games you bought – we’re currently waiting on serial keys to complete your orders and will deliver them as soon as possible.

If you have not managed to access any of the games
This means that we were not able to complete your order due to technical difficulties, and have therefore reversed your payment. We understand the disappointment that you have experienced especially during the Holiday season and as compensation we are providing your account with a 20% discount valid on all purchases on the GamersGate site until 31 December 2013. In the few cases where discounts are not permitted, we will do our best to provide similar compensation (e.g. the equivalent amount in Blue Coins). The discount is not valid when purchasing Blue Coins.

We want to apologize for these mistakes and the amount of time it has taken to resolve everything. It is possible that there are some who may be “stuck in the middle” and we would like to direct them to our support team so we can help you individually. Please be aware that due to the above issues, our support team is under heavy pressure – we will be answering all tickets we receive, but it may take longer than usual until things calm down.

We hope that you can be pleased with the resolution of these issues, and that we can continue to deliver fantastic deals and some exciting new releases as we move forward.

People like royceee have sold hundreds of Dead Island keys for paypal or other games and now he has changed his steam address and made his new profile private. It used to be steamcommunity.com/id/royceee but now it doesn't exist (EDIT: now he has linked to one of his alt accounts). I called him out in my history along with several other people on SPUF who knew what he was doing. His name is royceee on the Steam forums and that is where he sold most of his illegal copies http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2391919&amp;page=39. He is royceee on reddit too. He lied so many times while acting like a nice guy I am so pissed right now.

I *THINK* that this is him:

It was found here: http://forums.gamerep.org/members/royceee.27/ Funny that someone found him because royceee made an account to report OTHER scammers.

I hope steam takes action and makes an example so others are detoured from doing this in the future. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2547800&amp;page=4



steamrepURL: http://steamrep.com/index.php?id=76561197980701348

He even redirected his SPUF account to one of his alts, which he renamed and put his original picture up so it would look like his main account: http://steamcommunity.com/id/royceee2/

edit: He just made his profile public again since he realized he can't hide. He blames his ""supplier"" which is actually fkn0wned but he will keep lying like he has done for the last several months, and says he needs time to hear from steam support before he will give anything back. The dick actually tries to say that HE was the one who got scammed, even though he profited like mad and his responses to others questioning him before the key troubles show that he was and is still lying. Just the fact that he TRIED to hide from everyone pisses me off. After looking through his history which is saturated by lies, he is just trying to buy time while thinking of a different way to get away with all of the cash and games and items he has traded illegal Dead Island keys for. I can't begin to detail the web of lies this guy has told people in order to make money. If steam support receives several reports, maybe they will do something about it. He is trying to sell his Dead Island keys from his alt account which is private. http://tf2tp.com/profile.php?profile=76561197980701348   His latest post from 2/16 links to his alt now, saying he wants a Bills hat for each Dead Island copy. A Valve account on SPUF shut down his main selling thread long ago and warned him not to do it but he has continued to do it, only more on other forums since then. If Steam doesn't ban him, I'd say you can get away with anything.

edit: Annnnnd now his profile is private again. 

edit: And the lies continue. He says that his supplier took his website down and disconnected the phone. He has no supplier, someone found his account on the fkn0wned forums http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g302/Rutger_Mulder/Steam/StolenDeadIslandkeys2.jpg
 . Royceee says he sold the copies at or below cost. Nope, he wrote in one of his arguments on reddit that he never accepts less than $12 for a copy. He only paid $2 or less each. He says he has a negative balance with his credit card company. Pure lies. He sold hundreds of copies, got dozens of pages of GOOD steam games - well over 400 - in his inventory because of the illegal Dead Island keys, got tons of TF2 keys/buds/bills and sold THOSE for paypal, and also sold game after game for paypal. He has made thousands of dollars off of this scam and now he is saying he LOST money? This kid is despicable. At first, after people found his hidden/changed profile, he said he would refund everyone but he needed to wait to hear from steam first. Now he says, ""I have suffered massive losses from this crisis. [...] For you guys, I will be gathering what I still have left and try my best to give you a refund."" He has hundreds of sales JUST counting Dead Island for crying out loud. He says it was the fault of his supplier, so why did he go to such great lengths to try and hide before we discovered him again? He says that he won't accept any adds because he is still waiting for steam support, but he wants records from those who purchased from him so he can prove to the CC that his imaginary ""supplier"" is a fraud? Royceee has all the same records his duped customers have--in paypal, and how will people give him that info if he doesn't accept their adds? Answer: he doesn't think through his lies, he just wants sympathy so people don't demand their stuff back. None of what he says makes sense. He says he is online less because he is constantly going to his credit card company to try and ""settle this mess"" . . . WTF? This thief is a pathological liar and if you paid him with paypal, you should look into a dispute/chargeback so you can retrieve your money.",,False,,t5_2skv6,True,,,True,t3_psva0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/psva0/psa_dead_island_keys_being_revoked/,

I made a post about trading Payday 2 for some TF2 Keys, and this guy added me out of the blue. The whole situation seemed sketchy to me. Just a reminder to be careful, and don't be afraid to back out.

He mislead a trader by responding to questions whether or not it was for steam by stating it was a code you enter into a website. He was well aware that is was a uplay code after a conversation we had (that he deleted) and decided to just go after somebody who didn't know better. In my books, this is scamming. 

Our original conversation, you can only see my responses: http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1jy5c5/h_assassins_creed_iii_w_payday_2/ (he told me to fuck off and got very upset)

So I've been AWOL lately, and plan to go into (near total) retirement from trading. I think we've all said that before, but hopefully I can clear out my inventory and make it stick this time.

Please make me an offer on what you're interested in. You can check [past Steam sale prices](http://steamsales.rhekua.com) if you're not sure how much would be a reasonable offer.

**If you don't have the blue flair required to offer Paypal**, feel free to make an offer in TF2 keys, which you can either trade for or [purchase from the Steam Community Market](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) starting at around $2.15 each. I prefer Paypal, but will accept fair offers in keys, too.

Combo offers welcome. You're also welcome to offer other things like [games I don't own](http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikker_/wishlist/?sort=price) (every Steam game I don't own is on my wishlist), or trading cards. But since I'm trying to liquidate, chances are lower that I will accept such offers.

That being said, I've seen a lot of peoples asking on mod mail when will they get their flair upgrade. Don't worry, you will get your flair upgrade, if you didn't receive any response/flair upgrade in 7 days, feel free to resend a new request because we probably missed it(reddit mod tools sucks).  
  
If you need a quick flair upgrade, feel free to contact me directly on Steam, if I'm on my PC and not ingame, you'll likely get your flair upgrade right away.  
  
Also, please fill this short survey.

I promise It won't take more than a min. Keep in mind this is **not official** /r/SGS polling.

Also, **don't ""go first"", ask for a [middleman](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/middleman)** instead!

**Edit1**: Those who don't have [grey flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_flair.3F_why_do_we_have_it.3F) yet should not worry.

**Edit2:**

If you're a new to SGS and post threads offering your Blood Dragon keys, you are a prime target for scammers who will add you directly through steam or PM you through reddit in an attempt to rip you off. Be wary of people adding you directly without your permission!

**Red Flags include:**

* Being on trade probation
* Being in a hurry to do the trade
* Asking you to go first because 'they just got scammed'
* Having few games or low play time in their steam accounts
* New reddit or steam accounts

Any one of these things is normally okay (except trade probation), but when you see multiple red flags, then you should be more careful.

**EDITED IN** from a [comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1bkc6o/psa_company_of_heroes_tales_of_valor_keys_are/c97ilcg?context=3), on why PWYW bundle keys are not allowed individually:

&gt; PWYW bundle keys are not allowed following a community consensus from a poll about a year ago. Individuals may have voted for it for different reasons, though, a few being:

&gt; 1. Some feel it takes advantage of devs who are already deeply discounting their games by including them in a PWYW bundle.

&gt; 2. Some feel it takes advantage of inexperienced traders who don't know about bundles, who can be coerced into trading things of disadvantageously higher value than Humble Bundle keys.

&gt; 3. Some feel it opens the forum up to too much ""key spam"" with people offering the same extremely cheap keys on everyone's threads.

&gt; 4. It is against the TOS of Humble Bundle, Indie Royale, and possibly other bundle distributors to share/trade keys (I haven't read all of the TOS very closely). It doesn't mean they have a _legal_ right to prohibit you from doing what you want with them (first sale doctrine and all), but some may want to respect the bundle distributors / devs wishes in this matter. This is (presumably) the reason why, until recently, Humble Bundle only gave you one key for the entire bundle. (I assume the reason they stopped is that it became a hassle for Valve to add new CDR database entries for their bundles, which would also often lead to the bundle contents getting leaked early when people spotted the CDR entries; officially Humble's policy is still one-bundle-for-one-end-user, no sharing).

&gt; I don't agree with every one of these, but that's some of the logic. The ultimate reason being we put it to a vote, and that was the consensus. Those interested might try /r/indiegameswap, /r/gamesell or other sites like steamtrades.com, but they are responsible for double checking the rules of those places themselves.",,False,,t5_2skv6,1364970177.0,,mod-rikker,True,t3_1bkc6o,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1bkc6o/psa_company_of_heroes_tales_of_valor_keys_are/,

**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

[**Edit:** At least one report the Bioshock Infinite key was also region locked. I redeemed one from the bundle received in a trade with no problem myself.]

The way redemption of the Uplay codes works is the user adds it to their cart in the Uplay store and adds the code as a promo code, reducing the price to zero, allowing them to check out for free. A user in the United States negotiated a trade with a user in Europe who had the Uplay key. When the US user tried to use the promo code on the Uplay store, it was reported as invalid. The code was eventually able to be redeemed from a European IP address.

He first added me a while ago after pm'ing me about trading my AC3 Uplay code for his Dishonored key, which had yet to be delivered.  

He and I finally connected at being online at the same time and he proceeded to say that it was a key (as previously stated) but that the 'two previous codes he had been offered for it had been inactive'.  This immediately rang a bell, and I told him i would be happy to email him proof of the code (the confirmation email they send with the code to input to download the game' and he said it would not be necessary.

Following /sgs rules, I told him that I would have to have him go first, at which point he became hostile.  I then informed him that I would be happy to trade with him as long as we used an /sgs mod as a middleman.  He then gave me some bullshit about it being a 'forbidden key' which I called him out on.  

When I made it clear that I would not trade with him and suspected him of being a scammer, he stopped answering proceeded to defriend me.

In the following hours, you guys will be giving me what you believe to be the last 2 characters, in whatever order you believe is the correct one:

For example:

Kirobz does something like '' 2C '' or '' 22 '' or '' IB '' or '' B5 ''

That's the way to play.

**TL;DFLRTShit:** Post what you believe to be the last 2 characters of a BF3 LE key I'm giving away!

Cheers! And **good luck** everyone!

Mods can play too!

1337701262.0,26,self.SteamGameSwap,tzdeh,[PSA] How to value your TF2 Items,30,4,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/tzdeh/psa_how_to_value_your_tf2_items/,"So, you offer up your backpack for a TF2 trade but do you know what your items are worth? If you are not careful, you could end up being lowballed and trade a small game for 6-8 key item. Especially for people who don't play Team Fortress 2 much but purchase a lot of pre-orders. A good amount of those pre-orders come with nice TF2 bonuses that usually have decent value. 

Examples of these would be;

* Deus Ex: Human Revolution items (7+ keys)
* Bill's hat (8-9 keys)
* Genuine Scrap Pack (1-2 keys)

(For reference; TF2 Mann Co keys sell on the trading market for from **$1.35 - $1.50/key^1**, *$2.50/key if purchased from the Mann Co store*. *1 Key = about 2.44 Refined*)

* Not all TF2 Promo items are worth a ton, it's important to do your research. 
* Keep in mind that this mostly applies to promos, metal, keys and hats. If you are paying in weapons, even promos, you might have to 'overpay' their general TF2 value for a game unless it's a very sought after promo. For example, *Big Kill* from Sam &amp; Max is worth a ***lot*** more (14-15 keys) than the *Machina* promo from Deus Ex (~2 refined). As always, YMMV. 
* Tip from [mszu](http://www.reddit.com/user/mszu): *""If you are offering up a backpack full of random cheap stranges, a couple vintage weapons, and some crates. You can't expect people to pay you full price for each item and to have to sort thru all your junk. I often use the [backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf) site to check the overall value of the backpack then offer a fair comprimise on that.""* (note: edited grammar a little, hope no one minds)

**So how do I look up my value?**  
Well, the quick and easy way is to check out [backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf). On the top right hand you can enter your Steam userID and it'll give you a Refined and USD$ value for your whole backpack. For example, here's [mine](http://backpack.tf/id/drgncabe). ~~The prices here are the same ones [TF2 Warehouse](http://tf2wh.com) uses.~~ The prices are managed internally and voted on by users, It may not be 100% perfect but it seems to be more accurate than some of the other offerings and it gives you a good good place to start with your items value. 

***Information from [ruinernix](http://www.reddit.com/user/ruinernix), the creator of [backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf):*** *""While originally the tf2wh prices were used, this has since been changed to match market prices we have noticed. We no longer use TF2WH prices since they do not keep their prices updated anymore. We also have 2 staff members that are keeping unusual prices up to date, but that is a lot of work. Some hats are not priced yet, but we're working on it. You can vote on prices that you feel are not correct and we look at them once enough votes have been received. There is also a spreadsheet view, so you can see all prices at a glance.""*

Another way is to check each item individually using the following sites;

* [TF2 Trends pricing guide](http://www.tf2trends.com/)
* [TF2 pricing spreadsheet for hats and items](http://www.tf2pricingguide.blogspot.com/)
* [TF2 Warehouse](http://tf2wh.com)

The longer way (meaning it takes more research) is to check out the following locations to see what other people are trading for.

* /r/tf2trade 
* [TF2 Outpost](http://www.tf2outpost.com)
* [TF2 Trading Post](http://tf2tp.com/)

I hope this helps others, if anyone wants to add to this I'll gladly update with additional resources, tips and what not. /r/tf2trade is mainly for TF2 items and I recommend checking it out if you haven't yet. 

**^1** Useful info from [orijinal](http://www.reddit.com/user/orijinal): $1.50 per key is about the max you can hope for. It's easy to find keys for $1.40 and sometimes you can find them for as low as $1.30.

**What's 2.44 Refined mean, anyway?**   
Just in-case you are unsure, here's a quick rundown of Refined metal;  
*2.44 Refined* = *2 Refined, 1 Reclaimed (.33), 1 Scrap (.11)*. Weapons are .5 scrap. It takes 2 weapons from the same class (Heavy, Scout, etc...) to make a scrap, 3 scrap to make a reclaimed and 3 reclaimed to make a refined. Here's some additional info on the [TF2 Wiki crafting](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Crafting) entry.

* Tip from [ArturiusTsar](http://www.reddit.com/user/ArturiusTsar): *""I have also found a wonderful tool built into my Steam Profile inventory section. The* ***""View Inventory History""*** *link feature!. Note: sometimes it might require a few refreshes to show accurate info, and I have also noticed that my very recent donation of Spiral Knights items seems to only show the Crowns I traded off but not the other Gems or what have you*""

* Another tip from [ArturiusTsar](http://www.reddit.com/user/ArturiusTsar), this one paraphrased: *It might be wise to have a return policy. Not many people do it but it could lead to happier traders and more customers.*

Dev Notes
--

This script is a fork of [the one zedadex made] (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/112566) for /r/tf2trade. I loved that it provided so many links based off a SteamID alone, but it overwrote our flair tiers and wasn't very visible against SGS's white background.

I first modified it to leave flair tiers intact, and to not modify the flair of banned users or hidden profiles. I then tuned the colors and adjusted the links to fit a SGS workflow: open profile, check game inventory, skim TF2 backpack value, check SteamRep, add as a friend.

There are still ways this script could be improved, namely moving away from brittle HTML scraping and improving compatibility with RES' Never Ending Reddit.

-------------

Previously they stated, that any game which was bought in Steam Store will not have any regional restrictions to add to the library and play (it is well known that CD keys usually have various restrictions on activation and playing). Actually steam support still claims that gifts will not be region locked, but it is not true, there were several solid confirmations that restrictions exist.

---------------------------------------

Right now you should be aware of following gifts.
-------------

[Max payne 3 Pre order 1 (CIS) - sub id 14524](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/14524)
The gift has following parameter in its cdr record: 
&gt; onlyallowrunincountries = AM AZ BY GE KZ KG MD RU TJ TM UZ UA LV LT EE

which means it can not be runned outside [CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States#Membership) countries
  

[Max payne 3 Pre order 1 (RU) - sub id 14623](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/14623)
with parameter
&gt; onlyallowrunincountries = RU

which means that it will be playable only inside Russia. 
  
  

Also note, that there is another gift with the same name (Max payne 3 Pre order 1 (RU)), but different subscription id ([14100](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/14100)). It is not locked, but Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 form this gift will contain russian language pack ONLY. It was available to purchase in Russia till 12 of May. From this moment only restricted version (sub 14524) is available for Russians.

---------------------------------------

Other region locked gifts:

* [Confrontation Russian (sub id 13915) (playable only in Russia)](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/13915)
* [Ridge Racer Unbounded (RU) (sub id 13946) (playable only in Russia and CIS countries)](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/13946)
* [The Witcher 2 (RU) (sub id 13944) (playable only in Russia and CIS countries)](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/sub/13944). Note, that there is another gift with the same name and different sub id without any restrictions. It was available to buy in Russia and CIS till 27 of March.

Yet another thread hit 500 comments! Yet again, it's time to make another one.

The rules of this thread:

1. People who have Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment. **Don't post a new top-level comment unless you have Dota 2.**
3. The post-closing markup won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

**Remember that our normal rules still apply:**

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:
    * Gray to send non-Steam-Trading codes.
    * Blue **on both sides** for Paypal!

Have fun!

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

## FAQ
***

We now have [a FAQ](/r/SteamGameSwap/faq) available to read. Check it out, and let us know if you find any mistakes.

***
## Flair Changes
***

### 5+ Trade Flair

You might have noticed that most blue (1+ trade) flairs have turned gray. That's to make room for our new 5+ trade tier, which will use the blue icons of the previous 1+ tier. We added this due to overwhelming demand for something between 1 and 10 trades. To qualify for the new blue flair, you need 5 or more trades, and your account **must** be at least 30 days old.

Remember, flair upgrades are *not* automatic. If you have 5 trades, and you'd like to upgrade, [message the moderators.](http://go.blueshiftlabs.net/FlairUpgrade)

### Age and flair requirements reduced

The age requirements to receive red, green, or purple flair have all been reduced. In addition, the karma requirements for flair are now **combined karma** (link + comment), not just link karma.

Here's the new flair requirements:

Flair Tier | Color | Minimum account age | Minimum combined karma
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1+|Gray|None (3+ if under 30 days)|None
5+|Blue|30 days|None
10+|Red|**3 months** (was 6)|200
20+|Green|**6 months** (was 12)|400
50+|Purple|**6 months** (was 12)|400


***
## New Trade Restrictions
***

### Accounts

If you want to trade a LoL, WoW, or any other type of online account, you must have **blue flair (5+ trades)**.

***Steam accounts may not be traded under any circumstances.***

### Paypal

Trading for Paypal now requires **both sides of the trade have blue flair (5+ trades).**

***
## Removed Trade Restrictions
***

### Humble Bundles (and other name-your-own-price bundles)

Humble Bundles, IndieRoyale Bundles, IndieGala bundles, and other forms of name-your-own-price bundle are now **allowed**, subject to these restrictions:

1. Bundles must be above the average price.
    
    For Humble Bundles, you must have been above the average at the time of purchase.

    For IndieRoyale bundles, since there is a minimum price, any bundle is allowed.

    For other name-your-own-price bundles, you must have paid above $5 US (or equivalent).

    **Proof of purchase price must be provided for all bundles.**

2. Bundles must be complete gift URLs - **no partial bundles.**

3. Bundles are subject to the same restrictions as all other code trades (must have gray flair or higher).

### Dota 2 and Dead Island

Dota 2 and Dead Island are now allowed. **Proof of purchase / valid key ownership must be provided.**

### Other restrictions

Other restrictions are the same as before:

* **DiRT 3** requires proof of AMD card ownership for keys.
* **All keys** require gray flair or higher.
* **Steam tradables** have no restrictions or requirements.

## AutoModerator
***

[AutoModerator](/r/AutoModerator) is a bot created by [Deimorz](/u/Deimorz), one of the mods of /r/gaming, to automate some moderation tasks. In particular, we have AutoModerator configured to do these tasks:

1. Remove posts that don't follow our title-formatting rules.

    These will now be **very strictly enforced,** as only a machine can.

2. Remove posts that violate our rules.

    Posts that offer keys, accounts, or Paypal for trade without the requisite flair will be removed.

3. Automatically remove you from the spam filter.

    If your post doesn't appear on the front page immediately, **don't panic**. Give AutoModerator the chance to fix your problem. If you don't see your post on the front page in 15 minutes, message us to find out why.

I'm blueshiftlabs, and I'm the newest mod of /r/SteamGameSwap! I've made some changes - some you may have already seen, and some behind the scenes. Here's the highlights:

* Brand-new header image and CSS! This should fix the graphical bugs some of you were seeing. If you see any more, please [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SteamGameSwap)!
* Flairs can now contain a link to your Steam profile! If you already have flair, instructions for how to update your flair are at the bottom.
* We now have a [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RedditGameSwap)! Everyone is welcome to join.

Some more minor things:

* You can now use spoiler tags if you're discussing a game. To create a spoiler, post this:  

    `[Your princess is in another castle!](/spoiler)`

    That becomes:

    [Your princess is in another castle!](/spoiler)

* There's now an announcement bar at the top. Announcements from the moderators will be linked up there.

* Other, minor CSS tweaks and new features may roll out over the next few weeks. If you see anything go wrong, [let us know!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SteamGameSwap)

I'm looking forward to helping you all!

***How to update your flair:***

We'll need a couple pieces of information from you to update your flair successfully. We'll need:

* A *permanent* link to your Steam profile. You can find this link on:
    * [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) 
        * Enter your Profile Name.
        * Find the line that begins with ""steamID64"". This is the URL you need.
    * [SteamIDFinder](http://steamidfinder.com/)
        * Enter your profile link (you can get this by going to your Community page in Steam, right-clicking, and clicking ""Copy Page URL"")
        * Right click your profile picture (to the left) and copy the URL.
        * **Don't give us your steamID32** (the one that looks like **STEAM_X:Y:ZZZZZZZZ**) - give us the URL of the link attached to your profile picture (it should look like `http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/7656119xxxxxxxxxx`).


    **Don't give us your custom URL** (anything containing /id/). We need your permanent URL (the one containing /profiles/).

    *Please note that providing this information is optional.* If you don't want your Steam profile linked from your flair, please say so in your message.

* Proof of your completed trades. 
    * *If you already have flair, and are just changing your profile, your old flair is sufficient proof.*
    * If you are getting flair for the first time, or are upgrading to a higher tier of flair, please include links to completed-trades threads for all of your completed trades.  
    We accept trades from the following subreddits:
        * /r/SteamGameSwap
        * /r/gameswap
        * /r/SteamTrade
        * /r/SteamTrading

### To change your flair, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/message/compose?to=/r/SteamGameSwap&amp;subject=Flair+Request&amp;message=**steamID64%3A**+http%3A%2F%2Fsteamcommunity.com%2Fprofiles%2FYOUR+STEAMID64+HERE%0A%0A**Trade+Confirmation%28s%29%3A**+http%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2FSteamGameSwap%2FYOUR+CONFIRMATION+PERMALINK%28S%29+HERE) with those two pieces of information.

**Please note that posting in the completed-trades thread WILL NOT GET YOU FLAIR AUTOMATICALLY. You MUST follow these directions to receive flair.**

*Note that due to the width of the flair, it may not display properly in the sidebar. If you've been set up with flair, and you want to see how it looks, look at any posts or comments that you've made here.*

I would like to thank everyone for participating. If you still want a coupon from my inventory, PM me. 

I would have picked /u/moo_point as the winner since s/he provided very detailed feedback (though 5 things to change rather than 1). But since s/he is not in it for the key I'll move on to the next best choice.

I'm selecting /u/thefailien since s/he mentioned about the chat first. I personally believe the chat option, if promoted and participated in, can help SGS community a lot. A lot of people did not know about this. 

However, there were lots of useful suggestions and I'm sure they will be put to good use for SGS.

----------------------------------------------------------


Go to my inventory for list of coupons: http://steamcommunity.com/id/minhaz/

There are 43 coupons there. Pick one you want and make a post. However, along with that, you need to post 2 things:

1) The thing you love most about /r/steamgameswap.

2) The one thing you would prefer to change about /r/steamgameswap.

**Everyone will get coupons (First come first serve! One per person.) The best answer will get a TF2 key. And remember to upvote!**

----------------------------------------------------------

So an example post would be:

75% off Krater

1) All the helpful traders.

2) That rule about partial humble bundles not being traded.

Edit 1: Format.

Edit 2: Gave away a few coupons. Still a lot left. Will be back after a few hours.

The copy of Xcom was gone from my Inventory. but he said it wasnt appearing in his, though he had a copy of xcom already redeemed. he said it was for a friend, and he apparently sent an email to steam, but never got a response. i checked in a while back, and now his profile is private because he unfriended me, im worried he might have scammed me. what should i do?

Well more specifically, PayPal screwed up because I decided to buy a couple of games for people while I was at another IP address. Their automated system flagged both purchases as ""suspicious"" and, without my authorization, began a dispute process. 

The vendor whom I made a purchase from was non other than Valve Corporation. Valve immediately put a freeze on both items, despite being sent already since PayPal was doing a chargeback all on their own without emailing me prior. 

I've spent the last week with a tradeban waiting for the two to sort things out, and have made a dozen phonecalls to both companies trying to sort it out.

Luckily I was finally able to get PayPal to close both disputes and they are hopefully talking to Valve directly and my account will be cleared up by tomorrow or the day after.

**So the message I want to deliver is this: Be careful when using your PayPal account anywhere other than your typical IP address. They like to flag things as suspicious, regardless of what they truly are and this can result in a suspension of your Steam Account, albeit temporary.**

(ie. broke, unhappy life, etc...)  

In order to have a chance to win, you can either post here or private message me why you believe you should be the one to win a free game/why you really would like a game.  The person who I believe is most deserving will be the winner.  I will decide 24-hours from now, who is most deserving.  

I am not looking for someone who is too lazy to go out and buy one or just wants an easy way out of spending their own cash.  I am looking for someone who cannot afford a game or has had a bad life....etc.  I am just looking to put a little joy in someones life. Depending on how this works out, I may continue this as a monthly thing.

**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

If you are an AUS/EUR/UK redditor and would like to save a bit of cash by getting US prices, please contact me.

How it works: Add me and let me know what you want. Paypal Gift/Payment Owed me the funds, then I'll use my steam wallet to buy the game and trade it to you.

That's all to it.

I've helped out a lot of people on the SomethingAwful forums with the same thing and I'm one of the US gifters for their Steam threads.

Please post here before adding me.

Thanks for looking.

Edit: Down to $49

Edit 2: Please READ this before adding me. I'm not giving away games and I'm not looking to lose money on this. I've already had a couple of successful trades with people today.

Below is NOT what I'm looking for:

12:27 PM - Kuros: hi

12:28 PM - : hey man

12:28 PM - Kuros: how can i help you?

12:28 PM - : i was looking to get about $33 worth of stuff, can i do like $20 paypaled to you?

12:28 PM - : $32.50 actually

12:29 PM - Kuros: nooo, that's not how this works

12:29 PM - : what about $25

12:29 PM - : i'm not in the UK or anything

12:30 PM - Kuros: The reason why I'm opening it up to the UK/EUR/AUS people is because they save money and I get paypal, so we both win

First of all, I'd like to note that Alpha simply means that the account has been registered since before November 2010. It has no effect on the value of the account.

Secondly, scamming using these accounts is incredibly easy - a password reset is very simple.

Finally, ***FLAAAAAIIIIIRRRRRRRRR***. LOOK FOR IT.

That is all. Peace, love, and harmony, y'all!

Yet another thread hit ~~500~~ 900 comments! And yet again, it's time to make another one.

The rules of this thread:

1. People who have Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment. **Don't post a new top-level comment unless you have Dota 2.**
3. The post-closing markup won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

**Remember that our normal rules still apply:**

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:
    * Gray to send non-Steam-Trading codes.
    * Blue **on both sides** for Paypal!

Have fun!

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

&gt;There was a pricing glitch in Steam today and LA Noire The Complete Edition was available at $2.49. Please be careful when trading for LA Noire The Complete Edition. A lot of people may feel they are trading a game far above the value than what the other party purchased and may feel cheated.

&gt;Please note there are two version of LA Noire, one is the Complete Edition and the other is the non-DLC version.

I don't mean to cast suspicion on every copy of LA Noire being traded, but I saw one guy selling copies for $5 paypal elsewhere. Also:

Don't freak out, it's merely a possibility, but I feel everyone should know the risks involved when trading. As always, be especially careful of deals that seem too good to be true.

But /u/MineralsMan found me an Amazon Manager who lurks on Reddit, so I'll do my best to contact him. Otherwise, I already contacted them twice and there is squat that I can do. They need his address and account. I don't have that. All I have is one serial number that's been used. Keep reading. 



Otherwise, I lost my $100. But maybe I should be happy about it. No one would scam for that amount of money unless they really needed it. Maybe he was low on cash and needed to it. Sure I'm left without the money but I'll scrap by, maybe he just needs it more. There could have been better ways to approach this problem, but nonetheless he seemed to solve it.




Thanks for all the support and help in trying to solve my pitiful problem. My advice is that you disregard how many trades a person a has. This one had 70+ trade and still pulled out the biggest scam on the subreddit apparently. Look through a traders history comments and see what they're like. If they post reasonable offers, help people out, and give a cent about the community, then they have some humanity in them and can be trusted. Also ask other big traders like /u/Kataki ComputerNerd and a whole lot more you probably accumulated. 



Don't make the mistakes I made.

We have just made the switch to this new website, I hope everyone enjoys it. The purpose of this website is to provide the current, lowest, and average price of the top 100 selling games on Steam. But more importantly, these prices are then calculated, using our own unique algorithm, to provide the equivalent price in both Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 keys.

We will be hosting a raffle for some TF2 items soon. Please stay tuned.

Change log:

-Draws the current price from Steam

-Stores the lowest price for the year

-Auto-updating!

-Revolutionized UI

-Search function

-Game images

-Link to store page in title

-Now holds top 100 selling

-Current price shows green if the value is less than or equal to the lowest price

On the website, TF2 keys are valued at $1.30 and Dota 2 keys are valued at $1.85.

Future changes include possibly implementing a voting system to the prices/key prices. More games and more pages.

Hope this helps someone new to online trading and human disintegrity :D

**Avoiding scammers**


Guidelines:

1. *It doesn't have to be a new account.* 
Many scammers will do some 1:1 Steam trades on /r/SteamGameSwap and give you links to completed ones. Trading one game for another of relatively same value gets you a great illusion of credibility.

2. *Don't blindly trust Steam Rep*. Now I didn't even check it beforehand (I did everything wrong, I have no idea how I don't get mugged every weekend) but the scammer had a bunch of positive reviews and even a ton of games on his account.

3. *If it's a key, use a middleman*. [Traders Guild](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TradersGuild) admins for example are reliable people in charge of a massive trading group. The mods of /r/steamgameswap are another option. It's highly likely they will help you if you just ask them politely. If anyone knows of other proper middlemen, please post them in the comments. If there's money involved (which I do not recommend) this can be done through Amazon Gift Card Codes by e-mail ordering the correct amount to your own e-mail address and giving the code to the middleman. NEVER send the money first.

4. *Take screenshots*. This won't really help you avoid scamming, but it will help you get the scammer banned, possibly saving another from the same fate. Besides, if someone takes your hard-earned goods, you will want justice. 

5. *Need-to-know basis*. Don't give out any information your trading partner doesn't need. Obviously no credit card details, but don't give out e-mail addresses and the like either - if he is a scammer, and you get him banned, you'll avoid getting your e-mail on spamlists and such.

Red flags:


*Keep in mind, showing none of these might not mean the person's not a scammer - just that (s)he's a good one.*

1. *Temporary e-mail account*. Obvious temporary accounts are one good indicator you might be dealing with a scammer. A bunch of numbers at the end, e.g. harrysmith1823@ something dot com, is a pretty good indicator that the account is meant to be temporary even if it's not from an actual tempmail site.

2. *Oh, I don't have Paypal*. Every trader worth his pants has paypal.

3. *You're taking too long, I'm in a hurry*. I don't know why, but many scammers seem to get all itchy if you take long to respond.

4. *I don't trust middlemen*. Get. The. Fuck. Out.


**If you get scammed**

1. *Don't think about personal retaliation*. Putting the e-mail on spamlists won't do any good, it's probably a temp account anyway. Even if he had a real name on the Steam profile, Facebook harassment is also pretty much out of the question - might be illegal and you have no way of knowing if it's the real name or the ""real"" name. All ""personal army"" stuff has to go out of the window too.

2. *Get him banned*. Hard. Here's where those screenshots you took come in handy. You have a buttload of evidence. If you screwed up, don't be afraid to admit your stupidity to the mods. They're a bit like doctors, this isn't the first asshole they've shoved their fingers into.

3. *Get him more banned*. It doesn't have to stay within where ever you traded with him. Get him banned from every trading media you possibly can - all Steam trading groups he belongs to, trading subreddits, Steam Rep... If you have evidence, no trading group is going to trust him.

4. *Be smarter next time*. This was a lesson - a tough one, maybe, but definitely a learning experience. Next time you won't do the risky trade, you're going to find a direct Steam trade or buy from a proper reseller. Lose 40 bucks? Don't let it get you down, think about it this way - maybe without the experience you've gained, someone would've scammed you out of a hundred bucks a year from now.",,False,,t5_2skv6,False,,,True,t3_10d2yp,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/10d2yp/psa_scammer_avoidance_guide/,

That's funny... neither of these have the 500 games promised. If I knew his main account, I would get that banned, too.

So he has at least 3 alt Steam accounts in addition to his ""500 game"" account. Seems legit...

**He is using a new Reddit account because these other two have been banned from SGS** (you're welcome):

**Kids, always check the basics before trading with someone:**

* Account age! Scammers often have older alts, and new legit traders will have young accounts, but anything less than 3 months old is a HUGE red flag. Proceed with caution.
* Game count (always be extra careful if they have ~50 games or less)
* Recently played time (this varies of course, but 0.0 is ~~a dead giveaway~~ cause for extreme caution). Still, high game play time is no guarantee, either. Some may use alt accounts to ""idle"" in TF2 for item drops, etc.
* Remember: Wall rep doesn't mean much! That's why we have our flair system. Scammers often leave rep from their own alt accounts, or make small-ticket trades for TF2 items to get a few positive +rep comments from legit traders. And any negative feedback can be deleted by the profile owner!

[Here's a link](http://redditraffle.com/) to a raffle site for Reddit I've been working on. I'm cross-posting it here because this great community gets a lot of raffles too.

Raffling on reddit can be a big pain, since you usually have to pick a number, and OP has to random it, and find your number. This can cause a lot of problems if you're late to the party, or want minimum age/karma requirements (to prevent alts).

If you're holding a raffle, please use my site instead of making people pick random numbers! It's kind of a pain for both the participants to pick numbers, especially if you're late to the party and have to find one that's not taken.

This site automatically detects multiple entries. If you post more than once, you will only be entered **once**. The raffler may choose to use filters to *only* enter comments with ""entering"", or not enter comments with ""not entering"" (for example, these filters may be any character/words). You may also specify minimum comment/link karma, and account age. Once again, these are filters for the raffler to specify himself.

Do let me know what you think, either here on Reddit or via the [contact form](http://redditraffle.com/contact.html).

If you haven't got your flair it is for one of the following reasons:

1. Your trade is invalid or violated the rules somehow. If this is the case it will be removed shortly.

2. Both parties haven't confirmed the trade. Your trade partner needs to confirm your trade too. When you finish your trade on steam that's the perfect time to let each other know to follow up on the confirmation thread.

3. Your account age is too low. Your account must be 30 days old before you can get grey. If this is the case, sit tight. Be patient and continue to trade if you wish as long as it doesn't violate the rules.

4. Time. Be patient please, we will get to your first time grey flair eventually. Continue to trade and your new trade will top any old trade we don't get to and will make your flair come faster.

Non-new users, you can let first time traders know that they won't need to apply for first time flair when you trade with them. This will help us get to your upgrades as well.

Make a damn throwaway if you're worried about it.

In light of the events of the last week or so - more scam PSAs than I've seen in a while - I felt it might be good to start a weekly event to highlight a few tips to help safeguard your trades.  Yes, this directed more at new traders, but I've often seen seasoned traders learn a thing or two (myself included), so we can all help each other out in some way, I'm sure.

Think of this as a place to ask your questions, solicit advice, or just toss up an anecdote about how you were able to avoid losing your hard-earned money because you took an extra step to ensure your trading partner was legit.

I'm going to start by adding a piece from yesterday's middleman PSA that applies to the general idea of confirming the identity of other Steam users.

To verify the identity of a user and/or MM
--
1.  Click their avatar in the Steam chat window.  Don't bother with any links anybody sends you - *DO IT YOURSELF!*
2.  Copy their URL directly from your main Steam window where their profile should now be loaded (skip the next step if you are able to do this).
3.  If you don't see a URL - do this:  In the main Steam window, click Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Interface tab.  Make sure ""Display Steam URL address bar when available"" is checked.
4.  Go to [steamrep.com](http://steamrep.com/) and paste the copied profile link into the search.
5.  NOW you can compare the page you have on SR to any (potentially false) links that may have been provided to you.  You can also state that you are going to take a moment to click a few of the quick search links on that person's SR page.  You can also ask that the MM PM you on reddit to verify that he/she is indeed one of the people listed in this thread.

The following steps are only for when things go awry.
--
1.  Should any step of verification fail or if anybody becomes too pushy - *BACK THE FUCK OUT IMMEDIATELY*.  There's rarely - if ever - a need to rush a trade.
2.  *DO NOT* close any chat windows - begin taking screenshots.  Capture as much as you can.
3.  Read this first:  http://forums.steamrep.com/threads/howto-report-a-scammer-look-at-acceptable-format-before-posting.51/
4.  Then report here:  http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/

ALWAYS report scammers - even if a person is already marked.  Some day, these asshats are going to want to appeal their tags, and more evidence means they're more likely to get a (most likely deserved) denial.
--

The other day a user was scammed, and all the scammer's information was provided eventually through some legwork by other SGS users.  As far as I know, however, *that scammer was never reported on SR.*

YOU NEED TO REPORT YOUR OWN SCAMMERS, ASK FOR HELP, OR BE WILLING TO MONITOR THE REPORT THREAD AND PROVIDE SR ADMINS WITH ANY ADDITIONALLY REQUESTED EVIDENCE.

Other users should not have to file for you, but chances are there are always going to be a few people willing to help make sure your report is complete.

I'm going to post now and let additional advice or questions show up, and I'll edit this text with anything deemed relevant.  The point here is to put out something that's more likely to be read than sidebar or announcement links (no offense, mods).

Please observe reddiquette while in this thread, and only downvote comments that are spam or extremely derailing.

/r/badkarma is reddit's own scammer database.  All trading and gifting subreddits (that I know of) add to a shared ban list indexed there.  By entering a scammer's reddit name in the search bar, you can find if they've been marked here but not on SR.

If it is a scammer, they might try to avoid that. If it is the real deal and they have a decent flair or whatever, it should be good (Usually blue flair and up is okay, but otherwise try to have them go first.

Secondly, if they're pushing you really hard for a game and they're ""reputable"", double check the profile. Unless it is a collectors item, then 99.99999% of the time, none of the reputable traders will do this.

Third, use a middleman if you are unsure. I would be happy to do it and so would many of the other traders that have a decent rep. It doesn't take long and really isn't too tasking.

Courtesy of [blueshiftlabs](/u/blueshiftlabs):

Profile rep (""+rep"" comments on a Steam profile) doesn't mean a thing. Remember, any comments a scammer doesn't like can be removed.

Don't trust links that a trader gives you - do your own checking. Check people on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com) to see they're if  marked there. If they link you to a rep thread (e.g. on SOP), ignore their link and find it yourself. (There are crafty sites designed to look like SOP and display fake rep threads for scammers.)

1335576040.0,20,self.SteamGameSwap,sw72u,[PSA] Posting Format Guide and Glossary,25,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/sw72u/psa_posting_format_guide_and_glossary/,"We've been seeing a lot of posts get caught by AutoModerator lately, so I thought I'd give everyone a quick reminder of how to format posts:

***
***
## Thread Formats
***
***
### Trade Threads
***

Trade threads follow this format:

**[H] Games, more games [W] Games**

Some particulars:

* The spaces are important. These won't work:

    *[H]Stuff[W]Stuff*  
    *[H]Stuff [W]Stuff*

    Always make sure to put spaces **after [H], before [W], and after [W].**

* You have to use square brackets. These won't work:

    *(H) Stuff (W) Other stuff*  
    *{H} Stuff {W} Other stuff*

    Always use **[square brackets]** around [H] and [W].

* Put the parts of your post in the right order. This won't work:

    [W] Other stuff [H] Stuff

    Remember that **[H] comes before [W].**

* Separate parts of your post correctly. These won't work:

    *[H] Cool stuff &amp; Dota 2 [W] Offers*
    *[H] Cool stuff and Dota 2 [W] Offers*

    Always **use commas or plus signs** to separate individual parts of your post.

* Remember to **put some number of games in your title.**

    If you have a large inventory, feel free to use the body of the post to expand upon the list, but as a general rule of thumb, try to have at least **three games** listed in your title. This helps people who are scanning threads.

Trade threads are by far the most common type of thread, and are indicated by a **blue arrow icon.**

***
### PSA Threads
***

PSA threads are ""public service announcements"" - non-trading posts that convey information that other traders should know.

PSA threads should be formatted as follows:

**[PSA] Title of your post**

PSA threads can be posted by any user - but please keep non-trading-relevant discussion in its appropriate subreddit.

PSA threads are indicated by a **yellow exclamation point icon.**

***
### Announcement Threads
***

Announcement threads contain information about rules changes, or other important information from the mod team. As a rule, new announcements will be available in the top Announcement section, while old announcements will be moved to the Announcement section of the sidebar.

Announcement threads are **reserved for moderator use.** AutoModerator will remove announcement posts not posted by moderators.

Announcement threads follow this format:

**[ANNOUNCEMENT] Post title**

Announcement threads are indicated by a **yellow exclamation point icon**, just like PSA threads.

***
### Giveaway Threads
***

Giveaway threads are threads where generous Redditors can give games to others! Giveaways are subject to whatever rules may be set by the game giver. Please confirm giveaways just like any other trade - they are counted toward flair for the giver, but not the receiver.

Giveaway threads follow this format:

**[GIVEAWAY] Games being given away**

Giveaways are indicated by a **green plus icon.**

***
### Closed Threads
***

Closed threads are threads that have completed. Thread posters will have ""close thread"" links that they can use to close threads.

Closed threads are indicated by a **red do-not-enter icon.**

Note that closing a thread is purely cosmetic - other users are still able to add comments to closed threads.

Also note that closed threads, internally, make use of the ""NSFW"" feature of reddit. If you have subreddit styles disabled, are browsing from the front page, or are browsing from a mobile app, you may see closed threads appear as normal threads with an NSFW tag.

***
***
## SGS Glossary
***
***

There's also been some confusion about what certain terms mean, and why some posts have been taken down. Here's a quick glossary:

* **Key**

    A CD key, or some other sort of code that cannot be traded through the Steam Trading window. These require **gray flair** to be traded.

    *To avoid confusing AutoModerator, don't refer to Steam-tradable items as ""keys"".*

* **TF2 keys**

    Distinct from unqualified ""keys"", TF2 keys refer to Team Fortress 2 [Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate_Key), a common TF2 trading currency. TF2 keys are Steam Trading items, and are not subject to flair restrictions.

    *To avoid AutoModerator confusion, don't refer to TF2 keys as ""keys"" - use the phrase ""TF2 keys"" or ""Mann Co. keys"".*

* **Steam Wallet**

    ""$X Steam Wallet"" is shorthand for ""Any game or combination of games, costing no more than $X"". During trading, the person receiving the Steam Wallet amount specifies the game or games desired. The person offering Steam Wallet then purchases the games, and trades them through the trading window.

    *Because this is a Steam Trading transaction, Steam Wallet offers are not subject to any flair requirement.*

* **Accounts**

    An account is **anything you log in to.** This includes accounts for WoW, LoL, and other games, as well as accounts for game services such as Origin, and even established accounts for non-gaming services.

    **Note that due to the easy ability to recover accounts in most cases, we strongly discourage account trading.** That said, we allow it for users with **blue flair** or higher.

    When trading for accounts, make sure to gain control of the associated **email account** as well, to prevent password resets later.

***

Hope this helps clear up any confusion you might have.

Happy trading,

I'm about as musically talented as a goat with window-wipers, so I figured I'd offer what I'm good at: web-design.

Some websites I've made:

* http://www.texturepacker.net - My most recent website, I made this over a few days to teach myself jQuery and ajax. This is a pretty quick and rough website but is a good example of the level of quality you should expect.
* http://www.colony-wars.com - My first ever website, made when I was 15, paid for me while I went through college. This demonstrates my ability to manage large volumes and adopt multiple technologies from the ground up.
* http://www.cowdenbeathfc.com - One of the websites I did for a 9 to 5 which happens to look quite nice and has a lot going on including a custom designed e-commerce store and pay-to-enter on-the-fly lottery.
* http://www.attitudeinc.co.uk &amp; http://www.cannabis-seeds-bank.co.uk - Despite having some hosting issues (I parted ways with these guys years ago) the latter is an example of an e-commerce site I developed which was built to handle large volumes of traffic and processed more than £1million worth of trade within several months.

In return for [games on my wishlist](http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/inventory/) I'm offering my skills as a web-designer. Please keep in mind that this usually costs $40 and upwards per hour but since I know that's unrealistic here, since I'm doing absolutely nothing this weekend and since I'm a game addict, I'm willing to do this for whacky unrealistic crazy offers. Be aware though you shouldn't expect a fully fledged web-design run-down with metrics and continual feedback unless you're offering half of the games on Steam. I'm looking for little projects, WordPress or other free platforms which will only take up my time and effort.

I have a continually paid deal with http://www.justhost.com which offers ""unlimited"" traffic, unlimited storage space, unlimited database storage and unlimited domains. I'll offer you up to 3 years unlimited hosting depending on your offer, I'll also give you all you need to move elsewhere whenever you like.

1329512984.0,21,self.SteamGameSwap,pudxh,[PSA] Steam trading for games is still very risky. Here's a way to protect yourselves a bit more if you decide to do so. [x/post /r/tf2trade],25,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/pudxh/psa_steam_trading_for_games_is_still_very_risky/,"From /u/rolmos, [/r/tf2trade](/r/tf2trade) mod:

***

&gt;Remember that fraudulent purchases are very common, and that any game you get in a trade may not have been originally purchased by the person trading it to you, but from someone more dishonest. Always ask!
&gt;
&gt;Steam does try to help people that get affected by such game copies:
&gt;
&gt;https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **What if a game I received in a trade is fraudulently purchased?**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If this happens, the account where the fraud took place will be suspended. Your account will not be suspended, however the game you received will be removed from your account. We will restore the items/gifts that were associated with the trade back to you. **If you did not trade any items/gifts for the game directly then we are not able to restore anything to your account.**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm highlighting the last part, since I was a victim that lost games because of this. One copy of Skyrim, for example, was gifted to a friend for his birthday (he obviously didn't give me anything for it). The game was revoked, and Steam couldn't/wouldn't restore anything to *me*.
&gt;
&gt;**********************
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This would have been avoided the following way:
&gt;
&gt;Never trade for a game without giving something back for it. **NEVER**.
&gt;
&gt;* Before gifting the game, give the receiver something of similar value (in my case, a pair of buds and a Bill's would have been enough for Skyrim).
&gt;
&gt;* Trade the copy of the game for the items. 
&gt;
&gt;This way, Steam now has a record of items being exchanged. It sounds unnecessarily tedious, but will help you avoid a headache.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If you are buying games while paying with cash, this is especially important. [**Remember that Steam is against selling Steam gifts for money**](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=549#sellgifts), threatening to even suspend the accounts of those selling games. While they may not enforce this much, if a sold game is revoked, you're basically on your own.
&gt;
&gt;Since all cash sales **should** involve middlemen, you should do something like this:
&gt;
&gt;* The game seller sends the game to the middleman.
&gt;
&gt;* You, as the buyer, give the middleman items or games of the same value of the game to the middleman for the game in the same trade session.
&gt;
&gt;* When the payment is done, and the items are returned to you.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This way, if the game IS revoked, you will get those items you traded with back. If the buyer doesn't have items to trade with, you can work something out with the seller and middleman to protect yourself in a similar way. 
&gt;
&gt;******************************
&gt;
&gt;The best way not to get scammed trading for games is to only buy from trustworthy traders that bought the games themselves.
&gt;
&gt;**TL;DR** Never trade Steam games without having something on the other side of the trade window of the same value, or you won't get anything if it's revoked. Even if it's a gift or a Paypal sale.

1376455064.0,22,self.SteamGameSwap,1kbv7k,[Q] Why is karma relevant for flair?,26,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1kbv7k/q_why_is_karma_relevant_for_flair/,"I apologize in advance if this question's been asked before, but I feel like there's a lot of people in this subreddit who are barred from their flair upgrades because of karma.  

How exactly does it come into play within this subreddit and when applying for flair?   

Personally, I'm more of a lurker in subreddits outside of this one. 95% of all of my posts belong here (an area where karma really doesn't happen).  
I understand that karma signifies that the user is active on reddit, but I feel like it marginalizes lurkers and isn't a number that should relative to trading. For example, an idiotic post on /r/circlejerk can reap thousands of karma, yet thought out and rational responses on a less popular subreddit can reap 10 upvotes, at best. I'd much rather trade with the person that didn't post on /r/circlejerk, but if a karma requirement barred the rational person from trading Paypal, for example, I wouldn't have the option. Yes, the trade is still getting done (in this example, at least), but the point still stands.  
I think the karma requirement shouldn't be in place for flair.
I can understand account age, because an account that is freshly made definitely could raise red flags, but I just don't see how posting outside of this subreddit is relevant for trading.  

So I guess that's it. Just curious.
  

Ninja Edit: This isn't due to me being barred from red flair. With blue I have full trading capabilities, so red isn't necessary. I'm thinking more toward those with gray and barred from blue.

- clean steamrep profile

- at least 1 year steam &amp; Reddit account age


We can be flexible with some of this if you're still interested.

---------------------

Responsibilities include:

- Flair. This is the most important issue that we can't keep up with. It's a simple verification process that can get monotonous. For the first 30 days it's all you'll even be able to do during your probation/trial period as a mod.

- A decent chunk of daily time. It adds up fast how much time you'll invest in the process.

- Good judgement. Keep in mind, we're not internet police. Zealousness toward bans isn't something we need right now. This won't come into effect until after the trial time is up.

------------------

If you're interested post:

1. Why you want to become a mod.

2. Your time-zone

Those of us that are around will be talking with you on steam

Remember this is just a beta, and it will end soon.

It doesn't seem right to charge someone for a beta that will end soon, so... I just want a funny joke about nuns or elephants, the best one wins.
I'll be back in a couple of hours to give the beta away :D.

P.S. I'll give it just to someone who wants to try the game, not resellers please...

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: How much for Don't Starve?**

A: I cant offer a sweet price for this game, im sorry


**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

Make a throwaway if you're concerned about the karma.**

Great week, everyone!  Only one scam PSA (that I saw - and doesn't include whatever messages the mods got) by someone who knew to check SR first and not trade with that person!

First, I'd like to ask everybody here to subscribe to /r/badkarma and check fishy reddit names against what is stored there.  Additionally, use - basically - the same format you do when reporting to SR if you need to report a reddit user to that sub.  That way, when we use [the quick search links from a user's SR page](http://i.imgur.com/30DlyS3.png), we can find their Steam ID associated with the reddit account.

Second, /r/tf2trade and /r/tf2 have had a few reports of some old phishing attempts lately - particularly on Outpost.  Some asshat will say some shit like ""I caught you!  Your hat is scammed!"" and then post a link to a hijacking site.  Please pay attention to what you're logging into.  There's only one [web-based Steam site, and it has credentials!](http://i.imgur.com/IguwOA3.png)  (No, I don't crop.  *Bro.*)

Finally - /r/badkarma.  Seriously.  The PSA yesterday (?  shitty memory...) stated that the scammer was likely lurking reddit to pick victims.  If someone adds you out of the blue, and their SR checks out, but they still seem fishy - ask them to PM you here on reddit.  Then run their name through a /r/badkarma search.  If you have the same trades posted on other sites, then this won't work as well, so **always use your best judgement.**

Any questions directed at anyone who feels like answering are welcome, and I'd encourage anyone to add/clarify/fix anything I've said here.

In event of a tie, whoever post first will win.  I will choose the winner by January 1, 2013 at 10:oo PM EST unless it is guessed before then.  I will send the key via message through Reddit.

Oh, and Happy New Year!


**Regulations:**

-Your account must be at least 1 month old.

-You can only guess once.

-You cannot already have Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne in your game library.

-You will need to use the steam code shortly after receiving.



**Update 12-31-12 at 1:35 PM EST**
Still no one has guessed the number, but there is one very close guess.  I will leave this open until January 1, 2013 at 10:00 PM unless someone guesses the exact number.

## Da Rulez:

1. People who **want** Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who **have** Dota 2 and want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment.
3. The post-closing function won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

## **If you have Dota 2, don't post a new comment. Only reply to other people's offers.**

Remember that our normal rules still apply:

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:
    * Gray to send non-Steam-Trading codes.
    * Blue **on both sides** for Paypal!

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

From my PSA few days ago.
http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1fc6se/psa_unofficial_feedback_thread_poll_inside_info/  
  
I've got 117 participants, but SurveyMonkey was being a dick and only let me view 100 answer unless I pay for premium. But most answer ends up in one choice, so I don't think that 17 votes will change the outcome.  
  
I'll answer all questions/feedback later(any mod feel free to respond in these questions if needed). Keep in mind this is not official /r/SGS survey.  
  
**WARNING : Wall of Text. ** 
  
Here is the results.  
  
**Q1. Do you think grey flair is really needed for keys/code trade?**  
  
[Click](http://i.imgur.com/LaOviHe.png)  
  
Comments from peoples who chose ""Other"":  
  
1. Everyone should be able to trade key codes but 1 person must be grey and the non-flair goes first.  
  
2. Blue flair. It is easy enough for a scammer to get the 3 trades. If we can get them to have 5 + trades before trading keys or codes, it makes them less apt to scam since they already have a considerable investment. I understand this won't eliminate all, but merely an additional precaution.  
  
3. Either flair or established Reddit and Steam accounts should be sufficient. If you don't have no confirmed flair, but have a 1000 karma, 1 year old Reddit account and a 5 year, 300 game Steam account then keys should be allowed. My vote would be 30-60 days, 100+ karma Reddit Account and 50-100 games Steam Account, OR confirmed grey flair.  
  
4. Move it up to blue.  
  
5. I think you should have at least a blue fair to trade keys/codes  
  
6. Let the user take the risk  
  
7. Should be based on steam account mainly (perhaps a game minimum limit such as 200+ wityh 1-2 years)  
  
8. People should be allowed to trade keys if they're A) Redditor for a few months or B) can provide proof that they own the key.  
  
9. I think anyone should be allowed to trade as long as their steam account is linked (which is required now anyway). However, a lot of people with keys still expect you to go first even if you're trading steam items.  
  
10. Both grey flair + 30-60 days for codes.  
  
11. Make it blue flair for keys/code.  
  
12. The account should have to be 30-60, with at least one known trade
  
**Q2. Do you think blue flair for both party is really needed for paypal trade?**

Comments from peoples who chose ""Other"":  
  
1. Make it only for buyer due to they can reclaim their money due to getting bank to cancel. Lower flair goes first.  
  
2. I think people can decide what they're trafding for. But I think you guys must courage people with higher trades to not go first.  
  
3. Same as above, established Steam and Reddit accounts OR flair.  
  
4. Upgrade it to minimum red only. This will cut down on a lot of newbie paypal only posts and clean the sub up.  
  
5. It should be used as a recommended guideline but not enforced.  
  
6. Only active reddit accounts in good standing should be allowed to sell via Paypal. Anyone should be able to buy using Paypal.  
  
7. Should be based on steam account mainly (perhaps a game minimum limit such as 200+ with 1-2 years)  
  
8. red flair should be required for the seller only  
  
9. It should be required by the seller only but to become a seller should be made much more difficult as to avoid scammers. maybe make paypal sellers require 20 confirmed trades  
  
10. The 3rd option, but the person who is paying paypal should go first, and receiving should go second  
  
11. No. Flair basically makes it so people with less common sense have a baseline to judge their trading partner. It's also quite inhibiting to those who either don't care about flair or have rep somewhere else. Make it a suggestion, not a rule.  
  
**Q3. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being bad and 5 being good. What score will you give /r/SGS compared to other trading community?**  

[Click](http://i.imgur.com/gEByfcs.png)  
  
Comments:  
  
1. It's a nice alternative, but I hate it when people downvote your thread just because you declined their (often ripoff) offer. I guess it's an issue if you sort by New, though.  
  
2. Because your /r/SGS is allways flooded with some [PSA] shit, and many people comment on each other trade and talking bullshit while they have no clue about trading. And when i see Scammer PSA it makes me puke.  
  
3. Would be 5 if there wasn't so much backseat trading. Too many people try to enforce their idea of what a game is worth on other people.  
  
4. I really like it. Though I've made some paypal trades without having blue flair and wish I was able to increase my flair through these successful transactions.  
  
5. Compared to other trading communities, I don't think that there are as many options,  
  
6. I came from SourceOP, and this place is a thousand times better. Thanks!  
  
7. Better than most, the lack of scammers is a big plus. Inability to trade certain things is the only bad thing.  
  
8. SGS used to be the best trading community, but as it has grown over the past six to eight months there has been a large influx in new users, resulting in more low quality offers, sharking, bundle key spam, and similar posts that have brought down the quality substantially. Without more active moderation and a deeper line in the sand against the lower quality aspects of trading, it will soon devolve into the same state as every other, once nice, trading forum. New users should be welcomed and helped fit into the community, but a free for all community will be taken over by the more aggressive and pervasive trading members will drive the rest away, as has been done in many other places.  
  
9. The mods are working hard and doing the best they can, the community is pretty selfish IMO.  
  
10. I have been a Reddit lurker for many years, and only recently made an account a year ago or so. I just learned of this subreddit today and it's amazing how well organized you all are here. I made my first transaction today and I felt pretty safe (I mean, let's be honest, I felt as safe as you can feel when trading online) and I instantly subscribed to the subreddit and am sharing it with all of my friends and my gaming community members. Thanks for putting in time, all of you, to make this place worth something!  
  
11. Very outdated and clunky. Having to manually find your trade comments and request flair is annoying. High flair users may have an unfair advantage over lower flair users since the trade count is displayed during interaction. Maybe there could be a ""in good standing"" status after 3-5 trades which is displayed instead of flair. Users could then optionally view the user's trade count/flair by clicking their flair  
  
12. You guys are doing a great job. A lot of users here add a sense of urgency because of a great deal they can't grab up, etc. They feel entitled to a lot, and you already do a great job being as active as you are.  
  
13. Rules are a little strict at the moment, so if someone doesn't have a tradeable game, it's hard to get a flair. Otherwise, very good community with active mods and friendly/informative members.  
  
14. I have used Steamtrades and TF2 Outpost in the past but SGS is my favourite. I feel it has a good atmosphere and the mods do a really good job!H However, it saddens me to see that people get scammed in SGS too. I haven't been scammed once since I joined :/ I also hope it doesn't get filled up with parasites like Steamtrades.  
  
15. I have little experience with other trading communities, however I find /r/SGS very easy to understand and use.  
  
16. It's not invulnerable to scammers.  
  
17. information is overwhelming for new traders - rules arent clear  
  
18. I dont use the other ones :P  
  
**Q4. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being bad and 5 being good. Do you feel we've done well moderating this subreddit?**  
  
[Click](http://i.imgur.com/OBQ5Yj6.png)  
  
Comments:  
  
1. 8 Pages behind, so you are not that good.  
  
2. Normally great, but too many PSAs allowed and not enough guidance on what is permitted and what is not permitted generally.  
  
3. mods are active, and helpful. keep up the good work.  
  
4. Moderation is perfect, but you should get a few mods dedicated to flair requests, or maybe there's a bot of some kind that could handle them.  
  
5. As the user base has grown, the lack of moderation has started to really become evident. Even with the latest few being added, there is still a visible need for help. What is done is appreciated, but if current mods can not, or do not have the time to sufficiently moderate the community properly then perhaps it is worth adding more to the list, or if Reddit allows it at least some lower level Janitors to help keep the posts in line.  
  
6. Keep it up. You should get rewarded for your efforts.  
  
7. Too strict.  
  
8. I think the moderators do a fine job, but you could use a few more.  
  
9. There is a lot of demand and mod-mail and as far as I am concerned, you guys are doing as good, even better than should be expected.  
  
10. Thanks for keeping SGS a safe community for trading!  
  
11. The mods do a really good job enforcing the rules and educating the new guys. However, I feel they could be a bit nicer to people who make small mistakes but harsher to the Dota2 sharks. After all they know what they are doing and they get away with it because they ""didn't know"" that it was worthless.  
  
12. You have done exceptionally well with warning others of bad traders and scammers.  
  
13. Half the day is moderated for me so there ok, lots of different moderator ranks seem silly 50+, 50+ with mod and mod might be confusing to newer members  
  
14. Flair assignment has gotten quicker since new mods were added, but it's primarily the older mods I see taking care of threads/comments that break the rules (not that that's a bad thing, just an observation). However, there seems to be massive disagreement and/or confusion about what the actual rules of the subreddit are among the mods, especially the newer mods. I have seen one mod basically make up rules on more than one occasion.  
  
15. Many of the mods are either completely inactive or have a history of idiotic behavior.  
  
16. Don't just remove threads/comments that are breaking the rules, but always give a clear explanation of your reasons.  
  
17. Keep up the good work.  
  
18. I still feel like more mods are needed. This is a huge subreddit that has very heavy regulation requirements. There are long periods of time where no mods are around or available  
  
19. The moderators are very good :)  
  
20. Mods are great/friendly but far more are needed  
  
**Q5. What should we (mods) do to improve /r/SGS? (Optional)**  
  
1. Get more mods to assign flairs, create new [DEAL] [GUIDE] and redefine usage of PSA.

2. Possibly have a list of (current?) scammers for the newcomers, as it seems they are the ones getting scammed.
  
3. -
  
1. As I have seen many trades are related to Dota 2 / TF2 Keys, please include the lowest price for them, or at least where to find the cheap price. The prices vary a bit. In steam store they are $2.5 but in trading it is considered as $1.6- $1.7
  
1. nothing, just get flairs to people, rest is easy.
  
1. It's great! Nothing right now. Thanks for this awesome community!
  
1. Stop acting like nazi's.
  
1. Don't now how you would do it or if there is a guide already; but helping people identify an impersonator or a well known trader. Also, maybe a way(s) to prevent being impersonated. Seems like that has been happening alot latley
  
1. give out more free stuff and eat some more babies
  
1. Keep on doin what you're doing.
  
1. No much, thanks for the great job you all do already! :)
  
1. I think it's fine how it is.
  
1. Need more mods for when help is needed. It's too often that illegal stuff goes through because no mod was online
  
1. It's hard for starters to begin trading when the mods close your thread very quickly.
  
1. Different colored PSA tags.
  
1. More mods for flair.
  
1. Flair requests are a bottleneck. Find out a way to automate them. Russian traders are also somewhat sparse.
  
1. Sign on a few more mods or janitors to clean up indie key offers.
  
1. Crack down on newbie users. They're the worst.
  
1. Prevent scammers from being able to PM
  
1. Notihng, you guys rock!
  
1. you are doing a great job!
  
1. Allow bundle key trading, disallow all account trading.
  
1. Fix steambot so you can unlink accounts. I accidentally linked an alt reddit account and not my main with 5+ trade flair.
  
1. Perhaps select new moderators who have more free time.
  
1. mods that care about updating flair in a timely fashion
  
1. CSS Upgrades. Make it super slick.
  
1. Remind people that you mod for free, and this is not your main job.
  
1. Create more ""state of subreddit"" discussion posts (perhaps once a month) to get community thoughts.
  
1. I don't think you should do anything really. You moderate the subreddit for free and I think you do a very good job considering the circumstances. I am also happy that I have been seeing a few ""potential scammer"" PSA's. This to me is a lot better than ""I just got scammed by..."" PSA's. It's nice to see everyone looking out for each other.
  
1. More staff to moderate/flair requests (mornings uk time seems to be no one moderating posts) Weekly events with the community couldn't hurt
  
1. Cut down on the number of PSAs. Seems to be an *awful* lot of them.
  
1. Flair doesn't make any sense except to maybe protect users against themselves. It works in the physical trading subreddits since somebody always has to go first, but none of the other Steam trading subreddits use since nearly all trades are through the trading window. The FAQ says it's about notoriety but some of the mods keep saying it's reputation.
  
1. Color coding for announcements!
  
1. make an auto bot for flair requests
  
1. Get more/better mods
  
1. Steam game swap should be for any steam games/keys indie games included. Call it AAA game swap or something if you arent allowed to trade steam keys regardless of the game type
  
1. Automate Flair and recruit more mods.
  
1. You are doing a great job!
  
1. The faq and the rules are in dire need of a revision. The number of mods doesn't nearly reflect the actual number of active mods. Retire those who haven't been active in a long while.
  
1. If the flair system is to be used, more mods should be taken on to make sure that user flair is indeed up to date. otherwise a stellar job.
  
1. Force people signing up with the SteamBot to read some vital rules for the subreddit. Perhaps show each key rule a screen at a time with a timer on the ""next"" button to make sure they are actually reading and acknowledging the rules.
  
1. I can't think of anything other than just being able to go through flair requests faster. I've already got purple flair so I'm not complaining, but I'm sure you're aware that there are many concerned traders out there patiently waiting.
  
1. Reorganize the sidebar and wikis, the information is everywhere and overwhelming. it needs to be cleaned up.  
do more to eliminate rude traders and trolls  
not allow people to game the system for karma  
be more clear about what constitutes a trade and put it on the rule list  
maybe make specific psa for scammers and must have mod approval to post as to not slander innocent traders  
make middlemen more available somehow since mods arent around all the time  
add higher tiers of flair beyond 50 trades  
crack down in illegitimate trades in the confirmed trades
  
1. make the flair system easier (if possible)
  
1. Endorse common sense. Endorse reading guides and tips. Do it more openly and more often. It's really too bad you can't make people pass an entrance exam.
  
1. Make the rules more apparent to new users.
  
1. More mods, effective way of sorting trades/psa/giveaways  
  
**Q6. Aside from waiting for flair upgrade(I know it sucks you have to wait that long to get a flair upgrade), what is the shittiest situation you've ever been on /r/SGS? i.e : Getting scammed, mod abuse, etc. (Optional)**  
  
1. People basically treating you like you don't know anything when you have low flair, despite high rep on other trading sites.
  
1. Only people treating it like a heavy job - my experience has been very positive
  
1. -
  
1. Nothing yet. SGS rocks. Even I got my flair on the same day I sent the message. So no complain :D
  
1. Fucking downvotes from random retarded people and retarded comments on my trade topics. How i should do some deal because its good. And all sort of random shits that happens on reddit as allways.
  
1. I'd be proud to say that I am very satisfied and happy with r/SGS's performance so far :) Thanks again!
  
1. I made a successful trade (All I had to trade were keys, but I informed the other party and they were okay with it). I sent my key to them, and then they replied with theirs. Submitted a flair requested, confirmed the trade, everything. NOPE NO FLAIR FOR YOU BCUZ U TRADED KEY UR 1ST TIME. I don't understand how trading a key, and having it confirmed is any different than another trade. They both serve the same purpose. I verified I wasn't an asshole.
  
1. Nothing really to write about. Occasionally that rude person.
  
1. someone didn't agree with my opinion and i was sad
  
1. Never had an issue, but i use common sense, so bad situations are generally easily avoidable.
  
1. When I first joined I remember times I got taken advantage of due to my limited knowledge on how /r/sgs actually worked
  
1. Too many scammers.
  
1. Mod was being very rude. I don't mind too much, but it got on my nerves.
  
1. Nothing. :) You guys do a great job!
  
1. Scammed by multiple people and not having allowed to do much about it (except warn others and putting on steamrep.)
  
1. Shittiest was being called a scammer, when it was the other guy's fault for not reading well. I told him my code was for Uplay, and he called me a scammer because it didn't work on Steam. But things got worked out, and everything's better now.
  
1. Scammed early on, I learned fast though.
  
1. getting sharked many times (my fault I was ignorant about games values)
  
1. Notihng, you guys rock!
  
1. the worst that is happened to me, is having people randomly add me to try and scam. People that havn't evn posted on my trade post.
  
1. Non-mods telling me I'm breaking a rule.
  
1. My first two trade encounter on SGS were scammers. They nearly convinced me out of my games but luckily I backed out in the end. ( They were later confirmed scammers )
  
1. Loosing 100+ karma in a single trade thread, because a user disagreed on a price.
  
1. No complaints really but SGS is far from my primary trading community.
  
1. I havent been scammed on here, but ive noticed there are serial deleters who try to get around the 24 rule.
  
1. No complaints, just some shitty lowball traders. /u/sesshythepopo I'm looking at you
  
1. Nothing... yet!
  
1. I am happy to say that I have never been in a bad situation. Everyone I have traded with has been really nice and trades have been very easy for me, even when trading keys! Maybe I am lucky but I do background checks before I trade with someone and this has kept me safe so far!
  
1. Every situation I have had on this subreddit has left me satisfied.
  
1. 24 hour waiting for posting even 22 or so where you have some flex between times would be great
  
1. Arbitrarily deciding that certain things don't count for flair
  
1. Great experiences so far. Love you guys.
  
1. people ruining other peoples trades with price-checks and too many scammers
  
1. I've had no troubles with it so far.
  
1. Mostly it was brought upon myself by my own ignorance, but there was a time when I was trying to get a game, and I forgot to specify that the game was region-blocked in my area, which led to a number of people berating me for my short temper when I reacted violently to other people pointing out that I could've bought it myself. Like I said, I basically deserved the backlash for being an idiot, but that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me in /r/SGS
  
1. I was downvote bombed on all of my posts from a guy for letting people in his thread know how to get the deal he was getting (cheaper wallet funds)
  
1. I think the scammer PSA rules need a closer look. I see some people really going off on something really small and labeling someone as a scammer and posting about it.
  
1. none
  
1. Missing out on the TF2 key for Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon trades :P
  
1. Haven't really run into any problems other than the tempers of other redditors.
  
1. people being rude and talking bad about other traders without provocation -
  
1. getting a trade and figuring out it was extremely lowballed and I got ripped off... (but never scammed)
  
1. Never been in one, great community
  
1. Some idiot pretending I scammed him, and for a while people not believing me that I didn't do it.

It used to come up every now and then, but the community seems to be polarized about certain types of PSAs.. and it made me curious about how the community feels about them.

In the first part, I'm going to approach the topic from a very general point of view, to get to know how the community feels about PSAs in general. Then, depending on the results, I'm planning on posting a second survey, in which we'll get into the details.

It's not an official survey by any means, but I was hoping you guys will share your opinion about the subject from which we can learn how the majority feels about Public Service Announcements in /r/sgs.

Here are 
screenshots of their profiles showing they are mutual friends. [Kenji's](http://i.imgur.com/FohIXOl.png) shows 1 common friend and [Dustys](http://i.imgur.com/HSjffEU.png) has Kenji listed in friends tab. 

When I messaged both of them they both started off the conversation the same exact way which is what first caught my attention. They were both offering 3 Arma Alpha Lite KEYS and wanted a tradable game in return. Kenji specifically asked for Sanctum and I think at one point Mass Effect. Both of them also refused to comment on the reddit trade thread I made earlier which was another red flag. After playing along for a while I eventually accused Kenji of trying to scam and he said he wasn't then he left the conversation. I told Dusty both him and Kenji were coming off as scammers and he never replied. I'm not sure if they just didn't understand the value of arma alpha lite but they were both behaving suspiciously.

Each person received 3x Arma III Alpha Lite.

In this thread I am going to explain what they are and what you get from having one. Basically its just a watered down version of the Alpha in its current stage and you do NOT get the full game.

Here is a screenshot directly from the Arma 3 website that shows what you get.

Here is a direct link to the page that shows what you get with each version too: http://www.arma3.com/buy

A few key points about the Lite:

* It does not contain Multiplayer!

* It does not give you the Beta or Full game!

* You do not have access to the Modding features.

* You have a limited version of the editor.

* It lasts between 14 March - 18 June.

* You receive another alpha lite key for you to then pass on. (Chain Effect)



I hope this thread has helped clear things up for people and now you know if you engage in a trade for one you know what you are receiving.

Remember that our normal rules still apply:

Another note:

This thread is sorted by ""old"" by default.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

Why do people downvote trade offers?

[Only downvote if it's spam or off-topic.](http://i.imgur.com/VMOsrjj.png)

Some redditors in /r/SGS fail to understand the concept of downvoting. I've seen random trade offers get downvoted if it wasn't the best offer in the world, if anything it's the last thing we need in this sub-community. I checked up on my thread and somebody downvoted the comments people left me in my thread. Most of us don't care about the whole comment karma deal, but I've seen the downvoted comments at the bottom of my post, sometimes I miss it.

I want people to feel confident in making offers (as long as it's not Dota 2), because there is an announcement above that reads:

&gt;Get/give Dota 2

But I've seen games with values being offered getting downvoted. Might not be equivalent trade market value, but it is not up to you to decide. Don't downvote other people's offers; it makes no sense when they're not even in your thread.

What is the point in doing this? Can you guys not read the downvote warning when you hover over the down arrow?

If urgent, personally PM me or another mod.",19,0,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/15tcsw/announcement_please_dont_make_psas_unless_you_are/,"**Edit**: Title is somewhat poorly worded. I mean don't make PSAs about another user unless they scammed you. PSAs on other topics are also still fine.

Hi all.

So we just had a bit of an ugly incident. A user was the subject of a PSA accusing him of scamming. He did some things that made him appear suspicious, but with minimal verification I am prepared to say that he was falsely accused.

The user had created a new Reddit and Steam account to do a giveaway, causing suspicion. However, after messaging him, he verified his primary Reddit account with me, including links to past giveaways on /r/PlayItForward, and I was able to locate his pending flair request (which is the reason he had confirmed trades but no flair). The request was about 3 days old, and near the top of the backlog queue to be dealt with. This stuff was all easily verified and the user cooperated with me.

Point is this: PSAs are okay to warn people about actual confirmed scammers. I don't mind the PSAs, though I'm sure others may find them annoying. But if it's just someone you're suspicious of, this is _not_ an appropriate use of a PSA. Message the moderators or contact me personally via PM to look into someone.

That said, I can't say I blame the community for reacting with suspicion. We've had scammers attempt an awful lot of different techniques. So if you want to go and do something like a big giveaway using a new Reddit/Steam account, this is _exactly_ the type of thing you should seek moderator approval for first. Because it looks extremely suspicious even if it's innocuous.

Things took a sour turn when someone posted his Google account info, which appears to have contained the user's real name. This is treading the edge of doxing, and extremely inappropriate to post publicly. It just adds to the witchhunt mentality.

Everybody screwed up here in some way -- moderators don't process flair quickly enough, a user creating a brand new accounts to do a giveaway looks suspicious, posting PSAs for unconfirmed suspicions can lead to pitchfork reactions from the rest of the users, and posting anyone's personal info of any kind is straight out of bounds.

Your vigilance and protectiveness of the community is much appreciated, as is the generosity of anyone seeking to do a giveaway here. But let's try to prevent ugly incidents like this from happening again.",,False,,t5_2skv6,1357111571.0,,mod-rikker,True,t3_15tcsw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/15tcsw/announcement_please_dont_make_psas_unless_you_are/,moderator

Fast forward a few hours later, I find myself being harassed about those sweeteners on the basis of the partial bundle trades rule.

I'm seeing a lot of confusion from people who expect their flair to show up after they confirm their trade. (/r/gameswap users - this is what you're used to.) That's not the case here - there's still one more step.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Click [**this link**](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade) to open the flair application form.
2. Look up your **steamID64** on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com), and paste it into the form
3. Paste the **permalink** to your confirmation post into the form.
4. Click **Send.**

Once the mods process your application, you'll receive your flair. Please be patient - this is a completely manual process for us, so it takes us some time to do.

Happy trading!

1. **No partial bundles, opened bundles, or Steam keys from bundles.**

    You must trade _the entire bundle,_ as a gift URL. You can't trade individual keys from your bundle, or give people a URL that you've already used.

    This means **no Bastion keys,** or any other keys of the sort found in bundles.

2. **Thou shalt have flair to trade Humble Bundles.**

    Remember point #1? How you needed to trade an entire gift URL? That URL is considered a ""key or code"" (because it can't be traded through Steam Trading).

    Therefore, you must have _at least gray flair_ to trade Humble Bundles.

**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

There's the person's permanent profile. This guy is a POSSIBLE scammer, I am not 100% sure he was trying to scam me but it seems very likely. Here's the chat log image:

http://i.imgur.com/PUD30RZ.png

I blacked out his e-mail because I don't think I can share personal info on here.

So here's what happened: I had a spare copy of Witcher 2 that I wanted to do for 5$ Paypal. He said he would do it, and pay all the fees, etc. but I should send him a paypal invoice first because ""It makes it easier on him."" I didn't see the harm in sending him a paypal invoice, so I did so. However, as soon as I mentioned I wanted him to fill the invoice he unfriended me. So while I am not 100% sure what happened, I think I can guess:

1) He wanted me to feel like because I sent him an invoice he had to pay it, so that I would send him my game then he wouldn't pay the invoice and have the game for free

OR 

2) He wanted the personal details (Contact Info, Address, etc.) that comes with the Paypal Invoice AUTOMATICALLY when you send it. Thankfully I saw this before I sent the invoice and edited the invoice so it showed none of this information.

Thankfully I was not scammed this time, but here's a warning to everyone about this guy and how people can use Paypal Invoices to (maybe) scam you.

Got a few complaints/PMs last time about how I should open this up for people who want to re-trade, so I'll concede.

As last time, you can trade for any two games of your choosing, and more after 24 hours if you'd like. This is to spread the games around, rather than having one or two people clear me out.

Again, I'm looking for [Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key), and/or [Treasure Keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key). Refined Metal/trading cards for games I paid less than one key's worth for. If you'd like to pay completely in ref, six ref=one key. And please don't try to trade me five of the same card; try to mix up which cards you give me, and which games the cards come from. ^(Thanks!)

If you have another offer, I'll gladly listen, but likely decline. I'm more interested in getting back my spent keys for the imminent summer sales (which hopefully starts this Thursday!).

Drunken F00l  	 12 hours ago

Changes to maximum listing price and fees
We've changed the maximum wallet balance and also changed the maximum listing price. The maximum wallet balance is now $500 (or 320 GBP, 380 Euros, 15,500 Rubles, 1000 Brazilian Reals), but the maximum listing price is 80% of the max wallet balance ( $400 -- twice what it was before). We've set the maximum wallet balance greater than the maximum listing price to help ensure people can purchase all listings regardless of currency.

We've also had to make a change to the way the fees work to better account for the two different fees. Before, we applied a single 15% fee, rounded down (with a minimum of $0.01) and split it so that 1/3 was for the Steam fee and 2/3 for the game fee. Now, we apply the fees completely separately, each rounded down with a minimum of $0.01. Yes, this means the minimum purchase price of an item increased to $0.03 (from $0.02), but this also means a lot of items are actually cheaper since each fee is rounded down separately. We've got some ideas about how we can let people sell entire stacks of items at a time which will help make the fee a smaller percentage of the entire cost of cheap items.

What should you do? I mean I don't think it's fair for person C to have to pay but neither is it fair for person D to have to pay. Obviously the scammer/buyer is not going to do anything about it.

Obviously contacting steam support is the way to go, but would person C lose the item he traded for the revoked gift? Or anyone in the chain?

2. If you do not have flair on this subreddit (the little colored Steam icon next to users' names), you are only permitted to offer Steam Tradable goods (anything that is in your inventory -- gifts, in-game items, coupons).

3. Metro 2033 is being [given away FREE](https://www.facebook.com/NVIDIAGeForce/app_424559564282066). I will probably just delete any threads offering only Metro 2033.

Finally go to the Death Rally product page at http://store.steampowered.com/app/108700/ and you’ll be able to purchase the game with a 90% discount.

Be quick to claim your code before they run out! The offer ends December 31st 2012.

~~EDIT: theres a minor bug if you have a -15 off discount , the coupon shows up as N/A and doesnt lower the price , this is due to owning Alan wake, which discounts death rally to -15 off and steam probably doesnt want it to stack. will update the post when its fixed~~

Read on only if you want to see how much of a putz I am. D:

*Note: Someone [asked if the mods could do this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ou4xm/announcement_suggestions_thread_post_any/c416mhs) in the Suggestions thread, and blueshiftlabs mentioned that they were working on a solution for this. It'd be nice to have a script that _only_ worked on /r/sgs and was thus considered safe for everyone to use; unfortunately, I'm a bit impatient.* :)

Have you ever tried to go to a user's Steam profile using the link in their flair, but every time you try and select the URL, you [swerve off-target and end up selecting a good chunk of the top of the page instead](http://i.imgur.com/kDmn6.png)?

**addendum:** Firefox users have the privilege of being able to simply triple-click on the profile URL to highlight the link, then either middle-click to open in new tab or right-click and select the option to open. Perfectly good suggestion, props to [Bgro](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wt4nv/psa_are_the_flair_links_to_steam_profiles/c5g7hwg) for reminding me. But, let's say you want to save some clicks in the long run.

I did it about twenty times tonight and, finally, I'd had enough. There had to be an easier way to use these links. And now, [there is](http://i.imgur.com/GjMi9.png)!

---

**addendum x2:** I feel like an idiot.

I thought I'd searched to see if anyone had posted this before, but evidently I missed ThisRandomRedditor's post with a [superior, custom-tailored script](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/vwh80/psa_steamgameswap_flair_linker_automatic_links/) that was taken from /r/tf2trade and customized to work on /r/sgs.

I'm keeping the rest of this up as a monument to my shame, and also because they are still handy scripts to have elsewhere on the web. But, I urge you to [go see](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/vwh80/psa_steamgameswap_flair_linker_automatic_links/) what he ~~came up with~~ tweaked for us, the clever ba- guy.

WHY DIDN'T I SEE THAT POST? ::weeps::

---
First, based on what browser you're using, download one of the following options.

**I shouldn't have to say this, but you install these scripts and extensions _at your own risk_. I take no responsibility for any exploding computers or other mishaps that might occur through the use of these solutions. They work for me and plenty of others, though. Discretion is always advised.**

* If you use Chrome or Opera (which supports Greasemonkey scripts natively) or have Greasemonkey installed, there's [Linkify Plus](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1352), which works on sites that are Javascript-enabled, and will work on all kinds of links (HTTP/S, mailto, etc). 
    * If you block Javascript on reddit, you can also try [Linkify ting](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/2254). It doesn't use Javascript, but it also doesn't work on links other than HTTP. Good enough for our purposes.
* If you just want an extension, Firefox users can use [Linkification](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkification/).
* Likewise, Chrome users can use [Clickable Links](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mblbciejcodpealifnhfjbdlkedplodp).
    * I prefer the Greasemonkey scripts, though, for they are a bit lighter.

---

Next, install your selected script or extension.

* Chrome users will be prompted to install the scripts or Clickable Links as soon as it's finished downloading. It'll ask for access to all websites; realize that it needs this access to be able to see the HTML code on the page and search for text strings that look like URLs.
* Firefox users using Greasemonkey should follow the normal instructions to install the scripts. If you install the extension, it will install as soon as it's finished downloading as well.
* Opera users... are on their own; sorry, not an Opera fan. :p The Greasemonkey scripts should work just fine for you, though, as long as you figure out how to install them.
* IE/Safari users should've gotten the hint earlier that I have no idea what options are available for you, seeing as how I didn't offer any download suggestions for you. :) Go looking and report back here if you find something usable. I might even reward you for your service. :)

---

Once you've installed either of the scripts or one of the extensions, refresh your page. (Firefox users may need to restart their browser.)

For those who want to see what these extensions and scripts do, [here's](http://imgur.com/a/ivoXl) some screenshots I took both without and with Linkify Plus installed.

All flair links should now be clickable; no more dragging to highlight, no more right-clicking and selecting 'Go to URL'. It's that easy!

**edit:** Added some images to depict what happens when you have these extensions installed; check 'em [here](http://imgur.com/a/ivoXl). Also, this isn't a new thing to me, but I'd forgotten about it for some time and just realized that, hey, maybe there's an easier way to do this. :) I thought I'd share.

**edit x2:** Added the addendum above regarding triple-clicking in Firefox. Too bad I'm a Chrome user.

Just ask the price for any game and i'll see what i can do.

**Please read the FAQ at the end of this post, its good for you**

!All games are tradable gifts!

**Announcement: As you may know, I've been haunted by transaction error for last days, it appears if you buy a lot of games in a short period of time. That's why i'll do only 6 transactions per hour (every 10 minutes) to avoid this error. What does it mean to you?

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games (TF2 or DOTA2), if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

~~2) Reddit account must be older than 3 months.~~

~~4) No begging. This is a very important rule that I forgot to add initially.~~

~~If you meet the above qualifications, here's what you need to do to win: Give me a link to a funny bit from a standup comedian. Whoever provides the clip that is my favorite/makes me laugh the hardest wins.~~

~~I will stop accepting entries at 1:00 PM Mountain time today, July 16, and I will announce the winner sometime before 5:00 PM Mountain time. Good luck!~~

Please don't downvote other submissions. I'll read them all, and votes mean fuckall to me. If a submission is good enough, then you might instantly win!

We'll probably wrap the whole thing up later tonight (or tomorrow morning depending how drunk I get).

Please only add me for coupons or that arma thing.

ps - list of games may also change depending on my intoxication level. booze and giving shit away makes me feel better.

I reported him on steamrep.com, mentioning it in the trade thread here on Reddit and also reported him from his profile page on Steam. 

SteamRep's staff asked me for more info which I then provided and then others started to chime in saying that they had the same experience... he had been reported before on a forum _5 times_ that I'd missed while Googling his name thoroughly. I lost HitMan: Absolution while trading for a game key. Make sure that you Google search the person's Steam name and read all the entries on the first 2 pages or so at least. I took that forum post and posted it to SteamRep and included it in another in-Steam report of the scam and the scammer's behavior.

Make sure that you report from their Steam profile page _and_ go to SteamRep.com and report them.

Well, a week later and he was flagged on SteamRep.com which is highly visible and everyone _should_ use. Then, a few days after that I checked his account and what do you know, he's banned from Steam entirely, losing all the ill-gotten games. I'm not happy that I won't get my game back, but I'm happy that the 15 year old Australian guy is now banned from that account. Sure, he'll probably create another account but at least he knows he's been kissed and lost _everything_... he had a lot of games on that account, many more than were reported anywhere as being scammed. So, I hope he and his family, by his own actions, lost out on several thousand dollars worth of games.

Reports do work against scammers.

Remember:

A) Google search someone's name. Be thorough, check the first two or more pages and use parentheses around the name. Add in other search terms like Steam and Scam and Scammer to help aid your Search.

B) Report on forums, report on SteamRep.com and report inside Steam. Make sure that it's reported. It will have an affect most likely. Save yourself the trouble, get even and make them lose everything when they cost you a game, games or items. Don't say ""nothing will happen"" and let it go because you can make something happen.

I know this isn't a great post that many of you want to see, but it's important that you're reminded to be diligent and that even after you get screwed over, you can get even and prevent this from happening to others with that account.

~~Anyone trading for a Gamersgate gift-copy, you aren't getting your key anytime soon.~~

~~It also looks like you'll need to create a GamersGate account to claim one. Now is probably a good time to set-up a GG account so it's one less hurdle to deal with when the next eagerly-awaited pricing mistake drops.~~

~~GamersGate [twitter page](https://twitter.com/GamersGate) appeared to be the best place for info regarding the Bethesda keys (which are due mid-Jan) so I'm sure they'll have updates there regarding these keys.~~

**edit**

I didn't claim/reveal my key from the 4-pack, nor gift any of the other 3 and I have received a refund. Same for the Bethesda bundle, I didn't activate any keys and I am receiving a refund. The BL2 Season pass for $7.50, I claimed a key and activated on Steam and that looks there to stay in my account.

So I think if you've claimed a key, you'll get to keep that key and either get 3 more, or get a complete refund. If you haven't claimed any keys, you're getting a refund. If you received a gift and haven't received a key by now, you're not getting one. Anybody that has, is likely to keep it.

Luckily, it's not all bad, we get to keep the Blue Points.

Hey all.

Just a friendly update/reminder thread. I sure hope you're reading this.

***First***:


PLEASE READ THE FAQ. It can be found here: [FaQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/quw61/announcement_faq_is_down_faq_inside/#from-tab)
And please re-read the sidebar again.

***Second***

This is about requesting your flair. When doing it, please click on the ""Request your Flair"" button in the sidebar. When you click on it, read how you get flair. You can click [here](http://x.bluesl.net/FlairUpgrade) to get your flair as well.

**When you request it, please make sure you have a correct steam community link.**

*What you should have:*
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012626666

*What you shouldn't have:* 

http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skasshole

**And, please don't shorten the permalink to the confirmed trade.**

*What you should have:*

*What you shouldn't have:*

It just creates more work for us, and we do get a lot of flair requests a day.

***

***Third***

It's your job to report people who offer something who doesn't have sufficient flair to do so. We can't read everything. If you report something the more likely we can see it and remove it. 

***

***Fourth***

Me and an unnamed moderator have decided to ban trading Minecraft 360 keys/threads/whatevers until further notice.

***Fifth***

Thanks for being a great community and taking the time to read this. We would like to have this reddit be as helpful as possible to everyone, so if you have something to say then please message the mods.

They are in the form of steam keys so no need to be suspicious of steam tradable ones. There are legit ones out there in the form of steamkeys so just be safe and ask for proof.


I've also seen people trying to convince people to register it through some sort of VPN server. DO NOT do it. It is against steam policy and you risk getting your account banned. It is not worth the risk just to play a beta. Chances are the asking price would be a little less if not the same as a regular, just take the time to find a tradable one.


 

On a side note if you do live in South East Asia and want a key just message me. I have one but live in America =\

The old thread hit 500 comments, meaning that new comments were unlikely to load the first time. New posts should go here.

The rules of this thread:

1. People who have Dota 2, post a top-level response (comment box immediately below this post) with the details of what you have and want.
2. People who want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment. **Don't post a new top-level comment unless you have Dota 2.**
3. The post-closing markup won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.**

**Remember that our normal rules still apply:**

1. **Don't hijack other people's trades!**
2. Flair rules still apply:
    * Gray to send non-Steam-Trading codes.
    * Blue **on both sides** for Paypal!

Have fun!

Yesterday I got warned by a mod and accused me of trying to **""game flair system""** by trading *worthless* TF2 items and below average bundles with friends (whom I previously never knew or associated before I traded with them)

The first trade was where I traded a game for $7 worth of TF2 items. I fail to see how can that much amount be deemed as worthless. 

~~For the second trade, I traded $1.4 worth of TF2 metal for Telltale below average bundle. I already had Walking Dead from my last winter sale purchase and it was the only game in above average category so I didn't want BTA bundle as average one would do just fine in my case. Unfortunately I didn't have paypal balance so I couldn't buy it myself so I traded $1.4 worth TF2 metal for a giftable URL. According to rules trading complete gift URL for bundles is allowed so I didn't see anything wrong here.~~

According to a mod, these trades aren't valid trades and they were deleted and *downvoted*

I honestly don't care about flair. For paypal transactions I have my own set of rules which include either atleast 2 year old steam account, SourceOp reputation, having 200+ games/1000+ hours on TF2 whichever applies. I am not going to trust a guy who joined in Jan 2013 and has made 5 trades and go like OMG blue falir lets trade sort of thing.

That being said, I no longer care for my flair or whether it gets upgraded or not. I am not even going to try to upgrade it after this point.

All I want is couple of moderators to answer my question

* Why aren't these said trades considered valid? ~~Trading Fortix for a $0.50 DLC would be considered as a valid trade why wouldn't trading complete URL for below average bundles be considered invalid? And same goes for items.~~ Trading a $1.75 TF2 key for a game is considered valid but trading $7 worth of TF2 items for same game isn't considered valid. Justification please
* And a moderator accused me of trying to 'game flair system' and considers any TF2 items other than currency *worthless*. My trade confirmations were deleted and I was warned and that too before I could say anything otherwise. Is this level of high-handedness and free flowing accusations normal around here?

**EDIT:** I was under impression that below average bundles are allowed given if they are giftable URL. I misread the rules and was pointed out by Heretic.

I know, that the number of participants isn't that high, and the poll was far from perfect, not to mention that anyone could've entered (and some probably did) the survey more than once, but the results clearly showed that the majority of voters find Public Service Announcements helpful to the community.

---

As many of you pointed out, /r/GameDeals definitely deserves a more prominent display.

But how would you feel about more distinguishable PSAs with different colourings? For example, [SCAMMER] for Scam Reports, [DEAL] for discounts, etc. Do you think it's necessary, would it make any difference, or would just *over complicate* things?

I guess all of us find some of the PSAs annoying, useless.. so, share with us why, and how do you think their frequency can be reduced.

1367594775.0,17,self.SteamGameSwap,1dmfza,"[H] Many, many, many Steam tradeable games [W] Your corresponding Steam keys!",22,5,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1dmfza/h_many_many_many_steam_tradeable_games_w_your/,"The [last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/18dris/h_many_steam_tradeable_games_w_your_corresponding/) I did a trade thread like this, it was reasonably well-received, and since then my inventory backlog has balooned quite a bit. So here we go again!

----

I have collected a considerable number of tradeable Steam games that had been on my wishlist or otherwise fit my taste. So to clarify, these are all for my personal use.

To get the most out of them and to help out my fellow traders, I'm offering to swap any of my games to you guys for any corresponding Steam keys you may have, plus a small sweetener. That way I make a little win, and you can convert your obnoxious keys into hassle-free tradeables. :)

So **for example** if you have a *Driver San Francisco* key (e.g. from Amazon), you'd trade that plus something small (see below), in exchange for my Steam tradeable copy of *Driver San Francisco*.

As for **potential sweeteners**, shoot for about 10% to 20% of the game's sales value, depending on circumstances. For small games I may go 1:1 with no sweetener (provided I feel I can trust you), in the middle range I can accept things like *The Ship*, *Toki Tori* or even a couple of *Dota 2* copies, for bigger games I may request a bit of Steam Wallet for a game soundtrack, something small from the *Star Wars* sale or, at the upper end of the scale, a TF2 key. If you can supply more than one game, that'll work in your favor.

----

### Rules

1. You need at least gray flair to offer keys. Please be mindful of the subreddit rules when making your offer.
2. For bigger or riskier deals, I may ask for proof of purchase for your key.
3. Generally I'll expect you to go first, but I can show you that I own the game through the trade window before you send your key.
4. To reiterate, I personally want to keep all these games, so I'm **not interested in free-for-all offers**. See [my last trade thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1d4e3q/h_dont_starve_eufloria_loom_lunar_pack_more/) for stuff that's available for general trading.

In his post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1b9rw2/h_bastion_x5_arma_2_hotline_miami_mw3_the_walking/) he claimed to have Arma 2, Skyrim, AC3, MW3 and others. Eventually he agreed to MW3 for my GTA Complete (too good to be true) but insisted that I go first. I declined and I didn't think he would keep going even after I suggested a middleman, but he went with it. Surprise, surprise the key didn't work. It wasn't just previously used, it was just completely wrong; and only did it not work, he accused me of faking my proof of it not working. In the end I got my game back but he's been the subject of a PSA (a rather weak one though) before [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/z3wqh/psa_scammer_cant_scam/) AND he triggered a lot of red flags during our convo. 

I don't know if he necessarily intended to scam me, but I don't think he would have had any problem running off with my copy of GTA Complete once his key failed to work.

CONFIRMED AS SCAMMER - http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/17cmr9/psa_be_careful_with_traderpete/c84a3u1

So, I don't know if this guy is a scammer, but it raised all red flag.  
1. Brand New account, have 0 games except free weekend Chivalry.  
2. Based on his post, he's been offering games like Far Cry 3, Black Ops 2, etc.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/17cfxi/h_assassins_creed_iii_code_terraria_castle/c8479se  
http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/17chul/h_chivalry_sleeping_dogs_w_offers/c847ubo  
3. His inventory show nothing.  
  
I hope I'm wrong, but unless he can prove his legitimacy, do not go first with this guy. If you need a middleman, ADD ME.  

His reddit account :  
http://www.reddit.com/user/TraderPete  
http://steamcommunity.com/id/TraderPete  
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082429390  

I saw one person giving rep on his profile, so I add him and talk to him. The guy who give rep SteamID :  
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074941570/
  
UPDATE :  
  
Chat Screenshot with guy who gave him rep, I'm positive they are a same person.

http://i.imgur.com/mHAqsml.png  

His Account history :  
http://i.imgur.com/KnMfFPu.png  
You can see it clearly didn't click, because ""TraderPete"" made his account today, and the logs said that the guy who gave him rep(I'll state him as ""Ross"" from now) have new Vegas before Chivalry weekend which is 2 days ago, and it also said that New Vegas is a Gift, not key like ""Ross"" said.  
  
Also, if you look at ""Ross"" game history, he have 18++ hours on New Vegas, it is not possible to play 18++ hours if he just got the game today, unless Steam number is bugged(chance are slim to none).  
http://i.imgur.com/UMoMWr3.png  
  
My Conclusion : TraderPete and Ross is the same person, I hope I'm wrong because Ross keep saying he's not scammer, but I rarely wrong about these kind of thing because his stories doesn't click.  
  
**That being said, TraderPete, feel free to prove the screenshot of your ""STORE TRANSACTION"" here if you are legit.**

&gt;[11:03:35 AM] warheat1990: the shady guy made his account today  
&gt;[11:03:48 AM] warheat1990: if you trade fallout before chivalry weekend which is 2 days ago

This doesn't seem to affect anyone that managed to actually get keys from the purchase, only ones that bought the packs and don't have keys.

As a precaution, we will now be banning the trade of keyless gifts from Gamersgate.  **Please report trades that are trying to trade key-less gifts.**  We don't want a large influx of people who traded for these ""future keys"" getting their GG gifts removed with nothing to show for it.  If you were fortunate enough to actually get keys, you must submit proof of having the key in the trade.  

If you have traded for one of these gifts and have found it to be removed, please contact your original trader first.  Contact us if you are unable to reach a satisfactory agreement, please.  

If anyone gets any official response from GG or can provide additional confirmation about these refunds, please feel free to comment below.  If anything changes about these gifts, we will make another announcement.

See also [Steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/206500/). It will be free-to-play eventually, but you get early access with these invites. It's pretty fun.

I'm not sure how much demand there will be, so I've set out some rules below.

**_The rules:_**

1. You must have flair on this subreddit (1+ completed trades -- [see FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/help/faqs/SteamGameSwap?/button/p/left/c/green/#flair)).
2. You must not have AirMech on your Steam account.

**_How to enter:_**

1. List your favorite film that was released at least 10 years before you were born. ~~Most upvotes gets first dibs.~~ **Edit:** Upvotes no longer factor into play because y'all are downvoting other people. _This is why we can't have nice things._
2. ???
3. ~~Profit~~ AirMech!

If there are fewer entries than I have copies of AirMech, everyone with flair who enters gets one. :)

The reason why this subreddit is best steamgameswapping place out there, other than the great community, superb rules, and the mods hard work, is **searchability**.

It takes so much time to browse these individuals's offers, even if they list their huge inventory.

So my suggestion is that every trader at least should *highlight* a few rarities, or what kind of games they have for offer / looking for, cause it's quite disappointing when you click on an offer, than his inventory link, and it turns out that he bought the potato reunion pack + a few games from the latest weekend deals..

Here are a few examples:

* [H] GTA Complete, Dead Island, Skyrim, daily deals and more [W] Super Meat Boy, Offers

* [H] valve complete pack, lots of indie games, daily deals, 200+ inventory [W] indie bundles, indie games, offers

So making the title more descriptive would make everyone's life easier.

I know it's not easy to even implement this in the rules (but including at least two games's titles on the title, or something similar should do it), and it involves a lot of work from the mods, but after the, khm.. *sharks* with a huge inventory will post their offers properly, than most likely the newcomers will follow.

**One more thing**, there should be a post limit of 48 hours on the dota2, csgo threads to prevent some people from spamming their long list of frivolous offers.

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

[Inventory listing by TradeStarter](http://runtyrobot.com/tradestarter)

I have some Wallet as well - if you're offering something I feel I *must* have.  :P

I'm mostly into 1:1 trades - If I'm interested in your offer - and I'd probably be willing to do PayPal (with Blue+) or Amazon GC (with Grey+) if you don't have something I want but have cash.

My [Wishlist is here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/WarNev3rChanges/wishlist) and it's up-to-date, but not in any real order.

If you're offering [something I already have](http://steamcommunity.com/id/WarNev3rChanges/games?tab=all), then please limit the offer to a fun multiplayer game I can give to a friend.

I'll take TF2 keys as well.  Just check out any sale site (I like steamprices.com) and divide by the current key price.

Well, my team and I are finally able to open for alpha testing, The TF2 Economy Project!

----

**Project Vision:**

To provide the TF2 trading community with a fair, balanced price guide, with votes from elite traders setting the basis of the values.  We also will be aggregating pricing data from several sources, such as Backpack.tf, and present that pricing data to the user.  The TF2 Economy team is dedicated to providing a fair system that we can use ourselves, in light of the main TF2 Spreadsheet conspiracy.  Our system is built from the ground up to be efficient, fast, and secure, without being prone to price manipulation, with myself as the head developer.

The system runs on elected trade officials having votes, not just the average person.  This allows those that are deemed trustworthy by the public to vote to set the price a certain way, and others can enforce or deny this value.  No ""administrator"" has tools to change values directly in the database, although I do have access (which I need as the web dev :P ).  This eliminates many of the issues seen on Backpack.tf and the TF2 Spreadsheet.  Any addition ideas to combat price fraud will be considered.

As for the current design, yes, I know it's horribly ugly.  Yes, I know the front end is fairly bad.  As a front end web developer myself, I've spent most of my time working on the APIs and back end to make TF2 Economy work.  I do have graphics people working on a design, but feel free to submit one of your own if you feel the need.  I'm sure they would love to have additional input.

This system is planned to be the official pricing guide to /r/TF2Trade, so we must build a very good system for their use.

----

**Leadership:**

The leadership of the TF2 Economy project is being divided between several key figures, with several distinct jobs to handle.  The team is as follows:

&gt;MLGM - Head of Graphics
 &gt;&gt;VideoVideo - Graphics Support, along with overall Project Support

&gt;Qwix and ME Chihuahua [MCT] - Project Support, Bug Testing, Brainstorming

&gt;Macropower - Head Pricer

&gt;agg23 - Project Lead and Head Developer
&gt;&gt;Ponco - Domain Owner and Development Support

Additional members will be added/removed as necessary.

----

**Pricers:**

What we now need from the community are members who are willing to start using the system.  People who have a high trading reputation, those who are willing to file bug reports, and all around good people.  This system is very much in an alpha state, but as far as I can tell it should be usable.  Additional features will be added as time goes on.

Don't want any additional offers coming in? You now have the ability to mark your thread as ""closed""!

To do so, click the red ""`close thread`"" link at the bottom of your post, and confirm that you want to close your thread. If you decide later to reopen your thread, click the green ""`reopen thread`"" link.

Posts now also have icons:

* Open trade threads have a ~~green check~~ **blue arrow** icon.
* Closed trade threads have a ~~red dash~~ **red do-not-enter** icon.
* PSA and announcement threads have a yellow exclamation point icon.
* Other threads have a ~~blue question-mark~~ **green plus** icon.

***

Some notes about these changes:

* Closing a post does not prevent people from commenting, or let the moderators know your trades are complete, or anything else. **Closing a post** ***only*** **changes the icon at the front of your post. That's it. Nothing else.**

* Posts must follow the correct format to be recognized as a trade thread, and not show up as an ""other"" thread. For those of you who need a reminder, the correct format is:

    **[H] What you have [W] What you want**

    Please remember that **spacing and order are important.** The following are *not* acceptable:

    *[H]What you have [W]What you want* (note the spacing)

    *[W] What you want [H] What you have*

    PSA threads should follow this format:

    **[PSA] Information people should know**

    [ANNOUNCEMENT] is reserved for mod use - any other posts using it will be removed.

    **We will begin enforcing this more heavily. Posts that don't follow our format are subject to removal without warning.**

* Closing a thread is accomplished by marking it NSFW. If our stylesheet is not available, closed threads will appear as NSFW. This is most likely to happen if:

    * You're subscribed to /r/SGS, and you see a post from the front page.
    * You have subreddit CSS turned off in your global Reddit settings, or through [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com).
    * You're browsing through [/r/all](/r/all) or a multi-reddit (such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap+SteamGameSwap)).

    **If you see NSFW posts in SGS, don't panic - this is why.**

***

**tl;dr:**

* You can close threads now. Close your thread when you're done with it.
* Follow the format, or we'll delete your posts.",,False,,t5_2skv6,True,,mod,True,t3_pbiiw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/pbiiw/announcement_new_feature_post_icons_closing_posts/,moderator

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games (TF2 or DOTA2), if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

If this is against the rules, let me know, I'll delete this post.)

Now that's done, I was wondering if 9 keys for Don't Starve, CiV, and Oblivion GotY would be fair. I see each game go variably for games (3-5 keys, 2-3, and 3-5 respectively). Just an answer would be fine, then I'll delete the post. 

P.S: Is there more places to trade other than here and steamtrades.com? Lots of people seem to overprice there and sometimes here. Just wondering.

And I know that it's purely cosmetic, with the exception that those with lower flairs have to go first if they're trading keys, or non steam items.

However I don't see the point of that combined karma restriction. 
This subreddit is all about trading, and sometimes posting useful links about sales, giveaways, etc.. and it's pretty hard to get comment karma, not to mention that you can easily get downvoted if you turn someone's offer down.

So the only way is to get at least 200 combined karma is to be an active redditor, or to post something funny, smart, silly, or a pic of a cute little kitty, which has nothing to do with game trading nor this subreddit at all.

First of all - Welcome to /r/sgs!  Please take *some* time to acquaint yourself with the rules of the subreddit - specifically those regarding bundles and keys (codes for games, not TF2, Dota, or CSGO keys).  Posts are still being reported and removed regularly, and *no exceptions are made.*

Just because we remove your thread, and you're pissed off - that shouldn't mean you take your trade elsewhere and get scammed.

Third - poontawn's [consolidated Giveaway thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/1kgrbr/giveaway_humble_bundle_giveaway_general_thread/) is stickied and will be for a while.  Thank you for using it!  Please do not beg - only make a top level comment if you are giving away.

Fourth - Let's get a little Q&amp;A going for the benefit of the new folks.  Let's make them feel welcome.  Ask anything you're unsure about, and either the mod staff or one of our experienced traders will help you.  Please be respectful of each other as well.  There are no stupid questions, okay?

It's simple. I'm clearing out my inventory, and to make things go quickly, I'm offering everything at cost (or less, if at cost isn't cheap enough). This means I won't take anything lower than the prices listed above, as I would then be hemorrhaging money.

**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games (TF2 or DOTA2), if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

I have a certain number between 1-450 assigned for each game. If you choose that number, you win that game. In the possible, but unlikely event you already have that game, I reserve the right to simply swap a game around. I will check your profile first to make sure you do or do not have the game for the number you picked.

**Also, please post your favorite GIF along with your number**

I will be on at 12:00 A:M Central Standard Time give or take an hour to find my winners! I will simply P.M you the key for the game and post the winners in the thread. If a game has an unpicked number, I will find the closest person to that number and reward them with the key.

Good luck and enjoy!

All random numbers for the games were picked using [Random.org](http://www.random.org/)

**EDIT** All winners have been chosen! Thanks for participating in the contest and I enjoyed the GIF's! Nobody was right on with a number but a couple that were 1 away. The rest were all the closest! Here are the winners.

So I purchased a $10 KK card with the intention of trading it to a rather *ungrateful* person (who will remain anonymous) only to find out that he no longer wants it. I've no use for it, so I've decided to set up a giveaway for it.

The rules are:

1. Pick a number between 1 and 200, I will use the number generator at Random.org to pick a winner after 24 hours.

2. Tell me which you prefer, 4chan or Reddit, *and why* (just curious).

3. If you are entering this giveaway, it is under the intention of using the card.

4. The code **may not be retraded to another person**, this is a new rule implemented by a moderator.

~~*Alternatively*, I'm looking for Chivalry, so if you want to trade for it, I'd consider that, but I would prefer to give the giveaway a chance first.~~

&gt;Dear Arma 3 Supporter,


&gt;We would like to thank you for your purchase of the Arma 3 Supporter Edition on the day of its release. As you can surely remember, we experienced some serious problems with store stability at the time, which makes your dedication even more admirable. 

&gt;Out of appreciation for your support of the Arma series, and also as an apology for all the trouble you experienced, we would like to offer you this one time gift code for 25€ which you can use on Store.bistudio.com. 

&gt;To prevent similar problems from occurring in the future, we are currently exploring (and consequently implementing) several new features. Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience this situation may have caused you. 


That covers the cost of another copy of Arma III perfectly (25€).

Its a fairly good coop shooter, i being fan of Borderlands and its coop had to give a try to this game and it didnt disappoint. Id say this game is Doom (old ones) meets borderlands.

Registering account and activating it is a bit confusing. I had to enter email and password twice to make same account before it got activated and couldn't find where to enter beta key. But i got it sorted out nevertheless.

Also i didnt take beta key from Gamersbook, i registered account on Warframe website and got my key within 24h.

You need to like the website on Facebook or follow on Twitter and fill out the form to be entered. If you do both, you're entered twice. I don't expect the participation to be massive, so you guys have an amazing chance. Good luck.

1348222529.0,13,self.SteamGameSwap,108q0t,"[H] Games, DLCs, and an experiment; [W] tradable copies of games devalued by indie bundles (Torchlight, SPAZ, Shatter, Vessel, Rochard, Broken Sword, etc)",15,2,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/108q0t/h_games_dlcs_and_an_experiment_w_tradable_copies/,"I've been thinking. (I know, I really should be careful about doing that.)

**An unpleasant truth about trading:** The indie bundles we love so much devalue existing tradable copies of our games. To make matters worse, Steam has a nasty, mean habit of putting games on daily deal just before they are included in bundles (happened with Shatter and Rochard just last week).

If the games are good, **the value _will_ usually bounce back, but it will take a while** (weeks at least, often months--and then there's The Ship, which has been at the bottom of the barrel since last December).

I'm a patient trader. I play the long game and don't mind to let stuff sit in my inventory for months. **If you aren't so patient,** though, and would rather trade your game now for _something_ rather than have to wait forever for the value to bounce back, maybe we can work out a deal.

**What do you get?** You get something new to play or re-trade immediately. **What do I get?** I will let the stuff sit and re-trade it in a few weeks or months when the game is (hopefully) worth a little more again.

**Consider this an experimental offer.** It may very well meet with no success. Or it may make some people very happy.

**Here is [my inventory](http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikker_/inventory/).** Below I've listed my cheaper tradable games and DLC, and also my Steam keys. Feel free to suggest something!

**Or if you'd just like to discuss whether you think this experiment is a good idea or a stupid one, I'd be interested to hear what you think about that, too. :)**

Here is the deal: We are going to buy 50 ducks. VERILY, A FLOCK OF AIRBORNE TERROR! However, diabolical fowl from the depths of the abyss must come at nothing but a [fowl price](http://www.amazon.com/Lot-Assorted-Rubber-Ducks-Toy/dp/B00168328W). So yeah, a couple of my friends are splitting the cost for that.

BUT FEAR NOT FELLOW CONSPIRATORS! For we are ALSO in need of 5 more EQUALLY DIABOLICAL RUBBER DUCKS. 

[Look at them](http://imgur.com/7Anrh.jpg). GRUESOMELY toying with their prey as they collude for CONQUEST AND THE DEFEAT OF ALL THAT IS GOOD! 

And they are ONLY *FIVE DOLLAHS*, the exact value of Left 4 Dead 2 of which I still have a spare copy from last July! MMMHYESSSsss, this will do very well.

###IMPORTANT THING THE FIRST:

I've just had a complaint in modmail about one of our moderators supposedly scamming someone out of a game. The scammed user managed to pick up their SteamID64 before it was too late, and we've ascertained that [this guy](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198027081900) is currently impersonating /u/rikker_.

The *only* Steam accounts that we will ever contact you on will be our own (this may change in the future), and [those accounts are all members of this private Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RedditGameSwapMods/). I'll include our Steam details below for reference:

###IMPORTANT THING THE SECOND:

If you act like a raging douche in your interactions with other traders we'll probably ban you. Just a fair warning.

###IMPORTANT THING THE THIRD:

I've noticed that some people have been using the [PSA] tag to ask questions. This is a no-no. We're going to contact /u/Deimorz and ask him to add a [Q] tag for the automod so people can ask questions without making it look like they're announcing something important to the community.

2. People who **have** Dota 2 and want to make a trade, reply to the person making the top-level comment.
3. The post-closing function won't work in here, so top-level traders - be sure to **edit your post to indicate when your trade is finished.** Use `~~strikeout~~`.

### Don't spam your trade. It won't help.

### Don't downvote other people's trades. It won't help either.

People will see the first-posted trades sooner, so putting more copies of your post in the thread just fills up this thread faster. Downvoting also won't affect the order.

(and other leaked keys),13,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/p48od/regarding_dead_island_leaked_keys_and_other/,"I guess it's kind of a PSA for those unaware... If this is public knowledge and you guys think it's spam, please have a mod remove this post.

Regarding leaked keys (especially Dirt 3, Dead Island), it seems that some of us have the idea that leaked keys shouldn't activate at all, so that if it activates, it's not leaked.

It is my believe that's not the case, and it's not fine just because you can activate it. Case in point, I bought a retail copy of Dead Island from a major retailer, and much to my disappointment when I tried to activate the key on Steam it tells me it's a Duplicated key - which means the unique key is being used by another Steam account.

I followed the procedure to CD key reset and now I'm waiting for Steam support - it's taking some time but I have no doubt in my mind that once it's done, the key will belong to me (rightfully) and whoever had this key before will be shit out of luck, and won't be able to play the game anymore (or worse, have their steam account affected).

So for those of you who think just because you can activate a key then it's fine... no it's not. Buyer (Swapper) beware. Always ask for proof when trading keys or stick with giftable copies.

Scammer Alert Avoid iiz3rkaii / Silent_sound1996 until he resolves the situation,16,1,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/iflkf/urgent_scammer_alert_avoid_iiz3rkaii_silent/,"In regards to: http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/i9jtf/h_two_minecraft_alpha_accounts_w_decent_steam/

I traded iiz3rkaii a copy of Borderlands GOTY in exchange for a Minecraft Alpha Account.

I insisted that he give me the account info first because he's only been a redditor for a month and has -15 karma.

I added him on steam, check out his profile, see that he's 14 and from the UK.

 I was cautious, had him give me the account information first. I logged in, changed the password, checked to see if the account was a full account, it was.

 I asked him if there was a way to indicate whether it was an Alpha account or not, he said there wasn't a way to do that.

I figured that since I had access to the account and had changed the password that I was safe. So, I sent him the game, thanked him, etc.

A few minutes later I downloaded the game, tried to log on to multiplayer after having logged in on browser based single player and was unable to do.

I contacted him at his steam name of ""**Silent_sound1996**"" and asked him what the deal was, if there was a multiplayer password that was different from the account password (again, I'm completely new to minecraft).

Upon my request for help with the multiplayer password he blocked all communication from me on Steam and will not reply to my messages. Hence, why I feel that I have been scammed.

I'm getting a response from him on reddit but he's just denying it. I'm going to take screenshots showing that I can't log in to Minecraft, if he doesn't resolve this, I would really appreciate if you would report him for misconduct on steam saying that he's scamming people on a forum and having them gift him steam games in exchange for Minecraft accounts. 

Until he resolves this issue, I am under the impression that I was intentionally scammed and that this is not a miscommunication.

I have made this post to make other people aware of this scammer and ask the community's assistance in reporting him to Steam by going to his profile page, click on report violation, user misconduct and just tell steam that this user is scamming people on a forum by offering them Minecraft in lieu of games on Steam. 

That should be enough to get his account banned and cause him to lose all of his games that he scammed people out of.

**Please hold off on the reporting until we give him a chance to prove that I am mistaken (hopefully) but I doubt that this will happen**

Just ask the price for any game and i'll see what i can do.

**Please read the FAQ at the end of this post, its good for you**

!All games are tradable gifts!

**Announcement: As you may know, I've been haunted by transaction error for last days, it appears if you buy a lot of games in a short period of time. That's why i'll do only 6 transactions per hour (every 10 minutes) to avoid this error. What does it mean to you? You'll have to wait 1-10 minutes before the trade, while im collecting orders from all my customers to buy all these games in a single transaction. I cant see another way to avoid this error, im sorry for your waiting, thanks for your patience.**

**Announcement#2: Payday2 has been recently region restricted, so i cant buy it anymore for you. If you already have Payday 2 from russian store - don't worry, they've just added a new restricted version to the russian store, and your ""old"" version will be still totaly region free.**

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games (TF2 or DOTA2), if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys or 0.6 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). And 0.6 keys = 1 [tf2 voucher](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Squad%20Surplus%20Voucher?filter=ticket) You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 and 0.6 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal?**

A: No, i do not, but i accept Webmoney and Qiwi.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

&gt;The free Shadow Warrior Classic App was mistakenly set to live early and there were no keys offered as the database was not setup yet! Sorry for the confusion but it will be working this week and you'll all have a chance for a free code for Shadow Warrior Classic on Steam!

**Edit3:**

&gt;Well, looks like folks hacked the giveaway app and stole all the keys like a ninja in the night!  
Don't fear grasshoppers, we'll be back in just a bit with some great news for you all...trust in Wang!

**Edit4:**

&gt;Shadow Warrior Classic (1997) is now free on Steam for a limited time! Grab it and hit the Share button below to invite your friends to be fans of Shadow Warrior on Facebook!

**Edit5:**

&gt;Looks like people are loving Shadow Warrior Classic (1997) so we'll just keep it F2P forever. Enjoy, retweet, and follow for more news!

Today when I asked him about the situation, he told me he will be able to buy a copy of dawnguard between today and 8th of march, but after I saw he removed me from his friends on steam, I added him again but he refused.

It appears that a new linkjacking exploit you heard about here a few days ago has resurfaced. This one is also reported fixed by Valve.

* A new linkjacking exploit has surfaced

* This one appears to be fixed, but new ones may resurface, so it is still an **extremely bad idea to click on links**

* If you take the risk, make sure to examine the URL closely before clicking

* If the site is a forgery, as stated in another PSA about said forgeries, contact the abuse department of the webhost (use [DomainTools](http://domaintools.com) to do this), [report it to Google](http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/), and [rate it on WOT](http://mywot.com)

* And as always, [check SteamRep](http://steamrep.com) to see if the person you're trading with is a scammer. If you're trading in money or other high-value items, ask for a feedback/reputation thread **and check the flair restrictions here!**

It's clear that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 keys have absolutely been compromised. We will now permanently ban users that submit them as giveaways.

I've decided to make this into a bit more of a competition about who's got the most interesting stories to share. What I'd want you to include in your post is:  
  
1) Where you're from. I've noticed this subreddit's pretty international, so that'd be interesting to hear.  
2) What you enjoy the most in your free time - excluding gaming. Hobbies, interests, sports, anything.  
3) Your favorite website. Like, just one. Excluding r/SGS of course.  
4) Your opinion on today's digital game distribution. Has it all gone too far now that you can't even count all the third-party DRM out there? Would the world be a better place if Steam was the only digital game distributor? What happened to 'DRM-free' retail games that used to be the rule and not the exception?  
5) What you think of EA in general.    
--and an optional 5.1 for *former* EA Sports NHL fans - Do you think the PC series would still exist if it had been available on Steam?  
6) Which of the games below you'd be interested in the most - and a brief description why.  
  
  
The games, as some of you probably guessed already, are:  
~~Dead Space~~ - All gone!  
Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box - One key left  
~~Crysis 2 Maximum Edition~~ - All gone!  
~~Medal of Honor~~ - All gone!

**Lenkiew´s FAQ and questions:**

**Question: I want a game from your list, where can i find you?**

Answer: Yo can add me [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/theLtheLtheL)

**Question: What is your steamrep?**

Answer: My steamrep can find [here](http://steamrep.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsteamcommunity.com%2Fid%2FtheLtheLtheL)

**Question: Where do i find keys?**

Answer: Well, i accept two different types of keys [Mann Co. Supply Crate Key](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [Dota Treasure Key](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Treasure%20Key), you can choose, for me are the same.

**Question: What is ref?Can i choose another thing?**

Answer: [Refined metal](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Refined_Metal) is a craft item that can get in Teamfortress 2 and  can´t buy in the steam market . If you cant get them, you can change them for 2x [Tour of Duty Ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket) and you can find them in steam market like keys.

**Question: Can i offer tf2 items, dota items or games?**

Answer: Dota2 items aren´t accepted. Teamfortress 2 items can be accepted if you overpay the pure keys price. Games can be accepted if they make sense.

**Question: Do you accept another payment way, for example: paypal?**

Answer: Well, Following reddit rules i can´t do paypal trades until get flair. I have completed all steps to get it but admins are busy (i think), for that reason i must wait.

**Question: Can you do any offer or discount?**

Answer: Offers can be accepted only with purchases in bulk. Discounts only are accepted when games are on sales (only on sales, when they finished, prices return to normal price) or purchases in bulk.

**Question: Do you accept CD-keys, bundles keys, codes ,coupons or cards?**

Answer: At the moment cant accept nothing of them.

**Question: I want a game that dont appear in your list, Can you get it?**

Answer: Ask for prices and i answer you as soon as possible.

**Question: I have more questions... or want to discuss prices.**

Answer: Add me on steam or send me a MP

Earlier today the dev of gun monkeys gave me 3 copies to give to my friends, since i only have 2 friends i play games with I seem to have an extra key.  So here is what we're going to do, I work until 11pm est tonight and while i am gone I want to know why you want this game.  If I feel that you genuinely want to play this game (It is really fun, just needs a playerbase) you will get my extra copy.  Also pick a number between 1-1000 just in case this thing blows up and i will do a lottery type thing instead of going through and reading it all.

2 Rules:
1. You must have been a member of reddit for AT LEAST 30 days
2. Only apply if you plan on playing the game, like i said before, it is a good game it just needs a larger player base.  If you are just a trader looking to make an extra few keys than u need not apply. 

You guys have 6 hours to apply, good luck!

1. **No spaces.**

    Remember, you need spaces around the [H] and the [W] in your title.

    This doesn't:

        [H]Portal 2 [W]Left 4 Dead 2

2. **Confusion over the word ""key"".**

    A ""key"" is something you put into the Activate a Product on Steam window, or something else that you trade outside of Steam Trading. In particular, these are not keys:

    1. **Tradable** Dota 2 / CS:GO invites.
    2. TF2 crate keys. For TF2 keys, please use the exact phrase ""TF2 keys"" when describing them - the bot is programmed to allow these posts through.

**Q&amp;A section:**

_____________________________________________________



**Q: keys? what keys?**

A: I accept [tf2 keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) and [dota treasure keys](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) as payment, u can always buy them from official steam market or official stores in these games, if you have ones.

**Q: Sometimes i can see 0.4 keys in your prices, dafuq is this?**

A: Well, it is really simple. 0.4 keys = 1 [tf2 ticket](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Tour%20of%20Duty%20Ticket). You can always buy it from official steam market, and it is much easier to make more accurate prices with these 0.4 keys

**Q: Can you get ANY game for me?**

A: I can get ALMOST anygame for you, but some games are area locked, it means you wont be able to play this game unless you are russian. I do not sell area locked games and always warn my clients if game is area locked or i have suspicion of it.

**Q: How much for Don't Starve?**

A: I cant offer a sweet price for this game, im sorry


**Q: Can i offer you a game instead of keys?**

A: Sorry, im interested in keys only and i do not accept any game offers


**Q: Do you accept Paypal? Do you work with money at all?**

A: We have some issues with Paypal here in Russia, so I do not accept Paypal, im sorry. I can accept Webmoney if you have some, but it is a rare thing for non-russians.


**Q: I have some questions about payment/game i wanna buy/whatever**

A: Feel free to ask your questions it my topic, also u can always add me in steam for discussion

Feel free to offer below, but don't add me straight up unless you agree to pay with Paypal. That means **don't add me to offer games**.

Feel free to add me if you interested in some games and willing to pay with Paypal. That means **you can add me anytime if you wanna buy something with listed price**.

Games listed below are just example, if you need something that's not on my list. Feel free to add me for price check.

I can do discount if you buy in bulk.
