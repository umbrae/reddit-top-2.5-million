Elkins, apprehending the war's true nature and eventual outcome: ""I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow, ... and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.""

very important history

edit: it has been pointed out this is a false quote and that Lincoln actually said this:

As early as 1847 (lincoln) had written, ""To secure to each labourer the whole product of his labour, or as nearly as possible, is a most worthy object of any good government,"" which was remarkable for a prairie lawyer of that time. Speaking in New England in 1860, he praised the right to strike, as then being exercised by the shoemakers of Lynn. His clear assertion of the labor theory of value in the 1861 message ; ""Labor is prior to, and . . . superior to capital"" — and his answers to the addresses of workingmen abroad and at home gave a color of Marxism to his thinking. He was, surely, the best friend labor ever had in the White House.: source http://www.snopes.com/quotes/lincoln.asp",,False,,t5_2qhpn,True,,,True,t3_n676z,http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/n676z/1864_president_lincoln_letter_as_a_result_of_the/,

Really?  

There are a limited number of general-usage words -- why should [/r/economy](/r/economy) NOT be simply about the ECONOMY -- (and I'm not talking about just ""economic theory"" that is [/r/economics](/r/economics) {and a dozen other economics subreddits} but rather news about the economy).

And given that [/r/investors](/r/investors), [/r/investing](/r/investing), and [/r/investments](/r/investments) are all in existence, why in the world should THIS subreddit be constrained to ""investors"" -- that just makes no sense whatsoever.

1354827667.0,82,self.economy,14ejhl,TIL a little more about how badly prisons fuck people and the economy.,105,23,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/14ejhl/til_a_little_more_about_how_badly_prisons_fuck/,"I work at a communications department that handles a lot of print work. I'm one of 5 graphic designers, all of which send several large, expensive jobs to print on a weekly basis. The way our process works, we get the specs for a piece and while we are designing the artwork, the piece is sent out to several printers on bid. Whoever winds the bid, obviously, gets the work. 

Well, recently we've gotten a new printer added to our bid list who has been winning all of our jobs by a LANDSLIDE. Each quote they give is substantially lower than they other printers. Upon inquiry, I discovered that the printer who was winning all our work was the prison! 

Now, I'm 100% for teaching prisoners skills and allowing them to work, but the reason they can charge so little is because they pay the prisoners next to nothing (I couldn't figure out how much this particular industry pays the prisoners, but research found they generally make 50 cents to $2 an hour) As a matter of fact, I read that Honda has paid inmates $2 an hour for doing the same work an auto worker would get paid $20 to $30 an hour to do! That's just insane. Upon further reading, I learned prisons have their hands in MANY industries from clothing production to telemarketing!  After the initial outrage settled, I started to think about just how fucked up this situation is. 

Not only are prisoners being seriously exploited, but legitimate businesses who PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES are losing thousands of dollars in business per month- this is clear just from my personal experience.. local printers are losing thousands of dollars a month in just my little area! At this rate, I'm not sure how many of them will stay afloat for long. 

Next, we have people and clients in my office who are THRILLED at the savings. They will talk about how much they are saving and how wonderful the saving is ""in this economy"" while essentially helping to put businesses under the ground. (this is doubly infuriating because I work for a publicly funded institution so taxpayer dollars gets recycled and goes to the prison industry as profit)

So now we have worker/prisoner exploitation and economic disaster! great. But that's not it. This private prison industry also promotes the obtaining of prisoners in the first place! Arresting people now seems to me like some sort of sick hiring process instead of punishment for legitimate crime. 

Here is one article I found on it. http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/may2000/pris-m08.shtml

There are many more if you google. 

I just thought it was crazy that this is affecting an average city in the south o drastically... I can't imagine the extent of the corruption across the whole USA. 


This is just my opinion and reaction to a situation I've recently discovered. If I am wrong, or there is valuable information I don't know.. please inform me. 

TL:DR- Prisons are essentially slave labor camps and an industry that is stealing business from legitimate companies, exploiting workers and helping to destroy our economy.",,False,,t5_2qhpn,False,,,True,t3_14ejhl,http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/14ejhl/til_a_little_more_about_how_badly_prisons_fuck/,

1373992285.0,82,self.economy,1if79m,My dinner with Paul Volcker to discuss post-scarcity economics of The Technocopia Plan [UPDATE],97,15,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1if79m/my_dinner_with_paul_volcker_to_discuss/,"To begin with [PROOF](http://imgur.com/a/7yqTV)

This was the meeting described in [this post from 3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/1arzzd/1er_here_that_won_an_auction_benefiting_the_rfk/). It turned out that due to health problems the fishing trip got boiled down to a long dinner conversation, but that was ok because I can not fish worth a damn.

As a preface, I was given this opportunity because /u/m0rph3u5 thought my project [The Technocopia Plan](http://code.google.com/p/the-technocopia-project/wiki/About_Technocopia) would produce an interesting conversation.

The meeting began with a discussion of robotics. One of the contracts my company does is for control systems for [neurosurgery frameworks](http://aimlab.wpi.edu/research/) (skip to 0:33 in the video). A friend of his has cerebral palsy so i was able to discuss with him how the robotic assisted therapy works. From there we segued into robotics and automation of the economy. 

I laid out the basic thesis from [Race Against the Machine](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store/dp/B005WTR4ZI) in that the rate at which we are eliminating jobs is faster then a human can be trained for any new job. I then further claimed that projects like the Technocopia Plan and [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/) will leverage the community of labor to design the new manufacturing backbone. On top of that, the Technocopia plan is aiming to eliminate mineral sources in favor of carbon based materials synthesized from CO2 (and other air gasses plus trace minerals from seawater). The result will be free and open designs, free and open manufacturing equipment, and free and effectively infinite (emphasis on effectively) material source streams. (since this is not a tech sub, i will spare you all the details of how that will work)

The response was surprising. In response to ""It seems we just have more people than are needed to make ever increasing productive capacity, and that divergence can only accelerate thanks to the technology coming online now"", Mr Volcker responded ""You have put your finger on the central problem in the global economy that no one wants to admit"". This confirmation from the top of the banking system literally made my heart skip a beat! (I have a heart condition, so that was not hard though)

We then discussed ideas like disconnecting a citizens ability to exert demand in the economy from employment, since it is now clear that there is no longer a structural correlation between them. We discussed Basic Income and the Negative Income Tax (Milton Friedman), as transitory frameworks to allow for the development and rollout of Technocopia abundance machines.  As a confirmation that Mr Volcker was not just nodding along, when i misspoke about how the Friedman negative income tax, i was quickly and forcefully corrected. I had accidentally said everyone gets the same income, but what i meant was that everyone got at least a bare minimum, supplemented by negative taxes. This correction was good because it meant he was not just being polite listening to me, he was engaged and willing to correct anything he heard that was out of place. 

Over all, Mr Volcker was a really nice guy, and somewhat surprisingly, he was FUNNY. He made jokes and carried on a very interesting conversation. Even if he had not previously been the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, i would have enjoyed my conversation with him. 

Thank you to /u/m0rph3u5 and Reddit for making this happen!

Or is the act of legislating in order to redistribute wealth and trying to be more progressive actually resulting in that which it seeks to correct?

Of course, there are myriad factors that I am probably overlooking, but if anyone has some insight as to a possible cause for this, it would be greatly appreciated. &lt;3

Edit: I seem to be misunderstood by some. Sorry if I did not explain myself well; I will attempt to be less ambiguous with the aid of a chart:

[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/2008_Top1percentUSA.png) is a chart to illustrate what I am talking about. By ""past century"" I mean post-Great Depression, modern economics of the US. As you see, while the wealth disparity has fluctuated, it is now extremely high compared to the past ~83 years. Yet, since then, the government has enacted fiscal policy which attempts to redistribute wealth to the poor (Social Security, social welfare, etc), enacted comparatively more progressive tax systems, increased economic regulation on corporations and businesses, etc. Yet, it seems like all of these programs have accomplished nothing in the sense of wealth disparity, as one can see it is now the highest it has been since before the Great Depression. This doesn't make sense to me, since one would think that such programs would better balance the wealth of the poor in relation to the wealth of the rich. 

I am just curious to see any possible explanations for this seemingly paradoxical phenomenon. ",,False,,t5_2qhpn,1375916711.0,,,True,t3_1jwni6,http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1jwni6/if_the_us_government_has_become_more_progressive/,
