**UPDATE: The Juicy Deets**  
Alright everyone, so there is definitely sufficient interest in this for me to go forward with it. I am currently in the process of trying out different solutions to find something that will work best. For all those who asked, I will definitely be recording the classes--I don't want anyone to miss out for reasons beyond their control. The classes will begin Sunday, November 18th. I will send a PM to anyone who replies to this post with all the details on how to join the class, and details on where to go to watch the recorded videos. I will also make another post (an UPDATE post) a few days before the class begins with all the exact details. A note, you do *not* have to install Arch Linux or CentOS on your system. If you're comfortable with Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, then keep that. We will only be installing CentOS in our KVMs--the host does not matter. I will work with people in any distro to get the lab properly set up. Please, if there is anything that you're interested in learning, let me know so that I can get into the final syllabus.

**Original Post**  
Hello all. Back in the day when I got into Linux there was an incredible guy on the EFnet channel #linuxhelp whom I owe much of where I am today and what I know to. He was always willing to help a newb. So, in the spirit of awol (that was his handle), I am offering a class for those interested in learning Linux. We will be working in CentOS, because that is the best distro to know if you ever plan on being a system administrator.

**What are the requirements for the class?**

No knowledge of Linux is required. Because we will be working with KVM, you will need a CPU that supports hardware virtualization. You can find out if your CPU supports hardware virtualization by checking the manufacturer website for your CPU. For example, if we check the product details for AMD's Phenom N930, we will see that there is a ""Yes"" listed next to ""AMD's Virtualization Technology,"" which means that the CPU supports hardware virtualization. If we check the product details for Intel's i7-2600, we see that there is a ""Yes"" listed for Intel's Virtualization Technology (VT-x), which means that the CPU supports hardware virtualization. If you're already in Linux, you can check by typing  grep svm /proc/cpuinfo for AMD CPUs, or grep vmx /proc/cpuinfo for Intel CPUs. If the grep statement returns nothing, this means your CPU does not support hardware virtualization. If your CPU returns some text, you're good to go. If your CPU does not support hardware virtualization, then you're more than welcome to use Virtualbox, or some other solution. However, I will not be supporting such a setup, so you'll be on your own following along.

I will be streaming my desktop, thus you will need to be able to view the live stream. As well, I recommend having a mic, though this is not necessary. We will be communication via our mics, but I will also try to get a chat environment setup as well.

**When?**

We will meet every Sunday evening at 7PM PST. If you'd like to meet at a different time, please let me know. 

**Syllabus**

*Week 1: Getting Installed, KVM setup and the shell*  
First, we will get Linux set up on our systems. I will be doing this in a KVM, but you're more than welcome to set it up on your system. I am running an Arch Linux host, and will be running CentOS VMs. The install will be CentOS. We will then setup 3 CentOS VMs. After our environment is setup, we will be covering the basics of the shell environment. What is a shell? What can we do with the shell? Getting around the filesystem, and so on.

*Week 2: The shell in-depth*  
We will spend some time comparing different shell environments (e.g., bash, ksh), and more in-depth subjects, such as piping, redirection, some basic shell scripting (loops, conditional statements), environment variables, files (.bashrc, etc), aliases, builtins, signals, brace expansion, and more. Our focus will be on the bash shell.

*Week 3: System management*  
We will cover the log files, configuration files, vi, disk and network management (e.g., ip command, lvm, fdisk, ethtool, what's a jumbo frame?, etc), package mangement, ACLs, temporary vs. persistent changes, sudo, user and group management, quotas, difference between hard and soft links, grub, fstab, LuKS, cron/at, processes and runlevels.

*Week 4: Services*  
We will cover NFS, ftp, Apache, mail server, CIFS, automounter, VNC and some basics of DNS. We will also look at how these things work with SELinux and iptables, and we will be delving in-depth into SELinux policies and roles.

*Week 5: The Kernel*  
We will be building packages from source, creating RPMs, creating our own yum repositories, building a custom kernel, looking at proc and sysctl. We will then create a kickstart file with %post scripts to setup a VM to our exact specifications.

*Week 6: Shell Scripts*  
We will begin by writing some simple shell scripts.

*Week 7: Advanced shell scripts*  
More scripting. Arrays, regular expressions, debugging our scripts, and more.

*Week 8: Tcl*  
We will cover the basics of Tcl to get ourselves ready for next week.

*Week 9: Automating system administration with Expect*  
We will build on all of our knowledge gained thus far and build some Expect scripts to automate the tasks that we have learned how to do.

*Week 10-15: Perl*  
Now that we know shell scripts and Expect, we will be expanding on that knowledge with Perl + Expect to create a system administration automation suite. The end product will manage our VM network, adding/removing users in bulk, changing passwords, locking user accounts, and so on.

*Week 15-20: Administration of LAMP server*  
We will cover MySQL, Apache PHP, BIND, OpenLDAP, and Postfix+Dovecot in-depth. The focus of this will be the administration of these services. For example, we will learn what an SFP record is, and a virtual host.

*Week 20-25: Advanced Perl scripts*  
We will be creating a MySQL backend for our system administration scripts from earlier, and expanding our scripts to make a full fledged system administration suite. We may set up a VM running OpenIndiana (Solaris-based) just to have a mixed platform environment. We will also be using the Net::LDAP module to manage our users who will now be stored in an LDAP setup. We will also write a Nagios plugin.

**About Me**  
I have been a Linux user for 15 years now, and have worked in some sort of administrative role for 10 years. I have extensive experience with Linux, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX. I love automation, and truly believe that the best system administrator is the one who does the least amount of work.

**Other Stuff**  
Please, if you have any suggestions, let me know. I am always open to constructive criticism. The class is a collaborative environment. I am still learning as well. If you already know your stuff, why not join and help out? Keep me in check, add to the discussion, whatever you can do. If you're interested in signing up, let me know.

**EDIT:** Just thought of something else. We will also cover Upstart, init and systemd with a heavy focus on systemd.",,False,,t5_2qy7t,1352223710.0,,,True,t3_12pp8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/12pp8b/a_class_for_those_wishing_to_learn_linux/,

1. Check you /var/log files and system mail.  Use pipes like 
    
        sudo cat /var/*.log | grep sshd
        sudo cat /var/*.log | grep Invalid

1263497506.0,71,self.linux4noobs,apoig,"10 mistakes to avoid when learning Linux, especially if you're coming from Windows.",85,14,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/apoig/10_mistakes_to_avoid_when_learning_linux/,"1. **Not learning to use the command line.**
File managers are great, but the console is really your best friend.  Get comfortable using it. The most important command is man.  That gives you the documentation you'll need to get started on most of the other commands you'll learn about.  The very next command to learn and learn well is ls.  Then move on to cp, mv, ln, rm and tar.  File permissions and ownership, pipes, redirection and grep round out the bare essentials.

2. **Not learning about backing up, package management and upgrading.**
Backing up your files is pretty obvious, and applies to all operating systems, but there it is.  Learn it, do it.  Package management on variants of Linux can be slightly different. Study those man pages! Eventually you'll probably break something when you try to upgrade a package or do a system upgrade.  You'll be glad you learned the command line if and when you break something.

3. **Not looking before you leap.**
Every time you do something major to your system, like upgrading the whole thing or maybe just your favorite, much used software, find out all about it before you act.  Use your google-fu.  Join your operating system's forums and pay attention to the news and release notes.  Submit those questions, it never hurts to ask.

4. **Being too lazy to type.**
Learn to use two text editors.  One for the GUI environment, one for the command line.  There are many choices for GUI, it doesn't hurt to try a few out until you find your favorite.  For beginners, the best choice on the command line is probably Nano.  You may want to move up to Vim or Emacs if you're not afraid of a steep learning curve at the very beginning.

5. **Not learning what all those directories mean.**
You don't have to be an expert on everything under your / (root) directory, or even your ~ (home) directory but be curious and find out what they are as time permits.  When backup/restore time comes, you'll be glad you did.  There is also a wealth of information tucked in there, like running processes (/proc), all kinds of log files (/var) and a myriad of settings in files and directories that start with a dot.

6. **Putting up with the default options on your new installation.**
Linux is infinitely more customizable than Windows.  Learn how to make your life easier by creating your own menus, icons and writing your own simple scripts and shortcuts.

7. **Not learning about the shell.**
This usually means bash, the software that runs in your terminal, or command line.  It's related to number 1 above, but gets its own entry because if you take the time to drill down just a little, you can make your life a lot easier when fixing annoyances, changing configuration files, capturing program errors or want to automate just about anything on your system.

8. **Neglecting security.**
Most of this is common sense.  Don't run a web or ftp server on your machine without knowing what you're doing.  Don't neglect upgrades, they are often nothing more than security fixes.  Pick a nice long password for your account and memorize it.  Change it from time to time.  Remember to lock your door, physically and metaphorically!

9. **Expecting it to be as ""easy"" as windows.**
It doesn't have to be nuclear physics hard, but Linux does require to you think a little more.  This is not a bug, it's a feature.

10. **Giving up too easily.**
Don't expect to learn the whole Linux ecosystem in a week, a month or even a year.  It's ongoing.  If you don't like to learn, go back to Windows.  Don't expect it to be the same as Windows either.  There is a lot more power granted to the user of a Linux system, use it wisely. The modern Linux desktop seems very similar to Windows at first, and I suppose parts of it are.  But give yourself time to learn it and you'll come to love its power and flexibility.

Right now I am trying to get more in depth settings, as the stock ones are shallow. I would really like to know how to get UbuntuOne gone, as I don't plan to ever use it. I deleted all of the folders I could find of it and deleted them, yet this little cloud remains by the clock. Also this mail icon...**

First of all, I sincerely apologize if this is posted in the wrong subreddit. I considered /r/linux, /r/linuxquestions, and /r/linux4noobs, and this seemed the best place to ask, as /r/linux seemed to be more about news, and /r/linuxquestions was more for technical issues.

A little background to set up the question: I am a college student majoring in mathematics. I chose this major over computer science for personal reasons, and although this may not seem relevant, it is the basis for the fact that I know approximately nothing on any sort of programming. I am, however, at least proficient at troubleshooting (Google-Fu), and I am the go to guy for my friends and family when technical issues arise. Networking eludes me, but other than that I can fix most software problems with ease. Now on to the question(s).

I have been increasingly interested in trying out linux for a long while, and may finally have the time to give it a go. I am worried, however, that is just won't be worth the time or trouble. I play video games very often, so compatibility may be an issue, though I have heard of ways to get unsupported programs to still run, and the game I play the most (DOTA 2) is Linux compatible. Can most programs and games still be tweaked to run in linux?

I am unsure if my hardware is entirely compatible with gaming on linux, as I heard that it doesn't work well with graphic cards that aren't nVidia. I'll post a pastebin of my dxdiag, as I am unsure of an easier way to give my full specifications.

[DxDiag](http://pastebin.com/L6Xzx0vr)

As stated before, I know nothing of programming or languages, yet I see that the command prompt (line?) is used very often and seems to be essential to linux. Looking at some of the short tutorials on it, it seems to be at the very least straight forward. Still, am I going to be gimped on my ability to do much in linux if I don't know how to program? After reading various threads in the three related subreddits, I often have no idea what you people are talking about. Most of you seem like professional programmers or system admins.

I run a small, free ventrilo server for my friends using a process that starts when my computer boots up. I saw on the ventrilo download page that there is a ""Linux Ventrilo Script"", but not a linux client program. Would I still be able to run my server and the client on linux, or would a different VOIP program need to be found?

Lastly, is it possible to retain all of the current software I have on this machine? I know dual-booting is a possibility, but I am unsure of how it would work. Would I still be able to access any music, applications, or files that I currently have through say Ubuntu?

Two advanced Linux users  helping me said they were glad to learn about it because they can now avoid future problems - so I thought I'll also share it here.

My systems: Windows 7 Home Premium and Kubuntu 12.04, 64 bit versions.

I was messing around with my Windows, and at one point, I decided to boot into Windows Recovery Environment to see what it does. WRE is one of the booting options in my GRUB. It loaded and displayed me three (I think) options of system recovery and the option ""close"". Since it was not what I was looking for, I selected ""close"". It all lasted a few seconds and I did **not** launch any of the recovery tools. I just opened the environment, read the options and exited. Doesn't sound like something risky, right?

Well, after my computer automatically rebooted, I got an elegant, minimalistic black screen with a white message:

error file not found

grub rescue&gt;


And that was all - I couldn't boot in anything on my hard disk.


And now, the worst part: later, it turned out that my ext4 partition on which I had installed Kubuntu was gone. Instead of it, I just had 60 GB of unallocated disk space (though my other Linux partitions were fine).

Using Kubuntu Live USB and [Boot Repair](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair) tool, I managed to regain access to my Windows, but recovering the lost partition was more complicated and including typing a lot of unintelligible (to me) things my friend told me to type in the terminal. Luckily, the data on the lost partition were not gone, but I had to recover the partition and recover GRUB, and it's a pain in the ass for a complete newbie.

The moral of the story is: if you it's necessary to survive, stay away from Windows Recovery Environment. When selecting options in GRUB, be careful - I read a story of a guy who had the same problem, but he launched WRE by accident. Even if you don't actually do anything in it, WRE can screw up your GRUB and delete Linux partitions.

**First** SSH, this is how to securely tunnel into your linux box, from another computer. I like to use [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) which is a nice one for windows machines. 

**Secondly** If you are looking for an easy FTP (File transferring) the best tool that I have used is [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php) I found it incredibly easy to use, fast and simple. 

**Some useful commands** : *cd* this is to Change directory for example *cd* /home will bring you to your home directory. 

*mkdir* This is to make a new directory for example; *mkdir* linux. This will make a new directory  called linux. 

**Text editors** I personally prefer nano as it is easy to use, so for nano you would type; *nano* &lt;name of document&gt;.txt . For example; nano first_document.txt and it will bring you into the nano text editor and from here you type control X and then it will ask you to save and you press enter. 


**How to read from a file without opening it** the command for doing this would be that *cat* command. so you would type; *cat* first_document.txt whilst in the directory that it is in and it will print out what the contents of the file is. 

**other small things** some fun commands would be *cal* this displays the calendar or date which displays the date.

What are the challenges of developing for both platforms? Is it just because the majority of developers are using Direct3D instead of OpenGL, or are there more reasons?

I also got it without a CD/DVD optical drive, which up til now was the only way I'd ever installed linux.

First, I tried wubi, which I soon found does not work with Windows 8 due to [UEFI issues](http://askubuntu.com/questions/225048/is-wubi-for-windows-8).

I also tried installing using a USB key I made with unetbootin. I tried both using the automatic download feature of unetbootin and then with a independent downloaded .iso file. No matter what, the computer hangs after the linux bootloader, just with a black screen or the bootloader screen itself freezes.

I have looked into installing using a virtual machine, but from what I can understand, you cannot do this such that you can boot your new partition from outside the VM.

I have disabled secure boot, as well as give Legacy priority over UEFI, in the BIOS, and I am still at a loss as to how I can get Linux running on this machine outside of a VM. It would also be nice to know if this is a problem with the hardware or the BIOS, so that I could make sure to exchange it with a machine that will actually work.

I'd heard Lenovo was very compatible with Linux, but I'm not finding that to be the case.

Many tools that you will find yourself using only show their full potential when used in conjunction with Screen. One of the reasons is that applications can be ran in a terminal session through Screen, and even when the terminal is closed, are still left running. To view your application's progress, simply reattach the Screen session. From anywhere. Screen's true power is it's use remotely via SSH.

The compositor, wherever it sits between these two, provides some kind of buffer to draw to to allow transparency and general awareness of things above and below the window.

I think I've gained enough experience to try something new:

I have a computer (mediocre, but not horrible specs) lying around that I don't really use anymore, and I was wondering if I could use it to create a convenient home server.

I want to realize my project step-by-step:

1. Local networked backup/storage/media server computer: other computers in my home LAN can share data with it, play music from it, automatically schedule backups on it. The server can be used to remotely control other computers (an user directly working on the server must be able to send commands to other computers in the house).

2. ""Cloud"" server, accessible from the public internet: I want to be able to do everything listed in point 1, but through the internet. The goals are being able to share/use data/music/backups not only from inside the house, but also using mobile devices or computers located somewhere else.

3. Website hosting: use the machine to directly host and manage a web page.

So, my question is: **where do I start?**

* I already managed to connect all computers in the house with Samba (both Windows and Linux). 
* The machine I intend to use for the ""server"" is assembled and working.

I'm looking for tutorials/guidelines on how to realize ""point 1"" of my project.

They're easy to install and have access to a huge software repository as well as a very helpful community. The downside may be that this family of distributions  is ""too easy"" or that they're starting to suffer from too much bloat.


Something like Arch or Gentoo makes sense too, since the difficult process of getting them set up helps a new user gain an understanding of the inner-workings of their system. Bloat isn't an issue here because, outside of the base system, you're free to choose how much or how little extra software you'd like to install. However, distributions of this sort are a far cry from something that ""just works"".


I feel that Fedora strikes a balance between the two, though it certainly leans more toward the ""just works"" category. You get a pure desktop environment, unmodified by branding or distro-specific tweaks, the default software selection is rather light, and the repository is robust (especially with the secondary rpmfusion repo for nonfree software). Installation is GUI-driven and lets you exert a lot of control throughout the process. The community isn't as large as Ubuntu's, but it IS a major distro, so help is very easy to find. Finally, Fedora tends to implement new Linux features rather quickly, such as the move to systemd and the /usr merge (for those that like to have the newest of the new).


So I'm wondering why Fedora isn't an oft-recommended distro! By being somewhere in the middle, does it appear blasé? Am I missing some critical flaw?

1258694425.0,31,self.linux4noobs,a6aw6,Here's a little script I wrote that lets you upload pics to imgur via the command line. I'll also explain what everything does so you can see a simple bash script,33,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/a6aw6/heres_a_little_script_i_wrote_that_lets_you/,"http://pastebin.com/f5930edd1 is the script.

It's invoked with ./imgurscript somepic.jpg

All it returns is the direct url to the pic on imgur. I didn't include the delete url, since I've never used it. You need bash, curl, and sed for this to work, but those are all pretty common.

Alright, here's what's happening

    curl -F ""image=@$1"" -F ""key=&lt;YOUR_KEY&gt;"" http://imgur.com/api/upload.xml | sed -e 's|^.*&lt;original_image&gt;\(.*\)&lt;/original_image&gt;.*|\1|' | sed -e '1d' 
that's the code, now let's break it down

    curl -F ""image=@$1""
curl is a tool that lets you upload or grab data from an http server. It's super useful and very very powerful.     curl     -F is the command that lets you POST data to the HTTP server. When you fill out form online, each field is given a name (email address, zip code, etc)     curl     -F ""field=something"" would fill out that field with ""something""

So, this script has the field as ""image=@$1"" the @ is something that is needed by the api, and $1 is the first argument of the script. when you invoke the script with ./imgurscript somepic.jpg , somepic.jpg is the first argument and the string is stored in the variable ""$1""

The next field is the same thing, but it doesn't need $2 (the second argument) because there is no second argument, the api key is always the same, so it's hardcoded in.

The url is the url that curl uploads to.

    | sed -e 's|^.*&lt;original_image&gt;\(.*\)&lt;/original_image&gt;.*|\1|' 

Now the fun part. Sed is a tool that allows you to change the stream of data (stdout).

I pipe the output of the curl command to sed, I do this because the response for the upload is too verbose for my liking.

Here's what curl returns with no modification:

     &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
     &lt;rsp stat=""ok""&gt;&lt;image_hash&gt;11m8d&lt;/image_hash&gt;&lt;delete_hash&gt;lZHpMvpmLc&lt;/delete_hash&gt;&lt;original_image&gt;http://imgur.com/11m8d.jpg&lt;/original_image&gt;&lt;large_thumbnail&gt;http://imgur.com/11m8dl.jpg&lt;/large_thumbnail&gt;&lt;small_thumbnail&gt;http://imgur.com/11m8ds.png&lt;/small_thumbnail&gt;&lt;imgur_page&gt;http://imgur.com/11m8d&lt;/imgur_page&gt;&lt;delete_page&gt;http://imgur.com/delete/lZHpMvpmLc&lt;/delete_page&gt;&lt;/rsp&gt;

I want to grab the data in between &lt;original\_image&gt;  and  &lt;/original\_image&gt;


Since this is pretty ugly for command line usage, let's use sed to grab only the data that I want, which is just the url to the image.

    sed -e 
lets me pass multiple arguments to sed. This lets me do multiple things in one sed call.

    's|^.*&lt;original_image&gt;\(.*\)&lt;/original_image&gt;.*|\1|'
the ""s"" stands for substitute, its a command given to sed. Usually, the command ""sed 's/foo/bar/'"" replaces foo with bar. I don't use the slashes in my command, though, because I want to replace a /, so I use | instead. sed is smart and knows what I'm talking about

    ^.*&lt;original_image&gt;
^ makes sure I'm at the beginning of the line. It's not necessarily needed here, but it's good practice.

    .* 
matches everything up to &lt;original\_image&gt; 
    .     matches one character, and     .*     matches one character at a time until it reaches     &lt;original\_image&gt;    . ""    &lt;original\_image&gt;    "" is also matched.

    \(.*\)
This is a little more tricky to see, but it's really important. The real command here is      (.*)     , but I have to escape the (, so i precede the ( with \

    (.*) 
is the command that says ""take the string that I've specified and put it into a variable"".
The string that I've specified is     .*    , which is everything, but it stops at &lt;/original_image&gt; I then match everything after that with     .*

    |\1
this command takes that variable that I made with     (.*)     and replaces the entire string with the first variable.
In english this is equivalent to saying ""I want to replace the entire line with the information in between &lt;original\_image&gt; and &lt;/original\_image&gt;

     | sed -e '1d' 
I then pipe the results of the first sed to sed again, but I just delete the first line of the data, as I don't need it. the ""1"" says go to the first line, and the ""d"" says delete it.

Hope this has shown you a neat example of sed and how it works. Also, I'm human too, so I probably made mistakes somewhere, let me know :)

Also, I know that I don't need to call another sed, but the way I did it is simple to understand

Sorry for the wall of text.

I've been using Ubuntu 11.04 Natty for a couple of weeks now in an attempt to extend the life of my old decrepit laptop which is struggling under the weight of Windows 7. So far I like it. It's fast; booted and ready to use in just over 60 seconds. It's mostly simple, although I'm struggling to get used to some of the dealings with the command line. To a long-time windows Luddite like me, using the command line in Linux feels like I'm some kind of omnipotent super-hacker – except I don't know what I’m doing.

There are a few things I'd really like to iron out before fully committing to Linux and ditching windows. I need to be secure in the knowledge I can get my work done just as well or better using Linux than by using windows. Any help answering these questions would be greatly appreciated. Please do answer me like I am an idiot.

General Linux question:

What are the different versions of Linux all about? Is it simply a case of the skins and bundles of shit it comes with being different, but it's all the same technical wizardry making it work? I was looking at a friends laptop the other day with Mint 9 installed, and it appeared not a million miles different looking to Win7. Rightly or wrongly that is what I'm well used to so it would be handy for me. Why would I use one version of Linux compared to another?

Ubuntu 110.04 questions:

Extended desktop: I use extended desktop all the time to view large architectural plans but I can't get this to work at all with Ubuntu. Mirroring the desktop on both the laptop screen and the second monitor works but only if the laptop is restarted with the second monitor attached; if it's plugged in while Ubuntu is already running both screens will become garbled immediately. 

Software 1: it's essential for me to be able to view, mark-up and *measure* PDF files. The only software I know of to do this in windows is Foxit reader which comes with a scaled measuring tool as standard. There is a Linux version but for the life of me I cannot get it to install. Anyone know of any alternatives to this or can talk me through baby-steps to get Foxit working?

Software 2: what are your favourite pieces of software for Ubuntu? 

Also, at the top right of the screen there are a set of icons much like the windows system tray. How do I customise this? Specifically the email icon is linked to Evolution, but I use Thunderbird, can I change what the icon does can I get rid of the default and replace it with a TB version?

Resolving the extended desktop question and the PDF question are deal-makers for me.

I've been using Windows since 3.1 so Linux is a big step for me.
I thought my netbook would be a good place to try out Linux because I only use it for internet access.

**So far I'm really impressed by:**

*the speed*
&gt; even off of my usb, my laptop boots about 5 times as fast as it does with windows 7. I would expect it to be a tiny bit faster if I do a solid installation.

*wireless networking*
&gt; wireless networks are super easy to connect to. the lenovo software that came with windows 7 was slow and cumbersome.

*the command line*
&gt; I honestly don't know how to use it, but it's just intriguing. The few commands I've learned so far have only been useful while trying to fix the problems I've encountered, but I'm in love with the shutdown command.

*shutdown*
&gt; just like the boot up, the shutdown command is 5 times faster than the process on windows 7

**Now here are the issues that have me thinking that Linux may not be for me**

*technical support*
&gt; the lack of organized support makes me feel like I'm in a foreign land. When I ask a native Linux-user about Linux, they are speaking a different language.

&gt; my Realtek ethernet card does not immediately work with Linux (not Linux's or Realtek's fault). Trying to resolve the issue, 2 days after I touch Linux for the first time, I have to read about kernels and debian and all these different commands that have 0 explanation with them. Wtf is a kernel? What is debian? Wtf does GREP mean?

&gt; a steep learning curve isn't really the problem, but the problem is that there is no one spot to teach me how to start using Linux and make sure it is working properly with my hardware.

I want to thank everyone that replied. Thanks go to joedonut for making me think about what I was really wanting. I've decided to go with the Debian Netinstall for the experience I'm looking for. The turmoil is born in my distaste for Unity (purely preference and I understand some people do like it) and a lack of ability to properly get a Gnome environment to work properly. I do not properly know what I can remove from Unity and what I've done wrong with Gnome and I've foobared my system at this point.

My journey begins. Hope to be back with you all again soon.

No other means to verify so I just went with the default 686 option the installer had highlighted (I can change it later, right?).

This is my first topic here, and I have a question.  I've seen from my browsing about various subreddits that people have recommended the Ubuntu Live CD (or something, been a while since I've seen it) for recovering files from problem drives running windows, and I want to get some confirmation about it.

Basically, here's the story: My dad recently had a big problem with his work laptop involving some virus, which I was able to fix; it worked for a while and he successfully used it without trouble for nearly a week.  He goes to work today and finds that his laptop won't boot because the windows32 config file is missing; I don't know how this happened, and he obviously doesn't have the installation CD because it's his work computer.  Could I use the aforementioned Ubuntu CD to access his drive and grab some files before he sends the thing to his IT department? 

I've played around with Ubuntu a bit, but generally have little experience with anything linux.  I just want to know if this is viable before I try anything out or if I'm completely wrong. If it matters, his laptop runs some version of XP, most likely SP2.

I apologize ahead of time if I am completely misinformed on the topic or if there is a more appropriate subreddit for this question.  Thanks for your time.

My questions are: 

1. What differences are there between Linux and Windows' utilization of hardware? 

2. Are there certain considerations to make with Linux that aren't necessary/pertinent for Windows? (e.g. DirectX)

3. Is there hardware optimized for Linux, or should common hardware be optimized for Linux?

2. Clone their HDD to my replacement, with 100% continuity, 100% bootable, no faults, no errors, no hiccups, so I can make it a seemlessly installed replacement

**EDIT 2** Clonezilla seems to be the the popular choice for fool-proof cloning, however I do like the more technical approach of `dd`, so I MUST thank /u/msdosuser for his incredibly informative posts. 

For the task detailed in this post, I will be using the `dd` utility to clone the source drive to a type of intermediary to allow me a chance to check it for errors and continuity issues, then I'll be cloning from the image to the destination drive.

What should I expect from Fedora? I assume it's has a vast user based like any distro of linux.
How stream line are installs within Fedora (Command line heavy? Gui heavy?)
The packet manager for Fedora is yum (I think) so I'm assuming that for updates or installing of programs it's along the same lines as Debian?

I have noticed, though, that we tend to get a lot of calls to our help-desk to fix problems when the user fiddles.  Mainly, it's viruses.  I removed 600 viruses from a workstation recently.  

There are two major problems I can foresee.

* Medical proprietary software will not run on Wine
* My boss is petrified of *Nix systems, even though he uses a Mac.

I assume if I cannot get the operatories to run it's software on Wine, I can at least recommend Linux for the office workstations.  This should cut down the number of viruses, and general fiddling.

My boss would be the major sticking point.  He is utterly petrified of Linux, which I find hysterical since he is using OSx.  While I am no means a pro, I am the only one in the office with any form of *nix experience, so I need to figure out a way to make transition easy if this were approved.

I just know that Debian and Ubuntu and others use APT to install software, Fedora uses Yum (I think, I have never used Fedora), Arch Linux uses Pacman, and there are many more package managers that I haven't mentioned.

How is it possible that games from Steam can install without using any of these package managers? As far as I know, these games can install on any distro.

And another question: seeing as these games can install anywhere, why does regular software need to be made into .deb or .rpm files? Why not just do it the same way Steam does? One format for all distros. It seems that it would make it a lot easier.

I know there are many factors that I haven't thought of.

I found OpenSUSE, installed it, and I love it so far.

The problem is that using it for any more than a few minutes gives me a feeling of seasickness. I can't figure out what's causing it. The animations don't seem out-of-the-ordinary, and I've tried changing the screen brightness so I don't think it's that. I can still use Windows for hours without any problems, so it's definitely OpenSUSE specific.

Here are some things that might be causing it, but they're all pretty doubtful:

* F.lux. I use it on Windows, so maybe my eyes just aren't used to the harsher screen. I don't think this is the case though, because I was able to use Ubuntu and Mint without problems. (Bonus question: Can anyone help me figure out how to install F.lux onto OpenSUSE? The terminal commands didn't work.)

* I have eye strain problems with games and programs that have blurry textures/graphics. OpenSUSE doesn't have any blurry graphics, so I don't think that's the problem here.

* Maybe the OpenSUSE desktop is locked at an odd framerate? I've never had nausea issues involving framerates so that's probably not the issue either.

I would enjoy something that is documented well and allows for a good amount of customization. I am not looking for a Windows replacement, but it might just end up being that with Steam progressing towards Linux compatibility.

What I use my computer for:

* Surfing the web
* Listening to music
* Playing games (I realize I will not be able to use steam or any other windows games, that doesn't bother me the least, a lot of games I enjoy are also available for linux.)
* Watching movies
* Programming (this is something I would like to do in the future.)

For srs.

Mkay maybe not.

Since this is a laptop, are there settings I need to edit to handle power management?

Once I get this thing on the network, it will be lid-closed, accessed via ssh. I'd like it to be quiet, cool, and patiently waiting.

I've tried to find information on configuring power settings via the command line, but had no luck.

**EDIT**

I just realized that because I had previously removed the screen from the laptop (A failed DIY attempt...) I had disconnected the sensors that would detect the lid-close. So... problem solved?

I'd still like to get it configured best for my situation - which is low-power, always-on.

**EDIT II**

And now I discover that I can't connect to the network :\

system-config-network brings up the text based config, but there are no devices listed.

I'm currently running Windows 7. I don't have a big problem with it, but there are many reasons why I like Linux. I like the way it's set up, its customization, the freedom it gives to the user, and etc. I'm not really sure why I want to switch, but I find Linux very interesting and the more I learn about it, the more I am disappointed with Windows, and want to switch; but there are problems.

You see, like many of you (I assume), I'm a gamer. Linux unfortunately has mediocre support for games (if only Valve made Steam to be Linux only, maybe some devs would jump in the bandwagon..). There are obviously some games that run on it, but I'm not sure if I can run all of them through WINE.

On top of that, I have an ATi card AND a CPU that doesn't have VT-x support. With my experience with Linux so far (mainly Ubuntu), ATi drivers *suck*. The reason why I mentioned VT-x support is because I can easily just run a Linux distro in VirtualBox/VMWare. I can, but it really doesn't run that well.

The reason why I'm ranting so much is because I'm mad that if I'm going to use a Linux distro as my main OS, I'm going to have to dual-boot just to play my favourite games. I'm obviously not the only person who's dealing with this, but it's frustrating, and the only thing I can do to ease the situation is to build a PC with (preferably) an nVidia card and any CPU (there's *nothing* that doesn't have VT-x support now. Curse my damn Q8200).

Again, sorry for the wall-of-text rant. I don't really know why I even did this. I know reasons why I should switch from Windows to Linux, but there are so many things that are holding me back. What do I do?

EDIT: Okay it seems that *some* of you guys didn't exactly read the whole rant or something. I *have* dual-booted before, and I *have* ran it in VMware and Virtualbox. Why do you think I was talking about VT-x? I said it doesn't run well in virtualization. And I have dualbooted before, why do you think I'm complaining about it?

I've been distro-hopping ever since I discovered linux in the beginning of this year, and I've tried a fair number of distros (it helps that I have 3 machines I am not really using much). Perhaps I haven't gotten as acquainted as I should with all of them, but I think I have given each one enough due to answer the question of distro choice for other noobs like me. However, I will stress that there are still quite a few I haven't tried yet, so I will need a bit of help from the community with those.

So, onwards with the list:

* Ubuntu:

    * Pros: 
        * The most popular distro, so you'll rarely have to worry about not having your technical issue answered. 
        * Easy to set-up, everything more or less works out-of-the-box.
        * Large and fairly up-to-date repository. PPAs are available for even more cutting-edge software, but does contain security risks.
        * Being (previously) based on Debian, Ubuntu uses the Synaptics/aptitude package manager, making installing software a snap.
    * Cons:
        * Some consider it to contain a lot of bloat (Ubuntu One, Evolution etc.). Even the KDE and XCFE versions seem to be quite slow depending on the machine. Not recommended for older hardware.
        * Lots of hand-holding. Assuming typical usage, it would almost never break, so you rarely have to get at the Linux innards to fix things. (This could be a good or bad thing depending on your needs)
        * 11.04 will come with Unity. Oh dear lord.

* Debian:

    * Pros:
        * Stable. You will never have to worry about reliable ol' Debian failing catastrophically. Making it the perfect choice for servers.
        * Backports and apt-pinning allow you more freedom with your software, allowing you to choose which version you wish to install, at a cost to that aforementioned rock-solid stability.
        * No non-free (as in freedom) software included by default, though some Debian based distros will install those software by default (Crunchbang etc.)
        * aptitude/Synaptics is easy to use and very intuitive (see Ubuntu)
    * Cons: 
        * ""Debian comes in three flavours: rusty, old, and stale.""
        * There are certain fragments of the community that can be considered elitist jerks. But it's pretty safe to assume they are the exception rather than the norm.

* Arch Linux

    * Pros:
        * Rolling-release - there's no reinstalling of the newest version to worry about, just do pacman -Syu/yaourt -Syua.
        * Customizable. You basically start off with a blank slate, so you can install only the software you need.
        * You'll learn more about the software you install with Arch, since you pretty much have to write all the configs yourself.
        * The ABS and AUR makes installing software that aren't in the main repositories quick and easy, if you know what you are doing.
        * Helpful community. Being smaller, the community seems to be more tight-knit. (Though this come at a cost of certain biases)
        * Their Wiki is AWESOME.
    * Cons:
        * Until you've set-up mostly everything you need, your initial period after the install is done will be spent writing config files.
        * Being cutting-edge, it's more prone to breakage, though it only happens very rarely.
        * No package signing. Without getting into the technical details, this is basically a huge security flaw. But so far nothing bad has happened, and package signing is being worked on.
        * If you are both new to GNU/Linux and **not** technically-inclined, this is not the distro for you.

* Gentoo:
   * Pros:
        * *Very* cutting edge, also a ""rolling release"" distro like Arch.
        * Everything you install will be compiled from source. Coupled with a good make.conf and USE flags, each package is optimized down to the core for your machine.
        * You will learn more about Linux than any other distro during the installation process alone. Guaranteed.
        * Very good documentation. From what I understand it was the de-facto source on Linux knowledge before the Arch Wiki rolled around.
    * Cons:
        * You'll be spending a while compiling all that optimized software. Openoffice, the biggest source package in the repository, took me roughly 7 hours to compile on my laptop. 14 on my netbook. YMMV. (Note that most do not take this long. But it is going to take you more time than other distros)
        * I would argue that portage is the most non-user-friendly ""package manager"" I used
        * Development seems to be slower than other distros, but I'm not subbed to the mailing list so I could be very wrong.
        * Many, many things could go wrong during the install. Took me 3 whole days to get the system to a workable state. Be prepared to spend a week on the install alone if you are not experienced.
        * The documentation isn't what it used to be. 

That's all I have so far. I intend to keep this list updated as I try new things (I know the list isn't nearly comprehensive enough yet, with Fedora, OpenSUSE and PCLinuxOS etc. to be tried, Slackware is next on the list), or as the community gives out more tips. I know there are some things I didn't get into (the Arch init system, for instance.) but this is intended to be more of a newbie resource.

I don't want to be a Windows sheep, but having been ""raised"" on Microsoft all my working life, Ubuntu is just ridiculously frustrating.  I simply want to be able to read my mail, browse the web, listen to music, watch the occasional video, and that's about it.  I'm not a gamer, I'm not a graphic artist, I'm not a programmer.

But Microsoft has leveraged its position in the market to place itself as the sole/default key signer. Hardware vendors are shipping motherboards etc. with *only* Microsoft keys, so other OSes have to get their stuff signed by Microsoft or trust that their users are competent enough to turn off SecureBoot/UEFI in the BIOS.

The solution that I've seen from Ubuntu, Fedora/Redhat and the Linux foundation is to capitulate to Microsoft, get them to sign a bootloader called Shim, and hope that Microsoft never revokes the keys or otherwise move the goalposts. I also think that openSUSE is using the same process. 

I have two questions:

* Firstly, do I have my information correct and up-to-date?
* Secondly, is there an option for me to avoid Microsoft's *SecureBoot* altogether? I actually don't have a UEFI capable computer so ""turn it off"" is not a sufficient answer.

Fixing stuff following forums directions is a necessary evil sometimes while we are noobs, not the proper way to learn. Make some hardware work makes you no more linux savvy.

My advice in no particular order:

* Even tho lots of programs have visual interfaces, most of them have the possibility to be called from command line with switches. Thats the biggest strength we have since everything is scriptable.  Learn bash and perl/python scripting so you can at least read them. Better if you can do your own... You can ask questions in real time in irc #bash @ freenode
* Dont install gentoo, arch, slackware, etc... You have everything you need in ubuntu right now. You want to go from easy to medium to hard while learning, just like any other thing you learn. Why people recommend hard stuff at the beggining is beyond me... There is plenty to do with your current installation right now. You can read gentoo and arch wikis as tutorials to learn whats different from your own installation tho.
* I type these several times everyday and so i have some binds for them. Useful commands to learn more about your installation are:
  * dpkg -S /path/to/file
  * apt-file search -x \\/file$
  * apt-file list package
  * dpkg -L package
  * apt-cache show package
  * aptitude search word (show status of every package with 'word' in its name in locally known repositories vs dpkg -l word that only search locally known packages)
* learn basics about apache and mysql, since lots of programs use them
* learn about partitions, lvm and mount. Sooner or later you are going to have to move stuff around.
* ssh is your friend. Learn it, use it, embrace it. From scp to sshfs, passing throu tunneling, proxying, proxy socks..
* learn certicates basics. Id say those basics is what is necessary to be able to mount an openvpn tunnel if you understand what you are doing.
* learn ip tool. ip a, ip n, ip r. Basic networking knowledge is always helpful to diagnose problems
* Dont be afraid to look at source to understand what something does. Only if you can read those. Its our biggest strength in linux. Only if you like it. Not necessary at all. strace and ltrace can help you with this sometimes
* strace can tell you easily what files is reading a program when it starts for troubleshooting.
* Find something just a little above what you know and try to make it work. (ex. dont try to learn sendmail as your first task)
* learn one thing at a time but be no afraid to read more of the basics if you have trouble following something. Maybe its too hard for you in that moment. Be careful as well of digging too deep. Things to learn are too damn wide and large and time is finite. You might be sucked up into something that wasnt what you were trying to make work in the first place.
* lpic is a linux certification. No need to take the exam, but look at the topics and learn them. All thats mention is really basic stuff to learn.
* learn the ways of the community and understand most of them are volunteers. Thats it:
  * usually eager to cooperate if you are not a jerk.
  * They carry no obligation with you of any kind. If anything, you owe them.
  * strong sense of doacracy. Those who do make the calls. Talkers and most noisy people are usually considered as linux tabloids. Not very relevant. Everybody enjoys a flame now and then, but be wary of not being sucked into that.
  * Again, most if not all of these are carried on by volunteers. This is a sock for windows users since they tend to think of themselves as clients of the programs instead users that kindly got a gift from a developer. Developers love to have users, but they are not trying to sell you anything. Since everything you receive is a gift... dont be a jerk.
* virtual machines can make your life easier to try out stuff without breaking your system. Only virtualbox. If you feel you like this area, kvm with virt-manager to learn more, but its by no means necessary to go that road.

edit*: Some more advice.

* If some hardware does not work after a little fight, do not get frustrated with it. Return it and buy something that does. You can ask the clerk if they know it works with linux or if they dont know, ask what are the return policies. Easy and painless... as i said, making some hardware work gains you nothing (unless you particularly enjoy making it work, witch most of us just want it to work, but then you are hardly a noob to be reading this on the frist place). If only i had understood this before, i would have started with it sooner instead of thinking it was hard at all...

source: I had never used linux 4 years ago and now i made my living with it for the last 1.5 year

PS1: I moved a year ago from ubuntu to debian just because thats where the deccision making, the bug fixing and the discussion is. There is no need to move but i feel more confortable fixing stuff at the source of problems.

PS2: linux is vast. This are general advices. It all depends on what you want to achieve with linux. By no means is necessary to follow all advices since time is finite. Just those that apply better to your current 'status -&gt; goal' pair

I was wondering if there was a list of the primary ""tools"" one uses to look into Linux boxes and fix certain errors. I am aware that Linux has so many distros and tools that are available, but I was hoping to at least get an idea of standard best practices. Possibly get an idea of Linux's version of msconfig, msinfo32, dxdiag, gpedit, regedit, etc. Also if there is any documentation on understanding the file structure better, that would be amazing. I have already begun reviewing some documentation myself.

- What is GTK+?
- If relevant, how do the previous two things gel together?
- Is there any RAD tool/suite that you would recommend that would be similar to M$ Visual Studio where one can code/test/debug/compile/run in one place.

For further info, I am quite happy with Perl (have to use it in my job), and I'm currently learning Python for when I get my Raspberry Pi :-)

While I’ve dabbled with linux in the past, I recently bought a Raspberry Pi and so I’m starting to learn a lot more about linux, specifically at the command line. However, I find a lot of things to be rather non-intuitive.

For example, I recently installed the Alpine mail client to use with my gmail account from the Pi’s command line. Via man alpine I was able to figure out how to set up the smtp server pretty easily. Setting up the imap server for the inbox took me a bit longer, and I had to spend some time on google as I wasn’t finding what I needed in the manual pages.

While reading various sites online, I came across a tip that if you create a .pine-passfile file in your home directory, Alpine can use it to store your password so you don’t have to repeatedly authenticate. There’s no mention of this in the manual pages or in the in-program help -- the only way I knew how to do it was by relying on the experience of others.

I guess I have this notion that I should be able to use the resources available within linux and within the program to figure out how to use it, but I haven’t found that to be the case. Maybe I need to get over that and just be grateful that there’s a large online community that is happy to share what they know! But I’m also curious to know what other people’s process of discovery and learning is. Thanks!

Pics included,19,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/17kybj/having_some_graphical_problems_in_wine_with_an/,"So for the past few months I've been playing around with different linux distributions and messing with wine on an old Dell running a Pentium 4 and a Radeon x600 (I believe).

I'm trying to get a game from 1998, [Turok 2: Seeds of Evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turok_2:_Seeds_of_Evil), to work in wine.

I've had some problems getting it working, and now when I run it, it looks like this: 

http://i.imgur.com/rNtApwJ.png

http://i.imgur.com/GPXBs4a.png

(EDIT: [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Turok2screen2.jpg) is what it should look like)

As you can see, the environment is grey and mostly invisible, minus a few objects 

It also runs very slow, but that might just be my hardware.

The game runs directx 6.1, and I'm not sure if that affects wine as I know that it targets directx 9 games. I've messed with many different settings, re-installed it multiple times, and still no luck.

Some notes:

-I figured out that I had to install it with wine set to windows 95, but the directx install fails unless I set it to windows 2000 for some reason. (I retried it after installing the game)

-At first the game wouldn't run because it wasn't detecting the disc in my CD-Rom drive, so I installed a crack to bypass it (not sure if this  is what broke the game though).

-I've tried running it on Ubuntu Ultimate edition, and regular Ubuntu with gnome 3, same result. (Ubuntu 12.04 lts | Wine 1.4)

-I've tried some winedbg commands, but it didn't really help me.

-The intro screen normally shows a 3D iguana with the name of the studio under it, but in wine it shows up as a moving white triangle.

Is there anything else I can do? The Wine app database shows that someone got the German version working, but right now I'm at a loss.

Any help is appreciated.

However, I can't hibernate. When I try hibernating, my laptop seems to shut down instead, and doesn't save the session. After some searching, I think this is because I don't have a swap partition...?  

I didn't read much about partitioning before installing Mint (probably was too excited to install) so when I tried to create a swap partition, I realized that my arrangement wasn't very well thought out since I can't have more than four primary partitions...

My current partitions are:  
/dev/sda1 - ntfs Windows partition  
/dev/sda3 - /root partition  
/dev/sda4 - /home partition  
/dev/sda2 - extended partition

I want to rearrange the partitions so I have a swap partition, and another extended partition in case I want to install another distro. How should I set up the partitions for this, and how would I go about doing this?

But I can run a tool from Broadcom to update the firmware on the card.

What is the distinction? How are the fw files used by Linux? Is the fw file necessarily tied to the driver? (i.e. if you update the driver do you also have to update the fw files?)

EDIT:

I found a more complete explanation. Here it is, in case someone else wants to know:

Some cards do not have a EEPROM onboard with firmware, or only have a subset of the firmware they need in order to run properly. This is probably an attempt to reduce manufacturing costs. These devices need to have the data in the fw (or bin) files uploaded to then when they are initialized; the driver is responsible for doing this. 

Tools that ""flash the firmware"" update the EEPROM on the device (so you can theoretically move it to another machine and it retains the update). These tools may also update the fw files in /lib/firmware but I'm not sure about that.

Sometimes there is an update to a driver that will expect certain functions to be available on the device. This may require a firmware update for the device to have those functions available for the driver to use. So there may be a relationship between driver versions and firmware versions, but it's not a strict relationship, afaik.

1361558260.0,20,self.linux4noobs,19191h,"My standard suite of software, now with more Linuxy flavored gaming. [x-post from /r/linux]",24,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/19191h/my_standard_suite_of_software_now_with_more/,"I just found out about /r/linux4noobs today, so I subbed and thought that this post that I made over in /r/linux might be better suited here.
    
(Wall-o-text warning. See end for TL;DR.)
    
Throughout my experiences on all operating systems, I've found that I have to have a certain suite of software capable of the following (some more obvious than others). In conversation with others, I've noticed a pretty standard trend of what folks typically need. The below list is the type of software that most folks add, plus a couple other additions that are a bit more limited in audience:
    
* Anti-virus
* Web browser
* Office suite (most specifically, for documents and spreadsheets)
* Multi-purpose media player
* Fully capable archive management
* Graphics suites (traditional, vector, and 3D)
* Audio manipulation
* E-Book management (a recent addition to my necessities list)
* ...and Games (who wouldn't need this!?)
    
One thing that has gotten just that much easier with the recent addition of Steam on the Linux platform is gaming. This obviously was the largest hurdle for most people. (As good as WINE and PlayOnLinux are, there's definitely a number of things they can't do.)
    
With all of that in mind, I'd like to share my list of applications that I typically install to capture all of these needs. **Most importantly, all of this software works quite well on both Linux AND Windows.**
    
* Avast anti-virus - This is a personal choice, and there are a number of alternatives across both platforms. Avast just happens to be my favorite.  *As a thing to add from my original post of this, there is a native client for Linux, but it was suggested that Clamav might be a good choice.*
* Chrome browser - Google does a fantastic job augmenting the Chromium browser with their services, and it works fantastically across every platform. As a side note, I also use it on my Galaxy Note.
* LibreOffice suite - The Libre fork has really kept it alive for me. No bleeding money to purchase the Microsoft flavored suite. So far, I haven't come across an office-related document that didn't work just fine in Libre's offering.
* VideoLan (VLC) media player- Let's face it, it's probably the best all-around media playing suite there is. It plays just about everything and has tons of options. Tough to beat.
* GIMP image manipulation - This rivals Photoshop in a few places. It's definitely not going to beat it in the niche areas, and I probably wouldn't suggest it for your professional graphic designer who is likely working in a shop with others using Adobe, but for home or small business use, it's an excellent choice.
* Inkscape vector graphics - This does the trick for vector. The tools are easy to get used to. Check it out if you haven't.
* Blender 3D modeling - A bit tough to get started on if you're not familiar with 3D modeling, but once you start, you can't stop.
Audacity audio manipulation - Great suite, super handy for chopping up stuff and other manipulation.
* Calibre E-Book management - Works on so many devices...I keep my library on my network storage and load things from there. It converts between formats when you need it to.
* Steam - What can be said that hasn't been said 100 times in the last few weeks. As Steam continues to pick up *ahem* steam, more and more games will make their way to the Linux world in native format. (As an aside, the Humble Bundles, http://humblebundle.com[1] , have also done quite a bit for everyone in that area.)
    
I can't stress enough that all of the things I've listed above work in both the Windows and Linux world, (many of them, if not all...I'm not sure, also work in the Mac world as well). These are programs that I have found useful...your mileage may vary.

So I've got Ubuntu desktop 11.04 installed. I tried following a tutorial to get tightVNC running but I couldn't get my laptop to connect to it, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'd rather just start back at the beginning. I'm also totally cool with installing a different OS if anyone thinks that would be a better idea.

Just purchased Asus A53U laptop, wiped the drive, and put Arch on it.

This is the first laptop that I'm actually using on an everyday basis. So I have a question: isn't the laptop fan supposed to spin down after suspend? If so, I have a problem on my hands - it doesn't. I installed laptop mode tools, pm-utils, upower, acpid... nothing helps hmm It looks like suspend is working as the device does turn off the screen and I get a tty-like screen right before that, and it does wake up from it correctly. However, the fan keeps spinning all the time, which is definitely killing the battery.

Help?

EDIT: So apparently suspend does nothing except for turning off the screen (fan is still spinning and the LED is not blinking as it is supposed to). Running pm-suspend switches me to text mode (tty-like mode), but then apparently gets stuck at ""freezing user space processes"" . pm-suspend.log reveals nothing or rather says ""success"" everywhere. I tried [this](http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug) script, many users reported that it is working now, but not for me. If I use that script, pm-suspend gets stuck in terminal adding

to the pm-suspend.log. Notice the absence of ""success"" here.

* Install packages using apt and dpkg as well as Synaptic
* Basic commands like ls, |, &gt; and basic bracket expansion

* Write some BASH scripts (though currently I don't know what they are or what they do, only that is BASH is the shell)
* Get some games running with Wine (I've heard that WoW runs better under WINE than in Windows, is this true? I could run WoW acceptably on this netbook so in theory it should work under linux too, right?)
* Fix up my old desktop and installed Arch.

So my question is this, what should I do now to learn more about Linux? Is there some sort of distro-agnostic guide I could follow? Thanks!

It's running windows 8. Long story short it was cheap and pretty new, relatively good stats for its dirt-level prices. 

I play a LOT of minecraft (FTB ultimate pack FTW) and my main rig isn't strong enough to be both client AND Server. So this cheap Win8 laptop has been playing as the server while my main is the client. Thing is, Win8 isn't the most optimal server OS. It devotes a lot of resources to stuff that has nothing to do with serving Minecraft. 

So I had an idea of using a linux boot on it that dedicates all of its resources to serving instead of maintaining a pretty GUI and a bunch of superfluous multimedia functions.

Is Linux good for this? Is it even recommended? And if so, which distribution? And how do I set it up? I'd rather not lose my win8 install since I use this laptop to keep in touch and for art (drawing with my wacom tablet) when I'm out and about, and my art program of choice is sadly windows exclusive (PaintTool SAI). 

I suppose I could try to make a dual-boot partition, but I worry about if it might force me to wipe my drive (I've heard some rather frightening stories too)

Alternatively I was wondering if using a live CD that basically does nothing but load a linux kernel command line that can at least execute the java code of the server if nothing else, but would running it from a live CD/DVD entirely defeat the purpose?

My situation could be fixed with money of course, by just buying a better server machine, but the whole reason I'm here is that although a tantalizing option, it is not an option *for me*. 

My laptop (the server) already has a discernible positive impact on my main rig's gaming experience. Splitting the workload between them (client and server) gives me a drastic boost to stability and fps, but my poor little laptop chugging along experiences a fair bit of lag. Mobs move in 1-second Fits and Starts, *especially* when a friend visits my server from the 'net. ANY slight performance improvement would be a huge boon. 

So is this even a good idea?

**TL; DR** Should I take Fedora, Xubuntu or... (sth else)? I know both distributions feature the so-called lightweight XFCE DE so I think I should use that with my old laptop.

Here's my history and then some facts:

* Used Ubuntu 7.10 for 2 months when it came out, uninstalled it since I was way more productive with Windows.

* Used Ubuntu 11.04 for 4 weeks, then uninstalled it since I had to start with a term paper and couldn't fiddle around with some experimental system anymore. Not that I wanted to transfer fully, but I just uninstalled it. It was fine to deal with the console and commands but I was very slow.

* The old laptop is a Lenovo T61. It has 2 GB of RAM, some Intel Core 2 Duo CPU with ~ 2.33 GHz and runs ok-ish with Win 7. It is pretty slow at times when I simultaneously work in, let's say, Word 2010 while Thunderbird, Firefox and Excel 2010 are running in the background. Not that I expect some rock solid performance out of (any) Linux (distribution) but Win 7 is a bit too much apparently and the most important part, it is huuuge and it takes about 3 minutes to boot. So all in all, it is a bit mind numbing in the big picture.

* I am going to have a dual boot setup on my laptop at first.

* Over time (could be anything from 6 weeks to 6 months) I am aim to fully convert to Arch Linux in terms of Linux at one point. I don't need to rush things and if I hit a bump in the road I might jsut put it on the side and keep on working on it later.

* I want to use it for (normal) office stuff and the usual browsing, plus maybe some LaTeX stuff. That's all I can think off right now.

* If I could uninstall Windows 7, the better.

* One thing though: All that Ubuntu belief / system / paradigm / hype... not for me. I see Ubuntu has a big load of implemented tools and eases the pain setting things up, but my *personal* feeling is that Ubuntu kind of locks you in out of comfort, meaning I'd be the kidn of user who definitely would get used to the easy way of Ubuntu. Plus, the ""dash"" thingy is a bit too political-monetary for my taste.

If you read it all: Thank you for reading, I hope it wasn't too long. :)

Anyway. I want to make sure wireless is solid on whatever netbook I get, and it would be good if some not-so-beginner-friendly distributions worked without a lot of tweaking. Durability is also a big thing. Recommendations for specific models would be great but specific hardware components to look for or avoid might be helpful too. A lot of people recommend ThinkPads but I've heard the 11.6"" one doesn't have the same reliability. The Eee PC line seems quite Linux-friendly and the Acer Aspire One is also supposed to be good.

I just don't know what distro to choose. I know Ubuntu is the first choice for newbies, but I'm looking for something that will fit my needs (maybe Ubuntu would after all?)

First, I do play PC games, but until Steam is fully to go with Linux, I'll be sticking with Windows 7 and dual-booting whatever Linux distro I end up choosing. But something that will fit nicely with this when that time comes (if it ever does). Also, I do use two monitors, I think I read once that one of the distros (Ubuntu?) had some problems with dual-monitors. Probably wrong about that.

Second, I am a programmer (in training). I'm in my second year of my Comp Sci degree and I'm fairly proficient at C++. Whether it be my fault or not, we've never had to use Unix or any command-line interface to write our programs - we've been taught to use Visual Studio from day one, and I still write all my code in it. But I notice that a lot of programmers use Linux with stuff like gcc and what not, and I wonder if I'm missing out on something.

So I have a Raspberry Pi and it's running Debian Wheezy.

I got a great frontend emuation program running well on it ([RetroPi/EmulationStation](http://petrockblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/retropie-setup-an-initialization-script-for-retroarch-on-the-raspberry-pi/)) with my controllers and everything.

Currently, to launch the frontend, I need to log in as user ""pi"" and then run the command ""emulationstation"" - and from there, I can control everything using my SNES controller.  

Ideally, I want to remove the need for a keyboard.  I want to have just the controllers, and when the Pi turns on, I want it to boot directly into the frontend.

Can anybody help me achieve this?  Or point me in the direction of a tutorial?

Thanks ahead.

**RESOLUTION**:

I had to edit /etc/rc.local and just add the line /root/RetroPie/EmulationStation/emulationstation

Thank you for your suggestions.

**FURTHER UPDATE**
The edit I made to rc.local was able to boot the frontend, but the way the frontend was installed, it would launch EmulationStation, but then it wouldn't launch the RetroArch emulators.

I tinkered for a while and added the following command to rc.local which got it to launch properly with no issues inside of the software:

su - root -c emulationstation

Now it boots into the EmulationStation frontend, which can be controlled with my USB/SNES controller.  From there I can navigate, pick a game, and then launch it.

I never needed root to run ifconfig from ubuntu...).

The last straw was when I went to make a backup to an external usb drive (just to see how to do it using the cli - again, this is all new to me). So I make the backup, then I issue ""umount /media/My\ Passport"" and I get as an error: ""umount: /media/My Passport is not in the fstab (and you are not root)"" which seemed like a double taunt to me.

HD0 - 250g Seagate PATA

HD1 - 75g Western Digital (I'm keeping the smaller HD as a backup drive, and will probably leave the NTFS formatting. )


I've installed Linux Mint on older laptops with much success, so I'm going to set this up with Mint as well. This will be the first time I won't bother with the dual-boot, I'm going totally Linux all the way on this, and I'd just like a reality check on something.

My plan is to format the 250g HD into 3 partitons:

/ (root) = 25g

/home = 220g

/swap = 4g



The idea is that if I need to reinstall something later, or switch from, say, Mint to Ubuntu, then all I should need to worry about would be my / partiton. Is that correct? The home partition would still have my program settings and data files, if I understand this correctly, and would not be affected by a reinstall or upgrade. 

Appreciate any comments on this.

So, any gaming would be slightly older games, nothing too hardware intensive. Mostly old RPG and strat games. 

I'm an audio guy, and I spend a lot of time doing different kinds of sound work with Pro Tools. Not expecting to be able to run PT on this, don't even know if people have done that successfully with linux. BUT, it'd be interesting if I could do some efficient file management (I have a really large database of recordings and samples that I'd like to organize and tag with metadata, if you're familiar at all with soundminer or basehead then you'll know what I'm getting at) and perhaps some basic waveform editing (like a single track soundforge type deal). I primarily work in film &amp; TV, which usually calls for a fairly quick computer with a separate graphics card. 

Another thing to note (maybe?) is that I use windows phone 8 on my mobile, and so it could be nice to be able to sync it up with my computer, though a lot of the stuff I'd want there has to do with SkyDrive, Dropbox, and calendars, which is all pretty much cloud based.

Here's a rundown of (some of) the hardware on this:
Intel Core 2 Duo T5870 @ 2.00Ghz
778 Mhz, 1.96 GB RAM
Intel Mobile Display Adapter (4 series?)
Intel WiFi Link 5100 AGN
Conexant HD SmartAudio 221
some sort of DVDRW drive - could probably figure out model if important

I think I could dig up more on the hardware specs, but I'm not exactly sure what's important to know in this case. Maybe motherboard model? Anyhow, yeah.

Ultimately, I'm interested in Linux because A. I like tweaking and customizing. A lot. I'm kind of obsessed with efficiency. B. I enjoy learning about how my technology is REALLY working. C. Windows XP SP3 is sort of annoying me, and I feel that maybe it's not utilizing the system resources efficiently, and support is being dropped soon/has been dropped already. D. I am avoiding buying another Windows 7 license. I got one through my school, but I've since graduated, and looking into it, it seems that it'd cost me like $70 at least.

I really appreciate anyone who actually reads all this and has any suggestions or thoughts. And, if I'm kind of making an /r/linux4noobs faux pas in posting this, and there's somewhere I should be looking first, please let me know. In the past, I've gone through a lot of effort (perhaps too much?) to do a crapton of googling and research, only to find myself in analysis-paralysis and realizing that I wasn't really researching effectively or that I could've asked for assistance at some point. Thanks everyone.


EDIT: UPDATE I went ahead and installed Mint 15 XFCE. I'm liking it so far, I think that this will be a good enough distro for my wanting to learn more about how to -really- work with Linux, while still having a user friendly GUI to make things happen quickly when I need to. Have already started experimenting with the terminal to do different things like managing installs and other easy things, and I'm sure it will all progress from there.

Hi,

first of all: I do not have a working Linux distribution at the moment which is why I couldn't register at the AL forums and post this there.

So I followed the [official Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide). I have a few questions:

1. What's with internet not being enabled on startup? I have to activate it via dhcpcd after reboots. Is this normal behavior? I actually don't mind, just wondering. It has some ""security"" aspect to it (for the lack of a better term, non-native speaker here), I like that.

1. Then, in direct relation to 1., how could I make a symbol on the desktop which would start up my ethernet adapter (Intel 82566-somethign)?

1. The keyboard layout is back to *us* after a reboot although I think I followed [the instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide#Chroot_and_configure_the_base_system) correctly. How can I change it stays permanently on *de* (German)?

1. The font in the console always is set back to the old typewriter one, although I like the Lat2-Terminus16 one better. Same here, I think I followed the instructions correctly.

1. I immediately installed the full XFCE4 package (pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies) and [slim](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM) as the Login Manager. The login only is in TTY1 though and if I start X via startx, I have one three very ugly weird green-white windows in front of me.

I am a sysadmin with 16 years of experience in Windows and VMware administration.  I was thinking recently of working on a Linux+ certification.  I have spent my entire career in Windows, and Linux has always been on the periphery for me.  But I see it catching up a lot in the enterprise, and a lot of applications for it in other areas (for instance, if you work on NetApp storage and have at least a decent grasp of Linux you can administer the whole thing through the console, useful if there is a network issue preventing other avenues to the NetApp)

My question to the community is:  Is the Linux+ certification worthwhile.  Is a class really required, or would self study be sufficient for someone like myself who already understands the fundamentals of computing (DNS, file management, networking fundamentals, security etc etc)  I'm not a super genius or anything, but I always manage to get the job done.

I'm just looking for some input from some professionals who have some understanding of the Linux administration world.

My favorite things to do though, all have to do with networking, such as making Ajax calls to grab feeds or interacting with api's.  I have an ok understanding of what I'm doing, but don't have a real firm grasp of the underlying technologies that I use, which isn't completely necessary to do my job, but it's something I feel is important if I want to be any good.

I have set up lamp servers on virtual machines to play around with, but I always end up getting distracted by my ignorance.  So this time, rather than set something up locally, I decided to purchase a hosting plan that allows shell access, since I only have one physical computer to mess around with at home.  This probably wasn't even necessary, but that's because I'm not even sure where to start.

All I really want to be able to do is set up a secure testing environment where I can make Ajax calls in whatever language I decide to use (prob PHP and JavaScript, but I want to learn Python and Ruby too), and it looks like these are the things I need to learn:

* Apache configuration (best .htaccess and config file practices)
* User configuration (what folders require what privileges)
* Some good shell commands that will help with the above, and any other web dev related stuff.   

Maybe this would better be posted in /r/webdev , but it all seems very linux-centric as well. (setting up Wamp and Xampp servers is easy and doesn't require any knowledge of what I'm doing)

I've been able to establish ssh access using putty to the server, and I can xfer files using sftp, but there is something up with my permissions cause I can't even write files right now.  I was able to a few days ago, and then I must've done something stupid, and now I can't even write files.

I've used Windows all my life, as a gamer and internet addict. The last few times I installed it, for various reasons, I was lazy: put a new hard drive in the case and installed to that. There's lots of debris on the other disks from abandoned installations of Windows. Today I ran out of space on one of the drives and thought it was a good time to do something about it.

I consider myself a techie, but I've only flirted with Linux on netbooks and laptops. Had it there, wasn't forced to use it kind of thing. At the same time I'm heavily interested in programming, but not learning because of the aforementioned organizational issues.  

What I want to do is dual boot: Linux for general use, so that I can learn to use it, while keeping a Windows install around for the occasional game session.

* I have four internal hard drives. One is an SSD. Is it as advantageous to install Linux to an SSD as it is with Windows?

* How can I set up dual booting with Win 7 so that booting into Linux is the default?

* I'll be moving all my music, data, etc. to an NTFS external drive connected via eSATA in order to format the drives with the mangled Windows installs on them. Should I expect any trouble getting to the drive from within Linux?

* The consensus seems to be that I should get Ubuntu, but is there anything else I should consider? Dual-monitor setup, if it matters.

Can't seem to think of anything else.. Oh yeah, and I'm on a 64-bit system right now.

Originally I was going to go Ubuntu, but after lurking around here a lot of people seem to be suggesting that it's better to start with something less user friendly, and Arch looked like a good choice. Part of the reason I'm doing this in the first place is that I'm a CS major but I feel like I don't have a good enough grasp of how everything works, so I see this in part as a learning experience.

A little background: I plan on installing it on a 2 year old netbook, which has served me well and it currently running xp. I also have a desktop, which I plan on leaving alone for the time being. The netbook's specs are nothing spectacular, but it's able to do the basics pretty well.

I have a bad habit of writing walls of text, so I'll try to outline my questions as neatly as possible. Answers/opinions on any or all of them would be greatly appreciated!

1) Since the netbook has a tiny harddrive that I want to replace anyways, my plan was to just pull out the one that's in there now and buy a bigger one, which would also protect me from data loss. That makes sense to me on paper (since I'll be installing from a flash drive) but would it work?

2) Is installing Arch a good idea? Is it doable, for someone with limited experience? My experience with the command line is pretty much just changing directories and compiling stuff. I don't mind if this computer is down for awhile- I have a desktop as well that I'll leave alone (for now!)

3) About how long does an Arch install (along with getting things up and running) take?

4) How stable is Arch? I know it's ""bleeding edge,"" but how does that affect the day to day running of the computer?

5) I'm thinking I'll probably use Gnome as a GUI, but as this is an older computer- how hungry is it? Should I look into using a lightweight one? I also think Awesome Window Manager seems really cool, but again, I don't think I'm quite ready to use it. 

6) A more general linux question (and a very noobish one)- how similar are linux distros? For instance, does the command line work differently in ubuntu and arch, or are the foundations pretty much the same?

7) Are there any resources in particular that people would suggest for learning the command line (the list from the link in the sidebar looks great- just wondering if there are any others/ any favorites?)

8)Also, more long term, any well-liked resources on learning/ learning about scripting?

9) To any Arch users out there: what are your favorite and least favorite things about Arch?

10) Are there any other pieces of sage wisdom, or resources you guys would suggest I check out before I get started?

Please bear with me, this may be a touch long...

I have a windows box set up at home that I'm using with my television screen for most of the more mundane tasks(hulu, reddit, etc.)  I also have another box that I've used windows on for quite a while, but I'm thinking about pulling a reformat since I added a partition to the HDD on it to install an older distro on, and I never really got around to using.  I also no longer have my windows discs(lost them during a move.)

Like I said, I never really got around to using my linux distro, but did tinker a little bit.  I came to find out that things like gaming and TV were kind of out of the picture due to the lack of support with AMD and Nvidia drivers, which was kind of a bummer.  I also really thought that I could use Linux to learn about some more agressive computing and networking(which I know is true,) but I wound up not too motivated to do so.

Well, here I am thinking about making the switch to Linux, and I figure I should tell you all what I plan to use the box for, and see if maybe I could get some insight.

What I want to do:

* Browse the internet

* Play some decent games from time to time(not regularly, and nothing fancy by today's standard.  Things like Assassin's Creed 2 with WINE, and whatnot)

* Do some music recording/mixing/mastering.

* Maybe down the line start to learn some command scripting.

As you can tell, I plan on using this as an end user, as someone who is switching over from Windows.  I want the GUI to be simple enough for me to transition (almost) seamlessly, but I want the distro to be powerful enough that should I ever start studying about servers and network administration, I'll still have the tools to learn in front of me.

Now the questions:

* Has the linux community come up with decent display drivers yet?

* Is there open source music production software available that is powerful and legitimate(aside from just Audacity, which is an amazing tool?)

I installed Ubuntu Studio on my new laptop. I read some dual-booting tutorials online and thought I was doing things correctly--my understanding was that I needed to shrink my Win7 partition first, which I did, leaving about 20 GB of free space. My understanding was that Ubuntu would automatically detect the Windows partition and configure the bootloader to allow me to dual boot. The ""free"" partition looked oddly big to me--it was like 30 GB instead of 20--but I let Ubuntu install to it, assuming that it was some kind of discrepancy between how Windows and Linux account for disk space.

I was able to boot into Ubuntu fine, but when I tried to reboot and go into Windows 7, I got a weird error about the required device being inaccessible. I tried to use a Windows 7 DVD to go into the repair console and repair the boot sector, but the Windows 7 installer doesn't even seem to recognize that there's a hard drive there--it shows nothing in the ""select your installation"" box. When I run the ""repair boot"" thing on the Win7 CD, it doesn't do much of anything.

I'm pretty sure the Win7 partition still exists; I still see a 120 GB partition in Ubuntu and it looks like my files are still there. I think it's just a matter of figuring out how to fix the boot situation in order to get into it.

I wouldn't mind totally wiping the hard drive and starting over, but I don't even think I can do that, since Windows 7 doesn't even recognize that I have a hard drive.

Any thoughts? Any info I can provide that might be helpful?

* Use the package manager to install rtorrent.

        pacman -S rtorrent

* [Download this rtorrent config file template](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/browser/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc?format=raw), move it to /home/torrent/.rtorrent.rc, and configure it.

In your configuration, set your .torrent watched directory to be /home/torrent/watch and the downloads directory to be /home/torrent/files.
* On your server, log in as torrent and run rtorrent using just the command ""rtorrent."" Leave this open so that your server will always watch for torrents and you can check in and do stuff on the torrent client right on the server when necessary. 
* Leave this server on 24/7. If you follow all of the Arch wiki's rtorrent instructions, your server will text you when it's done with a download!

**Laptop Configuration**

* Now to start setting up your Windows laptop to control your server. On your laptop, go get a copy of WebDrive from wherever you please. You can either torrent it or buy it. Install it.
* Create a new site in WebDrive whose IP is your server's IP, ""Server Type"" is SFTP, default home directory is ""watch"" (since it uses a relative path), and login credentials are the same as your server's ""torrent"" user's username/password. Use WebDrive to connect to it; it will mount your server's /home/torrent/watch directory to some drive letter, say W.
* Now, whenever you are on your laptop and on your home LAN, whenever you download .torrent files on your laptop you can just save them to W:/ and they will automatically be copied to your server, rtorrent will notice them, download, and seed as long as you like. Seedbox! If you aren't on your home LAN, you can use [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) to log in as the ""torrent"" user and upload your .torrent files to the ./watch directory.
* Whenever you want to get music from your seedbox onto your laptop, you can again use WinSCP to get whatever you want off your seedbox and then use iTunes, MediaMonkey, or, my favorite, foobar2000, to maintain your portable music library.
* Fun fact: if you follow the Arch wiki for setting up rtorrent, you can also configure your server to text you when a download is done! I tested it and it works (AT&amp;T here).

**Media Server**

* [Follow the ALSA setup as per the Arch Linux wiki's instructions](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture). This is necessary because otherwise you won't get any sound out of your server.
* Install some packages:

      pacman -S mpd ncmpc

* [Configure mpd as per the Arch linux wiki](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon), EXCEPT you will set your mpd music library directory to be /home/torrent/files. 
* Set up ncmpc. Googling will get you any resources you need. ncmpc is a command-line client for mpd that will let you control mpd from your laptop via SSH or directly on the physical server.
* You can control your media server from your laptop by logging into it using [PuTTY](http://putty.very.rulez.org/) and running ncmpc.
* PROTIP: Pressing Ctrl+U in ncmpc forces a library update.

**iPhone**

* Get the free MPoD app and in the configuration give it your server's info. You already know all the information from the previous steps. I tested it and it works beautifully (though, admittedly, this app's interface isn't the most beautiful I've seen).

**Finally!**

Bask in the glory of having a seedbox to keep up your private tracker ratios that also autoindexes all your music into a music library you can play through whatever sound system you like and control from your iPhone.

**Going farther**

If you have a jailbroken iPhone, you could install SafariDownloader (or whatever it was that lets you download any file via Safari) and set up a cron job to scp any torrent files to your server so you can start torrenting anything whenever you think of it, say if a friend recommends a certain band while you're at the bar.

It doesn't seem very difficult, but I am clearly missing something.  PLEASE help.  I will buy you lunch, seriously.",16,1,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/bf6ui/linux4noobs_i_have_been_working_on_installing/,"Quick background:  I am trying to install [DACAPO, a quantum mechanics simulation package](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/dacapo).  This is where I am having the trouble.  I need to run some simulations to put in my dissertation, which is due around June.  

I have been trying to get this to work practically non-stop and I've spent several nights at 4AM just googling for help, but I have hit a brick wall.  Plus, I have 3 other projects to work on and I do actually have to spend time writing my dissertation as well.
 

**Details:**

DACAPO requires a few things to run.  For the most part, I believe I have installed EVERYTHING that it requires.  But possibly, I have not installed everything ""correctly"".  

[Here is the documentation for the Dacapo installation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/dacapo/Installation).  It is a bit outdated, and a mess.  This is a huge part of my frustration, because I am trying to modify the steps to work with my more modern system (was Fedora 12, then I switched to Ubuntu 9.10).  

 ** The big things that DACAPO requires are: **

 - [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp) **BIG PROBLEMS HERE**

 - [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) **MORE PROBLEMS HERE**

 - Fortran compiler (I have tried both gfortran and ifort, the Intel fortran compiler... both have given me problems)

 - C compiler (gcc is working fine I believe)

 - C++ compiler (c++ or g++ is fine I think)

 - BLAS (basic linear algebra subprograms) 

 - LAPACK (linear algebra package)

 - I believe BLAS / LAPACK should be included in [AMD Core Math Library](http://developer.amd.com/cpu/libraries/acml/Pages/default.aspx)   which I think I installed without issues

 - [Atomic simulation environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) which I installed correctly and is working.


And I think that's about it.  The biggest issue by far is making sure the fortran code compiles, so this means it needs access to all of the correct libraries.  

Here is the trouble I'm having:

I am following the general installation procedure [HERE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/dacapo/Installation#opteron-gfortran-compiler).  I was trying to use gfortran.

- I installed the ACML Math Library  version 4.4.0  (for BLAS and LAPACK)

**Next step**:  I followed their advice on trying to install NetCDF 3.6.1.  

    Build netcdf like this:

    tar -zxf netcdf-3.6.1.tar.gz
    cd netcdf-3.6.1/src
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/netcdf3-3.6.1-1.gfortran \  
        FC=gfortran FCFLAGS=-O2 CC=gcc CXX=c++ CPPFLAGS='-DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran -fPIC""'
    make

The reason for configuring it this was I believe is so the environment variables for compiling dacapo can find the correct netCDF libraries in the install dir

So, I tried NetCDF 3.6.1, but it was too outdated/buggy and the configure didn't work.  So I got NetCDF 4.0.1 instead.  (It says it is fully backward compatible, but I wonder...)  I configured it the same way but changed the name of the install directory to /usr/local/netcdf-4.0.1.gfortran   ... then I did make, and sudo make install, and it seems to be installed correctly.

**Next step**:  Build FFTW library.

They suggest version 2.1.5, so I used it.  There is a newer FFTW but it seems to have different library names, which is not compatible with DACAPO's makefile.

    Download version 2.1.5 [here](http://www.fftw.org/fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz) Build FFTW like this:
    tar -zxf fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz
    cd fftw-2.1.5
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/fftw2-2.1.5-1.gfortran \  
        F77=gfortran CC=gcc CFLAGS=-O3 FFLAGS=-O3 --enable-shared --enable-threads
    make
    sudo make install

So I do this and there are no problems apparently.

**Next step**:  Set environment variables for BLAS, LAPACK, NETCDF, and FFTW  **PROBLEMS HERE**

    setenv BLASLAPACK ""-L/opt/acml-4.0.1/gfortran64/lib -lacml -L/opt/acml-4.0.1/gfortran64/lib -lacml -lgfortran""
    setenv NETCDF /usr/local/netcdf3-3.6.1-1.gfortran/lib64
    setenv FFTW /usr/local/fftw2-2.1.5-1.gfortran/lib64

OK so I had to improvise here, because first of all, I don't think setenv works in Ubuntu 9.10, so I used **export** instead.  Secondly, the install directories are different, because I have NetCDF and ACML of different versions.  Thirdly, I don't know what the flags are for in $BLASLAPACK.  For example, I don't really understand what -L does, or what -lacml does, etc.

I did this (without really knowing WTF I was doing):

    export BLASLAPACK=""-L/opt/acml4.4.0/gfortran32/lib -lacml -L/opt/acml4.4.0/gfortran32/lib -lacml -lgfortran""
    export NETCDF=""/usr/local/netcdf-4.0.1.gfortran/lib""
    export FFTW=""/usr/local/fftw2-2.1.5-1.gfortran/lib""

then I have to tell the Dacapo Makefile what to do, so I tell it to use gfortran like this:

    (from the dacapo/src directory)
    make gfortran_fsecond_underscore

gfortran\_fsecond\_underscore is recommended for gcc-gfortran-4.2.1 compiler on Ubuntu ... but there is also a gfortran\_fnosecond\_underscore option for gcc-gfortran-4.1.1. compiler on CentOS.  

So... everything SEEMS TO WORK FINE, until almost at the very end of the make, I get an error about

    ../blas/gfortran_fsecond_underscore/libmyblas.a /libnetcdf.a /libfftw.a   
    gfortran: /libnetcdf.a: No such file or directory  
    gfortran: /libfftw.a: No such file or directory  
    make[2]: *** [dacapo.run] Error 1  
    make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/blah/dacapo/src/gfortran_fsecond_underscore_serial'  
    make[1]: *** [serial] Error 2  
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/blah/dacapo/src'  
    make: *** [gfortran_fsecond_underscore] Error 2


and it basically gives an error that  **libnetcdf.a** and **libfftw.a** are NOT FOUND.  Even though the environment variables should point the makefile in the right direction, towards the NetCDF and FFTW install directories.    I can fucking SEE the files in the directory, but the Makefile seems to ignore them or something.

**EDIT:** So I've confirmed that the Makefile wants to see libnetcdf.a and libfftw.a in / (the main filesystem).  So just to fuck around, I copied all my libraries to /  and tried to compile again.  **I got past the error listed above** but it still didn't work completely.  I had issues compiling most of the fortran stuff.  Now, I believe it will work... but I think I have slightly incorrect libfftw.a and libnetcdf.a files.  I think I have to compile them myself using gfortran because they have some weird underscoring convention.  


**So if you would like to help.... here is what you can do**

Please, someone just try to compile Dacapo, especially on Ubuntu 9.10  (or any easily obtainable distro is fine), and let me know how you compiled / installed / configured all of the components.  

I have googled a LOT and I have found some others with the same issues, but NONE of the responses that were posted to these problems have helped me.

Thank you so much in advance.

I snooped around online and the problem looked like a graphics card issue. Somehow the updates I had installed prevented my graphics card from being recognized. This seemed plausible as I could log in with no problems under run level 1.

One user said that he renamed /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old and it fixed his problem.

I logged in under run level 1 to do this but I made the VERY DUMB MISTAKE of forgetting elementary bash and I deleted the file instead of renaming it (I am extremely new to Linux).

What are my options? Is there a way I can replace the configuration file or reinstall X11 from run level 1? I am VERY inexperienced as you can tell.

I'm wanting to use command line tools, prefer Linux to Windows, but am operating within Windows XP at the moment due to some wireless driver issues, therefore I am using Cygwin.

Question: I have a large number (100's of GB) of .shn files in various subdirectories that I would like to convert to .flac, and then if possible, delete the original .shn. If you are not aware, these are compressed audio files. I have installed the shntool, shorten, and flac executables to my cygwin directory.

Specifics/Problems: I know that ""shntool.exe conv -o wav *.shn"" will convert all .shn files in a directory to .wav. I know that ""flac.exe --best *.wav"" will convert all of the resulting .wav's in a directory to FLAC with level 8 compression. I'm pretty sure a pipe between the two commands will run one right after the other. I understand that my script should start with a ""#!/bin/sh"" and that my file name should be something along the lines of ""shn2flac.sh"" and be ran from the parent directory. My problem is the subdirectories run very deep (parent band directory/year/archival disc/category/audio disc/actual files) so I wanted the script to search ""down to the bottom"" and find/convert ALL the files in the parent directory, no matter how many subdirectories deep in which they may exist. I would also like the script to delete the original .shn files after conversion to .wav., and delete the .wav files after conversion to .flac. Can anyone help?

Beyond accomplishing this task, I would love to be shown a guide on the logic and syntax behind this type of script writing. I have read documentation on cygwin, bash, shntool, flac, and scripting, but have not been able to find anything that really explains it beyond the ""draw the effing owl"" level (i.e., here's a list of syntax, here's a sample script that does something really complicated, nothing in between).

As I mentioned, I created an *extremely* basic script that just does:



sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y


I was wondering if I needed the sudo inside of the script in order for those commands to work?

Also, what would I need to add to this basic script to do the follow:

Export a log file to a specific folder (probably a shared Dropbox folder) IF the is an error/something breaks in the update? Or, even if successfully, send a log file to a folder.

I would then like to have this script tied to a crontask or cronjob to execute everytime the computer is turned on.

This script is only going to be used on my family's computer (Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon) to allow easier updating. Yes, I'm sure there is probably a GUI thing I could do, but I would really like to learn how to start scripting in the shell.

I have a linux Mint machine set up to be a dedicated fileserver and occasional media center machine (hooked to a TV for movies etc).  I would like to connect it to 2-3 other machines on the local network, all of them are windows 7 machines.

I would like to be able to set up a raid5 array for dedicated drives (3x3tb for a 6tb RAID), and then allow the windows machines to access the array.  It would be nice if I could specify directories on the server that are private per user, as well as public to all machines.  This way, shared files like anime or music can be accessed by anyone with an account on the FS, but private things like tax information or receipts can be kept private.  Ideally, I can stop using windows network sharing to let my roommates watch my anime :)

The reason for wanting to put my private data on the server would be to give it a better level of redundancy in case of hardware failure.  It would actually be ideal to be able to be able to specify some kind of mirroring for private files across the network, for even better redundancy (similar to dropbox?).

I'm wondering if any of these ideas are possible/reasonable, and looking for tips for a well-documented, user-friendly way to do it.  Not all of the users will be able to use linux command line, so it would be ideal if I could set it all up and not have to mess with configs frequently.  Mint is not a required distro, if there's a significantly better one for this purpose.

Here's a quick tl/dr bullet point list:

 * Linux RAID5 software?
 * Networked file server on linux Mint, which can be used by Windows 7 over LAN.
 * Ability to specify public (any account) and private (per-account) storage locations.
 * Possibly mount storage locations as a folder, for easy and transparent use.
 * Possibly specify to mirror some storage on the server and the local machine, for redundancy and faster access.",,False,,t5_2qy7t,False,,,True,t3_x3yaa,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/x3yaa/setting_up_a_home_file_server/,

Just for background as to what I did to mess it up, in case anyone is interested. This was a month or so ago, but I remember the first time I had to reinstall it I was editing a .bash file to try and get a custom terminal command to open Chrome. This was before I learned about Alias. Apparently I was editing the one that automatically runs programs before the window manager/ubuntu even boots, so next time I power on nothing but a chrome window pops up. An easy fix from a live-cd boot, but I had also made the mistake of encrypting my home folder and not making a recovery cd/password thing. Another install (the next day) I was downloading a couple themes, all of them through third-party repositories, and suddenly I get a system error that my 'libc6' package is corrupted. Tried everything I could to fix it, but I just decided to reinstall. Finally, the next day, I install everything good and well, it's all working, I go to reboot, and I get a ""checking battery state"" message. Can't boot. Apparently the official nvidia linux drivers were causing this for some people. It was at this point that I said ""Fuck it, I'm going back to Windows"".

What I have:

* A classic iPod with all my music on it, including playlists and ratings
* My library saved to a folder on my computer
* iTunes 7.6 running under wine, which works great for organising everything but doesn't recognise my iPod
* Playlist and song rating information in an iTunes xml document (I can export whatever else I need to)

What I need:

* A music manager on my computer which uses a five-star rating system
* If I need to change from iTunes, a way of converting the ratings from the xml document to the new music manager
* A way of synchronising my library (including playlists and ratings) to my iPod
* My music, playlists, and ratings, to be on my computer and my iPod at the same time, updated in real time (or close)

Basically, despite being mostly very happy with the move to Ubuntu, my greatest regret about leaving Windows is iPod and music management. I love iTunes, and while I'm open to using an iPod alternative I can't find one which has all the iPod features I want. Yes, I know no-one rates all their music but me, but it's very important to me. I tried rhythmbox, and I even found [a python script which lets me convert my iTunes ratings to rhythmbox](http://code.google.com/p/itunes-to-rhythmbox-ratings/), but I couldn't find the rhythmbox library file it wanted and anyway I don't think rhythmbox synchronises with iPods (it's also hideous, but I could live with that).

Solutions:

* Get wine'd iTunes to synchronise with my iPod (I thought I heard someone say they'd managed it, but couldn't find how)
* Find an alternative iTunes with all the right features
* Find an alternative ipod with all the right features
* Something else?

A lot of the stuff in here is basic help with problems. That's certainly valuable, but I think linux4noobs can do a little more - it can help feed those of us with a budding passion and genuine interest to embrace the freedom and malleability of linux, rather than just getting by without windows.

What are some good projects? What kinds of clever customizations have the veterans reading this come up with through the years? Can you point us to resources, even vaguely, that can get us started? I'm not asking for complete tutorials - just some starting points.

I don't have a ton to offer, but I want to start this off with an example for those newer than me. One project that has been challenging but worthwhile was setting up a private wiki for my fiancee and I. First I had to set up a LAMP stack and double-check my firewalls. Once I had apache serving up index.html, I got [a dyndns account](http://www.dyndns.com) because I don't have a static IP at home. Then I shopped around and found a [free wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki) that looked easy to use. Finally, since I'm not offering a public service, I had to wrestle with getting the whole thing working with user accounts and SSL to keep out the riff-raff (lots of guides for this online).

And now we have a little site where we can leave to-dos for each other, personal bios of our family members (I always mix up her relatives), and school notes. We've been using it a lot and the process of setting it up was a great way for me to learn.

Can any of you share some of your successful projects to inspire us noobs? Cron jobs that order flowers for your mother on her birthday? Scripts that scour the internet, harvesting autographed pictures of the Harlem Globetrotters? Crazy encryption schemes to lock down your Seinfeld fanfic?

Btw, is there a live cd version which would have the minimum potential exploits? (e.g. it has no java, no flash, a well tested browser etc etc?). 

I also understand that a live cd has the problem that it does not get any security updates.

My problem is that I have a Logitech G11 keyboard, and I would love to use the media keys to their full extent. I've got 2 problems at the moment:


1. For some reason, all the media players I use refuse to pick up my media keys. I've mapped them properly in Keyboard Shortcuts in the Preferences section and they get detected just fine (X86AudioMediaNext or whatever). But in both media players I've tried (Clementine and Banshee) they refuse to do anything when pressed, even if I map them in the options. Two things I did notice was that Clementine's custom keyboard settings dialog didn't pick up the media keys as input until I unmapped them from my system global shortcuts. The other is that Banshee definitely registers them as some form of input, as I can see the window ""blink"" when I press the keys, but nothing happens. Any suggestions? I've got the suspicion that the key inputs are caught by the system somewhere and their functions are locked somehow.


2. When using my volume wheel, every ""click"" on the wheel corresponds to about 10% of my volume bar. This is a very unsensitive method of adjusting volume, and I would like to decrease the step size of the volume wheel.

I'm still trying to decide what the best option would be.  I have three scenarios in mind, none of which are mutually exclusive.

1)  Install linux on my desktop that I hardly ever use.  Currently it is running Windows 7.  I can't decide if I'd rather save what I want, wipe the hard drive, and do a completely clean linux install; or keep Windows 7 and set up some sort of dual boot scenario.  Some considerations:  The machine has gotten increasingly slow over the last few years, so I've considered doing a wipe and a clean install on it in any case.  Since I hardly ever use this machine, I wouldn't be bothered if it was out of commission for some extended period while I dinked around with whatever needed dinking.  In that sense, it would make a great learning environment.  However, once I've done whatever I want to do, I probably still would hardly ever even turn the machine on.  So, aside from the education, the return on investment for this route wouldn't be too great.

2) Install linux on my laptop, which is my primary machine.  The laptop is a pretty decent one.  It's an ASUS G73Sw, one of the Republic of Gamers models.  The temptation here is that the hard drive is already partitioned into OS(C:) and DATA(D:).  I'm only using C: right now, and have 207 of 279 GB left on it, plenty of space.  I am not using D: at all, so I have 394/394GB available there.  My thinking is that since the hard drive is already partitioned this way, I am guessing it would make devoting the D: drive to a linux install much easier.  But I have no idea if this actually true.

My hesitation with this route is that I'm a little less eager to have this machine go offline.  There's no significant data that I couldn't back up before attempting anything, it's more a matter of having the machine set up 'just so' and the fact that I use it every day.  However, if it came down to it, I wouldn't be too pissed if I ended up having to rebuild all of my software and settings again.

3)  The wild card route.  Buy a cheap-ish laptop, wipe whatever is on there, and do a linux install there.  The main appeal here is that I'd have no issues with losing data, settings, or whatever.  A brand new laboratory.  The other benefit to this option is portability.  I bought my existing laptop to essentially replace my desktop.  As such, I didn't go for portability.  It's over 10 lbs and has a 17.3 inch screen.  It doesn't go to school (or other places) with me very often.  I'd kind of like to have a smaller machine that I could easily take with me places.  All the better if it was something rather cheap that I bought used.

Those are the options that I see.  Like I said, I'm not opposed to doing more than one of them.  For example, do the cheap laptop as a first experiment, learn from mistakes, wipe the desktop and install there, then do the dual boot on the nice laptop.

Opinions on which of these might be the best route?  Is there another route I'm completely ignoring?  Potential pitfalls to any of these routes?  Anything else anybody thinks of?

Thanks in advance.  I've been a subscriber to this sub for a long time, this is my first post.

**TL;DR -- I have a nice Windows7 laptop that I use every day that has a partitioned hard drive, and a Windows7 desktop that I hardly ever use.  Should I install a dual boot on the laptop? (Kind of scary since it's my primary machine.)  Or wipe the desktop and do a clean install there? (Less scary but I hardly use the machine and wouldn't use it more after installing linux.)  Or buy a cheap, used laptop and do a clean install there?  (No risk and it could become my new mobile laptop.)**",,False,,t5_2qy7t,True,,,True,t3_pcire,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/pcire/want_to_install_linux_considering_different/,

It's a bit slow but that's probably because everything's happening on one disc and in Windows, hopefully with a separate PC it will be a bit faster.

My main question is to do with what is actually cached by Squid and how to force other items to cache too. In our house there are 3 Playstations (sometimes more when friends are over) and since we have similar interests we tend to download the same demos, game updates and the like. Is there any way to get Squid to cache these? I've had a look online but I can't seem to find anything too useful, but that's probably because I don't know what I'm looking for.

I've managed to get my PS3 working through Squid and downloads work fine. but nothing is being stored in the cache. It my have something to do with HTTP request headers (???) but again I'm not too sure what's going on.

On a side note, I have run a Linux server before, as a college project we set up LinucMCE on one of the computers then set up another 9 and 3 PS3s to run through it. It was quite fun to start the server up then have the other 9 WoL a few moments later.

I've been off-again on-again trying to dual boot Win.7 and openSUSE, so far I can successfully run one but it would result in not being able to boot the other. Windows is having a crumby time dealing with another partition(Linux), and is fighting for control and throws an error saying that the partition table is corrupt every time I go to boot Windows. Which leads me to believe that this can be fixed, so that I may boot either OS at moments notice. But I'm not quite sure in what direction to go from here.

I remember in my last system, the BIOS would prompt me which partition I would like to boot; it was quite nice. Would this be achievable? I know it's doubtful. I've also got an toshiba satellite a665, if this helps.

I'm moderately familiar linux user, in that at one point I had a ubuntu server with ftp and media servers set up, but that is long since dead and I never revived it. 

Basically, the phones I have right now are as follows:

* I will soon have google voice as my primary number
* my girlfriend may have google voice as her primary number if my results are good. 
* we each have cell phones that google voice would forward to
* My google voice also will forward to my work number

What I'm looking into doing is grabbing a Sheeva Plug or a Guru Plug, installing PlugPBX and finding a cheap handset to set up a home line through Asterisk. First, is this a good idea, or is there a better solution?

Would I be able to set it up so that:

* If someone calls my GV number, it rings ALL of my phones as normal, plus the house phone (and NOT the work phone) if my phone is nearby (sensing through bluetooth)
* If someone calls my girlfriends google voice number, it does the same, except with her phone.
* When we dial out from our home phone, it defaults to go out through my number, but if you dial 9 (for example) first, it goes out through my girlfriend's number.

Is this possible? If it isn't possible with Google Voice, is there something else I can do? Is there anywhere with documentation on doing this?

I have a binary file, a ROM for a gameboy game.  Let's assume that between the offsets of AC000 and AF000 is a bunch of text encoded in hex.  

Let's say I have a basic text file with hex data (or binary data) written in ascii.  That is, the actual text of the file is ""48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21""(formatted in whatever the best way to format it to solve my problem would be), but the *actual* hex of the file is ""34 38 20 36 35 20 36 63 20 36 63 20 36 66 20 32 30 20 35 37 20 36 66 20 37 32 20 36 63 20 36 34 20 32 31""   How would I make an *actual* hex file with the proper hex data?

That's the first part of my question.  The second part is how do you *insert* that data into another hex file at a certain offset *over writing* the data already there?  xiv, which is a windows text editor, has the functionality of being able to import another file, but it does not overwrite.  Which is *okay* I guess but inconvenient because I have to delete all the data it moves.  Additionally, I'd like to be able to do this without using wine.

Because I feel like I am being confusing, here is a picture of what I want to do:  http://i.imgur.com/pCyOLEx.png

Thank you *greatly* for any help.

EDIT: I can't edit the data manually because it is a LOT of hex data.  Instead, I am converting text to the proper hex values, and I want to IMPORT the file directly, because that is much much quicker than typing in the individual values for each letter.

EDIT: After a lot of hair-pulling, I think I've solved this.

To fix the first problem (the turning ascii hex into actual hex), I did 

    xxd -p -r ascii.file patch.file

The -p is VERY important.

Then, once I have patch.file, I do 

    dd if=patch.file of=source.file seek=56000 obs=1 conv=notrunc count=2000 bs=1

Where ""seek"" is the offset I want the imported data to start, bs is set to 1 to indicate I want it to count by one byte, and count is how many bytes are in the patch.file

I've desired to go for ubuntu as my distro at the moment as its the one I've got the most experience with currently, and the integration of Steam and such plays to my gaming heart. Although Debian might be a possibility as I've read about being able to get steam on there, but I'm not sure if its to much of a step for me at the moment.

Background:
I plan to upgrade my current system, built mainly for gaming, (i7 sandybridge, AT 6950, 120gb SSD) with a new HDD, my old 640gb is just not cutting it now, its full of 4 years of bad management and old windows installs, to a new Larger HDD, I've been looking at going to maybe a 3 or 4 TB hard drive, just for some future proofing.

Main Questions:
With the change to the larger HDD, I've been thinking of running Ubuntu on one partion of the SSD and Windows 7 on another. With a partion of the HDD for additional storage for each of the OS's.

Is this the right sort of thing to do? 

Also I've read little bits about using 3TB+ size hard drives requiring different formatting, could someone explain, (or link to an explanation), of what needs to happen.

Any help is appreciated. As I want to do some research first instead of just jumping into things like I normally do.",,False,,t5_2qy7t,False,,,True,t3_1bqef8,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1bqef8/would_like_some_linux_migration_advice/,

The only machine currently in my possession capable of running Linux is a hulking custom build that I spent way too much money on to risk bricking due to my novicehood.

For the purpose of testing the Linux waters, I have determined that I should invest in a new device, one that:

* is capable of running Debian;

* is resilient enough that I can restore it to factory settings, no matter how much I F it UBAR;

* is inexpensive, so I won't be out too much if I am forced to conclude this Linux business is over my head.

I have heard a lot about bare bones systems, pirate boxes, etc. Of course, the big name now is Raspberry Pi, which claims that if I manage to brick it, I can restore it by [""reflashing the SD card""](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs) — not that I'm sure what that means yet (and I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with what I'm thinking of).

Once I determine what I should get, I'll touch base here again to make sure I'm getting everything I need and nothing I don't. Thanks in advance.
