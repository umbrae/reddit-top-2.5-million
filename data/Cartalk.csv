I joined /r/Cartalk to help people while I have free time, but I've seen a lot of God awful advice as well. Folks give out advice when the problem and the suggested answer have nothing at all to do w/ one another.
In replying, while you believe you are helping you can quite possibly make the problem worse or cause folks to spend money in the hopes that your suggestion works when to trained professionals it won't just by looking at the reply.
Please, before you reply, make sure you know what you're talking about as it will save wasted time and energy in actually rectifying the problem of the original poster.
Thank you.

Please remember, your amateur opinion or advice, no matter how well intended,if incorrect, could lead to injury, or even loss of life. Can you afford to be wrong?

I personally have ~30 years experience in the automotive trades, but I seldom post here because my experience is somewhat dated. (If it has ignition points and a carburetor, I'm your man) and I don't want to add to the ""noise"". There are a lot of great, qualified people here answering questions. Please give them a chance.


tl;dr - Don't reply to a person's problem thread unless the advice you give is sound.

I would like everyone who posts here to think about what they're posting, in the context of what this sub is. It's a place for people with car trouble to come and get advice.

But remember, the right answer isn't always the one with the most upvotes.

When people post garbage like, ""Don't go to the dealer, they're crooks"", it pisses me off. I'm not a fucking crook. I go to work every day and fix the second most valuable possession in people's lives. A crook takes your things and gives nothing back. I take your money and provide a service. One that most people cannot provide. I try my best to fix the car in such a way that the problem will not re-occur. That often requires more money than just fixing it for now. I don't just put pads on a car that needs brakes, I machine the rotors so they don't squeak.

1334262532.0,66,self.Cartalk,s6qmp,Fix-A-Flat: A firsthand account,76,10,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/s6qmp/fixaflat_a_firsthand_account/,"Okay, so I get into this discussion fairly often on this subreddit, so I thought I would make a post explaining the few advantages/many disadvantages of [Fix-A-Flat](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A9SSJ78SL._AA300_.jpg) and similar products.

Before we get started, I find it necessary to state that I am both a former Goodyear employee and Big O Tires employee. I'm not sure how I can verify this, but here is an [old paystub](http://i.imgur.com/V9RKu.jpg) with my username on it.

As an employee of these companies, I encountered tires that had been introduced to Fix-A-Flat numerous times, and each time I had to explain to my customer that the tire was ruined and needed to be replaced.  I also was not your typical corporate mechanic in that I didn't try to upsell a full set of tires for some bullshit reason, nor did I try selling him anything else he didn't need, and if the tires were not purchased at my store or I couldn't get a matching tire for the customer, I would send them somewhere they could get a match, be it Les Schwab, Discount Tire, etc.  My honesty was something that I never gave up in my employment with these establishments.

The advantages of Fix-A-Flat are that it comes in handy in a pinch and it's convenient.  A product that can fix a small puncture AND reinflate your tire?  Fantastic.  There are many situations in which this could save much time and diffuse frustration.  That is about all the good I have to say about this product, other than it is a great idea, but it certainly has not been perfected yet.

The disadvantages of this product, however, are many.  What Fix-A-Flat is is a water-based chemical solution that breaks down and melts the rubber in a tire so that the puncture sort of melts itself together to create a patch.  This would be a perfectly fine fix if the compound targeted solely the puncture, but that is not the case.  Fix-A-Flat will roll around in your tire and sometimes never escape it.  Because of this, it comes in contact with the entire inner lining of the tire, which in turn breaks down the rubber and weakens the tire.

Possibly the worst aspect of this issue is that it weakens the sidewall, which is one of the most crucial parts of the tire.  If you have experience working with tires, or even a bad puncture experience, you know that most shops will not repair a tire if there is a puncture on the sidewall or on the shoulder of the tire.  This is because when you drive, your tires flex and bend, and there has yet to be made a patch or plug that can contour with all of that movement and retain a seal.  Sidewalls on most tires, unless specifically noted, don't have much reinforcement so they need all they can get.

Another disadvantage of Fix-A-Flat is that since it is a water-based product, it can cause your wheel to rust.  Again, once you put the product into the tire, it never escapes unless you break the tire off the rim and clean it out, then putting it back on, which some shops will do very hesitantly.  Not only does it cause a terrible mess, but it jeopardizes the integrity of the tire.  Sometimes the only way you can get a shop to do this for you is if you express that you understand the concerns and have them notate that you were advised of the risks on the work order, which both you and the store then have a copy of (example: Customer was notified of the dangers of this product; requested work be performed anyway).

One more issue with this product is that since it just rolls around in the tire with no real rhyme or reason to it, it can wear down a tire more in some parts, and not so much in others, causing the tire to be heavier/thicker in some areas and lighter/thinner than others.  This results in making the tire very difficult and sometimes impossible to rebalance.

Now if you go and look for reviews of this product, of course you will find some people who have never experienced problems with it at all.  Most of the time, however, they do all the work themselves and never have to rely on a mechanic or tire shop to do the work for them.  Since not everyone has a tire machine and balancer in their garage, I believe it is necessary that everyone should be aware of these potential risks of using Fix-A-Flat.  And just to be clear, I don't work for some company hell bent on creating a smear campaign against Fix-A-Flat, I'm just an honest guy attempting to share his firsthand knowledge and experience with this product to potentially save people from a very expensive bill in the future.

Feel free to ask me any questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

I'd like to suggest a few things to consider before asking about it here.  

* First, mechanical work is expensive.  You aren't paying a mechanic twenty-five bucks an hour, you're paying the shop eighty bucks an hour.

* Second, because I think it needs its own point, body work is **very** expensive.  Same hourly rates, but very labour-intensive.  If you get a little scratch on your bumper, a body shop won't dab some scratch filler in it and bill you half an hour, they're going to remove it, sand it down, apply body filler if necessary, sand that, then paint the whole thing.

* Third, most reputable shops get their hour quotes from a common catalogue that specifies standard labour times by make, model, and trim level.  If you think it shouldn't take more than twenty minutes to change a sensor and you're being quoted four hours, consider additional work such as parts that need to be removed for access.

* Fourth, most reputable shops will supply *quality* replacement parts and charge markup on them; this helps cover the shop's overhead including the cost of obtaining the parts.  You aren't getting ripped off by a shop charging eighty bucks for a brake rotor just because you saw one made in China with a fifteen day warranty for nine dollars on RockAuto.com.

With this knowledge in hand, hopefully most repair quotes will seem a bit less outrageous.  If you receive a quote that seems high, your first step should be to shop around - get a second and third opinion from other reputable shops.  Don't worry about the total dollar value, the figures of interest are the times.  If they're similar across the board then you most likely aren't being cheated.  If you think their parts are too expensive, many places will install parts you supply - but be aware they generally won't honour warranties on them.  Another great resource is the Internet, 99% of the time many other people will have performed the same work and posted about it in some forum.  Asking reddit should be your last option, and should only be exercised after obtaining multiple quotes and doing some other online research.

I hope this helps some of you out in providing context regarding repair quotes and some ideas about helping yourself figure out if your mechanic is dealing honestly.",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_ynu1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/ynu1h/psa_information_you_should_know_before_posting_an/,

I'm going to try to create a fairly well formatted post in an attempt to clarify things.  Hopefully it will be helpful, or at least entertaining.  
  
**Identify your vehicle**  
The *minimum* information that you should relay to us is the year, make, model, engine size, relevant options.  You will have to use your best judgement on what options are relevant.  Remember, it's always better to provide too much vehicle information than not enough.  Options that are helpful to know are transmission type (auto, manual), 4x4 vs 2x4, any aftermarket tomfoolery, modifications to the electronics, and any recent work that has been done.  Again, having too much information is much better than not having enough.  
  
**Vehicle won't start**  
  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, but doesn't, you should say ""The vehicle cranks, but doesn't start""  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, it does start, but immediately dies, you should say ""The vehicle cranks and starts, but won't run""  
* If the starter spins the engine, but it spins the engine too slowly to actually start the engine, you should say ""The engine cranks slowly and does not start""  
* If the starter does not spin the engine, you should say ""The engine does not crank""  
  
**Noises**  
  
When your vehicle makes odd noises try to tell us as much as possible about not only the noise, but also about what is going on in the environment around the vehicle, what the vehicle itself is doing, and what options are turned on.  Try to classify the noise that it's making, rather than just saying ""it's making noise.""
  
* Squeaks and Squeals: Usually a shrill, high pitched noise.  [Here's a Dayco video talking about squeals vs chirps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnftyDpfv4&amp;feature=related) and [here's a video with some brake squealing in it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxdE12B8QXM&amp;feature=related)  Tell us where the noise is coming from and when you hear it.  Examples: ""The brakes squeak when I brake at low speeds,"" ""the belt on the front of my engine squeaks all the time,"" ""my belt on the front of my engine squeaks when the A/C is on, but only when it's raining out.""  As always, more information is good.  
* Grinding nosies:  That noise you hear when metal is rubbing against metal.  I've heard it described a plethora of ways.  Once you've heard it you will be able to identify it everywhere.  Tell us when and where you hear it.  If it's coming from your brakes then STOP DRIVING THAT CAR until you find out where it's coming from.  
* Clunking and thumping:  Clunking noises in the suspension sound like someone tapping a part with a hammer.  Sometimes it sounds like they are tapping it gently, and sometimes it sounds like they aren't being very gentle at all.  Tell us everything you can about the noise, is it only over bumps?  Etc.
  
**Driveability**  
  
This is the part that I'm sure people will disagree with me on, at least to some extent.  
* If the vehicle seems to be running fine, but doesn't have the power that it used to have, say just that.  Don't forget to tell us and recent events that make you expect that it is operating at reduced power.  
* If the vehicle is jerking, shuddering, spasming, or the engine is bouncing around like a [cat in an automatic catwash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyi8ly5dRkU) then tell us when it happens.  Is it only when you're going up a steep hill?  At night with the headlights on?  In traffic?  In the rain?  All of this information helps us figure out whats up.  
* If the vehicle starts, runs for a bit, and then dies, for the love of FSM don't say it ""won't turn over.""  Tell us it starts, and then dies.  Then tell us how it dies.  Does it idle for a couple seconds then die?  Can you feather the accelerator and keep it running?  Does it die when you put it in gear?  Information is key.  
  
**The Check Engine Lamp**  
  
We need to know why this light is on, not that it is in fact on.  The check engine lamp is an indicator that says ""SOMETHING IS WRONG!""  If you vehicle is a 1996 or newer vehicle than you can go to almost any autoparts store and they can scan your computer and tell you the codes that are present.  When they do that, have them clear the codes, drive the vehicle until the light comes back on, and have them read again, and tell us all of the original codes and the codes that came back.  The codes will be in a very specific format, such are ""p0300 Random cylinder misfire"" or ""p0305 Cylinder 5 misfire"" or ""p0420 Catalytic converter efficiency below threshold.""  
  
**tl;dr**  
  
Just take it to a mechanic and tell us what he told you, preferably with a pic of the estimate.

* Check your lights. Brake lights, tag lights, reverse lights, you get the idea.

Underhood:

*  With the engine cold take off your radiator cap and check the fluid level. If it's nasty in there go ahead and flush out your cooling system. Top off as necessary.

*  Check brake fluid level, if it is low, you have a hint you may be low on brake pad thickness.

* Use a flash light and inspect your drive belts for cracks. If it is cracked, it is usually obvious. Replace cracked belts.

* Look around for oil leaking near your valve cover(s). If you see leaks a valve cover gasket is an easy, enjoyable fix for cheap. (If you own a GM with a 3100, 3400, 3600, 3800 look in the valey on both ends of the motor for coolant leaking. They leak all the time from the intake gaskets)

* Check your power steering reservoir. If the fluid is low, look for leaks near the pump or lines (we will look at the rack later)

* Check trans fluid, if it is dark considering getting a trans flush or dropping the pan and doing it your self. (Some will say to be careful with changing fluid on older transmissions. So do some research before you dive into this with a high mileage vehicle)

* Pull off your PCV valve and shake it. it should rattle a little. If it doesn't make any noise, replace it.

* Check your air filter and if you are feeling so inclined pull of the tubing to the throttlebody and peak into the intake. If it's nasty try some seafoam treatment to clean up the gunk.

* Inspect your battery terminals for corrosion. This is cleaned with a baking soda water mixture. Then rinse off with more water. There is a special paint that can be sprayed on the terminals to protect from future corrosion if that interests you.

* Using a flashlight look for any motor mounts on the upper part of the engine bay. Check for tearing and replace any that are torn through or almost torn through. as soon as one mount goes, the rest soon follow.

Wheel area:

* Check balljoints and tierods. On most cars jack the front end of the car up using the frame or pinchweld of the car. Hold the tire at 3 and 9 o'clock. shake side to side. a loose tierod will be light feeling. If you start to really shake the wheel back and forth you are going to feel some play from the steering rack. Just a gentle side to side shake. A loose tierod will be obvious, if you aren't sure if its loose, it probably isn't. Now check ball joint by holding the tire top and bottom and really pulling up hard. if the wheel moves you may have a bad ball joint. If the wheel moves up and down easily you may have a bad bearing. Repeat this on the other side.

* Truck/SUV ball joints are checked differently. (the way these are checked are more dependent on the suspension setup. A good rule of thumb is that if the spring is attached to the lower control arm check them with this method). Jack the front suspension up by putting the jack under the control arm. Then use a prybar and pry up on the bottom of the tire. If the wheel moves, you need a lower ball joint. A shake top to bottom can reveal a loose upper ball joint.

* Pull off one of your front wheels and peak at your brake pads. IF they are less than 2/32nds of an inch thick, you need new ones. If your rotors have a big lip around the outside edge you will need to replace your rotors, too. If you want to be thorough pull the caliper off (most cars you only need to remove the bottome bolt then swing the caliper up out of the way) and look for fluid leaking around the caliper piston. Pull a pad and check for cracks. If they are cracked, you need to replace them.

* Pull a rear wheel and repeat the brake inspection in the back. If you have drums, and the drum is stuck on use a hammer and hit the shit out of it. The drum should pop off. But don't hit a wheel stud. That would be a pain in the ass. EDIT: [A warning regarding my method from Axeman2063](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/13dm0n/how_to_do_a_multi_point_inspection_on_a_nice/c7305tp)

* On drums check the shoe thickness. under 1/32nd of an inch and you need to replace them (if there are rivets on the shoe, measure from the top of the rivet to the to of the friction material). Peel back the little boots around the wheel cylinder. If fluid comes pouring out you need wheel cylinders. (If you have a Saturn, you need wheel cylinders).  While you are in there you can adjust the brake out a bit. (google proper procedure for your vehicle)

* Check the tread pattern on all your tires. If they are at the wear bars (little raised pieces inbetween the treads) you need tires. If you have jagged edges you are having a toe issue. If you have excessive wear on one edge you may also have a toe issue. If you have a cupping pattern on the inside edge of the tire you need shocks. 

* Look for oil leaking from your shocks. You don't want oil leaking from your shocks.

Undercar:

* Do all that safe stuff so you don't kill yourself in your driveway

* Look at all of your suspension bushings. The little rubber pieces that are in all of the suspension connections. If you find some rotted out or torn badly. They need replacement. (90's Civics, check your rear suspension trailing arm)

* Look for oil leaks, and try to find the source of the leak. Repair leak. (if you cant find the source, you can get oil dye from your parts store. Just add half a bottle to the oil and recheck in a few weeks)

* Check your exhaust for leaks and rusted hangers.


Ok, I think I covered all of it. Of course there is always more and I hope others can add to my list in the comments.

Please note that I breezed over many things, but my goal here was just to give people something to do and a way to find something to fix on their cars. I hope someone finds this useful!

EDIT: The most important things are really your brakes, ball joints, and tie rods. Those parts are safety items and should be fixed first.

1345123613.0,42,self.Cartalk,ybhnn,PSA: Check your lug nuts!,51,9,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/ybhnn/psa_check_your_lug_nuts/,"I recently had my tires rotated and aligned. I then went on a 600 mile trip. When I got back I noticed at low speed I heard a creaking/knocking sound coming from my left front wheel. I've had this problem [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/Autos/comments/gokkd/creaking_noise_under_light_braking/) and figured it was my brake pads rubbing the rotor a little bit. 

But the sound was getting louder. I started to feel it in the steering wheel and all the pedals (brake, clutch, gas).

My internet research yielded the same results as the last time I had this problem, a laundry list of possible causes. Warped rotors, suspension links and bushings, cv joints, stuck caliper, poor quality brake pads, differentials... but this time I saw loose lug nuts. 

I check my wheel. 3 of the five lug nuts are loose to the point I could take them off by hand. They jiggled when I shook them. I was floored. 

I tighten them down and the noise is completely gone. 

I guess from this experience I've taken that I should always double check my lug nuts after any mechanic work that involves taking off the wheels. I'm also considering buying an inexpensive torque wrench and torquing them to spec myself.

And to others I recommend that if you have weird noises coming from the wheel area check those lug nuts! Don't make my stupid mistake.

1328550643.0,40,self.Cartalk,pdee1,How (not) to use DTCs (check engine codes) to diagnose problems,56,16,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/pdee1/how_not_to_use_dtcs_check_engine_codes_to/,"I see a lot of misunderstanding of what it means when your ""check engine light"" (MIL: Malfunction indicator Lamp) is on and what the ""codes"" (DTC: Diagnostic Trouble Codes) mean.  Let's discuss this a bit in general terms that apply to most vehicles and situations.  As with everything, there are always exceptions.

First of all, why does your MIL come on?  It's because the ECU has stored a ""hard"" DTC.  This is an event which likely has happened many times and with sufficient severity that the DTC has gone from a ""pending"" state (which you can read with a code reader but does not illuminate the MIL) to a ""hard"" state.  An easy example: you have a misfire on cylinder 1 once.  No DTCs are stored, pending or otherwise.  A counter and timer is started.  If this event reoccurs a specific number of times in a specific period of time (could be actual time, time when certain conditions such as speed or engine temp are met, or number of cold start cycles - for misfires it's typically just regular time) a pending DTC is stored.  If the event does not reoccur, the counter is cleared or decremented based on rules very similar to those that would increment the counter.  Should the counter reach a predetermined threshold a hard DTC will be set and your MIL will illuminate.  Specifically for misfires (and no other common DTC that I am aware of) this counter has a third threshold that when reached will flash the MIL.  This is a special situation for misfires that happens to tell you to STOP DRIVIG NOW because you are dumping enough raw fuel into your exhaust that it could cause catalytic converter damage.

Now, that was pretty simple, because P0301 means something very obvious: cylinder 1 is mifiring.  There's not much more to it than that, little room for interpertation, and little room for error.  Or is there?  What if the other cylinders on that bank are also misfiring but haven't reached a threshold to set a DTC?  That certainly changes the possible cause of this symptom from a single plug/wire/COP/compression/injector issue to something effecting an entire bank or the whole motor.  So how do you know what's going on?  Live data and logging.  You can see all of those counters as well as the DTCs with a laptop, some free software, and a $20 OBDII to USB cable off of eBay.

This is the part where I tell you about DTCs in general, even that very clear Cylinder 1 misfire, not being an actual problem.  DTCs are not problems.  They are symptoms.  If you keep that mentality you'll be able to successfully use them for diagnostics.

So the guy at AutoZone read the codes for you and it said P0420 Catalyst Inefficient and he told you that means your catalytic converter is dead.  Seems simple enough, but he's probably wrong.  All this actually means is that the upstream (pre-cat) and downstream (post-cat) O2 sensors are reporting similar values.  O2 sensors are chemical voltage generators.  They expect a difference between the upstream and downstream ones in an effort to tell if the catalytic converter is functioning well enough.  When that difference drops below a certain threshold it sets a hard DTC.

P0420=replace cat.  How can it mean anything else?  Well, if you know that your motor is running 100% (meaning all thing mechanical, all sensors, all ECUs, and good fuel) it really is that simple....the cat is bad.  But you really don't know that those other conditions have been met.  Chances are good they have not.  The first problem here is that O2 sensors age or get damaged in ways that the ECU hasn't yet met a criteria to call them ""bad"" and set an appropriate DTC.  There is a DTC dependency tree that makes a lot of sense but can be quite complicated.  An easy one that is applicable to this example is that you will NEVER get a P0420 if you have one of several codes indicating a problem with the upstream or downstream O2 sensor on that bank because it is rightly assumed that if either O2 sensor is bad, any extrapolated data from it will be bad as well.  This is why you can have a code indicating your upstream O2 is bad, replace it and clear that code, only to have a P0420 come up later: it was simply impossible for the P0420 to be set while the upstream was considered non or low-functioning.

More reasons you can't accept this P0420 diagnosis: you engine coolant temperature sensor could be faulty.  But that should set a DTC also, right?  Yes.  But just like O2 sensors, it can lie for a bit before the criteria are met for it to set a DTC and have it's data disregarded.  So you check that: it's pretty simple....you read the live data and compare it to another coolant sensor you have installed or the readings of an IR thermometer that has been appropriately placed.  How about another problem?  Retarded spark timing.  If your are actually knocking from fuel that is too low of an octane, incorrect or damaged spark plugs, etc the timing is going to get ""pulled"" by the ECU.  The fact that the ECU is doing this should preempt the P0420 code, but this won't always be the case, as the time overlap may not be great enough.  And, let's face it, this is software.  It's imperfect and you aren't exactly running Windows Update on it once a week.  Things just don't get fixed and mechanics who are familiar with your particular model car/ECU will probably be aware of these types of issues.  Now onto another one: exhaust leak.  If you have a leak in front of your upstream sensor if just might cause a P0420.  Conversely, if you have a leak in front of the downstream but behind the upstream it could actually MASK a failing catalytic converter from the ECU/sensors.

So here we are with what seems like a pretty simple DTC to diagnosis, yet we have 3 or 4 things, all of which are either or both cheaper or more likely to be the issue.  All of which require different methods to test and eliminate.  All of which require actual knowledge of how a motor works, what and where the sensors read, and how an ECU interprets and uses that data to be of any diagnostic value to you.

This is why the articles of late in regards to [""Ban the Check Engine Light""](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/01/ban-check-engine-lights/) are both short sighted and ignore the larger issue: DTCs are _NOT_ diagnoses.  They are often little better than vague pointers to a specific line of troubleshooting.  Improving the ""accuracy"" of these indicators, or making a car that was truly self-diagnosing would take so many sensors and redundant systems to check the validity of the data that it would be impractical both technically and financialy with what he have available today.

So there you have it.  Even though we have these wonderful data gathering devices in every car made past 1997 or so you still need someone who knows what they mean, because you simply can't accept their output at face value.  Fortunately, if you're reading this you are in a good spot to ask questions and learn much of this for  yourself.  Car specific forums are often even better, as certain DTCs tend to correspond with certain known problems that are make/model specific.

I've skipped over a lot here, but the intention was to give people who are just starting out wrenching or running to a parts store to have their codes read some insight on what they actually mean and hopefully save them some money on incorrect parts and the time it takes to replace them.",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_pdee1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/pdee1/how_not_to_use_dtcs_check_engine_codes_to/,

turning over - the starter is engaging the flywheel and turning the motor.  This is what happens when your car is working properly between the time when you turn the key to start and right before it actually starts firing and runs on its own.  It has nothing to do with if the car starts to run on its own or not.  Just that the starter motor is turning the engine.

cranking - see ""turning over"".  These are synonyms.

firing - the engine actually runs on its own power.

/r/cartalk is a great place with many regular posters from a wide variety of backgrounds ranging from professional mechanics to guys who have restored entire cars in their garage. Have a question about your car? Post away - someone here can probably help you. Have an answer or just a good tip? Please share.

In order to keep it from getting junked up with typical automotive forum garbage and to keep a viable car repair resource the following **rules** will be followed:

1.) **This is a car repair subreddit**. It is not for car reviews, pictures of cars you took in the mall parking lot, or asking if your mechanic ripped you off after the fact when there is literally nothing we can do to help you now.

2.) **Be specific**. ""MY WHITE CAR IS CLUNKING WHEN IT GOES WHAT COULD IT BE?"" is not going to get you anywhere. We need to know what make, model and year car you drive, and in most cases what motor is in it. Most cars are built with several different motor choices and for many problems it matters which one you have. If your MIL (""Check Engine"" or ""Service Engine Soon"" light) is on, we need to know that, as well as why. Use a code reader to get the code(s) and post the numbers (they will usually look like P&lt; 4_digits &gt;). If you don't have a code reader, most parts stores will read them for free.
Also, be descriptive in your post title. ""Car question"" or ""What could this be?"" are not good titles.

3.) **No car audio threads**. There is a reason why /r/caraudio was killed. We have no interest in repeating that here. If you have a question about your stock system malfunctioning, ask away. Want advice on putting in some ""SUBZ"" to get some ""MAD TYTE BASS""? Find an appropriate place to ask. This isn't it.

4.) **No car recommendation threads**. ""What's a good car for under $x?"" posts and the like will be deleted. Most are posted by people who have not bothered to do their own research first, and often times don't even bother to come back and respond. While there is generally nothing wrong with asking for advice on what car to buy, no one is interested in rehashing the merits of boring econoboxes every few days, telling you that spending $100 on a pre purchase inspection is the only way to go, or telling you why financing through the dealer at 14% with $1000 down is a bad idea.

1341676435.0,32,self.Cartalk,w6j16,"As there seem to be a LOT of Cranking No-Start (Turn key, engine spins, no start) Threads on here I wanted to create a little diagnostic reference for people to start with.",36,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/w6j16/as_there_seem_to_be_a_lot_of_cranking_nostart/,"I wanted to create this so that if submitters were able to do some preliminary diagnostics before posting, the assisting parties could focus their efforts a little more and there would be fewer people giving and getting incorrect and/or expensive advice leading the wrong direction.

Ok, here we go.

For a standard internal combustion engine to work it needs four main things.  Fuel, Air, Spark and Timing/Compression.  If these four things are present an engine has the potential to run, there are other thigns that can be wrong, but from my time working on cars, this will apply to 90% of cranking no starts.  AKA, you turn the key, the engine spins over but will not start.  And here are some basic tests to check for function.  I will include a set of tests for those who have some basic tools and for those without.  

The diagnostic tool kit (and absolutely necessary for those who want to work on cars)

1. Digital Multi Meter:  You can get these just about anywhere, a very basic one that can read voltage and resistance will be sufficient for most basic repairs and tests.

2.  Spark Tester:  These can be gotten at just about any parts store or online, there are many style and shapes out there, just get whatever you fancy.

3.  Fuel Pressure/Flow Tester:  Here we get into a little more specialized equipment, this is one of those you have to decide if you want to purchase, I will outline other ways to test for pressure here.  (Just be aware, if you have a diesel or direct injected engine any other method may be unsafe.)

4.  Timing Light:  With modern computer controlled engines, if you line up your timing marks, these are obsolete.  I have yet to use one on a car newer than the early 80s.

Onto the testing, we are assuming you have a cranking no start situation.  First off, don't panic! secondly, the last thing you want to do is just start throwing parts at this as it can get expensive and terrible very quickly.  But with some directed diagnostics you can save yourself a lot of time (and money.)

EDIT (thank you to derphurr):  One thing to add on, check your battery voltage, you simply do this by placing the leads of your volt meter on the + and - terminals, if you dont have at the bare minimum ~11.5V you will need to recharge your battery before doing anything else (most batteries range from 12.5-13.5V before applying a load to them) many cars wont even function at this level, but I have one car that will still start all the way down at 10.8V so I wont say they all stop functioning below 11.5, but as a rule of thumb I will either recharge it, or at least know that there may be some inherent issues with further testing.


* Spark:  This is usually the easiest to check and the most likely to be your problem.  
   
   1.  Visually inspect the system, are there loose wires?  if so try plugging them back in.  If there are broken damaged or arcing wires those are going to need replacing.

   2.  Check for spark, this involves disconnecting a spark plug boot, and inserting your spark tester, you then attach it to a ground and crank the engine and check to see if you get a nice electrical arc.  If you do, its most likely not an ignition problem.  If you have no spark, move to the next step.
   
   3.  If your car has a distributor, move to the coil to cap wire, do the same spark check test coming from the coil.  if you have spark there, then you are looking at a bad cap and rotor.  If there is still no spark there then we can address specific cars.  If you have no distributor, just check from coil to plug for spark and if no spark, then once again, its a case by case.

   4.  If you have made it to the coil, then you need to check if there is voltage going to it.  There are some differences from coil to coil, so once again a year make and model can get you more information from there.


* Air:  The inlet side of this is easy to check, outlet, not as easy.  
    
  1.  Look and make sure there are no kinks crimps or opens on the intake side of the engine.  should be kind of obvious if there are, another thing to check is air filter, and inlet, if these get gooped up badly enough it will not flow enough to allow the engine to do its thing.
 
  2.  Check under the car, is there a giant dent in a pipe under there?  if so, this could also be a big problem as it will not let the exhaust leave, this isn't helpful either.  if you see these, they might be your problem.

* Fuel:  Here it gets a little trickier, you'll need to hook up you fuel tester and then cycle the key and check what the pressure is, for most cars a good pressure is a bit north of 40, some are higher some are lower, you'll have to check your car's spec.  Also, the manner you hook these up is a little different from vehicle to vehicle, some are a schraeder valve on the rail, others you have to remove a bolt and thread in there you'll have to look on the web and find out how you are supposed to do it.

* Timing/Compression:  This is the hardest, if you have made it to this point, you are probably pretty far up a certain creek, and sadly it is completely dependent on your particular car and engine combo.  this is one of those that will require some time and familiarity to really be ale to check, so hopefully you can do the others first, and really unless you break a timing belt, your timing should never naturally come so far out that it cant run, it may run like crap but it should still run if you skip a tooth or two.

So that was how you do it with the proper tools. 

* Spark, instead of a tester you place a screw driver blade in the plug wires socket and hold the handle (insulated) so that the metal part is about 1/8"" from a good ground.  you should see a nice blue arc.

* Fuel:  For systems with a little valve:  get a rag and use a small flat head screw driver to simply press on the valve it should squirt out fuel, if it doesn't you arent getting fuel pressure.

* Air: well thats kind of a visual thing anyways.

* Timing: very likely its not happening without tools unless you have external timing marks, frankly fewer and fewer cars do these days.

Well, hopefully that helps, if mods want to make it a sticky/FAQ thing feel free, but jsut wanted to post this to hopefully help out those looking for assistance, also any ways I can improve this or make it more understandable, please let me know.

I know that post is over a month old, but I finally got around to fixing the issue. I pulled the carburetors and inspected them. 

There was a lot of junk in the bottom of the float bowls as well as the jet seats. The choke was stuck on the front carb, which was caused by the dashpot piston/jet sticking when it was down. The jet needle is straight, not bent, but the upper taper tended to get stuck. 

I should also note that the front carb is the one that has been giving me the most issues in the past. I have to keep the mixture nut very rich (in comparison to the rear carb) in order for the car to idle and rev smooth.  

I took my time cleaning them, checking clearances, and verifying smooth operation. I also removed the 40+ years of deposits on the intake manifold PCV ports (just for added protection). For the front jet, I simply moved it up in the piston housing by a 1/16th of an inch to give it clearance and richen the mixture. I gave the linkages a quick spray of silicone lubricant to assist with the choke and throttle operation.

I pulled the distributor cap and inspected the insides for damage or wear. There was some ashy buildup on the contact points on the inside of the cap, but not enough to cause the issue I was experiencing. I used some contact cleaner and a terry cloth to clean. Also checked the timing, but it didn't need adjustment. 

The car started right up after initial adjustments were made to the mixture. No stuttering when cold as well. Continued with minimal adjustments after the car fully warmed up. I took the car for a quick drive up to 45 mph with no issues, stuttering, or misfire.

Thank you to Caedus_Vao for pointing me in the correct direction to resolve the issue!

Basically, when I start it up, I need to really give it gas in order for the engine to turn over, and then I need to basically rev the engine every time I'm at a stop or the car will stall out. When I'm moving it's fine (though sometimes I'll stall at very low speeds), and once the engine's warmed up (5-10 minutes), everything gets fine. The idling can still be a little rough, but after 20 minutes or so of driving everything's pretty normal. 

I noticed the last time I was driving it that the idling issues seemed to go away at about the same time as the engine temperature gauge began moving up, but I'm not sure what the significance of that is. As has probably become evident, I'm not very knowledgable about cars but I am fairly handy and would love to try fixing this myself if possible. If not possible, it'd be great to at least get some concept of what I can expect to pay at a mechanic to get this fixed. 

PS: I'm not sure if this is related but I've also been gradually losing heat over the past couple years--I live in the south so it's never been much of an issue, but the heaters have gradually blown colder and colder air until maybe a year or two ago, there seems to be no heat coming out whatsoever. I've read elsewhere that gunk can build up in one of the manifolds--maybe something like that can affect cold idling as well?

This once tiny subreddit is getting a lot of traffic and a lot of attention, and I believe that's because we have so many core contributors that really know their stuff and answer a lot of questions.

As you all know, our goal has always been to put together a vibrant community that includes people who want to learn and do their own repair work as well as those who can assist.  Part of this goal is to ensure that we stay on target for our subject and make this a useful resource, not only for asking questions but as an archive of common issues that people can search and find accurate answers.

With that in mind, we've been tightly moderating posts to ensure they fit the rules we've laid out on the side bar.  Even when one of the mods misses a post that should have been removed I come back several hours later to find it reported and/or downvoted into oblivion and I thank all of you for pitching in and helping with that.  I take this to mean that many of you agree with our goal and method of making that happen.

With that in mind, I'd like to ask all of you to please refrain from making top level comments that are jokes, posing inaccurate or illegal advice (like how to bypass emissions components on street vehicles), memes, and all of the other things that turn so many comment threads in the larger subreddits into off topic circle jerks or arguments.  Reddit already has places for you to indulge yourself in that sort of ""discussion"" should you choose.  From this point forward, we will be removing comments of that sort and I encourage the rest of you to help by downvoting or reporting comments and posts that you see running afoul of these rules.

I've added some text to the submission page as well as comment submission box to remind people of these rules.

Thanks again for all of the help so many of you have given to CarTalk.  Us mods are turning into little more than the janitors/maintenance staff of the subreddit as so many of you are jumping in to provide advice and that's exactly how we had hoped things would turn out.

Keep the shiny side up.

A 17 year old car noob who got a 1985 Chevrolet G-20 van, Automatic V8, through an online contest. 

This story ends with my van. Before you ask, yes, it is a white, almost windowless van. The main issue I have right now is a sort of ""clunk"" which I believe is coming from the transmission.

The infamous clunk occurs to a lesser extent when accelerating rapidly, but is the worst when going up hills, and is accompanied by a massive power loss, sometimes pulsing, although it's difficult to tell if the power pulsing corresponds with the clunking, because by that point in time, I'm in ""Oh shit, I'm about to stop, accelerator to the floor, on this hill which I used to be able to hit 25, 30 going up!""

The van does leak some fluids, so I used to check the transmission fluid on a weekly basis, but it never strayed below the full line, and stayed at the same level, but when I checked yesterday, it was two pints short, which had to have leaked in the past month or two. I only had one pint of tranny fluid on hand, so I poured that in, and it didn't alleviate the clunking whatsoever. 

That's all I can think of, if I forgot to add anything really important, respond in all caps.

Oh, and if someone is feeling really adventurous, or just wants to feel better about their car, here's a laundry list of all the (known) problems:

* The right reverse light is spotty. Sometimes it stops working, and a swift punch to the face plate turns it on again. (This one I'm almost positive is a contact issue, I just haven't gotten around to fixing it.)

* One of the door stopper hinges (which prevents the door from swinging out too wide, and keeps it locked open) ripped through the sheet metal, and swings freely. Easy fix, if I knew how to weld.

* The gas intake is finicky, sometimes gumming up to the point where I have to pour gas in a certain pattern: pour .5 gallon, wait thirty seconds, repeat. No idea what this is.

* The cabin lights don't work. Probably burned out bulb, but I've got more pressing issues to deal with.

* The top rear hinge on the sliding door is weak, and the door sags/is a bitch to close. I'd probably need to replace the hinge, but for now, I'll deal with a temperamental door.

* The ignition is hard to engage at first, sometimes requiring two hands. After the starter engages, even if it doesn't catch, it becomes easier. No idea, minor complaint.

* The engine occasionally sputters out, usually in parking lots, especially on a gear switch. This is an RPM issue, not sure what the root cause is.

* The transmission makes a whiny noise in first gear. Apparently it's done this for years, so I'm not worried.

* The water pump whines a ton. I was going to replace the pump when I replaced the thermostat, but there were THREE timing belts. Fuck that, I'll just carry a replacement pump and a few v-belts in the back.

* The power brakes occasionally fail. This sounds like a major issue, but once you stop trusting them, you can compensate quickly. Water polo helps here. This one is probably a leaky vac hose, I'll have to check it out one day.

* The locks are too much of a pain to close, so every so often, my friends sneak in, and leave a wookie sitting in the driver's seat, half-eaten waffle in mouth. This is kind of bothersome, but makes my day every time.

And that's all I can think of at the moment, I'll probably edit this twelve billion times with new problems I remember.

tl;dr: I drive a death trap.




Edit: The clicking problem was happening in all gears. I say was, because sometime between when I drove it to school this morning and when I drove it back, the problem went away. The only thing I've done to the van since the problem occured was to add a pint of transmission fluid, which still left the level one pint under where it should be, and that was several days ago.

Ford's towing manual for this vehicle clearly states never to tow with the drive wheels down for fear of damaging transaxle components due to lack of proper lubrication, so I was prepared to pursue the towing company to pay for the damages until the symptoms mysteriously stopped.

The car is staying at the dealership for now. The service technicians there aren't sure what could cause this behavior to happen for ~24 hours and then disappear, or how it would be related to the towing trip, which I'm certain it is. At this point I'm not sure whether there's any permanent damage done which could cause a recurrence of symptoms or premature failure, and I'm looking for a plausible explanation of what could have caused the transmission to behave this way. Thanks in advance for any help.

First, it'd be great if anybody had any cheap fixes for any of those problems; but second, possibly more importantly - should I keep the car through the next few years of grad school and then get what I can from it when it really starts causing problems, or do I dump it now when it's still worth something?

I took a break for a while due to most ""proper"" mini owners being a bit elitist to me and my rusty mix and match cars. 

Now, I'm looking to go back to it as I realised how much it costs to run a modern car in the UK. Problem is, I want a different engine in my Mini. I want something a bit more modern to get a bit more MPG as well as giving a few less troubles, that and I've gone from carbs to injection powered 1.3 and I rather like it. 

I know there are plenty of modern engine mini's out there. Using things like Vtec's, Rover k-series and all that, but the subframes cost an utter packet (£1500+). 

I got enough brain cells to rub together, a welder, cutting tool and I tend to over do things. So I was wondering how you go about setting a different engine in a car.  

Its a front engine, front drive car. So, I'd use the same sort of engine. I get I have to use half shafts, odd wiring to get the ECU to work (or just use a megasquirt) but I've got no idea on what you measure to. 

Do I line up the output shafts to be in line with the hubs then secure around that (cut and tack mounts, recheck alignment, weld and check again). Or does output shaft location not really matter due to use of CV joints and I should look into getting the engine far back as I can for weight distro? 

Just wondering is all, I don't plan to do this for a while , I think I'd fully fit an A-Series engine first then get a few scrap parts to see if I could place a new engine on the subframe and what have you then slot it all in if I'm confident then plod off to an SVA test.

Anyway, it continued to leak air even faster after the plug, so I assumed the plug was bad (completely forgot about the fix-a-flat at this point).

Every mechanic he talked to refused to do it for him, so he did it himself.  
His argument: the front wheels are doing all the steering, driving and ~60% of the braking while the rear are only rolling along.  He is a ""thrifty"" person who doesn't want to spend money on the additional tires if it doesn't provide a significant benefit.  He says the mechanics refused to mount the tires on the car for him because they are trying to sell more tires and trying to cover their asses against being sued if something goes wrong.  
My argument is that this may have worked fine on old cars, but modern cars aren't designed for tires with differential traction profiles.  Between the ABS, traction control, and stability control systems on today's cars their inability to interpret data from tires grabbing the road differently may lead to performance actually being worse.  
Obviously four snow tires are better than zero or two, but is there danger to only having two?  
Why would several mechanics refuse to do this for him?  
If one (rear) tire locks up under braking does the ABS respond independently to that tire or globally to all tires?

Actually, I'll show you why. [THIS](http://thelongmile.posterous.com/dear-cowboy-mechanics-do-not-over-tighten-spa) is why! 

That is the screw thread from a regular spark plug that's completely separated from the nut and stayed in the head of the engine. Whatever idiot put this in made a right mess of it, and it took two screw extractors before it would even budge. The second of which being shown in the picture, the first being a complete write off. 

Please, do your future home mechanics a favour. Always spread a little copper grease on the thread (In fact, why not whip them out every few months and re-do this?) and always tighten to manufacturers specifications. If you don't have a torque wrench, go hand tight plus half a turn.


*pk386 added this - FYI: *hand tight + 1/8 turn on sparkplugs without washer *hand tight + 1/4-1/2*


In this instance I was lucky. I was able to remove the plug thread using my screw extractors and the one you see there is a straight type which got fairly solidly hammered home. Always use penetrating fluid, and always take your time! **There is no excuse for messing up the basics!**

In other cases you may have to remove the head to unscrew it from the other side, or if you're really unlucky, you'll have to drill the bit out and then helicoil a new thread in. Not a pretty task!

When I put the car in park, the car kept going, it was still in drive.  It felt like you had just taken your foot off of the brake, but not applying any gas. The car was moving forward at about 1 mph.  The shifter had no tension -- it was completely stripped.  Park, neutral, reverse, etc. did nothing.  I did not stop the car, but decided to drive straight home.  After turning the car off, I could not get it started again, because the car was still in drive.  I even had to use the emergency brake to keep the car from rolling.   (It has to be in park or neutral for the starter to engage.) I thought I was screwed as in this was going to be a major transmission issue.


With the help of my uncle over the phone and this wonderful video, I was able to fix my car! [Shift Cable Repair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQN8EYXXldc)


The shifter cable had come undone from the transmission lever and just needed to be reattached.  For the life of me, I could not find a rubber band at my house.

Once attached, I could shift the car into park and start the car.  Drive, reverse and park are now working correctly again.

What make this a major win for me is that I am not at all mechanically inclined.  I am a computer guy.  You always hear of transmission repairs costing a lot of money, too.

Before I drop off the car at the mechanic, I am going to stop by a parts store to see if this is something I can completely repair myself.

I said hell with it and drove it to my in-laws' house. Fixed the current problem for $20. Fixed another problem ($300 garage job) for $60. Spent about $60 in fuel (still have half a tank).

My father-in-law replaced the leaking line in about 30 minutes. Before I got out there to help him he came in and said ""I need you to step on the pedal"". 

Also replaced two pulleys (idler and tensioner) since the more urgent repair didn't take long. (idler was fine... spent $30 for nothing but oh well, both require removing the belt)

* What other things should I replace since I'll have the trans-axle off?  I was thinking maybe CV boots as well anything else?

Next steps?,28,8,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/12xd3g/i_bought_a_used_car_on_craigslist_that_turned_out/,"**THE BACKGROUND:** A German exchange student just moved into my house in August and she had been looking for a car with a budget of $2,000. She finally narrowed it down to a 2001 Ford Taurus, and the buyer seemed kind enough. We got it for $1,700. I've never bought a used car, and I followed an inspection checklist I found on the Internet. I also did a Carfax and it came out fine. I didn't know at the time that I could have a mechanic come scope it out on site.

When we took it to the mechanic to check out the brakes a couple weeks after the purchase, he noticed a blown head gasket. My heart sank. I basically feel responsible for destroying her car budget because there's no way she could recover from what the mechanic called a ""$1,500 bill, easy.""

This experience has taught me about the proper way to buy a used car. But lessons aside, I want to get this car working for her. I really feel like I owe it to her. She needs the car until June for mostly 10- to 15-minute city street drives, with the occasional 45-minute freeway drive.

**MY QUESTION:** With no car experience at all, but an eager desire to make this right, is there a lower-cost solution (even DIY) to fixing the blown head gasket or ""giving it a Band-Aid"" that wouldn't entail a $1,000+ repair?

I figured it was just some oil in the pan, but when I drove to get her, she started it up and it was like a fucking rock concert fog machine shooting out the entire bottom of the car.  We had it towed to a garage and it seems that the geniuses at the oil change joint drained the transmission fluid, and then completely overfilled the oil which is what was burning like crazy.  Now how much damage could be caused from driving around 2 miles with no transmission fluid and what should we expect from the place cleaning off all that excess oil?  Any help and info is appreciated, I am just awful with cars.

UPDATE:

Spoke with the woman.  The mechanic at the dealer that inspected the car backed up everything from before that the oil change place did fuck it all up.  The transmission seems to be fine, but who knows in a few weeks or so if we might have problems.  The woman spoke with the oil change place this morning after I dropped her off for work and they said to send them the bill for anything the dealer says was their fault.  I'm still watching these guys like a hawk and they were informed that they will be held responsible in our eyes for any problems in the immediate future with the trans.  They were a bit apprehensive but the mention of ""our lawyer"" made them much more cooperative.  I'll report back with a update later tonight or tomorrow.  

Thank you all very much for the information you've provided.  You really helped make a stressful situation much easier with the knowledge you've imparted. A thousand up votes to you all.

Update again.  So the car seems to be running very well, although it stinks like oil of course.  After we picked it up yesterday we drove to the oil change spot.  While the manager assured us he'd be there and the open sign was on, they were closed.  He did call and leave a message with the girlfriend (something it would have been nice if she checked) and said they are once again very sorry and just wants to let us know he'll be there all day today.  She'll be shooting over after work and will hopefully have a check in her hand.  

Oh, and after I actually talked to the mechanic instead of hearing the girlfriends interpretation of the mechanic there was still some trans fluid in the car, it was just very low.  

**Epilogue** So they cut a check for the full amount of what the dealer charged us to fix everything, refunded the oil change, and gave her a coupon for a full detail.  They signed a statement that they will be responsible for any other problems caused by this to the transmission and engine should those problems arise over the next year.  Just glad it's over.

(2006 Saturn VUE.)  This included an oil change, and new front pads. I also pointed out that the brakes were squealing and was curious if they needed to be adjusted or just cleaned, so I asked if this could be done, too. 

A week later, the brakes still squeal when applied (forward or reverse,) and now, the car shakes very badly if any brake pressure is applied at speeds above 35-40MPH, and much worse at freeway speeds.  The whole car shakes at freeway speeds, est 65MPH+.

Initially, I thought perhaps it was because the pads were new and needed to be broken in, but it's gotten progressively worse, and now I'm concerned that the rotars could be warped -- but equally frustrated that, if that's the case, then it's so sudden, and they didn't say anything to me at the time of repair.
This Monday I'm slated to be driving this car 1200+ miles up and down the West Coast, and I don't feel even remotely comfortable with that right now.  I'd like to take the car back to the dealership early this weekend.  Do you think this is something the mechanics could have done?  (Or not done?)  

For other information - this car has never been in a collision, never been curbed or hit *anything* and has had regular maintenance ever since purchased (new) and I'm the only owner of the car.  It has about 50k miles on it and has otherwise never given me any problems.

Darthcaldwell was kind enough to create this subreddit so those who aren't located near me could get car help.

First off, I would like to give a very special thanks to darthcaldwell for all his help and his active roll in this subreddit. Without him r/Cartalk wouldn't even exist.

But most of all, I would like to thank you, our r/Cartalk readers. Without you we would be nothing. I would like to thank those who ask questions, those who are willing to pick up a wrench and get to work on their own cars. I would like to thank all those who offer help, those who have answers to the tough questions.

So to wrap up: Thank You. Thank you for making this once tiny obscure subreddit into an awesome growing community. You guys are the gasoline that fuels our passion for cars. You are the ones who keep this community strong.

On behalf of r/Cartalk, thank all thousand of you. I hope we continue to grow, prosper, and help those in need. Keep up the great work!

Please be polite. Treat those asking for help with respect, and answer without bias toward them, their situation, or their knowledge (or lack thereof) about the repair issues. Also respect those that take the time to answer questions and remember that many are professional mechanics, who normally get paid very well to diagnose automotive repairs.

By making a good attempt to narrow down where and what may be causing the problem you save those trying to help many steps in diagnosing the problem. Be sure to also include the year, make, model and engine size of you car in your title, along with your main issue. For example ""2003 Ford Crown Victoria 4.6L exhaust manifold bolts rusted off"" would be an acceptable post title.

My brake pedal gets stiff after I've been driving for ~20 miles, sooner if I've been in traffic and have had to apply to the brakes frequently but sometimes it happens even if I've yet to use my brakes at all. It starts with the pedal getting stiff, then comes to the point where I notice a slight drag on the front end, almost like my brakes are being applied. If I let my foot off the gas it's like I've hit my brakes, the car slows down much faster than it should were I just coasting. If traffic is bad enough and I've used my brakes a lot I can take my foot off the brake/gas and my car won't move. 

The way I've learned to solve this issue is pulling over, turning my car off and waiting about 15-30 seconds. I will then hear a creaking noise and feel my car rock back and forth, like something is being released. When I start my car back up the pedal is back to normal and typically won't stiffen up again unless I get caught in a lot more stop/go traffic. 

This has become a huge issue, I burned through a brand new set of ceramic brake pads in 3 months, literally down to the metal. I had the following replaced last weekend, but the issue still exists. 

Brake pads, Rotors, Calipers, Brakes bled multiple times. Mechanic at a garage removed my emergency brake claiming this was the issue, it wasn't, had him put it back on after that was discovered.

I slid across the street and my drivers side front tire hit the curb pretty bad. It knocked my steering off about 30 degrees to the right, and it wasn't driving well at all. I took it to Pep Boys and they told me that I need to replace the control arm and ball joint, and an F control arm and along with fixing the alignment it'd run me about 600$. I had my brother (aspiring mechanic) take a quick look at it and he said he didn't see anything wrong with the control arm but that my ball joint was bad on the drivers side. I then took it to a Meineke for a second opinion (they do it for free unlike Pep Boys) and he said there was nothing wrong with the control arm or the ball joint, and that I bent my frame. He even showed it to me. He said I must have hit it at the perfect spot because usually the control arm takes most of the damage and leaves the frame intact. He couldn't give me an estimate on how much it would be to fix it because they don't do body work. I'm really nervous to drive it around but I don't really have a choice right now. (Work and class and no other way to get to them). He said if I really have to drive anywhere, to be careful because I'm wearing down my tire the way it is right now. Also about an hour after the accident I noticed that my check engine light came on (wonderful -_-) He said the frame being bent wouldn't cause that to go off, but that the accident could have knocked some stuff around under the hood, making it go off. 
Now I have to go home and break the news to my parents, who aren't going to be very happy. (I was involved in a car accident in December and I've only had this car for a month.)
My question is, what do you think about these mixed opinions on what's wrong with my car? And where do you suggest I take it to get fixed? I live in South Jersey. Also, possibly a ball park idea on how much it'd cost to bend it back into shape? Any help at all would be appreciated. :)

TLDR; 2002 Hyundai Elantra slid into curb. Left tire is at a slight inwards angle, making driving super hard.

The car running fine so far and I want to keep it that way. According to the service book the engine oil is changed every 10,000 km and the transmission is every 100,000 km.

However, ever since I got a car from company this car is rarely used, usually only used once a week and for short trip only. 

Before I got car from work I always change the engine oil every 7500km or 6 months and using full synthetic 5w/40 oil (changed it early due to driving in 100% heavy crazy city traffic full of traffic jam here in Jakarta).

I often change the oil even the odometer reads only 1000km because the age of oil already 6 months, but the mechanic on the workshop this is not necessary,  this is really overkill especially I'm using fully synthetic oils. Then I extend the duration to one year and yet this workshop still saying that I am wasting my money when he see my odometer only adds less than 2000km from last oil change. I find this odd because I am paying them for changing my oils?

What I know is the more often the oil is changed is better for the engine, but not for the environment. How often is too often? And also, how about the transmission oils? How often should I change it? 2 years? 5 years?

I live in Indonesia with tropical climate, and the car always sits on the garage when not used so protected from weather (does this matter on oils age?)

Here's some background: During a long trip a few months ago the truck overheated and seized up. I got AAA to tow the vehicle back to my house and it's been sitting on the side of the road ever since. When I tried to pop the hood, the release cable snapped. I had to remove the headlights and take out two bolts on either side in order to get under the hood. I checked all of my coolant lines and radiator; they were negative for leaks. The car starts fine, but I haven't driven it in months. My instrument cluster has had some sort of electrical issue ever since I bought the car so all the gauges stay flat. I have no way of telling if my engine is running hot or not.

I was pretty stumped so I got a friend of mine who works on cars to take a look. He shined a light down into the cylinder head and saw a pretty sizable crack. I had him run an estimate for the repair - he wants $1200 for parts and labor and apparently this is a good deal.

I'm done with this car and just want to get rid of it. I'm not sure if I should pay my friend to fix it and then try to sell it, if I should junk it, or if I should just sell it as is. It has 145k miles on it, the gauges don't work, there are some scratches on the hood and a little rust on the hub caps. My key cylinder jammed up a while ago so I drilled it out.

I'm using about a 0.8 oz/gallon premix of 2-stroke oil in the gas tank.

Anyone know if flames are a cause for concern?  I know a lot of people make it happen on purpose for show on some cars, so some of you must know a little about what causes it (unburnt fuel from the sudden throttle decrease during shifting?), and if it's dangerous or damaging in any way.

One of my students brought in a vehicle that he said was having A/C trouble, and he and several of the other students were trying to diagnose the problem. The static pressure was very low, so they recovered the refrigerant, pulled a vacuum, and charged the system to check for leaks.

Here's where the PSA part comes into play.

The student thought the vehicle had rear A/C - it didn't. Because he thought it had rear A/C, he added the correct amount of refrigerant for a vehicle with rear A/C. In other words, he severely overcharged the system (though I didn't know this at the time). Well, I've never seen one so overcharged and I figured if the pressure got too high the pressure switch would cut the compressor clutch off, or at worst the relief valve would vent the excessive pressure. I've seen both happen before. Today, however, I was wrong on both counts. Once he started the vehicle and turned on the A/C, it ran for about three seconds before one of the lines to the condenser ruptured. It was louder than an airbag deployment, and the entire shop was cloudy from all the refrigerant and oil. No one was hurt (safety glasses!), but I bet one or two of them shit their pants just a little. The words coming out of my mouth were ""Is everybody okay?"", but in my mind all I could think about was Jeff Spicoli saying ""Awesome! Totally awesome!"" Remember that scene at the end of Blues Brothers where the Dodge throws a rod and Elwood has to clean the windshield with his sleeve? That's how much oil and dye was all over the windshield of this thing. The moral of the story is that if you're working on the A/C system of a vehicle that may or may not have rear A/C, don't make any assumptions. You just may make a mess of the shop and/or your pants. Or lose an eye.

**TL;DR - My student grossly overcharged and AC system today and made a totally awesome refrigerant explosion in the shop. Pants may or may not have been shit.**",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_s8ju3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/s8ju3/ac_psa_for_friday_the_13th/,

WINNER GETS A MONTH OF REDDIT GOLD!

I had the most unusual issue with my vehicle the other day, and it took 3 days to figure out before any parts were thrown at the issue. Its fixed now and I found it to be highly unlikely, but take a guess. 

Also, you cannot just guess a bad part, you need an explanation to win!

Details: 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0, no engine modifications or exhaust at all. Regular maintenance and no neglect other than a torn CV boot which was replaced when the axle failed 8 months later. (I was lazy and cheap).

Story: I drove to work, 9 hours later went to go home and the engine turned over and over with no luck starting. The gas gauge read past empty, and the battery read ~9v. There was no engine light, so I could not use my scanner. Luckily working at a parts store, I just grabbed a jerry can and ran to the gas station and filled the tank with 10L just to get it started.

The tank still read empty, nothing else has changed at this point. Go for it cartalk, let me see what you can guess. I'll give more details as you guess if it applies!

**Edit:**

So far its been found that the battery is fine, the gauges read 9v which is false, the fuel pump is working but not getting power, its not a bad ground/water damage, and scanners cannot read the ECU.

We're dealing with fuel, if you don't have common sense, don't do this kind of work! Send it to a mechanic.* 

I am not a mechanic. I fix my car when it breaks, and that hasn't been too often. From wasting time troubleshooting these all in the wrong order, I've made a QUICK AND DIRTY list of items one should go through before changing your fuel pump. I'm not explaining in depth how to complete each item. So read up on each one.

Also, feel free to copy, paste, and edit anything from this. I'm not promising it's 100% correct.


**How to check if fuel pump is dead**

 - Make sure it’s not out of fuel

 - Check if you can hear the Fuel Pump by Removing gas cap and put ear up to it, have someone cycle the key. Most pumps start for 2-4 seconds to 'prime the engine' before the engine starts

       - If you CAN hear the fuel pump, jump to ""checking the fuel pressure"". Just because it's running, doesn't mean it's doing it's job!

 - Is the Fuse blown?

       - If It’s good, move onto next step

 - Is the Relay working?

       - You should be able to put a finger on the relay and feel it click on when the key is cycled

       - You should also be able to hear the relay click on when the key is cycled

       - If the relay is not clicking, it could be a bad relay, try another relay

       - If the new relay is not clicking, the cars controller might not be telling it to turn on

       - Test this by using a voltage detector on each female plug where the relay plugs in..Please read into this! You don't want to over-extend the female sockets, and you need to find out which should be hot at all times, and which should only be hot when the fuel pump is running. If it's acting as expected, move onto the next step.

 - If everything still is working, hook up a fuel pressure gauge to your fuel rail ($40-$60), IF the car has the port for it. It looks similar to an Air connection on the tire. 

      - If the gauge reads 0 when trying to start the car, there is 0 fuel making it to the engine

      - If there is a reading, check your manual what the reading is supposed to be.

      - A reading and spikes means the pump is pumping. You probably don't need to go on, unless it's intermittent 

 - At the gastank, see if you can access and disconnect the wiring going to the pump and confirm electricity is making it to the pump, with a voltage detector. REMEMBER, sparks and fuel are not good!

 - If 1-6 is good, then you likely have a bad pump. 

 - Once you get to the pump, inspect all hoses and clamps, sometimes it’s a simple thing that fell off or broke and a full new pump might not be required. Though, after this much work, it might be worth it to just put a new pump in!

Anyways the shop owner told me the caliper needs to be replaced because the wear is uneven on one side (20% left on the interior pad, 30% left on the exterior). Is that a correct course of action? I asked him of we could just clean and grease the pins, but he said moisture from living here in the northwest (WA metro area) gets into the piston, so it needs to be rebuilt. 
Also when I asked if I could keep the caliper they're replacing just to fiddle and learn more about it, he would need to charge me $80 for it, since he said they rebuild it and sell it back or use it for the next customer.

So last time I got my oil changed, I took it to a shop, and as tends to happen, they got Hercules to screw that shit on there, and there's no way I can get it off. The filter for some reason was slightly too large for my usual oil filter wrench (the kind that's like a really large driver that attaches to a socket wrench), so I used a strap wrench, which successfully crushed the thin body of the filter. So then I decided to just go out and buy a traditional oil filter wrench, the inch-wide-band-of-metal kind, but I can't get purchase because the thing is crushed. Then I remembered an old gearhead friend of mine that once punctured all the way through a filter with a screwdriver and that allowed him to get the purchase and leverage necessary. So I did that, but still can't get leverage on it enough to get the filter to budge (and also I'm worried that it will just sorta cut through the filter). 

So i guess now my options are to go to the hardware store and get a really long screwdriver for more leverage, or get the damn thing towed to a shop, look like an idiot, and have them fix my problem for me. But I really don't like that option. Any suggestions?

I like the towel idea, but I had already punctured it. may try that next time, also that 3-pronged oil filter wrench thing looks awesome!

But then I hit something and it wasn't loose enough to do it more, so I had to punch like 3 more holes in the thing before I was able to get it loose enough to do with my hand. The really frustrating thing is that my original oil filter wrench (when I bought practically when I got the car) worked just fine on the oil filter I bought, just the damn made-in-tokyo bulk filter was a hair too big.

**Why does this specific information matter?**

Well, a lot of manufacturers offer cars with a variety of engines, and as such, a variety of different parts. For instance, I have a 1987 Volvo 760. The 760 came with two radically different engines. One was a 2.7L naturally aspirated PRV V6, the other was a 2.3L Turbocharged 4cyl. *Literally none of the engine parts are compatible, including stuff like the alternator and AC compressor*. In addition, the wiring is completely different for those two motors even though the rest of the car (suspension, body panels, interior, etc) is the same.

**Don't forget to include modifications!**

Though not always installed by the person who's driving the car, don't fail to mention modifications or changes to your vehicle, if you know of any. This applies for here on /r/cartalk and also when you take your car to the shop. For instance, my '85 Volvo 240 has an upgraded alternator, taken from a '94 Volvo 940T. The stock 240 Alt puts out 55A and is made by Bosch. The upgraded alt puts out ~110A and is made by Nippondenso. This is a relatively minor modification, but if your car is for instance, turbocharged, and it wasn't from the factory, that's a good thing to know.

He had me lay across the seats as to put wight on them while he did something with the passenger's side rear wheel. He said something was turning. I'm not usually naive, but I feel like I was in this situation. What just happened? My breaks feel fine (maybe even better), but I also feel like what I was doing couldn't have been right.

These qualifiers make these statements vague.  Why?


If it really protects to 120,000 miles, does the bottle state it protects to 60,000 for different applications or because it might be used by consumers after some wear and damage was already done and so more frequent changing is required?

If it really protects to 60,000 miles, does car maintenance schedule state to change it at 120,000 to suggest that the vehicle needs little maintenance, foregoing the protection and life of the cooling system?

Is there something else at play here, such as an additive from the factory or that the coolant's specifications were revised after further testing or the coolant was reformulated for more protection?  And if the specifications were changed, which way were they changed and which is it now?

Today, I pulled up to a stop sign. When I started driving, I heard first gear, then BANG (violent shake for a second), then second gear, then third, then fourth. I pulled over as soon as I could to see if anything was laying on the road. Knowing that doom was coming, I decided to turn back home.

I put the truck in drive, and all it did was rev up. No movement. I then shifted to first gear, and the truck started moving. I repeated up to drive, and everything seemed okay. Came to a stop in drive, same problem. The engine would just rev. Put it back in first. Repeat.

I checked the transmission fluid in the truck and compared it to fresh fluid. [Here is a picture of the result.](http://i.imgur.com/1XzrA.jpg) There are no warning lights on the instrument panel, so I didn't bother to hook up the computer as it is OBD-I.

Well it did it again yesterday leaving me stranded with my son until it went away ten minutes later only this time the check engine light wont seem to turn off after I clear the code. After some research I found the follwing about this code:

""The p0942 code happens when it sees the malfunction in the hydraulic pressure unit control. The malfunction may not happen right away, it may take time for the vehicle to drive before the transmission control module sees the problem. The module most likely wont pick up on it immediately, but when the module recognizes the issue the transmission goes into Stuck limp home mode and the tcm will command max line pressure. Dont want to say that it is an intermittent issue but it takes certain failure parameters to be met before the tcm picks up on the issue. These parameters will need to be reached during the drive cycle before it retrips the code and goes into limp home mode. Sometimes all it takes is pulling over and turning it off and back on, you may be able to drive for a while before it retrips the code, all depends on how bad the failure is at this point""

Pics inside.,23,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/11wm7k/sludged_engine_advice_needed_pics_inside/,"So I recently inherited an '03 Hyundai Elantra that runs like crap. I tried to change the oil, only got about 1 qt. out of it, and pouring new oil in proved almost impossible, as the oil would pool at the cap and not flow into the engine. It was a slow, painstaking process, but I eventually got 3 quarts in it. I have not driven it more than a couple miles since.


Yesterday, I decided to pop off the valve cover and take a look inside, and discovered [this mess](http://imgur.com/a/XOlRc) (Sorry for the low picture quality). I imagine this thing hasn't had a proper oil change in a very long time. I haven't dropped the oil pan yet, but I imagine it won't be a pretty site, and will clean it out thoroughly. 
Now, my question is: should I attempt to manually de-grease and wipe out the sludge build up by hand (it is mostly solid, though goopy in some places), should I use an additive de-greaser like Auto-rx, or will simply changing the oil and filter frequently eventually clean the mess up?


I'm getting conflicting advice from all of the online research I've done. Thanks in advance for your input!

EDIT: Well, looks like I'm getting the same range of advice that my previous internet searches yielded. Seems like there are multiple ways to deal with this issue. I want this car to last for at least a couple more years, once I've fixed it up, and on that note I think I'll avoid any drastic cleaning measures, as TrouserPudding recommends below. After reading the comments here, I think that my performance issues probably do not stem from the gunk itself. I do have a check engine light, and I'm fairly certain there are electrical problems, and I'll focus my attention on those.

So, in conclusion: I'll go with high quality oil and filters, with frequent changes over the next few months. I am going to drop the oil pan and clean it out, and check the oil pickup screen. I'll pull the valve cover off again after a few oil changes, and see if there is any improvement.

I don’t know if it’s relevant but my car is pretty messed up.  I have random misfires on different cylinders, a really rough idle, and hesitation when accelerating.  The severity of the symptoms varies from day to day.  I got the timing belt replaced about 3 years ago – and the symptoms started shortly after that.  I know, crazy that I’ve been abusing my poor car for so long, but I took it back to them immediately after the symptoms and to several other mechanics after the symptoms started and have spent a boat load of money fixing approximately nothing.  The place that did the timing belt told me it was the brakes…  The next place said it was the battery.. The next place the alternator… The next place said I needed transmission service..  The next place said it was that I needed to replace my head gaskets and CV axles – I said fuck it at this point and did some research on my own knowing approximately fuckall about cars.  I thought it might be the plugs/cables/coil pack.  I’ve replaced all those on my own but the symptoms remain.  I think it must be the timing belt is off by like a notch but it’s 3 years after the shop made (what I assume) is that mistake, so I can’t imagine they’ll fix it for free – and it’s a really expensive job for a poor person like myself.  This is a pretty long winded way to say I believe I have a timing problem, and would that make me fail my emissions test?  And can I trick it into passing until I can afford fixing the timing belt again?

1349129068.0,17,self.Cartalk,10s7qb,I have a 2003 Pontiac Vibe ( -slash- the worst weekend I've had in a long time) story that I thought you might enjoy.,22,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/10s7qb/i_have_a_2003_pontiac_vibe_slash_the_worst/,"My wife and I had a wedding to go to this weekend.  Destination = 9 hours away.  We have a 6-month-old and a 2-year-old, so we decided to drive 1/2 way on night 1, and go the rest of the way the next morning.

Day 2 started out poorly:

1) I had the runs.  Excuse the term, but it was Grade A butt-piss.  All of the characteristics of the worst-of-the-worst.  10/10 nasty smell.  10/10 painful exit.  10/10 liquid-to-solid ratio.  Awful start to the day.

2) go to breakfast @ Sonic and they messed up my order.  So I had no food aside from the 1/2 that I could split with my wife.  Not terrible, but their order mess-up fit in well with the rest of this awesome day.

3) car trouble:

It was chilly that morning, so maybe 15 miles outside of town, my wife asked for me to turn on the heat.
When I turned on the heat, the air never warmed up, and I noticed a noise.  It was a mechanical noise, right behind the dash.  It sounded like something mechanical was trying to move into a different position, but was failing... and it was attempting every 30 seconds or so.

I was low on gas (my annoyed attitude @ sonic led me to simply hit the road instead of filling up), and my temp gage was fine.  So I thought I'd hit the next exit, fill up with gas and take a look under the hood.

2 miles later, my 'fuel low' light came on and the engine started sputtering.  I thought, ""great... my fuel 'float' is broken -- it says 1/4 tank, but it's probably empty.""

An exit was approaching, my speed was reducing, so I put my blinker on to take the exit.  Then, the car started smoking, white smoke (i believe).  I coasted onto the off-ramp to level ground.

I popped the hood... it was smokin' hot.  And... so much for my reasoning that something 'mechanical' wasn't lining up with the ventilation system... the radiator reservoir tank was pretty much empty.

The temp gage may have said that everything was o.k., but it was evident that she was over-heating, times 10.

After hanging out alongside the road in the middle-of-nowhere kansas with a 2-year-old and a 6-month-old, someone stopped and had a gallon of water for us.

I added it to the radiator reserve tank and tried starting the thing.  It was like the starter wasn't engaging.  Belts were turning, and I'm no mechanic, but something seemed funky with the starter.  I had a few thoughts there... coulda been the computer saying 'hey... something is bad, so don't start.'  (so I removed one of the battery cables and cleaned a post -- my thought was that simply removing the power would reset the computer if that was the issue).

Nothing.  I banged the starter a few times.  Old trick that I thought would maybe fix the issue.  Ixnay.

In the meantime, our motor club had sent a tow truck.  We took it to the next town... and this is where the crappiness of my week continues:

4) All-State Motor Club had sent us to Enterprise for a car rental.  Calling Enterprise on the way, we found that they were closed on Saturday.  So we called all the others that we could find.  The town was Hays, Kansas, and we called all the dealerships, 3rd party auto-rental companies, towing companies, everything we could think of... NOTHING.  I got a hold of a guy who ran a towing company who said, ""yeah, if you're going to try to rent a car here on a saturday, you're going to have problems.  There's a place that claims to have 24-hour rental services, but I've tried there about seven times, and they never answer.""

5)  So... mechanics closed.  car rental places closed.  wedding starts in 2 hours and the town is 1 hour and 50 minutes away.  The towing guy then says that one of their mechanics is in (he was from a smaller town about 20 miles back.)  They could probably take a look at it and if it's the starter, they probably have one and could MAYBE get everything fixed that afternoon.

We get there.  Turns out that the mechanic left and wouldn't be back until Monday.  Sooo...

6) We missed the wedding and were stuck in a town of 1000, with a McDonald's and a Pizza Hut (that didn't deliver).

We did a really good job of keeping our spirits up, but, every little thing that could have gone wrong, did go wrong.  Even the ATM machines at every locale we were at did not work.  So, no tip for the towing guy.

Well... it's now monday.  Mechanics are in.  My guesses about the starter were wrong (my not being a mechanic and understanding the sounds of the starter, etc.) -- the issue is that the engine doesn't have any compression.  Probably a blown gasket.

The car was purchased for $5K  Getting to the head gasket will be at least $1500... and if it isn't a blown gasket, then it'll be more.

I'm thinking that the car is going to be a parts car / project car... so if anyone has any insight that the mechanic may have missed, it is more than welcomed.  More than anything, though, I thought someone here might enjoy the story of my awesome weekend.

I have a intermittent cruise control failure.  Get this, it has only happened when I am driving south on the freeway.  I know, I know, what does the direction of travel have to do with it.  Nothing really, it's just an odd coincidence.  I'll be driving along, with cruise control around 65mph in 5th gear.  All the sudden I start to decelerate, quickly, and my cruise control light (on the dash) has gone out.  I cannot hit the ""resume"" button.  I have to turn the whole system on and off and then I can restart cruise control.  Sometimes I get an immediate failure when I try to resume, sometimes I don't.  Sometimes the light on the dash stays on.  One constant is I can never resume cruise control until I have turned it on and off again.

Oh, and it only happens heading southbound.

Any ideas?

Something about the south thing.... It could be heat related.  Usually when I get the failure it's the first time the car has run all day.  The car sits in the sunlight and heat all day, and it's hot I live in SLC, UT.

What should I do?,20,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/y4t7w/wifes_new_car_got_flooded_what_should_i_do/,"We live in Western NY and had freak flash flood two weeks ago. My wife's new Subaru Forester 2012 was in the low end of the parking lot, and was sitting in water for three hours when she left work and drove it three miles home. The water on the inside was up only to the floors, and I think it came through the doors. I vacuumed the water out as best I could, but they were soaked underneath. Then called the insurance guy and took it a reputable shop in town. The thing is we never get real flooding out here, so the shop guy and insurance agent didn't know how to assess the damage. They tore out the seats and carpets and dried the car out. They're replacing the flooring and re-greasing the electrical sockets but that's pretty much it. 

Now, a few people I talked to were saying things that were scaring me a little. 

Things like: the water should'nt have come through the door's weatherstripping after being in water for only three hours. Could it have come in through the floor?
The electric wires should all be replaced as they'll corrode in a few years.
They should change my transmission fluid and oil.

Are these valid concerns? The auto shop said they would recommend this be an ""open"" call so issues that arise in years to come can be associated with this claim (and hopefully deductible).

A couple of months ago, the BAS/ESP, ETS and ABS lights came on but there weren't any obvious effects on the brakes as far as I could tell. My boyfriend/mechanic troubleshot it: replaced the brake light switch, checked the fuses and relays, the booster, master cylinder. We were waiting for some extra money at the end of the summer to replace some more expensive parts.

He's gone now, though (working), and wanted me to get my oil changed. So I did... The mechanic (works only on Mercedes) changed the oil and we chatted about the lights. He started to run through a couple of things that might be going on and asked me if my cruise worked. I said it did and I haven't had any problems with it. He wanted to check the fuses under the hood, he did, said he didn't find anything and we talked about how much it might cost to get the lights turned off.

Later that day, on my drive to work, the cruise control was no longer working. The brake pedal also was intermittently hard. When it happens (about twice a day) , it moves very little, but will ""break"" and continue to move down with more pressure. This freaked me right the fuck out. I've **never** had this feeling in the brakes before. 

The fact that these problems appeared immediately after this conversation has me suspicious, but I don't want to jump to conclusions about the guy who changed my oil. I went behind him and looked at all the brake-related fuses... none were blown. I switched a couple relays: heater blower (k21) with the ABS hydraulic unit (k25)- nothing. When I switched the horn (k2) with the brake supressor light/ESP (k6), the horn started blowing so I assumed the relay was bad and left the horn relay in the k6 slot. The Vacuum pump slot (F40) was empty so I got a fuse for it and stuck it in, even though I know that might not be necessary for my car. None of that worked.

The cruise is still not functional, the pedal still gets hard sometimes (usually when I'm going under 15mph) and I just found out that the brake lights are also out. Should I take it back to the guy who changed my oil? I can't afford to take it to the dealership, but driving it with the brakes acting up scares me. Anyone have any ideas??

Toyota found code P0741 Verified Failure, “found solenoid for torque convertor clutch stuck,” and told me I needed to replace my entire transmission for close to $5k. The person I spoke to said that the problem is my car is not switching to 4th gear, and when I drive those speeds, I should see my RPMs go really high. He said that probably I had put in the wrong transmission fluid at some point (more on this later.)

I searched online, and found a local shop with excellent reviews, and took my car there. The owner verified the code, and took my car for a test drive, which didn’t turn anything up. After his inspection, he said that I needed to replace the solenoid, and that I might need to replace the Power Clutch Module, but that he wouldn’t know for sure until after we replaced the solenoid and he could run tests. Apparently, Toyota put out a bulletin that there’s a known problem with the computer, but I haven’t been able to find it. He replaced the solenoid and the transmission filters (he said they were filthy; more on this later.) (~$500)

His tests ran fine, but he said to come back in a few days to see if the Power Clutch Module would need to be replaced. A couple of days later, the check engine light came on again (also while driving at freeway speeds), so I took my car back. He ran tests again, and advised to replace the computer. I had my car back while he ordered the part, and I ended up waiting about a week to bring it back in because of my schedule. He replaced it (~$700), and just a few *hours* later, the check engine light came back (again at freeway speeds).

This entire time, I have not noticed anything wrong with my car other than the check engine light. I’ve been watching my dashboard, and my RPMs haven’t seemed high (somewhere between 2 and 3,000 at high speeds). No weird noises, no control issues, no trouble getting to/keeping my speed.

My current plan is to take my car back to the mechanic, but since he already fixed both of the problems that he found, I’m worried that whatever is wrong with my car is going to be this ridiculously difficult to pin-point problem, and I wanted to know if any of you had advice/experience with something similar.

**Car Details**

2007 Toyota Corolla LE

1.8L 4CYL DOHC 16V VVT-i SFI Engine

4 Speed ECT Automatic Transmission

Purchased New, a little over 6 years ago

~66,000 miles

1 accident, about two years ago: My ex hit an entire wheel (possibly the spare tire from a truck? It was huge, regardless) while on the freeway. Busted up the front of my car, had to replace the radiator and AC, but I double-checked the list just now, and there isn’t anything about the transmission listed. Still, it was like $7000. (Thank goodness for insurance.)

Other than that, I take it in for regular service every 5-6,000 miles, all of which except for 2-3 oil changes have been to Toyota, so if they think I put the wrong transmission fluid in, it’s probably something they did. At 15/30/45/60, I took it in for major service, which I would have thought covered at least checking the transmission and telling me I needed to pay X for Y service, but my current mechanic said it looked like the filter had never been replaced (or at least not been replaced in too long.) My last major service was less than 3 months ago. Either A: they didn’t even check the transmission filter, or B: whatever’s wrong with my car is making it extra dirty, really fast. It’s had standard replacements like brakes, tires, battery, etc.

The only other known mechanical issue I have with my car is the water pump. At the 60,000 mile service a few months ago, they found that it had self-patched a leak, and advised to replace it soon. I purchased the replacement part, but hadn’t gotten around to getting it done yet. I asked my mechanic for a quote when I first went in, and he said I don’t even need to replace it; hold on to the part until I actually notice it leaking. He showed me how to check the water levels safely, gave me signs to look for. I really, really like this mechanic.",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_1f7q2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1f7q2j/2007_toyota_corolla_le_18l_4cyl_code_p0741_but/,

I am having some very strange issues with my Aztek that I would like to get some input on understanding.  My level of gearhead-edness is fairly low, so please go easy on me.

The car in question is a 2004 Pontiac Aztek with 113k miles.

Basically, the engine overheats very quickly, on the order of 5-10 min, unless I'm driving &gt;50 mph, in which case the natural airflow seems to keep the engine cool.  If I'm driving around town on surface streets, in 25-35mph range, it will redline the heat gauge pretty quickly.  Also, my cabin heat doesn't seem to work.

**However**, most of the time when the heat gauge is getting high while driving, if I put it into neutral and rev the engine a bit (usually hold it between 4-5k RPM for 10 sec or so), the temperature will magically come back down, and the cabin heat will come on, almost like the heater decides to kick on, and bleeds the excess heat off from the overheating engine.  After driving the car, there is definitely a coolant odor coming from the engine that you can smell from outside the car.

I drive this car very lightly (no more than 10-15 miles a week usually, errands and such), and it has been in this rapid overheating state for at least 6 months.

My local dealership garage says that the head gasket is busted, and I have oil leaks as well.  I don't really have any reason to not believe them, but they can't really seem to give me an answer about the relationship between revving the engine, and the heat gauge dropping back down from redline to normal.  

I think I'm just in the process of coming to terms that I will have to junk this car or pay for an engine replacement.

Also interestingly, the check engine light hasn't come on once.

Can anyone shed some light on this?  I'm fairly certain I'm screwed, but I would at least like to understand what might be happening.

Thanks in advance!

Continued driving for several tanks of gas and an overnight rest and the CEL was still on so I put some Lucas cleaner in when I filled up again. Ran fine for that tank, but after the next fill I didn't even make it out of the gas station. Went to accelerate and got some heavy hesitation so I stopped and turned it off, let it rest for a few then started it back up and let it idle. Ran for about 30 seconds and died. I went through a bunch of threads on the fuel pumps and determined that was the problem. Several people said on the 04 V8 the drivers side pump is the main. I called around and the closest one is about 100 miles away, so I figured I'd pull the filter on the drivers side and clean it to see if that would help. It was filthy, but now the car won't start at all. There was one wiring harness that could clip in either way(180° rotation) so I thought maybe I put it on backwards. Switched it around and still nothing. It cranks fine but acts like it isn't getting any fuel at all. I pulled the relay, of which I only saw one, and did a smell test, as I don't have a meter with me. Smelled fine. I don't hear any humming from either pump. Could REALLY use some advice here, any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

He neglected to mention it only takes premium, and it was dark so we didn't see it written on the gas cap and stuff. 

It wouldn't go over about 42 mph  and would lurch whenever we pushed it to go over. As soon as we noticed this we called and asked him if that was normal and he said it wasn't, but he also wasn't really concerned so we kept going. We stopped for dinner after about 30 miles, and when we started it again the check engine light came on after a few minutes on the road. Then it started smoking from the hood and we pulled over. After that the engine wouldn't turn over at all. We got it towed back.

Now the guy we borrowed it from (who knows more about cars than me, but not a lot) took a look and says the motor is completely done. He thinks it's from the regular gas we put in. However, we asked the tow truck driver and a few other people on the way how much damage regular gas could really do, and they all said one tank wouldn't have a serious effect, and it probably just needed some octane booster. If the owner is right and it was the gas, I may helping pay for a new car. So can you guys give me any insight on this?

EDIT: So the general consensus is that this wouldn't kill the motor or cause serious engine damage. Is it still possible that the issues are the result of the gas? And if so is there something we can do before resorting to taking it to a mechanic? Is octane booster worth a try?

EDIT 2: We're taking it to a mechanic Monday to nail down what's wrong with it. I'll update then.

/u/wastedhotdogs recommended checking the ignition coils. My engine model has a single ignition coil pack, and using my Hayes manual + Youtube, I found the secondary resistance was far too high. Similarly, I  found out that the spark plug wires were showing too high of a resistance as well.

I went to a local car parts chain (Don't wanna say name, lest I be hammered by /r/hailcorporate), and they pulled the codes from my check engine light. There were a few codes that came up. One confirmed that there was indeed a misfire. The second code confirmed there were issues with the ignition coil. The last code, P0340, stated there was a failure in the camshaft position censor. 

Using my manual and some more youtube videos, I managed to replace the spark plug wires, the ignition coil pack, and the camshaft position sensor. After installation, my check engine light immediately went off. My car accelerates much better now, and has a much more consistent idle. I also never realized just how jerky my car was from stop until now.

Safe to drive?,16,3,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/15vybi/rotten_subframe_on_pt_cruiser_safe_to_drive/,"My girlfriend drives her dad's old 2001 PT Cruiser with about 73k miles on it. Car still belongs to him. It was due for a Vermont state inspection in December and as part of a little xmas gesture to her parents, I decided to save his dad the time/money and took the car out to the local Midas myself to get it inspected.

Not only did the car not pass the inspection, but it also came back with a report of rotten subframe, all-but-destroyed bushings and excessive wear on tire rods. I went out to the shop to take a look at the underside of the car, and the rot *seemed* pretty pervasive. There were a few quarter sized holes through the frame, and the thing looked especially flimsy around where the engine torque arm attaches to the frame.

I passed the news out onto her dad. Apparently the rumor has it (from multiple sources) that the local Midas likes to exaggerate issues a little bit. At the same time, I can't help but be concerned for her safety with this car. We left the car with her dad for him to get a second opinion on it at a different shop. We'll see what happens. But until then, I wanted to post here and ask for some advice.

Has anyone had similar issues with PT Cruisers? It's my understanding that rotting subframe is a relatively common issue for that year. We're trying to get another 3-4 years of very mild driving (15 minute commute every week day to college and back) out of it until she's out of school. How dangerous is it? Both me and her dad are concerned that it might not actually be safe to drive even if her dad can get the local ""friendly"" shop to pass the inspection. Trying to see if we would be better off just replacing the Cruiser with another shitty car that's at least safe to drive till she graduates.

Thanks!

P.S.: Sorry for the lack of pictures. In hindsight, I should have snapped a few of the underside of the car at the shop, but didn't think of it until after I brought the car home.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** Just posting to update the situation cos people are still responding.

Second shop expressed some concern as well about the subframe. We located a replacement newer one in pretty good condition off eBay and the car's going in next week to have that, as well as bushings and tie rods replaced. Cost of it turned out to be not so bad, so instead of junking this piece of crap car, we decided to hold onto it for a little while longer.

My car's starter died a few months back - simply would not start, not even an attempt to turn over. I got that replaced, no problem, and my car started up just fine. However, two blocks down the street after picking it up, my car began to shake and as I neared a stop light, the RPMs dropped to 0 and the engine died. I could not re-start my car.

I took the car back to the mechanic and had the fuel system cleaned and new spark plugs/gasket put in. Car ran fine for about two weeks, and during this time I managed to drive it about 500 miles on both the interstate and within the city with no incident. Out of the blue one day, my car did the same thing; I approached a stop light, felt the car shudder, the RPMs dropped to 0, and engine cut. I was able to start it, but only by keeping my foot down on the gas and not letting the RPMs drop. It wouldn't idle.

This time, the mechanic found that my alternator wasn't putting out enough power. No problem, I got it replaced. I went several more weeks without incident...bam, same problem.

The new mechanic found that the old mechanic put my vacuum hoses on backwards and that the TPS was dirty, so both of those things were taken care of and I went on my way.

Fast forward about a month or so to two days ago. I managed to drive my car out of the city on the interstate, about an hour or so of continuous driving, and I started to feel the telltale shaking when I was doing about 60. When I let up on the gas, the shaking stopped, but would resume as soon as I put my foot back down on the pedal. I pulled off the road and sure enough, the RPMs dropped as I was pulling into a gas station and my car died when I let it idle.

The second to last time my car died, a gentleman who pulled over to help me on the side of the road pulled the plug out of the mass air flow sensor and plugged it back in, and the car started up just fine and I was able to keep driving. I used this trick again on Saturday and it worked. My car started up again without incident, the RPM at idle was about where it should be (idles at around 650 rpm), and I was able to get it home with no further shaking.

There are no error codes being thrown, no lights on the dashboard, so there's nothing to read on that front. It should be noted at this point that no mechanics have been able to reproduce the problem while they've had my car. I've been told the air filter looks fine and they thought the mass air flow trick was just a fluke the first time I tried it, but obviously there's more to it if it's worked multiple times to get my car going again.

They mentioned the vacuum hoses being on backwards may have been causing my car to shut down at lower speeds, and if this is true and the problem is still elsewhere under the hood, it might make sense that I started feeling my car shaking at a higher speed this last time around, but my car knowledge is extremely limited, so that's probably grossly oversimplified or misstated.

To reiterate...

**List of things I have done:**

* Clean fuel system
* Clean TPS
* New starter
* New alternator
* New spark plugs
* New gasket
* Fixed backwards vacuum hoses

**Symptoms experienced:**

* Shaking from the engine
* RPMs drop to 0 when coming to a stop
* Engine shuts down
* Cannot re-start car unless gas is held down
* Once re-started, car will stay started with gas held down, but will shut down when it tries to idle

Its nothing flashy but thats okay i like it =) Anyway I've always wanted to change my own oil and learn a lot about how it all works. I figured I would start by changing my own oil seems simple enough and I think i can handle it. I see however that the initial cost of it all can be kind of pricy for lifts and tools and whatnot so i just need to ask 3 questions:

1) Do you have to use a jack and stands or are ramps on the front good enough (they are cheaper and like i said I'm in college and just bought a car)

2) Will these ramps [link](http://www.sears.com/rage-powersports-pair-of-plastic-4-400lb-capacity-mini/p-SPM6524373707?prdNo=2&amp;blockNo=2&amp;blockType=G2) lift up my car high enough for me to get under and preform the work? They seem a bit small but if I also dont wanna buy something too tall.

and finally,

3) Has anyone who has changed the oil or owned and worked on a 2010 Dodge Avenger before have any tips? (anything at all about the car just a curious car novice looking to learn)


Thanks in advance I look forward to reading responses and learning about my car

I changed the orientation of the strap slightly from [this](http://i.imgur.com/UIka7Vp.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/42z35D5.jpg).  That moved the muffler from about [1.5 inches from the tire](http://i.imgur.com/XbHRdHq.jpg) to [about 3 inches](http://i.imgur.com/HW6nkvW.jpg).

My muffler hanger broke a few days ago so I installed a new strap and hanger.  I used the parts from AutoZone that were listed as correct for my vehicle.  The muffler seems awfully close to the tire, I'm not sure if this is the wrong strap and it is supposed to be hung more to the right.  Is this OK?

**EDIT:**

Here is a picture of the hanger and strap.   it looks like I installed it the only way it would work.  Does this mean wrong strap?

I am a completely uninformed car owner who is trying to get an estimate on how much getting my car back in running condition will take. My car died in November 2011. I had just moved to a new city and, low on fund, adapted to life sans car. Now a year and half later, I'm ready to get back on the road. 

I'm pretty sure the initial issue was just that I needed a new battery (key in ignition has ZERO response, no lights work, etc...). Now that it has been a year and a half, I imagine I'm due for that new battery as well as some general upkeep (oil, gas, uh... other car stuff?). 

I don't want to break my bank on a car I've lived without for over a year, but I want it back to reliable status. 

**So: What are the major issues I should be looking forward to upon taking my car to the shop? I'm prepared for the new battery and oil change, but could something terrible have happened to my car in the past year of non-use? **

They're supposed to be changed every 60,000 miles.  I'm at ~110,000. 

The previous owner let his go past the mark (65,000), it snapped, and he ended up doing about $2,000 worth of damage to his engine, water pump, etc.  The previous owner was also a mechanic, so he ended up repairing everything himself.  

As I have no automotive skill, so I'm looking at taking it to a shop.  **The shop that I normally take my vehicle to is telling me that**:

A) It is strongly recommended that I have everything changed that the timing belt touches (springs, water pump, belt, etc) = $750. 

B) If I just change the belt itself, it's around $125. If I just change the belt, if **anything malfunctions** that the timing belt touches, that it will cause the same amount of damage to my engine as if I'd done nothing at all (eg, not take it in to have the belt changed).

-----

1) Can anyone verify that this is true?

2) Are these prices that you would expect from work done at a shop?

Obviously, I want to save money, but not at running the risk of me causing a lot of damage to my vehicle down the road.

I started [changing my clutch](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/17fo8q/i_am_changing_my_clutch_i_have_no_idea_what_im/) with zero experience about a month ago. I finally 'finished' the job yesterday. It took so long due to me only working weekends and a bunch of rusted/stuck bolts and not having certain tools ahead of time.

Anyway, everything was back together and torqued to spec. I put in some transmission oil and everything seemed fine. I did not start the car at this point because the battery was dead and I couldn't get one until the next day.

The next morning I noticed a pool of oil under the car. Uh oh. I look under the car and see [oil dripping from where the **extension rod** connects to the transmission case](http://imgur.com/W2eTW2G). I didn't even know that was possible! So I remove the bolt holding the rod to the case and oil starts pouring out rapidly. SHIT. I pull the extension rod off and **two pieces of the transmission case come off with it**. FUCK.

Well, I'm not about to take the transmission out again so fuck it. I'm done.

When we took it out for the first test drive everything seemed ok until shifting into 5th gear.

Shifting into 5th gear while rolling results in losing all throttle control, pressing the gas no longer revs the engine and the car coasts as if it were in neutral. If you shift into 5th gear while stopped the car will die as if it were stalling out with the clutch still depressed.

After noticing this we also come to find that driving in 2nd gear (about 3-4k RPM IIRC) results in the transfer case (this one is separate from the tranny) shaking way too much, so much so that it will on occasion knock the gear shift into 4wheel drive.

My Dad and I thought it over and figured of course it would by the tranny, so we swapped that out yesterday with a used one off craigslist and no dice, still all the same problems as before.

We're now thinking its gotta be the transfer case but could be one of these as well?

* Clutch plate installed backwards (seems like we'd have more problems in the rest of the gears and I'd like to hope we're competent enough not to screw that up)
* Clutch not adjusted properly causing 5th gear not to fully engage
* We put a spring over lift on it so maybe the drive shaft angle is all screwed up (accounts for shaking but not 5th gear issue)
* Electronic issue from a sensor in the tranny acting up with the computer (maybe sends weird signals to coil or something in 5th gear)

it's me again with the 93 Camry.  I brought my Camry into another shop to get a second opinion.  After the diagnosis I was told that the connector from the windshield wiper switch to the windshield wipers was disconnected (Thats how I understood it).

I took it to Midas and was told that I have ""severe"" oil leaks, and that there's no point in putting full synthetic in since I'll just piss it away and waste my money.

Is this a mistake?
I want this car to last like... two more years. Everything but the electrical &amp; paint on this car is in pretty good shape.

tl;dr: didn't get oil changed for long time, told I have severe leaks, put in regular oil instead of synthetic. Is this going to ruin things for my car?

Whatever.

Car: 2007 Ford Mustang

Problems:

1. Hand brake will freeze in winter, locking brakes on the rear wheels.

2. Water in passenger side foot well.

Causes/solutions, according to some googling:

1. Rubber grommet/seal/whatever on brake line breaking apart, letting moisture into line.  When weather gets cold, this freezes, locking the brakes in place.  Replace brake line to fix.

2.  Leaves clog some drainage pipe under the cowl, I guess?  I figured this would be a fairly easy fix myself but since I was taking it in for the above, I thought I might see how much it would cost, at least.


So I just got a call back, and they did confirm the brake line thing -- but they want $420 P&amp;L to replace them.  They also said that, while they were under there, they noticed there was something wrong with the control arms (I can't remember what, exactly) and they'd need to be replaced to the tune of $955.  While there, they could also replace the torn outer tie rod boots (?) for $150, and the necessary alignment after all that would be another $80.

The guy who could check the ""leak"" is only there in the mornings so they don't have an answer/confirmation about that yet.


So, questions:

3. Would you say these are likely actual problems or are they just trying to steal money?

1. How fucked is this pricing?

2. How hard would it be to do these things myself?  For reference, the most complicated thing I've done is replace the rear brakes and brake rotors (the locking brake issue tore them up pretty bad) -- and that took me a while.


UPDATE:  The ""leak guy"" determined there was a leak in the ""fresh air box"" and in the drip rail of the convertible top.  $300 to fix.  When I told them not to do anything, and I'll pick up my car later, there was a surprise $125 fee for the guy to check for leaks (I had previously only been told a $109 diagnostic fee).",,False,,t5_2s47e,True,,,True,t3_o04k7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/o04k7/so_im_an_idiot_and_took_my_car_to_the_dealer_for/,

**UPDATE** **FIXED**

So my friend just bought a 1988 Honda CRX HR with the D15B6 in it. It runs perfectly when cold, but as soon as it hits about 40% on the temp gauge, it starts inconsistently missing. It doesn't trip the MIL or even make RPMs drop, as it's just one 'chuff' (that's what it sounds like when it misses) or two every 4-10 seconds. It usually will idle fine, then 'chuffchuff', wait a second or two, then 'chuff', followed by as much as 15 seconds before it does it again. It smells like it's running quite rich, and power goes away (not that there was much to begin with) above 3,000 RPM, like you've lifted your foot off the gas.

It's got new NGK copper plugs, wires, cap, rotor, fuel filter (was on the original), a seafoam treatment, and a throttle+clutch cable adjustment. Compression test shows 200PSI dry across the board and 210PSI wet. I've tried pulling individual wires, but that doesn't change the behavior, though it does not throw a spark very far, where my '00 Civic DX with a D16Y7 will throw a 1"" spark if you pull a wire.  Pulled a vacuum line to see it's reaction to that, and the idle did not change appreciably, acting like it didn't have the vacuum leak I'd just given it, plus the misfire was still there.

My thought is a weak coil or ignitor, the crank position sensor, or a cam position sensor/hall effect sensor within the distributor.

My friend went ahead and bought a new complete distributor assembly (cap, rotor, coil, ignitor, etc) and it fixed the issue completely.

The part I have circled smokes white smoke every time I finish driving. I don't know the name for it, but it is located near the mid-front of the car and is connected to pipes that appear to connect to the exhaust.

I am losing massive amounts of oil (It goes from max to min in about a week and a half). I don't see massive puddles under my car, so perhaps the oil is being burned. 

Forums recommended changing the PCV valve before taking it into the shop. The hoses connected to the PCV valve were extremely cracked and worn, so I would not be surprised if hoses throughout the car were in equally bad condition. The valve replacement didn't affect the rate of oil loss, but it was a very inexpensive and easy thing to change.

I have a suspicion this has been going on for a long time, but I'm just now noticing it. I've only had the car for about 4-5 months. I did not check my oil levels much at all after receiving the car, and I now believe I may have ended up driving below minimum oil for over a month without knowing it...I just didn't expect it to all be gone.

I drive a 2002 Toyota Corolla CE. I adore that car! It's my first car to take care of myself, and I've had quite a bit of caring to do for it! 

Tonight, as we were driving back from dinner, my brother (the only person with us that knew how to drive stick) was designated driver. He's driven the car before, but he's not used to having five people in it, and in a car that small, weight can really make a difference ;). Anyway, he over-revved it at a stop light (to about 4k rpm), and the front wheels spun, causing quite a bit of shaking in the front of the car. After that shaking, we started noticing a much louder sound coming from the engine. Instead of emitting the typical purr of an idling 1.8L straight four, it was roaring! The engine was idling at the standard rpm: about 1.1-1.2k. I have some guesses as to what the problem could be.

The car seems to operate just fine. I can shift through the gears properly, and all the electronics and steering function properly. I have not noticed any problem with the braking. I have    n't tried any of these things above about 40 mph. When I step out of the car, I can smell exhaust pretty strongly. 

Back in November, I had a crack in the exhaust pipe welded, and my father theorizes that the shaking could have caused the cheap welding job to have come apart in such a way that the sound is no longer being muffled. Any thoughts?

Thanks much in advance!

* Stiff shifting
* Varying degrees of stiffness. (As in, some days it will take just a little, extra nudge to get it into gear. Others it feels like I have to hulk out to fully get it in gear)
* I've noticed that 1st Gear will pop out from time to time, and doesn't want to always go into gear on the first shot. When this happens  I shift into gear and it just pushes the shifter back out. Only about three times has the car actually been moving and it threw the car back into neutral. Both times, however, was at a slow take off. Never during my drive.

Also, as a side note, I notice that once the car has been running a while shifting into Reverse usually comes with a quick 'grind', but it doesn't have any issue slipping into reverse itself.

On several occassions, however, I have shifted it into reverse and it required quite a bit of muscle to to get it back into neutral.

Truck in question is a 1984 Chevrolet Silverado (C20) 6.2 Diesel. The truck is running great however it is consuming a fair amount of coolant. The truck doesn't smoke at all. I've flushed the coolant, and there was oil in the coolant (and small amount of coolant in oil, pulling the dipstick shows a little bit of a milky substance). Pulling the radiator cap shows bubbling as the truck runs, with a fine vapor (exhaust fumes, presumably). Pulling the oil dipstick with the truck running throws some vapors out as well, presumably from the coolant turning into vapor and finding the nearest exit.


I have the mechanical know-how to do the head gasket job myself, but it's a very time consuming project and time is not something I have much of, unfortunately. The person I bought the truck from pulled a fast one on me knowing the truck had a blown head gasket, because the truck had no thermostat installed and the radiator was full of that gunky sealant crap. 


I went ahead and went on a limb and got the $60 bottle of Blue Devil Head Gasket Sealant that's supposedly working on a molecular level to seal the leak. After flushing the cooling system completely and removing the non-existent thermostat, it's worked quite a bit from what I can tell. The amount of coolant it's drinking is considerably  less. Blue Devil guarantees their product or your money back, so if doesn't hold up within 24 hours I will be giving them a ring to file for reimbursement. I am getting a new thermostat tomorrow. 


This truck has the TH350 3-speed auto with 4.10 gears. It's going nowhere fast, it's maximum comfortable cruising speed is about 50mph. Taking it down to 40-45mph, do you think it'll last the 1700 mile road trip (pulling a 2001 Ranger on a dolly)? Assuming I keep a good amount of water/coolant and oil with me (oil pan has a small leak), will she keep running long enough to get to NY?


Once I'm up there, I have all the time in the world with lots of friends who have an abundance of tools, including an engine hoist. If needed (or if I deem it necessary) I could even pull the motor out and completely rebuild it if I wanted to - something I plan on doing in the near future, but it's got to get back home to NYC first.

Local mechanic said it would be about $150 to clean it out, or $450 if the EGR valve needed to be replaced. I couldn't afford $450 at the time, so I did some research and determined that I could let it sit a while without it likely running into any problems. This seemed to be born out to be true, as over the last couple months my car has still been running fine, with no overheating or even any loss in gas mileage.

Codes from MIL: P0401 - EGR insufficient flow. Probable causes: faulty EGR valve, blocked EGR passages in engine.

Yesterday and today, the check engine light (which has been steadily on for a while) flashed at me, so I drove it in to an AutoZone to get the meter read again. This time, in addition to the insufficient flow, it said there were some misfires on all cylinders, and random misfires.

P0401 - EGR insufficient flow. Probable causes: faulty EGR valve, blocked EGR passages in engine. P0300 - Random Cylinder misfire P0301, P0302, P0303 - cylinders 1,2,3 misfires

However, the guy at the AutoZone told me that it's an easy replace that I can do myself. He showed me where the EGR valve is in my car (very accessible under the hood, a couple of bolts, no engine disassembly required) and I can start with a bottle of engine cleaner to clean it out, or the part is about $150 and I can just replace the part.

Looking for opinions/experiences as to whether I should attempt this on my own and potentially save myself a lot of money, or if it's something I could do wrong and seriously screw up my car.

TL,DR: Relatively new to car repairs, should I attempt to clean/repair an EGR valve on a 2003 Honda Civic EX?

I need to know what is wrong before so I can get an estimate so I can get a loan to fix my car. My husband says its the clutch but my dad says it isn't so maybe you can give some insight.

First my power steering would go out in the middle of a turn and then come back on after I straightened out.

It started a couple of months ago where if my car wasn't warm enough that my car would die after I pushed in the clutch and brakes to slow down. My husband thought that might be the alternator or the battery.

For the past couple weeks my clutch has felt pretty soft when pushing it in and when I go to shift I basically have to force the gear in, it's hard to do and get stuck. Doesn't matter which gear, reverse is the hardest though but that has been going on since I bought it a year ago. My husband drove it and he said the clutch is going to need to be replaced along with my brakes. 

And then yesterday when I was going to leave for work I started my car and let it run for a minute and then I tried to shift to reverse and it would not let me. Everytime I tried, the rpm needle would drop below one and the car would stutter like it was going to die. I tried all the other gears and none of them would work. My husband said to wait for the engine to warm up and try again. I waited about ten more minutes and finally forced it into reverse and as soon as I did that the car started shuddering and coughing like when you turn the key a little too long. It died and I started it again, it kept shuddering and coughing but the engine wouldnt turn over and I couldn't get the reverse gear out and back to neutral. My husband finally got it out of reverse and said the clutch is finally gone. I described it to my dad who said it wasn't the clutch. 

I just need to know what to tell the mechanic so I can get an estimate. Nobody does it for free out here. It is all around 40-60$ for an inspection which I don't have because I spent the last of my extra money on my dog who broke his leg a couple days ago.

It's all very technical, but the oxygen content and the reversion waves are not able to ensure the proper AF ratio for the low speeds. If you're running an engine capable of high rpm power production, then it may be a favorable trade off. Less torque, but more HP due to the free flow.

So here's the deal. New Motor, built by Lotus' F1 Motor Builder, so Motor should be OK. Old one ran great right up until the owner put the car sideways into a mountain and cracked the block by breaking a mount. 

So installed the new motor, swapped all the sensors etc from the old well running motor, swapped the injectors from the old motor, MAP sensor as well. 

The Problem is that the motor is running extremely rich. the whole left bank is fouling plugs at idol and the right bank has 1 cylinder that fouls plugs and 3 that are just getting obviously too much fuel (dark, but not covered). In addition the car is getting too hot under boost and has a low throttle/idol misfire coming from the right bank. 

The ECU is the same as the perfectly running car, which is the race tune. I've swapped the plugs to the ones from the old motor (what I had on hand). I've tried pulling plugs to determine what cylinder is missing, but it's a flat planed crank so I can't really hear the difference to tell what's up. 

The Fuel pressure regulator has been swapped to the one from the old motor, same with plug wires, etc. I'm really running out of ideas. I've scoped the motor and the cylinders are dirty enough (as are the plugs) to know the overheating isn't the heads lifting. I've bled the cooling system and don't think it's air, but the temp rises very suddenly shortly after high boost pulls. 

anyone got any suggestions of thinks I haven't tried? 


**Edit Solved At least Part of the Issue** Leaking Vac line from the plenum to the FPR. Causing the trims to go to shit. Solved by Clearing all the codes and noticing it ran great for about 10 minutes until the trims could get all jacked again. Also Explains the heat (Lean @ boost) and the fouling (rich at idle). Fixed it and it runs well, isn't fouling plugs anymore. I'm still having a minor heat issue, but I think it's just air in the cooling system still, so will rebleed tonight!

I've been trying to get rid of the rattle my hood has been doing ever since my dad gave me his car, which he says he can't remember a time it didn't.

I thought the engine was running rough so I tried a gasoline additive and changing out the spark plugs. Still had the hood rattle. Then one day, my girlfriend was out of the car and just put her hand on the hood and it stopped the rattle.

To me, I feel like this is the latch then but with googling I found it could engine mounts? I have an uncle I'll see in a month that's pretty much a mechanic - so if it is one of those things that has to been seen in person to get an idea of what's wrong - I can hold out till then.

I was thinking maybe I can tighten the latch for the hood? Or should I just replace the latch (like $26 so it's not a huge deal if the latch is the problem).

My 1995 Mercury Sable 3.8 Liter is my baby.  It was bought at a tow yard and has been so good to me since day one, except for a busted fuel injector.  Now almost 4 years of ownership and 160,700 miles it created a huge mess in my parking spot.  I have added a link to the picture.

I know it for sure isn't good that it's rust colored, but I have no clue of the cars history prior to me taking care of it.  Some background on how this puddle happened: I parked the car and noticed drops behind the tail of the vehicle, but thought I had come into a puddle.  The next morning I walked out to this mess.  Prior to the spill there was no weird noise hinting at a failing water pump and no steam coming from the radiator.  I don't suspect a water pump because it lost the fluid over night without the assistance of the car running with the mass amounts of pressure.

Does anybody have a possible theory to what could need replacement.  With it being a '95 I'm not sure if I will fix it if the problem is MASSIVE.  Thank you for you're help and I look forward to any feedback.

Edit:  The milky color is because it was drying out into the asphalt.  If you look up close to the tire it's that dark Cheyenne color of rust and that is the color of the fluid before it dries.

About 2 weeks ago, I was driving it, and then all of a sudden the engine missed, all the lights in and outside the car dimmed, and the battery light came on. I drove a little more, and the car/battery died. We tried jumping it, got a mile before it died again. A few days later, we went back to my car with a fresh battery and managed to get my car home, but the battery light was still on. I can charge my battery with my friend's external battery charger and drive it a little bit at a time, but I don't want to keep driving off of the batteries that I put in it.

With much, much hassle changing the alternator (terrible location, see previous posts), I eventually got it changed and all put back together. However, much to my disdain, it didn't fix it. The battery light came on, and I was on the side of the road a mile after I left. 

I figured I would take the old alternator to get tested before I turned in the core, and it passed the test, so it was very my alternator.

My only guess is that it must be a wire somewhere, but I have almost zero experience with the electrical system in my cars. The most electric I know is to hook the wires back up when I take off a part.

It's my first car, and I didn't have a lot of money to play with, so I tried to get the best I could find with my budget.

Anyway, there seems to be a ton of problems with it.  I guess that's expected for a car that cost under $1K, but the real problem is that I know absolutely nothing about cars.  You could tell me to point to a part under the hood and I couldn't.

So I'm going to sort of stream of consciousness list things that I notice that are wrong, and I would be extremely grateful if you could list reasons why it's doing that and what I need to do to fix it.  

* The defroster doesn't seem to do anything, even leaving it on for 5-10 minutes, I don't see any change in the opacity in the windshields (front or back).

* The heater/AC is always on.  When it's on OFF, it's like it's on 1, when it's on 1 it's like it's on 2, etc..  I think this might be causing my gas to drain faster than it should...

* When it's cold out (maybe around 70F or lower, though sometimes regardless of the temperature), the car won't start at all on it's own - I have to press down the gas pedal right when it ""catches"", otherwise it'll turn on for a second  then just turn off.

* Related to the first problem, depending on how I break to a stop and it's cold out, my car will start lurching about 3 times and then shut off.  This really, really sucks, because I can't even turn on my emergency lights because it's off.

* I took it to get an oil change yesterday, and they said they couldn't because the oil pan was damaged.  I... do not even know.

so pretty much what happened was I did both upper and lower balljoints and stabilizer link at the same time. I botched the threads to the CV axle that I had already put in and stripped the hell out of it, and really I just decided to go pick up a another new CV because this is my daily driver and I've been trying to get it back on the road. But now... I can't get the stupid cv out of the transmission, which is the pictures above. the CV is recessed about a 1/2, making prying against the transmission impossible. the old CV had a lip that you where able to pry against, and I got it out in about 10 minutes with the right tools. This one is perfectly rounded edges, save for the track where the boot locks in. As you can see I accidently pulled the boot off of it trying to pull it out. I don't know how to get it out! I've tried lots of different pry bars and places to pry off of, and nothing seems to give it that pop I need to get it out. anyone else ever come up with this problem? Currently I think I need to go grab a another pry bar that is a little bit smaller (looks like a flathead screwdriver except a lot bigger, with a bend at the end) and I might be able to get in there and be able to get it to pop, I dunno though. I'm a computer guy, and a horrible car guy, but we all gotta learn somewhere I suppose &gt;.&gt;

From this angle you can better see how it is 'recessed' into a ring. Does a Pickle fork still work in something like this? It seems like that idea is more specific to something like this:

It took me about 15 hours or so, and cost me 60 bucks for the broken part and about 80-100 bucks in supplies and new tools. (New tools are always great.)

I made a YouTube video to help others who might some day be in my situation. Id love to get feedback. Let me know if i did anything wrong.  Though... when i put it all back together it all worked, including the four wheel drive (high and low)  So i must have done something right. ;-)

I currently have a 94 Firebird Formula that is in decent shape, and we're considering building it up to use on the track. However, it would need a pretty serious investment, and I'm not exactly sure it'd be worth it. The front end needs work, and it would need rear bars and all new tires (we'd probably go with slicks). It also needs a top-end rebuild and headers, to get any real power. Brakes all around. All in all, it'd probably be about another 5k investment to get into track-going shape. 

Or, I could sell my current car (I'm thinking I could get about $4,500 for it), and we could pool the money we would have spent on those upgrades and buy a car that was already track-ready. What cars would be optimal/in the ~9k price range? 

So far, we've come up with the following:

4th gen Firebird/Camaro/Transam
5.0 Liter Mustang/Fox Body 
280Z
Civic
Miata
VW Golf

The little Japanese cars would probably be the most economical and would surely be a lot of fun. We do, however, have an affection for big, dumb American V8s. And, the track has a ~mile long straight that would kind of suck to take in something like a Miata.

I'm not by any stance a gearhead, but after some craziness going on with my thermostat, I replaced it myself.  Here's my issue.

First of all, they gave me the thermostat that was ""recommended"" for my car, which was smaller than the one I pulled out, but it DID fit flush with the cap, just on a different part.  Afterwards, the check engine light turned off and the car seemed to run like a dream, until it came back on again.  Taking it into Autozone, they ran the computer diagnostics and said that either my thermostat was running the car cooler than it was supposed to, or that the temperature sensor would need to be replaced, neither of which was a bad thing and could probably be replaced within two months without any harm to the engine.

I took it back in and he said he can replace the right side bearing, no additional cost, but he's unsure if it will fix anything.

The sounds seems to get worse and come up during less sharp turns after the car has warmed up.  The noise is audible in forward or reverse at both low and high speeds.  

He is in the process of replacing the front right bearing, but he said it might be the differential bearing.  He's indicated it's the first time in years he's been confused by a sound like this.

Okay. Long story short, I changed the oil yesterday, accidentally punctured the oil filter and then drove it right after for like 2-3 miles. I had no idea, and on my way home from going to advance right down the rod, the car was barely going up the hill and was acting and sounding very weird. Upon opening the hood a very small amount of white smoke was present. I then got home found out i had no oil, and put the old oil back in along with the old oil filter. It seemed fine after that. Fast forward to today. I drove it to work fine and most of the way back on the parkway (80 mph) and when i got off on the exit, it started acting weird and shaking a little bit. It got worse and started chirping like it was a belt squeaking or something. Then it really got bad. My car was running extremely loud and sounded like an 18 wheeler when they slow down. like ""chug chug chug chug"" really fast and really loud, along with the chirping. It barely got up the same hill I could barely make up yesterday barely got to my house. I was almost flooring it up the hill just to go like 15-20 mph.

So now my questions.

Id imagine my engine is shot. Is it fixable by any means? Because I rely on it to get to work. Is there anything I can do right now to try to mediate the issue? Or is my baby fubar? I would post a video, but it barely starts and sounds very terrible when it is running where I am afraid it will literally just stop and fall apart and never run again.

Bent rod?

I am a noob after all, but thank you guys for being patient and helpful.  I figured since the appliances/lights were going strong and I didn't leave anything on that it was weird for the battery to simply die (there was a ton of corrosion I cleaned off too, but that didn't solve it).  A jump and a bit of driving got my car started and started a couple more times.  Don't trust the battery a whole lot so I'll likely just buy a new one (last one was in 2008/2009, so on par with the lifetime of a battery I guess) for peace of mind.  Cartalk, you rock!

Last year, I had a non-starting Acura Integra (1995).  I learned a great deal about the entire starting process with your guys's help (you guys were awesome!) - and I replaced the sparks, fuel filter, battery and finally distributor and set the timing myself and got the car working.  

Now, I've inherited a 2000 Pathfinder.  Car won't start again.  I'm fairly confident in thinking that it's definitely not a battery problem, but let me describe it - my Integra took about 4 months and like over $500 to fix, I'd much rather fix this quickly and cheaply.

1) Key in, electronics work great, nothing dim, all the dash signals light up as normal (oil, check engine, etc)

2) Turn key, car cranks maybe once very weakly, then all the dash signals start clicking/blinking

3) If I hold it there &gt;1 second then the tape deck will even eject the cassette that's inside

I don't think it's my battery because the electronics seem to be working fine.  I cleaned the terminals (a bit of corrosion) and it didn't seem to help.  Car doesn't even seem to crank, and again, clicking/blinking dash as I try to start.  Anyone got any ideas?

**EDIT/Update 1** Alright guys, consensus seems to be battery.  Gonna get it jumped soon by my gf, if my car starts I'll take it out and get it tested at the local autozone.

Ok, so for the last few days I've had a knocking sound coming from the front passenger side engine. Sounds like it's just inside from the idler pulley/tensioner area. This knock comes on at a very specific rpm range: Right at ~1000rpm. It has a slower intermittent knock at idle but when you load it up past ~1500rpm you can't hear the knock anymore. It doesn't follow the rotation of the engine, just sort of comes intermittently. It tends to happen more and be most pronounced when the engine is returning to idle past 1200rpm and down as opposed to reving up. Best way I can describe the sound is a marble rattling around inside a can.  
  
I pulled the serpentine belt off and ran the car quickly, and the knock was still there, leading me to believe it's internal and not just a bad pulley bearing. I then went and disconnected the wiring to the injectors cylnder-by-cylinder to see if maybe it could be rod knock but the sound persisted with each cylinder deactivated individually.  
  
I'm starting to think it's something to do with the timing chain. I've heard that the chain tensioners have a tendency to fail, or the plastic chain guides break, or both. And I suspect that the chain may be stretched out and smacking against something. Car still runs and drives fine.

I am currently stuck at my garage across town with the car that brought me here in a state of non-driveability, and after more hours than I'd like to admit I can't figure it out.

Currently I have managed to remove the old canister and test it for air flow; it didn't completely fail, but it was enough for me to go ahead with the change. Getting it out was a complete pain, the placement is tucked away, in front of the metal where the spare tire is kept, and just above the gas tank. Now that i'm trying to get things put back together, it looks like i can almost do it except for the vacuum hoses that run along the backside of the canister.

I have tried multiple times to push the tubes up high enough to get into the hard clips on the back, but since i cannot see anything or actually put my hand back there it is like building a ship in a bottle while blind.

Is there a trick to this, or should I just drop the gas tank? If I have to drop it, what is the bare minimum I can unhook to get it lowered slightly? I have a motorcycle jack I can support it on if need be.

Edit: The answer : If you have some way of manipulating a rigid hose in the back of two 6 inch deep, 1x1 inch openings either side of a solid object you can't move and have to work around - then no, you don't have to move the tank. 


The reality is you should definitely do it to save yourself some effort, so in my opinion, on the 07 Accent and similar model Hyundai you need to lower the gas tank about an inch to allow room for your hands to get to the back of the canister. 

To hopefully help someone else from my mistakes, here is the correct order of events: 

* Prep the tank for lowering from inside the car 
 * (run the line dry, disconnect the purge and gas lines) 
* get your car lifted up in the back for access to the canister 
* bring in the jack for the gas tank and lift it to support the gas tank
* perform the bolt removal steps for taking out the gas tank (don't worry about the 3 hose)
 * Try to leave the bolts in, to save you some frustration getting the tank back on (probably the only thing i did right)
* lower the gas tank jack a bit so clearance is made but you are still supporting the weight
* get to work on the canister, ccv, and all the parts crammed in there
 * When you get ready to remove the canister, tilt the side closest to you as far up as it will go and begin pulling outward
 * The right side should let go first if you need to, set it back down and reach in on the left side to free the large and small clipped hose 
* when you put a canister back in, new or old, you'll just have to reach behind the box to carefully lift the hose onto the clip edge and push it firmly into the opening till it sets
* Put it back together

edit 2: Stretch open the clips a bit before you pop it in to place, they are a bit too tight :/

Cross post from my other thread:

So far so good, but the damn dealership gave me the wrong parts so the job is only 1/3 done.
Long story short, the purge control solenoid valve is not replaced, I was a bit confused as when I was looking for the part before. Autozone didn't know what I was talking about and it doesn't show up in a normal inventory search for them - my bad. To be fair the Purge control valve has an awfully similar name, and hey it was a few bucks.
The dealership decided to hand over the parts after having a conversation in between me stating the year and actually getting the parts - I got 2011 stuff instead of 2007. It's similar in construct with a few key pieces, making it nearly impossible to see the difference on the canister, slightly more obvious on the CCV and PCSV but I got to those last. So the canister is in there, it works (and is doing the trick) but there's a bracket that is slightly off that holds the CCV. I can work with it, but it still pisses me off that I went through hell because the parts are slightly different.
So end result: currently the canister is holding it's part of the bargain, one refill and it isn't flooded.

I know it's to be done when the car's cooled, on level ground and to wipe away the first results, reinsert, wait a few seconds then check it again, but whenever I check it, it seems to be skewed (ie, it's not a *clear* line) on one side all the way up to about a centimeter or two above the max line, however on the other side it's a clear, easy to read, straight line a little over the middle of the max and min indicator.

Basically, I just want to confirm that the later, more clearer line is the true reading before I add any more since over-filling has a lot of issues associated with it. I should note that it's a 1999 Corolla (I think that's the year, but I'm not completely positive.) 

Beyond this, I'm having two other issues that are a bit disconcerting.

1.) Whenever I go on long trips and fill the gas up to maximum, it seems to not start correctly. The car will just sort of chug but not start. In the end I end up needing to do some awkward maneuver where I push the gas peddle while turning the key and switching over to drive, which is the only thing that works and doesn't feel healthy. (My friend mentioned that it could be due to ""flooding"", but I don't know what it means exactly/how to prevent it/how or if I should fix it or just not fill my gas all the way.)

This sort of leads me to question 2, as 2 happens more often (but definitely not exclusively) just after 1.

2.) When I stop while driving (ie., at a stop light/sign or just waiting to turn left), the car doesn't go immediately when I push the gas peddle. It sort of hesitates and then jumps ahead if I don't *really* ease up on it.

Could these questions be related to one another or even to my questionable oil level? I'm a pretty poor university student, so I'm apprehensive about going into a shop without knowing what to expect.

Go home, charge the battery, and hope it works, or

Go spend $100 on a new battery before the walking-distance PepBoys closes?

My wife's 99 Honda civic (no problems beforehand) made an odd noise one night when driving for about 5 seconds then went away. It sounded to me like a belt slapping something while rotating. When we stopped I got out and checked all the belts, hoses, fluids, everything was fine. (I was thinking timing belt but it drove perfect during/after the noise.)

The car started up and we drove it home, thinking maybe it was the AC compressor as we have had to replace it twice in 3 years. We get home and as she turns the ignition off it makes that weird noise again. I get out, same thing, nothing looks off. I tell her to crank it and we get nothing. No click, no trying to turn over, just the fuel pump priming.

The battery and alternator tested fine, the starter tested fine but there was no voltage on the solenoid wire. All fuses and relays tested good. I even bought a new main relay since I read elsewhere it controls flow to the starter but no luck. At this time jumping the starter got the car running and it idled normal. The car is old and almost worthless so I hooked up a starter switch between the hot and solenoid. I figured if I can get the car started than it would run fine, like it was idling.

After I did that I got the car started but I could tell it was misfiring now (first time its ever even missing). I decided to try to drive it (standard) and it was missing so bad it would shake and die out on me if I got over 10 MPH or near a slope. I got an obd2 reader and the only codes were misfire cyl 1, misfire cyl 3, and random misfire.

I realize now that it was probably the ECU not letting the starter get any juice because of an issue, but what could it be? I replaced the wires, plugs, cap, and rotor just to make sure it as they were under warranty even though they were relatively new.

I thought maybe cam position sensor but there was no error code for it. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Yes, it's high mileage but I think it's not uncommon for these cars to go up to 400,000 if it's taken care of well. 

Onto the symptoms.  When in idle I hear a tapping noise.  That's the best I can describe the sound.  If I turn the small pulley on the side of the throttle body which opens the throttle plate just a litttttle tiny bit then I can hear it increase for a second.  At anything higher though and the noise completely ceases (it seems).  This tapping noise doesn't always occur though.  But it does happen more often than not.  The engine still performs the same with the same gas mileage.  No CEL.  No idle problems because I keep the EGR system clean.  Also, I should mention that I performed what I believe is called a power balance test.  I unplugged the fuel injectors one at a time starting with cylinder #1.  The only time the noise (same noise, I'm not honestly sure) is definitely present is when I unplug cylinder #1 fuel injector. 

This tapping noise began to happen after I was told that my crankshaft pulley has a wobble.  I was told that this could damage my bearings.  I'm no mechanic so what says Reddit?  Thank you.

Caught a second of it on video.  Start listening soon after 00:29 seconds.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV5vINqGFMo  

**UPDATE** Fixed?  My uncle came over today and so I had him check it out.  He measured the belt deflection.  AC belt was too loose and the alternator belt was too tight.  I straightened them out and that seems to have cured most of the problem.  I still hear a slight tap and the crankshaft pulley does still have the slightest wobble.  But I am hugely relieved.

We can also jump the fuel pump (at the relay) and it will turn on and start pumping fuel (we have a puddle of gas on the floor of the garage as proof). Since the fuel pump CAN work, this led us to believe that the ECU was the culprit and maybe something was wrong with the ECU sending the signal to turn on the fuel pump, but we checked the ECU and were able to complete the circuit manually as described by the Bentley manual. We also checked to make sure the grounds in the ECU were ok and nothing was wrong.

So in conclusion - it seems like the fuel pump and fuel pump wiring is ok, the ECU seems to be ok, but when we turn the key the fuel pump doesn't turn on. When we try and start the car, the car cranks, but will not turn over (since there is no fuel being pumped).

Any ideas where we should check next? I'm stumped. ",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_xu055,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/xu055/e30_race_car_fuel_pump_works_but_wont_turn_on/,

I just got back from looking at an '05 Hyundai Tiburon that drove well and was at a great price, but it had a strange smell under the hood, and I noticed that there was some sort of pink, chrystaline, calcified gunk around where the radiator hose went into the engine. The smell was slightly metallic and wasn't oil or antifreeze, and the dealer said it was engine cleaner. My father said that the pink gunk was a sign of [sodium silicate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_silicate#Automotive_repair) that's used to stop a leak. He mentioned that it could be a quick and dirty fix for a leaky head gasket, and I've read of folks using it for radiator leaks as well. 

I really liked this car, but I'm trying to replace what I have now with something I can depend on *not* breaking down on road trips. 

Do you guys have any experience with this sort of thing? Is this something that I should worry about? Is this something I can bargain to get them to fix the underlying problem (assuming they can find it?)?

The title sums up my question. I am a relatively new driver, but I absolutely love it. That love for driving has expanded into a love for cars, and I find it a royal sin that I can't even change my own oil.

So where do I start? What tools should I have in my garage? Any recommendations of books or media I could study? 

My current auto is a 1999 Audi A4 1.8T S-line with a manual transmission and 210,000km. I love this car, but there are definitely a few things that could be fixed/replaced, according to my mechanic. I got the car for next to nothing and the repair costs would be roughly 2/3 the price I originally paid for the car. (I don't quite remember everything, but I know it includes the brake lines, rear suspension coils, tie rod ends and most of the steering, exhaust system, and CV boots)

So yes, that's about it. Any ""golden rules"" I should know and follow? Misconceptions and myths about car repair?

I started noticing a high pitched squeaking when I made right turns and accelerated.  Thought it was nothing.  I then filled up my gas tank at an unfamiliar gas station that was really cheap.  Now when I hit the accelerator, it hesitates like crazy.  I literally have to floor the car to make it uphill.  Today I was on the freeway and had my cruise control at 65mph and it started decelerating.  It has gotten nothing but worse and the high pitched squeaking has increased so now it squeaks all the time except for when I'm braking.  

I'm almost certain I filled up with bad gas.  Would this increase the high pitched squeaking or is that related to my new brakes?

I have about 1/4 tank of the bad gas left.  Should I take it to a mechanic and get it drained and get my fuel filter replaced?  I've also read things about fuel additives that it can clean out my engine and make my car more responsive when I give it gas.  Should I just add new fuel to the tank and will that fix my problem?

I'm really at a loss here and just put $500 into my car and don't want to put anymore money into it.

What I want to do is idle the car until the gas is almost gone and go fill up with good gas.  Will that work?

Immediately after leaving with my car, I could feel something-- almost like a grinding-- in the brake pedal that most definitely was not there before. This could have easily been overlooked by the tech when he drove the car around after finishing up, because its not overtly loud or anything and can only be felt at lower speeds.

I thought at first it might be the brakes, because you could feel it the most when braking hard, but I've since noticed that it can be felt at other times too when not braking. I took my car to an empty lot to test it. I would get some speed and hit the clutch and shut the engine off to see if I could hear anything better. No luck. I thought maybe at first maybe the tires on the front just needed to ""adjust"" to their new positioning but it's not going away and I'm really concerned about irreparable harm being done to my car.

Obviously I'm wanna take it back and have them fix it, but I'm wondering what people think it could be? Could it be they just didn't balance one of the front wheels correctly? Could there be something else they might've messed with that might have such an effect? Could having them switch the front tires (I've read this elsewhere) fix the problem?

Some people thought it was weird that the tech drove my car around the lot a bit after finishing up. I figured he was just testing to see if everything felt right, but others pointed out that if he accidentally broke something, he might've been checking to see if I would be able to tell after driving it away. Does this seem unusual to anyone else?

This is my first post on here so I hope I'm not being overly general by posting this. 

Background: I purchased an '03 Jetta wagon from a private party with about 195k miles.(yeah) It has been very well cared for at the local dealer, with all maintenance records and fully-synthetic oil changes. It has the 1.8L engine with turbo. I had it inspected at the dealer before buying.

Some questions:

- Only a few days after I got it, the coolant light came on. I notice an odor of coolant when the engine is hot. It appears to have an extremely slow leak. I bought a generic coolant at the auto parts store which said it was safe for VWs, and added it; the level has been decreasing very slowly over the past month. What do y'all think this is, a seal? Also, am I in trouble for adding a non-OEM coolant?

- The idle is a tiny bit rough, revving up to about 1.2 krpms and back down on about a 10 second cycle when sitting in neutral. Also, it revs a little on startup, up to about 1.5 krpms then settling back down to idle. Any ideas what this is?

- When I pop the hood, the release lever is very stiff and requires a bit of force to pull. Perhaps related, I have to slam the hood pretty forcefully to shut it. Is this normal?

- I have a copy of the 2002 Haynes manual - a friend of mine donated it. Is this close enough to the 2003 to be useful, or should I get the '03?

I plan on doing basic maintenance (oil changes, plugs, whatever) myself and taking it to the dealer for anything major.

What I've tried so far:

As per the owners manual ""Fixing a flooded engine"":
Attempt to start the car with the accelerator pushed all the way down. Try this until the car sounds like it is going to start and then release accelerator. 
Did not work, engine turned, and turned, but never sounded like it was going to start. No fumes from exhaust suggests no combustion. 

Something I found online:
Remove the fuel pump fuse from fuse box. Attempt to start engine until flooding sounds as if clear. When It sounds like it will start, replace fuse and start engine.
Same results, engine kept turning, no exhaust fumes, not sounding like it wants to start.

This is one of those ""help your buddy jobs"".  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

So what's I was told is that everything was going along fine and then it wouldn't move forward or in reverse.  I can make it move, but it's shifting VERY slowly between drive and reverse.  It works best after it's been turned off and restarted.  Then I can put it in drive and have it lurch as expected.  I can put it in reverse and have it lurch.  Then going between the two barely works.  Reverse is better as far as moving, but drive takes 4k RPMs to move on level gravel.  Turn it off, turn it back on and repeat as many times as you like.

Once you've used up your drive to reverse cycle I can hear and feel the torque converter caveating.  If you leave it in drive with your foot off the forward power shakes along with the cavitation noise.  I say cavitation, but I don't know for sure.  That's my assumption based on the sound and reaction.

I bypassed the radiator ATF cooler and ran 2 gallons of ATF through it a few quarts at a time with no change other than a improvement in ATF color. (letting it drain from the pressure line into a bucket, refill, let it drain more...you know, joe homeowner without a flush machine stuff)

Now, the history....this trans was already compromised: about a year ago this thing darkened my driveway courtesy of a rollback.  Classic case of strawberry milkshake.  I flushed the hell out of the cooling system and did what I could for the trans, replaced the radiator (and even did the damn timing belt, pump and rollers because they were due....I'm such a good guy!) and sent him off to get it flushed once again at a garage with a machine.  They seem to have done a good job, as everything I've drained has not settled out/separated but it is dark (not horrible dark, 70k miles dark if we're going on a scale of a new car).

The coolant has the slightest hint of raspberry milkshake, but I'm pretty sure that's from last year as I've found nothing in the ATF as of yet (I'll check again on what I drained in the morning to see if it settles out).  The coolant was low, so I initially suspected the cheap replacement radiator he bought as the culprit, but I also found the the pressure cap was bad, so it seems likely it boiled out.

I think nothing other than an oil change or two has been done to this between the time I repaired it last year and today.

I'm suspecting at a minimum that I'm looking at a stuck/sticking solenoid, or multiple solenoids.  I haven't priced them so I'm not sure even if it IS likely to be solenoids/a valve body replacement that it's worth doing based on the history.  I do know that it wasn't slipping at all up until it just decided to stop working.  And even now, on those first starts it seems to grab and pull appropriately.  It even made it into second gear between his house and mine.

So, Toyota guys......what would you do if this was yours?  Not if it was in your garage to be repaired for a customer (because I already know I'd be humping a trans and torque converter into it if that was the case).",,False,,t5_2s47e,1373336372.0,,,True,t3_1hwmu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1hwmu5/tp_needs_help_auto_trans_issues_on_1999_toyota/,

[Here's 2 pics of the part in question,](http://imgur.com/a/UoTOn) it's the cannister-looking device. I've been losing coolant, and it appears as though that is the source, and I've tried to research it but haven't been able to find it.

I'd mainly like to figure out what it is before I take it in, as I have no delusions about having the skills (much less the tools) to fix it on my own. Just relaying the following info incase anyone wants to lend any further advice...it'd be appreciated!

My check engine light came on recently before I was due for an oil change, so I had them check while they were changing the oil at a local mechanic (not a dealer or VW specialist). He showed me the code and told me it was a thermostat (or sensor?) which was causing the engine to think it was much colder than it was, thus periodically calling for more gas than needed. He said it wasn't major and that the only real effects would be decreased fuel efficiency. Ok, well I needed my car back and decided I'd address that problem later on.

However, about 2 weeks later (2 days ago), I was on my commute home, and about 15min in I noticed that I'm starting to overheat. After stopping to let traffic clear for an hour (lots of stopping at the time), I get home and notice that the coolant reservoir is dry. I filled it once it had cooled down, and then drove it to work the next morning and it acted fine then, but when I left work I noticed a puddle of coolant under my car, and by the time I got home the reservoir was completely empty again. 

I know I messed up when I put the coolant in, as it wasn't pre-diluted and I failed to put any water in myself, however I filled it up yesterday properly and it's done the same thing again... so that's when I took the pics, once I located what appears to be the source.

I was talking with a friend about it, and he thought maybe it was the serpentine belt since my A/C went warm when it started overheating, and also because I told him how it'll make a loud screech if I'm turning the wheel while the A/C is on and I'm moving slowly (pulling out of a parking space).

**Background**: At about 103,500 miles I noticed a transmission leak when changing my oil. I don't know enough about transmissions to take that repair on myself so I take to my local garage (whom I've used for years).

The garage replaced the pan/gasket and no more leak.

**Issue**: Since the pan has been replaced the transmission will slip when slowly accelerating from approximately 45 MPH in 4th (and only 4th) gear. Sometimes it has a violent shudder that is felt throughout the car. Here's a [video](http://s595.photobucket.com/user/free_range_veal/media/2013-05-06_17-11-28_438.mp4.html) of the slip (shitty video, sorry).

The slipping/shuddering only happens when the car has been driven for awhile. My commute is 22 miles and the problem won't start to happen (usually) after mile 15 when I exit one highway then speed up onto another. I typically cruise at 65 MPH.

**Solutions I've Tried**: I took it to the same shop that replaced the pan and they could only replicate the issue but it was not throwing any errors on their computers. On their recommendation, I took it to the dealer this week.

The dealer quickly diagnosed it as too much trans fluid and drained/replaced to the proper level. I paid for the diagnosis and drove home with a car shifting much smoother for the first 15 miles until the issue recurred.

I've talked with my friends who are car people and much more knowledgeable than me on the subject and they theorized that the extra fluid could have caused my issue when under pressure. After hearing their thoughts and thinking the issue usually occurs when the torque converter engages/disengages I'm wondering if the tq converter is the issue.

Any thoughts you have would be helpful. I want to be able to give the dealer (because they didn't *fix* it like they said) an opportunity to redeem itself. However, I also would like to know what direction I should be sending them.

So the dealership is recommending a new transmission. Looks like I'll be shopping for a new car.

**The Car**

1996 Honda Civic LX (Canadian Version, if that means anything). It's an automatic transmission.
Has around 354000km on it.
Has had no major repairs, just small, regular stuff.

**The Problem**

I was driving, came to a stop, and when I fully stopped I heard a muffled ""bang"" type of noise, as well as a sound that I can only describe as air rapidly being released (also sort of muffled).
After the initial noise, the car started running as if it had no muffler. While idling, the car sounds unmuffled and loud. While accelerating, the car makes a shit ton of noise, and is very loud. When the car starts, it sounds like an actual nice, fast car starting, i.e. it's nice, slow and a low sound.
The sound seems to be coming from the bottom of the engine block, but I haven't been able to pinpoint the sound.

**Performance**

After the incident, the performance of the car is reduced pretty significantly. Aside from being loud as fuck, the car struggles to accelerate as quickly as it previously could, while making a lot of noise. It also seems to take a little longer for the gears to ""catch"" when switching gears while driving.

I've been driving the thing for about 100km after it started, and the performance has not degraded from how bad it was.

I realize much of the description I give is pretty shitty, so I've [uploaded an audio file](https://soundcloud.com/user803513694/civic-starting-and-revving) of the car starting, and revving the engine. 

***BE ADVISED, IT IS LOUD (you should probably turn your speakers down)*** 

The quality is pretty bad, but it does help with understanding the sound, there is a lot of background noise too.

He drove the car across the street from work, went in to McD's, came out, and the car was still *powering on* but was not starting, at all. No starter clicking like the battery was dead, no noise at all.

To me, this sounds like the starter, but I've read that it can also be just a relay (Which is what I'm hoping for) I know the trick you can do on Chryslers, where you key on with the trip reset held down, and you get a diagnostic with error codes listed, but would something like this even throw a code?

The actual issues are as follows:

* Every so often when I first start the vehicle the ""AT Oil"" and CEL come on and the vehicle shifts very jerkily, letting it idle for a few minutes then restarting the vehicle clears these faults and it shifts fine.   
(This typically happens on warm days)

* Every so often when driving I will suddenly lose throttle for a split second and it will then act as though nothing happened, normally this will happen multiple times in a short period and then just not happen at all for a few days.

It seems to be a well-known defect with 8th gen Corollas. 1ZZ-FE engine apparently has some piston design flaws and has huge oil consumption issues right around the 150k mark. This is what I have gathered around various sites.

Personally, I have a 2000 Corolla VE (172k) that burns up around 1qt every 50 miles. I pretty much have to refill it about 2-3 times per week. It's getting expensive but I'm not in any position to buy a new car.

My question to you guys: is it OK to just keep refilling the oil? I read that there's no major performance degrade; however, because of this issue my cat converter has failed (no laws for this in Oregon, thankfully) and I get random misfires (302) according to the codes. Replaced the spark plugs a couple of times during the last few months but that doesn't resolve the 302's.

How much longer do you think it will last? In about 7 months I can afford to have the engine rebuilt, but not until then. Should I bother with another engine of the same build or what else should go in there? Is it a lot more expensive to put in something from a Honda Civic or newer model Camry/Corolla?

It only has 70,000 miles on it, original everything.  When I first got it I rebuilt the carb, and did a general tune-up and it runs pretty good.  It leaks oil like a sieve, but other than that, it starts every time and has been pretty reliable.

A few weeks ago I took it out and drove about 80 miles on it.  This truck never gets a lot of road underneath it because I don't trust it that much and the mileage is terrible compared to my car.  Anyway, the next morning I start it up and it dies a few minutes later.  Not unusual, it tends to do this when it's cold, but if I get going a few blocks everything runs great when it's warm.  

I start it up again, it dies about 10 seconds later again, this goes on and on.  Finally I figure I'm just going to start driving it and let it warm up and see if it goes away.  It didn't.  It would either die or come extremely close to dying.  I drove it 20 miles and it still did it.  It would idle, almost die, and then idle back up again.  When it died I hear a loud hissing noise.

Today (a few weeks since the problem started), I changed the oil and figured for the hell of it I would take off the air cleaner and check things out.  My knowledge of engines is pretty minimal but I noticed that the choke valve was difficult to move and seemed stuck open.  As I messed with it a little it loosened up, but I thought those were supposed to move pretty easily.  I checked my vacuum hoses and they all seemed good (although I wouldn't bet my life on it).

This car is my baby and not being able to drive it is killing me.

I own a 1990 Mazda Miata. 1.6L FI, with about 100k on the engine. 

I was driving home from class, and about a block away from my house, I lost power, my idle dropped to about 500rpm, then as I was parking it the car started knocking over 1500rpms. I shut it off, went inside quickly and came out to get a video. When I started it up I got the belt squeak and a constant knock at every RPM. I also noticed oil pressure was low. It was a cold engine, which normally runs around 90psi, but it was around 30 when this all was happening. I had less oil than normal when I checked the dipstick, but nothing below the 'fill' line. No metal particles or anything that I noticed in the oil, either.

I didn't drive over ~3000rpms during the trip, partially because it's a short trip home through a small downtown area, and partially because the engine was cold.

Early Miatas had an issue with the crank, but this engine is a replacement from a year without those issues. Miatas also have weird hydraulic lifters that tend to get gummed up with sludge and tick, but that never causes any issues other than the noise, and this knock is far worse than the ticking ever is.

Some folks over at miata.net seem to think it's my crank pulley, despite where the knock is coming from. I spoke with a guy who works as a technician at a local dealership and he said it sounds more like a bad lifter or something in the head.

Any ideas?

[Here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSfRwW3RDdU)

In November 2011 I had the clutch replaced (due to a loud throwout bearing, not a truly worn clutch) with a reman'd BMW OE kit. The tech who did the job noted how low the clutch engaged, and had another a tech drive it, and he agreed. He also mentioned that the tip of the slave cylinder shaft was worn, which could cause such an issue. At that point the car drove fine, the clutch just engaged a little low.

The following summer more symptoms showed up. On especially hot days, or just after driving for a reasonable amount of time, it became difficult to get into gear, most notably when the vehicle was at a standstill. To me, that said the clutch isn't disengaging as far as it should, and when the friction disk heats up it expands just enough that it begins to drag. This wouldn't have been an issue with the original friction disc since it was worn, but the new one is thick enough that it becomes an issue. I replaced the slave cylinder myself last summer, and it was indeed worn, but the symptoms remain. Now that its getting warm out, this issue is on my mind again.

Any ideas on what else to check? Obviously the dragging friction disc is the main concern.

It was running just fine, but yesterday I tried to start it and it started fine, but wouldn't idle - it would just stall. My girlfriend was outside of the car when I started it and said that she heard a pop, but I don't really hear anything. I tried starting it a few more times, and the same thing happened - as soon as the RPMs fell below 1000 or so, it would stall. I tried giving it some gas while starting it, and was able to keep it running as long as I was revving it up, but as soon as I took my foot off of the accelerator, it would stall again instead of idling. 

I tried putting a bottle of IsoHEET+fuel injector cleaner in it today, and have had a little bit more luck but it still won't move. Now it starts, and instead of stalling, it idles really roughly at around 500-1000 RPMs, and kind of makes a hiccuping sort of sound, and the whole engine and everything is really shaky. There is also sort of a clanking sound whole it idles.  It no longer stalls immediately, but when I put it in reverse to move it, it eventually stalled again.  

I did a bunch of googling and was thinking it could be a fuel pump issue, but I can't hear anything near the gas tank (whirring sound or something) so I'm not sure if that's good or bad.

I've a 1999 Saturn SL. Several months ago I moved into an apartment complex that requires me to park my car on a steep hill. The front / rear of the car are level, and the tilt occurs in the driver's side / passenger's side such that the driver's side is lower than the passenger's side. Shortly after I moved in, my car began making this weird liquid noise somewhere inside the dash. It sounds like someone pours a glass of water out every time I step on the gas. This sound normally lessens as I drive.

I believe it might be something with the car's coolant system, however my coolant is not pouring out and the car never overheats. I originally thought that there was probably a bunch of air in the coolant system, and because of the angle of my car as it sits, all those air bubbles would accumulate in the heater. So, I had the cooling system flushed to try to get rid of the bubbles. This seemed to work, but eventually the sound returned. So, I'm wondering if anyone else out there knows what else to try?

Further troubleshooting information:
The pouring water sound occurs when I rev the engine. If I put the car in neutral and rev the engine I still get the sound. If the car is sitting still and I rev the engine I still get the sound. And no coolant appears to be leaking out of the car.

Taking to the mechanic tomorrow, is it dead?",12,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/16zbz7/1999_ford_taurus_creamy_oil_stalling_issues/,"So I've had this car for about two years now, bought it for 500$ because I made a terrible choice in not getting an oil change on my last car!

The first issue that I've had is lately when it is cold out when I put the car in reverse from park, it would stall out and I would have to pump the gas while trying to start the car to get it going again, then wait a while before driving - or else if I put it in reverse ( trying to get it in drive ) it would stall.

So I'm not that great with cars and I noticed about a week or two ago my oil was creamy, I hadn't seen that before and noted it. I've talked to my Dad and my Boss ( good friend ) and they have their own ideas what it may be.

Yesterday I made a quick trip less than a mile away to a local supermarket, the car goes and starts up as normal when I just put it in drive immediately. Got out of the store, stalling issue, pumping the gas to get it going.

Now just today at about midnight I went out for fast food, note I'm broke and this is a rare thing for me to be out at this time of year ( winter snow removal in Michigan + no snow ) So I haven't been driving much.

I stalled at a red light, my car was sputtering and idling low. I finally got it started, even though every asshole let me know with their horn or flying around me even though my hazards were on, I drove to get my food and notice my car was not overheated - but running really really hot.

It has a dummy gauge from C to H and well, it was in the red.

Ate my food, talked on the phone a bit and before I could figure to get some anti-freeze in the car my Dad had already done it. I've been told its a blown head gasket, or a crack in the head by both of them... either a 500$+ repair or a dead car... from what I've been told.

It was really really low on radiator fluid too. Like put two gallon jugs into it and it wasn't even full yet. I plan to put more in it and take it a few blocks away to a trusted mechanic, but since I'm up I wanted to know if anyone had any input/experience in this sort of situation.

If its something like the head gasket and can be replaced - its a 500$ car with 160k miles and an engine that has already been replaced from a junkyard before I bought it - would it be worth fixing? ( Note I'm broke and can't repair it, so it would sit most likely until spring )

If it isn't that.... and there is permanent damage to the engine - is there anything I can do short term or basically should I just scrap it. Right now I'm not going out/driving at all and I do have options thankfully.

Just trying to figure out if its even worth keeping, or if the damage has already been done. ( Also a nice muffler leak so its loud as fuck )

The previous jack couldn't move for obvious reasons, but this one does.  The jack slowly moves inwards as I jack it up.

I do however, need to make it last. 
It has an oil leak and a busted coolant reservoir. The clutch grinds in first and second on cold days and the idle is rough. It has a high pitched whistle when accelerating and the overall performance is downright sluggish. 
Also, at speeds over 60 it starts to shake, so badly that my CD player shakes in its housing and loosens wires and causes the CD to skip. How do I find a leak? Do I need a clutch? Or a transmission? Someone told me the whistling

I recently graduated, got my own place, and decided to be independent.  What can be more independent and easier than changing the oil on a car?

Ha.  I went to a couple stores and got the needed materials.  A cheap jack.  Some 3-ton jack stands.  An oil drip pan.  Oil, filter, etc.

**1st attempt**:  The [jack](http://i.imgur.com/f0odL.jpg) (one on right) is crap.  So much slack in it that I have to pump it by hand in order to get the handle to clear the car.  It's hard to pump and takes a while.  Finally I get it maximum extension and go to put the jack stands in.  They don't fit.  They are off by one-half inch.  

**2nd attempt**:  Got a new [jack](http://i.imgur.com/f0odL.jpg) (one on left) on Amazon.  It's pretty amazing and gets my car up on the stands in no time.  I get under the car and start going to work.  Except I can't get the oil drain plug out.  At this point, I'm just using some adjustable wrenches that can't hold on to it.  Spend a while trying to find my socket wrench and have no luck.  I put the tools and car away and go have a beer.

**3rd attempt**:  Find the socket wrench 30 minutes later.  Let the beer wear off and put the car back up on the stands.  Socket wrench is gripping well but it's still not breaking loose.  Muscle time!  Haaa...

What I had done was a full service, MOT, new rear discs and pads, new wishbone, and a new rear brake calliper as the electric parking brake had developed a fault.

My (limited) understanding is that the new wishbone could've affected the wheel balance, but then should correcting this not have been part of the work originally carried out?

UPDATE: Just got a call from the garage to say they've adjusted the balancing and given it a run on the motorway and it drives great, no vibration at all. So it seems to have solved the problem, and they said there's no charge as it should have been done with the original job.

Basically, I took my car in for its annual emissions/inspection, and when we got the car up on the lift, it became apparent that doing the [coin check](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=51) and rotating my tires (front&lt;-&gt;back) hadn't been enough. The insides of all my tires, were basically shredded, the worst of which being [this guy on my left front](http://i.imgur.com/PS2VS.jpeg).

The mechanics at the shop speculated it was an alignment issue and/or my penchant for taking corners fairly hard, the latter of which I fully agree (hey, it's a performance car, and my daily commute can be, depending on the route, about 80% deserted, twisty country backroads).

My tires/wheel history is thus: 8k miles on my summers (225/40R18), 5k on my winters (205/60R16), then 5k on my summers again. At no point in this time has my car been aligned (oops?).

Basically my questions are these:

* Should I be getting my car aligned more frequently? If so, how often? I rotate tires just about every oil change (4k miles), but should I get an alignment say... at the beginning of each winter tire season and again when I put the summers back on?
* Is hard cornering really enough to skew the wear pattern as much as in the pic? My gut is telling me that hard cornering should still wear the tires fairly evenly if the car is properly aligned/set up.
* If hard cornering is enough, and I don't want to change my driving style, is annual tire replacement just something I'm going to have to live with/plan for, or can something be done to my alignment to mitigate the wear (or at least make the things wear more evenly)?

I feel like these are ""things I should know,"" but before my replacement tires get here, I'd like to have a better idea of what I did wrong with the last ones and what I can do better going forward.",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_x9o6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/x9o6f/11_mazdaspeed3_shredded_tires_after_13k_miles_not/,

He discovered a silent, hidden alarm was installed on the car (mind you, I've got no keyfob, nor had any indication from the dealer the car had an alarm). Anyway, the alarm was locking up the car (thus the flashing dashboard lights out of nowhere), and there was a hidden button under the steering wheel to disarm the alarm.

Car starts now (only had one time where I had to disarm it, so alarm seems to arm itself at its whim).

Course of action now is to get rid of that faulty hidden alarm and get a keyless entry or something going.

7/22

(Sorry for the essay, I tend to cover *everything*. The important items to speculation are before and after the separation lines below.)

So I was happy with my purchase yesterday, and the car ran just fine. Had to turn it on and off multiple times yesterday during running small errands (oil change, vacuuming the car, etc), so nothing indicated anything wrong with the ignition. Ran smoothly as well, so nothing indicated a transmission or engine problem.

This morning, car wouldn't start.
_____________________________________________________

I'd been used to everything automatic in a previous car (locks, headlights off, etc), so my first time leaving this older car I checked to make sure nothing was left on to result in a dead battery. Called AAA fearing the worst. (I realized at that very point how little I actually knew about cars cause I didn't know where to start troubleshooting.) I figured I could have it taken into a nearby shop and have them troubleshoot (while learning as much as I can about the processes). AAA rep suggested jump starting the car (I said to give it a shot, but the power windows, radio, and headlights were all working, and I remembered to turn everything off, so I was not hopeful). 

Turns out his jump helped. He said that if upon removing his jump recharger, the car stops, then it is an alternator problem. He removed it, but the car kept going, so I felt better about the situation. He left and reminded me to keep the car on for the next 30-45 minutes to have the alternator charge the battery. Meanwhile I ran errands to keep it running, and then got back home after just above an hour and parked it.

After leaving it off for about 20 minutes, I decided to go out again, but just as this morning, car wouldn't start.

I left it for a few hours, used another car to do other stuff, and picked up some jumper cables from Walmart. I tried to jump it again to move the Accord, but to no avail. I'm thinking it's these $10 cables not supplying enough juice between the Accord and my other car ('08 Saturn Vue), or it's actually dead this time.

-------------------------------------------------


**Some additional details you may need to know:** the car does not ""crank"" or ""click"" when I turn the key to start the engine. The car seemed to run just as it did yesterday in the hour it actually drove today. There is a chime that occurs when I open the car door (and no, it's not because of a key in the ignition, or headlights left on–those are different sounds, I've verified). When I do try to turn the car on, the radio display and digital clock on the dashboard, as well as lights on the dashboard all flicker.

I figure I'll call AAA tomorrow and have it jumped again or have it towed to a shop, but I've decided to post to be prepared of the possible problems related to these symptoms. I've done a fair bit of research, but I can't be sure of anything. So far I think it could be the battery, or the alternator.

Afterwards, we flushed out the fuel tank and filtered all the fuel. Still nothing. Soon after that, we replaced the fuel pump. The problem consisted. So i'm asking you guys. What could be the problem?

1337549551.0,11,self.Cartalk,twhnb,"Hey r/cartalk, do I have a project for you: 2004 Dodge Durango Engine Swap",15,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/twhnb/hey_rcartalk_do_i_have_a_project_for_you_2004/,"I know it is a *very* complicated and involved job, but how do I replace the engine in a 2004 Dodge Durango?

Backstory: I have a 2004 Dodge Durango. Last week while driving it on the highway, the engine threw a rod and destroyed the engine block. This seems to be a common issue for my year, make, and model, but Dodge has not made a recall. The dealer wants $8000 to replace the engine, but a friend and I can probably do it for half that.

Prior experience: I have experience working on cars (done an engine swap in a '95 Honda Accord, for example), but I have never replaced an engine in a Dodge Durango.

Vehicle information: Dodge Durango SLT with a Generation 1 5.7L HEMI

Tools and resources available: I probably have all the tools required (unless it's something out of the ordinary that you wouldn't typically find in an automotive shop). I have the service manual for my vehicle.

This is the basic procedure I know from my prior experience:

1. Remove hood after marking the alignment with marker or tape.

2. Prep engine for removal. This includes depressurizing the A/C and properly disposing the freon; draining the oil, coolant and other engine fluids; depressurizing the fuel system, etc.

3. Remove drive and serpentine belts, air cleaner assemblly, alternator, cooling fan, starter, spark plug wires, etc.

4. Remove power steering pump and A/C compressor, or if possible, just move them aside and secure with heavy wire (allowing you to leave the hoses connected).

5. Disconnect radiator and heater hoses and remove radiator from engine bay.

6. Disconnect and unplug vacuum lines and electrical sensors after marking each component with tape to make installation easier.

7. Detach and plug fuel lines.

8. Disconnect major components like exhaust pipe and manifold. Unscrew transmission/engine mounting bolts. Remove inspection plate and clamp transmission torque converter to keep it from falling off during engine removal. Make sure to mark alignment of torque converter and drive plate to make reassembly easier. Unfasten torque converter from drive plate.

9. Disconnect driveshaft and rear engine support.

10. Secure and detach transmission from engine using tranny jack.

11. Hook engine crane to engine and raise engine off engine mounts enough to release the weight off engine mounts. Remove engine mounts and insulators. Double check all connections between engine and engine compartment have been disconnected.

12. Lift engine out of engine compartment and place on engine stand or used tire.

Some guidelines to go by:

* mark all connections with tape, making them easy to identify
* sort and label bolts so they don't get mixed up and you know where they go
* take pictures of de-installation process to make re-installation easier

Am I missing anything? Does anyone else have prior experience with this and have advice to offer? **Does anyone else have step-by-step instructions for this project?**

Also, I want to replace the ""04 engine with an '05 engine to hopefully avoid this problem in the future. Any compatibility issues I should be aware of? (I looked it up, and they *say* I should be able to replace an '04 engine with an '05, but I'm just making sure.)

Any advice/information on this topic would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I just got back from car dealership, and Discount tire did this to me too. I specifically asked them to leave my tires alone because the tires on front had ~9/32 tread left while the rear tires had 6/32 tread left. I wanted to leave it this way so the tires would even out in wear and hopefully last longer.

I'm getting more and more angry when even after specifically asking DO NOT FUCKING ROTATE THEM, for the 3rd time someone has decided to just fucking put the good tires on the rear of a FWD car.  I'm getting very angry about it because I feel like its a cheap trick to get people into burning through tires faster and honestly I hate the way my car handles like this.

I understand that they have this line that states it prevents oversteer and is safer and such... I don't buy it. (side note - I have some track time, I'm not exactly prone to just losing control, I've been in loss-of-traction situations, never been a big deal for me) - I just don't buy their ""safety"" bullshit.  I asked discount tire why they kept doing it and they gave a very easy answer: because legal. (the long version is apparently if the person drives off and loses control of their car, Discount Tire can get investigated/sued for lack of precaution/safe measures)

Is there some other reason why I am continually finding myself jacking my car up manually and having to rotate my tires as I please so I don't feel like people are assuming I don't know how to control a car or screw me out of full use of rubber (lol)

just bought a 2003 mazda tribute (lx v6 4x4), 85k miles.  when getting it inspected for the sticker the mechanic said we needed a replacement exhaust system (converter to muffler), and showed us the rusty underbelly of the car.   we figured we would wait and get a 'second opinion' since we have no experience with cars, and so took it to a mazda dealership service center and said we wanted some rust damage checked out.  the dealer came  back and said the following was necessary.  

Parts and labor: 

Center Pipe – (pipe from converter to muffler) needs replacement. 
$805

Front Lower Control Arms. Rubber bushings are cracked.  Replace both sets.
$549.36
 
Wheel Alignment 
$169.95
 
Oil Pan Leaking
Replacement of that and gasket
$680
 
Crank shaft , replacement seal
$198.49
 
Valve cover gaskets – leaks into spark plug ports. Needs replacement.
$611.51
 
Flush / Replace Transmission fluid
$311.98
 
Flush / Replace power steering fluid
$158.76

wtf! this is like more than half what we paid for the car. the guy said that the control arms needed to be replaces as it was a safety issue.  
the car did pass inspection, but he said these leaks were also needed but not urgent. 

note that we have only had the vehicle for about 3 weeks, but haven't heard any clanking, whirring, banging, etc or felt any shimmying or shaking, or creaking.

I had a list of things to check that I've just typed up from my Dad and was hoping you guys could look it over and give me some things to add/look for.

**Questions**

* Where is the car from?

* How many owners has the car had?

* How long have you owned the car for?

* Is your name on the title? (I'm in Arizona and have seen so many titles that don't belong to the person I am trying to purchase a car from)

**Things to do:**

* Let it idle for 10 Minutes

* Drive it for 30-45 minutes

Things to Check:

* Check Underneath the car for dried fluid or pools of fluid.

* Look at the wheels, are their spiderweb cracks on the tires?

* Does the Axel look damaged?

* Dried grease anywhere under the car?

* Check the rear end differential, look for leaks around cover

Under the hood look for -

* Cracks on any of the plastic
 
* Breaks in any of the lines
 
* Discoloration of any plastic (yellowing)
 
* Radiators should run stable, no wobbling.

* Look for the A/C, (right in the front of the car). Search for dents.

* Check the interior, glass, electronics for any damage.

Look at the engine -

* Is it clean?

* Any dents?

* Wobbling?

* Check the undercarriage side of the tires, actually get underneath the car

* Look at the muffler, check for rust/exhaust burn/corrosion.

* If there is any kind of crusty powder on the engine? This is a huge warning side.

* Check the driveline transmission, if the line is loose there is a problem. Give it a tug.


Sorry if these are all common sense things. This is my first car and I would really like to get your opinions on what you should check for in a used car.
* Is there fluid coming off out of the struts between the tire and shock?

Wrong! Today I was getting off the highway, where things went fine, and going from stopped to first to second went fine, but going into third gear the clutch wouldn't grip.

So, when I told him, he took one whiff and declared I'd burned out the clutch. So this broke college student needs to fund his own transmission repair or wait a long ass time to get a family-funded repair.

I took my car in to a non-Honda shop to get a 60k mile diagnostic (simply because all the Honda shops I called beforehand seemed to struggle with English/basic communication), and was told I needed a LOF (which I agree with), a trans flush ($260), Coolant flush ($145), brake flush ($110), and induction service ($160).  Here is what I found from a Honda release (Sept 2006):


Regarding **coolant flush**:
&gt; Engine cooling system flushing is recommended only if the customer has installed incorrect coolant in their engine. In the very rare instance when flushing is necessary, a procedure is available that does not require the use of special tools. There is no difference in the service interval for coolant replacement between normal and severe conditions. Using a 2001 Accord again for an example, the recommended coolant replacement interval is 120,000 miles and every 60,000 miles thereafter. There is no justifiable reason to recommend coolant replacement more often.

Regarding **fuel induction service**:
&gt; Fuel injection (induction) cleaning/flushing is not recommended by American Honda. This is an unnecessary maintenance procedure and an improper repair procedure. If a Honda vehicle is experiencing a fuel injector malfunction, the faulty injector should be replaced.

I was finally able to get in touch with a Honda shop that spoke English and asked Service about fuel induction, to which his response was basically that Honda (manufacturer) can't come right out and *suggest* it specifically as it's the trademark name for a specific service, but that it's something that should be done if the throttle (I could be misremembering that part) is dirty.  I think this sounds like bullshit, but I could just be cynical.  The entire notice from Honda seemed to be very candid and forthright in what is best for customers and what is a waste of both their and the Honda shop's time.


I have about 69k on my car, but have been doing regular oil changes and taking it in twice a year or so to make sure there are no major issues with it, and I've always been given a clean report (and what I haven't, I've fixed - such as brake pads or air filters, etc).  So it's not like it's in poor condition to begin with.  I found another shop that's better rated and offers the services recommended more cheaply, but so far I'm leaning towards only doing the LOF, brake flush, and a trans drain and fill.  That said, the Honda shop I finally got in touch with today to ask about the flushes/inductor service said they'll do a complete flush (without the machines) for $245, which sounds like a rip off, so I'm considering finding someone who will do a drain and fill and doing that 3 times, but I'm not sure.  Can anyone shed some light on this situation?  Should I go ahead and have all the maintenance that was recommended done, or are they trying to take advantage?


**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for the time you took in crafting such invaluable responses.  I'll be taking the car in on pay day and I can't tell you how much I appreciate being given straight advice on what actually needs to be done.

**2nd Edit** Just came back from the shop and just wanted to say, once again, THANK YOU to you all.  I went from looking at an estimate of $708 (not including labor) from the original shop that did the recommendations to paying $162 (incl. labor) for a drain and fill and brake flush (which is not a bad rate in my area at all).  Not only that, I told the guy at the shop that I would be planning to take in the car for 2 more drain and fills (rather than do a flush), and when he came out from working on it, he said that it might be better to wait on the second drain and fill since the transmission fluid apparently wasn't looking that bad (this was something the shop that gave me the original quote said needed to be done right away).  So basically I saved about $600 based on a consensus reached by you guys.  As someone who is broke as a joke but who was planning to splash out on what I thought at the time was necessary maintenance, I can't thank you all enough for teaching me enough about what I needed to know for this stuff so that I didn't get totally screwed.  Not only that, I've always known my car is a solid machine (for all the mileage I've put on it - 69,000 in 4 years - and not one maintenance alert yet, apart from low tire pressure), but I'm now realizing just how well built it is, and I know enough now to understand that it doesn't need to be serviced as much as I've had various shops telling me it does, just so they can make a buck.

1375935061.0,9,self.Cartalk,1jxnxc,Axle replacement... Pissed... 2001 Ford Focus SE-Automatic. Need help or advice.,13,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1jxnxc/axle_replacement_pissed_2001_ford_focus/,"Hello. I've been spending time the past few days changing the axle on my wife's car. Initially I was going to do just the boot, but decided to do the whole axle midway. This is my first time working on the axle (gone as far as hubs or stabilizer links before.)

I ran into my first problem when removing the axle from the transmission. Fine, I didn't expect it to be easy. I ultimately disconnected the tie-rod, strut and stabilizer links to get the space I needed. I rented a slide hammer and CV axle remover from Autozone and was able to take it out with a lot of effort. I tried with a screwdriver and prybar etc. previously with no luck. This car apparently has a tight spot right underneath the CV axle that made it much more difficult. I tore the inner boot removing it so i decided just to buy a new axle and get a refund for the other one. I removed the boot but the cap to the axle stayed in, so I had to remove that. It wasn't as hard as the axle but I got it out.

I got the new axle, returned the slide hammer to Autozone and was ready to install, hoping it would be easy. This is where the getting pissed off started. I tried to insert the CV axle and it the initial part went in easy, great, but there is a larger section to it that cannot go in. It's like a small collar on the axle and I know it goes in, but I couldn't. 

This is where I started making mistakes. I decided to put the axle into the hub already so it could apply pressure to the other end of the boot. I got it into the hub easily and forced the ball joint into it. I accidentally tore the ball joint so I'm going to need to replace that. I then continued trying to push the CV in by hand. It was difficult since it's in a VERY awkward position... 

Here I made the big mistake. I tried to use a prybar to hold the cap near the inner boot in and hit it with a hammer. It didn't budge, and I realized I had torn the boot... God damnit. now I need a new boot &amp; ball joint for tomorrow. Maybe even the axle/transmissions seal... Not too sure though. 

Are there any tips/tricks to getting the whole CV boot in? I can't get a good angle and am really limited in leverage. Is there a special tool for this car? Also, how can I tell when the transaxle seal/collar need replacement?

tl;dr Cannot insert axle completely into car, tore boot, trying again tomorrow, need advice...

Thanks.

**Edit: Mission Accomplished.**

I got the car back together today (Can only work Tues. &amp; Wed. due to work schedule).
I was able to get the exchange done at Autozone, no questions asked, hooray! I also got a new ball joint and realized that it's not removable without an angle grinder &amp; drill. So I bought a whole new control arm ($60). Removing it from the cross-member was a major pain the ass... But I got it back together with no big problems.

I then proceeded to smack the axle in while holding it straight. It took a few good smacks with the rubber mallet and it eventually went in and seated itself very well.

I did damage the seal on the inside during removal. There's a little metal ring with a slight hill and holes in it. I smashed one side of it pretty bad during removal (tried with a small screwdriver first). The seal (green thick ring, like a camshaft seal) is okay. I may be confusing those as I'm not too sure what's what when it comes to these seals. I will be on the lookout for leaks in the next few days.

Torqued everything back up, and everything related to this is A-OK. I greased up all the joints and moving parts down there (Mobil-1, says it's good for chassis) and that's it.

I've been having a tough time figuring out exactly what it is but from what I've gathered it's a 50 trim garrett t31 turbine paired with a .63 turbonetics compressor... and stage 3 wheel whatever that means.. stages seem pretty arbitrary to me.


Anyway I'm curious because the guy I bought it from claims that he ran no oil restrictor on it and [instead there's just a fitting directly into the turbo](http://imgur.com/iW9JMm0).


Now I've been googling around the internet for the past couple days straight and haven't been able to find a definitive answer one way or another. Some people say it isn't necessary, some people say that turbonetics themselves say it isn't necessary. From the turbonetics FAQ, a good pressure is 20-30psi at idle and 70-80 under throttle. I know for a fact my car can hit 100psi at full throttle and this is where my concern comes in. Run an oil restrictor and starve the little guy at idle? Don't run one and hope I don't blow my seals every time I floor it?

I would be more worried, but my engine temperature is normal and nothing appears to be smoking/overheating, I was told it could just be a broken thermostat which should be a simple cheap fix.  The coolant level looks like it is right around the minimum line, but I checked immediately after pulling over, and I do not know if that effects the coolant level.

I have a closed coolant system and should not have to change the coolant, according to the user manual, however I am able to if it is an emergency.

I think I might have a spark problem, the sparkplug cables popped off the coilpack a few times, but I thought I fixed that by bending the connectors a little to give it a snugger fit. Haven't popped off since then.

Should I be concerned about the occasional low idle? When I noticed they hovering low a couple pumps of gas will usually pick them up a bit.

UPDATE: There was an update to the problem. I went for a drive, and when getting close to home I noticed the problem happening. When I pulled into my driveway I had the radio cranked, and noticed the ABS light flickering, and the radio would cut out sometimes. I hit the buttons for the sunroof/windows, and the car died.

I have a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT, and I need to get a few of the tires looked at (I just got it last Sunday). I brought it in to the tire place with the lugnut key that the previous owner gave me with the car, but I was told that I need a second key to undo the tires (he said they'd need both keys). He looked around and they did not have one that would do the job.

He sent me to a parts store, saying that they would be able to look at the car and get me the one I need. I walked into the parts store, and the folks inside didn't even look at the car--they said that keys are unique to the set of lugnuts they come with.

I called the tire place back, and he said that because of the way the rims on my car work they would not be able to forcibly remove the lugnuts. I tried the dealership, who said the same thing (although they wouldn't say anything definitively without physically seeing the car, which makes sense). The dealer does not sell keys for the lugnuts at all.

I have no idea what I can do to fix this. One of my tires needs to be patched ASAP, but they can't do it without that key. Any advice?

(2005 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner),9,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1gg5af/need_help_diagnosing_clunk_from_rear_end_2005/,"Well after damn near 125k miles, I finally have an issue with my Tacoma that I can't quite seem to solve. A couple of months ago, I took my truck through some desert trails out here in Nevada and while I didn't necessarily beat on the truck, the suspension was definitely put to the test a few times here and there. Shortly after, I started noticing that my truck would produce an audible clicking/clunk coming from the rear end. The only time that this audible click/clunk is heard is when I'm making a left turn. The odd thing is that the truck only produces this noise when the left turn is completed, it wont make it before or during the turn, only after the truck is pointed in a straight line. At first I thought it could possibly be the rear end binding but I've dealt with that issue before when I used synthetic rear diff fluid so I know what a rear end feels like when it binds. In addition, I find it very strange that it only makes this noise when I'm turning left, never when turning right. It leads me to believe that the clunking may be coming from one of the leaf springs. It can also be described as though something is tensing up or binding when turning left and then releasing once I point the truck straight. The truck itself drives fine, there's no grinding noises, no vibrating while on the freeway or at any speeds, no audible hums or anything like that either. I've given the rear end and drive shaft a visual inspection and everything seems as though it's solid, there are no broken springs or broken/leaking shocks either. I jacked the rear end up and wiggled the tires to check for any play that could be indicative of a wheel bearing on it's way out but those all seem good to go. Can the reddit community give me any pointers or things that I can check for in regards to tracking down what could be causing this noise? A friend of mine suggested lubricating the bushings on the leaf springs as well as the springs themselves to see if that quiets things down but I have a feeling this may be related to something that lube simply wont fix.

It has 180K miles on it and is finally starting to have problems... imagine that.. 

The first time this happened, while driving, the engine just turned off completely and wouldn't start back up. Took it to a mechanic and they said the VC gasket seal was faulty and leaking oil into spark plug wells. I did the work myself and replaced the seal, installed new spark plugs, wires, and coil. It started up just fine after that and worked for about a month. 

Now, the engine turns off randomly (once every 15 miles or so, at any speed) while I am driving. The battery, radio, lights, etc. are all still on after the engine cuts. The steering wheel and brakes lock up after the engine cuts. Battery is fine, just replaced that a couple months ago. Check engine light is NOT on. It flickers ONLY when the engine turns off for a second, but all the little indicators seem to do that when the engine cuts. The car is leaking oil from somewhere, but it doesn't seem to be leaking out of the seal. I checked the spark plugs (before I replaced the seal, they were covered in oil due to the faulty seal) and they are all dry and seem okay. Every time I move the car after it has been parked there is about a 3 inch spot of oil on the ground. 

What could be causing the engine to just turn off while driving? It ONLY happens while I am in a gear driving and it is random every time. After the engine turns off, I pull over and stop then restart the car. It usually starts right back up, but on occasion it takes 2 or 3 attempts. I have figured out that if I rev up the engine and keep the RPM's high in each gear between shifting, it is much less likely to stall out. I know this is bad for the car, but I have no choice at the time until I can get it fixed! Also, the car seems to be running rougher than usual.

 If anyone could help me figure out what I need to do to get her running again, it would be much appreciated! Please describe in detail, I am going to be working on fixing it myself. I don't have the funds to pay for labor and frankly, I enjoy learning how to do it myself. Thank you! :)

Then a very infrequent problem started happening. I chalked it up to the age of the car, but it is now becoming more frequent.

I guess I would describe the problem as a loss of power from the engine. It usually occurs when I'm accelerating. As I press on the gas the car seems to hesitate around 2200-2700 rpm, it varies, but almost always in that range. During the hesitation it doesn't matter how far down I press the pedal the engine doesn't respond at all. I get no lights on the dash or anything during this ordeal. No odd sounds either. On a probably related note, the engine will sometimes stall a second or so after I clutch in to shift down and coast a turn. Stalling mid turn sucks ass. The sudden lack of power steering... :/

Anyways these two only started happening after I had the sparks replaced. The mechanic, a friend of girlfriends family said it looked like they had never been changed out. Very gunked up.

Here are my [specs](http://www.cars.com/isuzu/rodeo/2001/specifications/?acode=USB10ISS012B0) and mine has the 4-speed auto transmission.

So, I see three 'symptoms':

1. **The Primary Problem** - When travelling at or just below highway speeds, say 40 to 70 mph, the vehicle will jerk.  I don't really know how to explain it other than to say it feels like the transmission is just losing traction or something.  The problem typically will go away if I lay off the gas just a touch or accelerate until the vehicle upshifts.

2. **The Secondary Problem** - The vehicle is idling roughly, especially after warming up and traveling a good distance.  When I say roughly, I mean that it will idle normally and then a rough rotation will come through.  It's like this: 'normal, normal, normal, rough, normal, normal, rough.'

3.  **The Tertiary Problem** - There's a rattling noise that happens when I'm both idling as well as accelerating, however it goes away between the time when I shift out of park until the point at which we're about 2k RPM.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Issue: When I hit a small bump there is a rattling noise coming from the rear driver side suspension. And when I hit any large bumps going at a speed of over 45 or so the car will sway slightly side to side and there will be a much louder rattling sound.

I think it's probably bad shocks and struts but I just wanted to get some outside input. I've crawled underneath and everything looks like it's supposed too; there is nothing loose or disconnected. The rattling makes me think it is the suspension and when I do the ""bounce test"" it definitely makes me think that at least the shocks are going.

**Update**: Problem solved. I installed a pair of [Monroe Quick Struts](http://www.monroe.com/products/Quick-Strut) in the rear and also replaced the sway bar linkages.

When i bought the Car in October everything looked very clean. Previous owner always did service/oil change on regular basis. Just put in a new clutch less then 3k miles ago. Testdrove it and felt so great!

Now the car sat for quite a while because i didnt want to take it out in the bad weather.

After i finally got to drive the car now i noticed occasional clutch slipping and immediately contacted the owner about the specs of the new clutch that has been put in the car and if he knew about the problem. 
Previous owner then refused to give any information about anything pretty much and claimed car is fine. Now with the time passed the warranty obviously expired so i couldn't really do much about it.

Now here are the symptoms.

- There are days where there is no clutchslipping when driving the car no matter what speed, throttle and gear. 

- The clutch will start slipping badly after being stuck in traffic (alot of stop and go aka. engage and disengage of the clutch) and then gets normal again after about 30min out of traffic, no slipping anymore.

- After there was clutch slip in any gear it is very hard to push the clutch pedal down for the first time afterwards.

- No burnt clutch smell... ever!

Now the Fact that it is a rather new clutch in the car just makes me unsure about my fruther steps.

we dont have parts here (in Switzerland) for these cars so it will take some time and alot of money (shipment + taxes) to get a new clutch.

So i really want to be sure if there isnt anything else that could cause this problems.

There's a coolant leak from the front driver side, dripping off the frame/plastic around the coolant reservoir. From what I can tell, the reservoir looks to be in good condition. The radiator was replaced about 40-50k miles ago. The coolant levels appear to hold steady if the car is sitting for extended periods, but the leak is very noticeable once I park after driving for a bit (i.e., 12 miles to work).

I was driving home from work last night and the car started making a rather loud grinding noise after about 10 miles of surface street driving (averaging about 30-40mph). It started as I was waiting at a light. I've heard the noise once before, about three weeks ago, as I was getting to work (again, about 12 miles of driving). I cracked the hood and checked fluids (looked good) but couldn't spot anything and had to head into work anyway. 8 hours later, she started right up and ran fine.

The only correlation between the two occurrences is that I ran the heater (full heat a few weeks ago, a few moments of low defrost last night). The car did seem to feel sluggish with the noise but ran fine beforehand (felt like I had full power, shifts were smooth).

* Error code indicating that the ignition coil needs replacement.  Unfortunately, I did not have the presence of mind at the time to get the exact code from the tech at AAP.
  
* Rough/chugging/loping idle.  Somewhat clears up above 12-1400 RPM, but the engine still doesn't ""sound"" right.
  
* Poor/little acceleration from a stop.  Climbing hills is a huge challenge.  The truck hits its shift points, but, at one point at low speed in the driveway, I had the accelerator floored, and it barely creeped forward.  
  
* Steps taken so far - Tested and replaced ignition coil, replaced half the plugs and wires (The ones on the passenger side only so far, I just haven't had the time to replace the other three - I've had maybe four hours to work on this, between work and rain), rotated relays in the main fuse box.  
  
* From time to time, the truck will literally ""click"" back to normal.  (I guess that, right now, the issue is permanent, and the ""normal"" running of the engine is intermittent.)  After I replaced the ignition coil, the truck ran like a champ during a test run around the block, and, then, after it sat for an hour, was back in shit state.  After I rotated the fuel pump relay, it ran well during the next test trip, but afterwards, was running poorly again.  Once, trying to limp home, at a light, the engine ""clicked"" again while it was in shit state, back to a normal running mode, and then, a few minutes later, ""clicked"" back to shit state.  I say ""clicked"" because that was exactly the noise that I heard from the engine compartment.  
  
* Any suggestions?  My only vehicle, etc, etc.  I'm handy-ish, but I'm not handy with a multimeter (I learned today how to test resistance across the terminals on the ignition coil, thanks to youtube).  Should I have the ignition coil code reset and test again?  The somewhat intermittent nature of the failure/success makes me wonder if there's an electrical issue.  That's only my uninformed opinion, though.  I can't speak to the state of any parts on the vehicle that I haven't touched - I bought it at 186k from a used car dealership that claimed that they PM'd it, and now the truck is at 240k (I drive a lot for work).  But, wouldn't a fuel filter or PCV valve trigger the the CE light?  (And, FWIW, the last time I put fuel in the truck, was $15 of 93 octane with a bottle of fuel injector cleaner.)
  
  
Thanks for any suggestions.  Tonight, I'm at my wit's end with this truck.  Before yesterday, I never had a problem with the engine. 
  
UPDATE - I completed replacing the plugs and wires this afternoon.  Success!  The truck ran smoothly during a test trip around the block, so I drove the truck to AAP to read the code again (they aren't allowed to clear it), and I picked up an air filter, which I replaced in the lot.  And, then...

My friend let his girlfriend drive my ol' Subaru and they had a freak accident where my headlight and grille got ripped partially off, with no other damage. The wiring for the headlight is all intact--I can't see any hardware damage. So here's the symptoms of my problem:

1. Dual filament bulb for the turn signal only lights up one filament, making it very, very dim. Hard to see in the sun, really.

2. It blinks very short and fast; when driving it blinks faster with acceleration and slows down as I brake. I think this might be why it's so dim--it doesn't have the time to completely light the filaments as it blinks so quickly.

3. The rear driver's side turn signal ALSO blinks irregularly now; it suffered no damage whatsoever. I'm guessing they're on the same circuit?

So I'm guessing that it's an electrical problem, but I'm out of my depth there. Is it a grounding thing? A fuse? Did something get messed up when I was using the back turn signal without a functioning one in front? I've made it this far without a mechanic--I'd be tickled pink if there's an answer I could try!

I'm not a car person, but I am a poor student and need some help with vehicle maintenance. My Legacy recently started having issues losing coolant very quickly and running very hot as a result. 

On top of this my auto transmission is having problems on hills. I took it up a hill on the weekend and it was super sluggish and ran at 4kRPM even on shallow slopes. If I put my foot down a bit made a lot of noise and then lurched up the hill while sounding really strained. The fluid is actually at a good level and still looks alright when I checked it myself. 

Initially some googling pointed towards head gasket issues, but....

I took it into a garage today and they have said I need a new water pump and coolant flush. They didn't mention anything about the transmission either as I had some problems communicating with the mechanic (who was foreign). The price is a bit steep for a student. 

Is the new water pump/radiator flush a sensible sounding fix for this and most importantly is this something I can do myself? I understand that I would have to remove a timing belt as well to access the pump?

The transmission is also a pressing issue as I like taking it into some steeper areas of the country (New Zealand)
I am able to source parts fairly easily as I have done some basic repairs on other cars before and know my way around a junk yard.

* Crank position sensor code - replaced as well as cam sensor

* Check for spark - nothing.  
* Had ignition coils tested - they are fine

I have yet to pull the codes again.  We have investigated the wiring to the coil on plug caps and repaired some that was slightly damaged.  I will go over it more today but I thought I'd cast a line out and see what you guys think!

It was a hose clamp that was previously holding an exhaust heat shield, that had come loose and was rattling on the exhaust pipe. I replaced the hose clamp with a new one, secured it and went about my life.

I have 2000 Nissan Maxima (88K) which won’t start. The car has been sitting outside on the street for a month now and it’s pretty cold here in Philadelphia. Now my car won’t start. I put the keys in and turn, the dashboard lights come on but I don’t hear anything from there. While it may be a battery issue I have strong feeling it’s not. 

Sometime ago I got a check engine light on and when I showed it to the mechanic he told me there was a ""p0420 CAT Effic Below Threshold (Bank 1)"" error code. He said that I would need to change my catalytic converter and O2 sensors. He gave me a huge bill but the light turned off so I didn’t get the problem fixed (there wasn’t any drop in my fuel efficiency and I’m a poor college kid). The light had come back on right before I let the car sit outside for month outside.

Now I’m going to AutoZone to check my battery but if it isn’t the battery is there any way I can get my car to start? Thanks again!

UPDATE: It was indeed the battery. It was completely gone. Bought a new one and everything is fine now. Thank you all for your helpful advice. Your guys are awesome!

- If I reverse spin the belts/pulleys coming off the alternator a full rotation, and try to start the car, it attempts to turn over a bit more than above but results in the ""clang"".

Car has tough time idling when it's cold outside, and when the engine is half-cooled from bring hot. 

**Long version:**

I turn on car, sometimes car has a tough time starting/idling when it's below 40 outside, but when it's warm, it runs fine. However, after it gets warm, when I turn the car off and I attempt to turn it on:

*Immediately - 0.5 hours later:* The car starts fine.

*0.5 - 1.5 hours later:* Starts, but I get misfires, eventually leading to engine halt. Car won't start after that. Basically, if I go somewhere, I have to either leave immediately, or commit to being there for 2 hours.

*1.5+ hours later:* The car starts fine.

I consistently get the same timings each time I start the car. If I try to start it right before half an hour has passed, it will idle rough, but I'll bounce the accelerator and eventually it sounds fine.

I also get a ton of random error codes, but the one that shows up consistently is (I think) P0300: Multiple Misfire Detected.

I've now spent a ton of money on shop and home repairs. Shop did a fuel system cleaning (but didn't replace the fuel filter itself, which I though was weird?), and replaced all spark plugs and spark plug wiring. ($650) Then the car wouldn't start at all. Took it back to shop, they said both the alternator and battery were dead. Wanted to charge me more ($350) for it. I said fuck that, got a jump starting pack ($80), and was able to get my car home.

Bought alternator, and in middle of replacing it, discovered *someone* had knocked the positive wire off the alternator in the car. Went ahead with replacing alternator anyhow and re-attached terminal wires correctly. No more electrical issues, and I'm not taking it back there again.

**Other potential issues:**

* Shop said battery was completely dead, but I think they were full of shit. I think my battery is fine, I don't have issues with cranking it normally. I also got a battery charger, and it appears to be holding a charge just fine. Should I get it tested anyhow? The battery's also only 18 months old.
* It's due for an oil change, nearly hit 4000 miles since last one. I'm going to handle that myself, but I don't think that's my problem since I've had this car issue for over a month.
* Also, I think the last owner may have topped off the coolant with the green kind, when the manual calls for Dexcool. It doesn't look like Dexcool at least, it looks puke colored (like, mix of green and orange). I got a few bottles of coolant to try doing a complete flush myself, but I can't fit under the car to disconnect the coolant line without a jack, and I don't have a jack yet.

**PLEASE HELP!**

I've been trying to fix this car for 2 months, and inspection was due in November. I don't think it's going to pass inspection unless I can get my car to consistently start without issues.

Currently it likes to make top end noise near #4 cylinder after a weird set of circumstances occurs. When you're driving it and you put the throttle in just the right place, it starts rattling really loud, but if you dip the throttle just a tad more or completely let off the gas, it stops.
However if you gun it to WOT, it will get loud and be apparent no matter what after 3.7-4k RPMs. I'm trying to figure out what it might be and so far all I can think of was a blocked oil passage, or possibly a bad rocker arm.

Earlier tonight I drove about 15 minutes on the highway, with no problems.  When I got to my destination, I turned the car off and was waiting for other people to arrive.  Moments later, I heard a very loud noise, which at first I thought was something happening behind me outside.  Then I saw smoke rising from the hood, and realized the smoke had come from my car, and it smelled sweet.

After stepping away for a few moments to make sure I wasn't about to have my face explode, I opened the hood and notice antifreeze was everywhere, and the thick hose leading into the engine has ruptured.

What is this hose called?  What does it do?  Also, does the fact that it ruptured mean that something is wrong with my car, or could it simply be that the hose was old and gave way under the pressure.  I'm hoping I will be able to have someone replace the hose, but was just curious what other things may have caused it to rupture.

Also, I got a ride home and left my car as-is until tomorrow.  Is the antifreeze corrosive and going to damage any parts? I'd like to avoid having to have it towed, so is it possible to replace this part just to get it to a shop and have it properly evaluated by a mechanic?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.

I just got my 1998 Subaru Impreza station wagon with 220,000 miles back from the dealer (it needed a repair that my local mechanic didn't have the tools for), and they've given me a list of problems that I should check out.

I am fairly mechanically-minded and I have a local AutoZone and a Chilton's manual.  I would prefer to fix easier things myself, as I enjoy working on my car.  However, I know that some stuff is just not worth it (the repair was actually something that a friend and I tried to fix ourselves, but it didn't hold).

This is what the dealer says I should get fixed, along with their prices:

* replace leaking front and rear struts ($1700)
* align vehicle ($129)
* replace worn wiper linkage ($276)
* replace loose worn shifter U-joint ($341)
* replace leaking power steering pump ($536)
* replace leaking valve cover gaskets ($392)
* diagnose noise at front of engine ($312) - they said that they thought it might be the timing belt, but the timing belt was replaced 5,000 miles ago, according to the previous owner

The wipers are annoying but I've gotten used to them (sometimes they don't go down the last 2"").  The shifter is also loose, but I've gotten used to it.  The struts are definitely not great - the car vibrates at speeds over 85 on the expressway - but it doesn't oscillate going over bumps or anything, so I don't think they're that bad.  I am concerned about the other issues, but I'm not sure if these are really all that urgent or if the dealer is just trying to get more business.

TL;DR my car is old and has issues, what can I fix and what should I pay my mechanic / dealer to fix?

Thanks!

EDIT: The dealer actually didn't comment on the thing that annoys me the most about the car, which is that the hood release no longer pops up so I need a buddy to catch and hold the hood open after I pull the lever if I want to check anything.  Minor problem, I guess :)

DOUBLE EDIT:  Thanks very much for all of the feedback!

Since the struts are so expensive, I think I'm going to wait until they're a little older before attempting to replace them (the car barely bounces when I do the jump-off-the-back-bumper test).  I'll be nicer to my suspension in the future, though.  I may take it to our local suspension / brake place to see what they say about the struts and the alignment just to be safe.

I found a few links online that show how to replace the worn shifter U-joint - apparently I can get the whole knuckle for about $60 and it's an afternoon repair.

I also found some links about tightening up the windshield linkage - it also looks like an afternoon repair.

I haven't noticed any issues with my power steering, so I'm going to wait until it becomes more of an issue.  The pump is expensive and power steering is mostly nice to have.

I'm also going to wait to replace the valve gaskets because they aren't leaking oil, and my mechanical engineer friend is busy but will be sad if I do it without him.

I've been restoring a '66 Ford Mustang for two years. It's going to be a daily driver, so I swapped the steering system over to a power rack and pinion (specifically, the Unisteer kit). The rack drives great but I have had countless issues with the pump the kit uses (Low-flow version of the GM Type II Pump, otherwise known as the TC pump). I have been through THREE pumps within ~1000mi. Every time that I kill the pump, it's the flow control valve. It seems very prone to getting stuck (both open and closed) and usually requires me to take the pump apart to poke at it until it pops back into its normal postion. I have pulled it out before to examine the edges of the valve for burrs; there are usually some, which I file / sand down very carefully. After that the valve will work again for awhile usually, but it never stays working. I am running an oil filter in the return line to ensure that particles stay out of the system but I'm not sure if it's working. Entire system has been flushed multiple times and it's still being an ass to me.

I was gone this summer for a job. When I left the power steering was not working and had been working intermittently for the past week; when I got back the power steering was working again. I have no idea how long it'll last this time. Does anyone have any ideas about what I could do to make the pump more reliable and keep the valve from sticking for good? Any ideas, good or bad, are appreciated. I need to keep using this type of pump due to engine bay restrictions, lack of fabrication skills, and rack operation requirements.

Thanks in advance!",,False,,t5_2s47e,False,,,True,t3_ymbhu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/ymbhu/long_shot_any_ideas_on_fixing_power_steering_pump/,

Mine is a bit more metallic than ""squeaky"")

I drove my car into work this morning with no trouble (and didn't hear any sound) but after going over a bit of a bump in the parking lot I started hearing a noise quite similar to the one in the video.  I didn't have too much time to check it out because I was already running late, but I just did a quick visual inspection thinking it was possibly a loose dust cover or something.  Everything looked fine, however.

I suspect either a bad wheel bearing or bad CV joint.  I guess it could also be worn brakes but I didn't notice an increase in noise as I was braking (noise seemed louder during turns). 

I'm not too sure what to do here.  Obvious first reaction would be to take it to a mechanic, but I don't really have much time as I'll be driving 500 miles next week (I'm Interning outside of Boston, MA and need to drive back to Buffalo, NY and my lease ends next week so I don't have many options here).  Clearly, if either the wheel bearing or CV Joints are bad I don't exactly want to drive that distance as the chance of death is something I'd like to avoid at this point in my life.

Any tips for troubleshooting this problem?  I'm not very car savvy but I'd like to at least have a good idea what the problem is before taking it to a mechanic (which is probably the safest route to go).

Any help/advice/requests for more info would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT - I feel like I should mention this: my apartment parking lot SUCKS.  No matter how slowly I drive over it, I ALWAYS hit the pavement with the bottom of my car (the pavement slope is way too big).  This is another reason I was suspecting CV or something else axle-related.  I have been living here for 5 months so EVERY time I enter the parking lot this happens.

If I put the car in neutral I can rev it up just fine; it's only when it's in Drive that it has an issue.  Taking it out of overdrive and back in has no noticable effect at this point; nor does putting it into low gear.  I am frustrated because the mechanics can't 1) replicate the issue (they don't want to drive on the Interstate for 3 hours) and 2) there is no service engine light, so no computer code.  Anyone have any idea what could be going on?  I am not a mechanic of any sort; I just really want to get this fixed.

One major chain auto repair store quoted $580-$600 for the job. Another chain (attached to a larger chain department store, ahem) quoted her $455. Another, local, putatively trustworthy shop looked at it and at first thought it was only the bolt that needed replacing, which was a relief for her at the time -- she paid about $100 and drove off the same day, only to find that the symptoms came back. Returned to the local shop and they found, indeed, that the rear struts needed replacing - which raises the secondary question of whether they should take some responsibility for not having properly diagnosed the problem in the first place, or at least credit her some portion of the $100 she already paid. The local guys are also quoting her about $600.

I'm specifically wondering if these amounts sound reasonable (about $455 to $600); if anyone has ideas on how to get a better price on the job; and whether with a standard set of tools (the kind that a very casual handyman would have) and whatever else could be rented or borrowed, we could do this ourselves and for cheaper.

The previous owner was driving it to work one day when his instrument cluster and various electronics began to go nuts. Smoke began to emanate from the dashboard and the car stalled out, leaving him stuck on the side of the road.

He brought it to a dealer (before he gave it to my dad) and was told that the instrument cluster was shot and he needed a new one which would cost about $1300 to install. The previous owner didn't want to pay up and offered the car to my dad (who is very talented when it comes to vehicle repair), knowing he'd probably be able to fix the issue.

My father sent the instrument cluster out to be fixed to Module Masters. They weren't able to repair the cluster so we acquired a used one off of eBay and brought it to the dealer where they were able to override the security issues involved with swapping clusters. Once that was resolved the car ran like a dream...for 3 months. We got her back on the road in December.

Fast forward to today:

I was heading back from my college with my roommates and whilst on the highway, I accelerated and all of the lights on the cluster began to glow incredibly bright and then suddenly all electrical power was lost. The gauges began to go crazy as well and, as what happened with the old owner, smoke began to pour out of the dashboard and the car died leaving us stranded on the side of the road.

Both clusters (the old one and the one we got on eBay) have around 140,000 miles on them and the car itself has probably closer to 150,000 miles.

My friend has a 2003 Ford Focus. Great maintenance, etc, etc, about 111k miles on it. He uses the AC religiously. As in if it's not extremely cold in Winter (Los Angeles, so it rarely is,) he has it on, oftentimes at full blast.

Here's the issue: refrigerant (presumably) keeps leaking out. At least, that's what we're assuming. He took it to a dealer he really likes (although I do not) and they charged him an arm and a leg to inject fluorescent dye into the system and look for a leak with a UV light. They claimed they couldn't find one, recharged the system and charged him ~$300.

Less than 3-6 months later, the cooling is back to blowing barely cool air. Stand outside and you can hear the compressor clutch engaging over and over and over. Clearly, no refrigerant and/or poor pressure.

Question. What is going on? is this a known issue for this model, or is the dealer useless and incompetent? I've heard you can buy kits to inject the dye yourself for roughly $15. Is this true? Do they come with a light?

Should we just refill with refrigerant and wait to see what happens again?

He claims the AC in this car has never worked as well as his other cars, so this may be a long-standing issue. Could there be something other than a leak that's causing the refrigerant to become depleted and/or pressure to drop off?

1324070226.0,9,self.Cartalk,nflrj,"I've seen a few posts regarding winter tires, what about snow chains?",9,0,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/nflrj/ive_seen_a_few_posts_regarding_winter_tires_what/,"So  I've done a fair amount of winter/snow driving, but never in my own car before. I'm going to be visiting the Sierra's a few times this year, and snow tires won't be practical for these trips, so I'm looking into various types of chains/cables, and I haven't really been able to get a whole lot of information on how they work. So this is what I have gathered so far, and a few particular questions I have, in the hope that someone else looking for information might find this useful.

Types of chains:

1. Cable chains. Probably the most common type, they have little coiled wires or something out that sort around a cable. Example: http://scc-chain.com/Traction%20Pages/Trac_ZChain.html

2. Link Chains. Similar to above, but actual chains. Example: http://scc-chain.com/Traction%20Pages/Trac_QGLT.html

3. Diamond Chains: Same as above, but a changed pattern that looks to me like it would offer more lateral resistance. Example: http://scc-chain.com/Traction%20Pages/Trac_WS.html

4. Some New Type of Chains. I just learned about these ones when I started looking stuff up online. The basic story with them is that you bolt some sort of thing onto your lug studs at home, and then attach the chain contraption to that thing when you actually put it on. The advantage seems to be that it's easy to install, and they look like they would really bite into ice. I'm curious about how well they grip the tires though. Since they aren't held on from the inside I'm curious as to whether the tires could slip off them with enough pressure from the side, such as in a skid. They're also pretty expensive. Example: http://www.thule.com/en-US/US/Products/Snow-Chains/SnowChains/Thule-K_-_Summit

Class S is required for most cars. The class is defined by how far the chains extend out from the wheels, and if it's too big then it will scrape against the wheel wells etc.

Tire chains are either self tightening or need to readjusted after you drive a hundred feet or so. Self tightening means that they use stretchy rubber loops with clips to keep the chains tight, which tend to wear out. If they need to be readjusted you need to stop twice.

Chains go on your drive wheels. If you want extra braking power and stability when stopping, you can put them on all four wheels.

What is really difficult about my search, I think, is that there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of data you can use to make a meaningful comparison, even between differing products from the same manufacturer. The durability of chains, their stopping power, relative traction of various chains, I haven't been able to find any information on any of that, besides sifting through reviews reviews on Amazon. So does anyone know of any good resources where I could get that kind of information? Or, does anyone have an opinion of the relative strengths of the various types or a certain chain in particular?

Also, I've heard some complaints about various chain types scuffing up wheels and rubbing on the sides of the tires. Does anyone know anything about potential wear to the tires from certain chain types?

* my car-savvier friend says the muffler is nearly rusted through.  A new one costs about $125.

I'm planning a few repairs to my 1993 Camry(i4 engine, drums in the back) next week while I have a week off. One of the repairs will be replacing all 4 struts and springs. Original shocks still at 135,000 miles. The ride is pretty bad and the front drivers side spring is actually broken.   

Figure I might as well replace all four springs with the struts. I was going to use Monroe QuickStruts for the convenience. The other option is getting springs and shocks separately, but I have no interest in dealing with putting the spring on myself so I would have to have a shop do it. Are the quickstruts fine quality wise or should I get something else and have them put together for me?  

My main question is what else should I replace while I have everything taken apart. I know I need to replace the sway bar bushings on my car, so I will definitely do that. What else would be prudent to replace at this time. I want to do this all at once and then get it aligned(I assume thats necessary after this work?) so missing some small part and having to take it back apart in 10,000 miles would be a pain.

I believe that I have too much compression inside my engine. While it is not excessive, oil tends to be pushed out of it occasionaly from gaskets.

I have an air/oil separator, connected to my engine, that is supposed to let air pass into it and into the ignition through a hose while it filters oil and let's it drop back into the engine.

Thing is, this separator is probably not very good anymore, since every year or so I notice the hose that leads from it to the admission has some gunky oil in it.

If I disconnected the hose from the separator to the admission would the pressure inside the engine decrease?

I ask because money is very tight, and while the leak isn't enormous, I still have to add 2 or 3 liters every OCI (6k miles currently, plan to change to 9k with full synthetic).

It's been dying by itself, and has NO power when I've taken it for a little drive. Currently I'm running straight exhaust manifolds. It starts up real quick but runs really rough unless I rev it to ~4000. I'm starting to think that the valves are overtightened. I am running harland sharp roller rockers, when I was installing them, I set them to zero lash, then a half turn more. I noticed this was opening the valves, so I loosened them up a little bit, rotated engine by hand, and continued slowly tightening all of them until they weren't wobbly anymore, repeated this until they all seemed good, and locked them down via poly locks. Anyways, it runs terribly, and was hoping for some advice. The engine is freshly rebuilt, nothing too extreme, it has roller rockers / lifters / 270HR comp cam, thats about it. I don't have a timing mark indicator on the block, but I know it's pretty nuts on. The only thing I can think of is a valvetrain issue. I thought it was strange that the additional 1/2 turn on the rockers would open the valves. Any advice? I noticed a select few of the cylinders are burning hotter than the other ones by feeling the manifold ports, which again makes me think its the valves. Vacuum is low (although I expected pretty low vac at idle with this cam.) I can keep it at 1000 RPM with my foot barely on the gas, runs rough, but steady. I removed the valve covers and noticed if I shook hard enough, a few of the rockers would move, the others were rock solid. When I took it for a drive I could floor it and gain almost no speed, running rough the whole time. Again, I'm stumped here. Any help would be greatly appreciated, feel free to ask any questions, thanks!

EDIT: Adjusted the rockers, running pretty solid now, still very low vacuum, power brakes only come alive at ~2000 RPM, shifts into 2nd way too late (again with the vacuum). I'll try and retime via vacuum gauge and keep you guys posted. If anyone found this also having issues with the valves opening when adjusting the roller rockers, the valves WILL open slightly when you give it the additional half turn. Lock them. The lifters will bleed a little and settle down. I can now shake all my roller rockers side to side slightly, no up and down movement, it's running well. Driving like shit, but running well.

This weekend, I replaced the brake pads, put new clips on the caliper mounts, with grease. I went for a drive, the sound was gone! Until I drove further. Now instead of immediate, it takes about 20 mins of driving until the noise appears. I'm confused. 

I'm guessing it's a wheel bearing, and I wasted $60 on brake pads and clips. 

Looking around, it appears that the complete assembly is about $100, but I don't know how intense it is to replace the assembly. I don't have a press, so changing just the bearing isn't an option. I have pulled engines and replaced head gaskets. Just asking for an opinion on how hard the change is before I drop the money. Or if the scraping noise could be something else.

It started when I was accelerating onto the interstate, I was taking the on-ramp fast staying at about 5.5k RPM in 2nd gear, and when the bend straightened out, I stepped on the gas to accelerate to match speed with the traffic. Once I stepped on the gas, the engine bumped, hiccuped for a second, and I shifted up into 3rd immediately. I smelt a burning smell, more of rubber than smoke, but that went away quickly. The engine light came on as I shifted into 3rd.

 I stopped the car, checked out the engine, no visible damage, no detectable change in performance, so I went to get the engine code from Autozone the next day. Comes out as ""VTEC malfunction."" It's been driving fine, so I just reset the engine light, thinking it was a one time thing with no permanent damage.

However, now (and here's the strange part) , the engine has performance issues, but only under specific circumstances. The issue is the powerband will just disappear, as in I can feel steady increase in acceleration until I hit about 6k RPM, then it just all goes away, and the engine starts to make a very different noise. The noise matches the engine sound, but it's a lot higher pitched.

The weird part is, this only happens when I'm in 1st gear and have 100% throttle. Otherwise, the powerband is smooth and everything is fine. But if I'm in 1st gear and flooring it, once I hit ~6k RPM, the engine gets really loud, adds a lot higher pitched noise, and all the power just disappears. The torque/power when it malfunctions is similar to the torque/power I'd get out of 5th gear at 2.5k RPM. 

Anyone have any ideas to what could be causing this strange issue?

Engine still has no problems, but things are starting to fail in other areas. My goal is for the car to last 1.5-2 more years until I pay off my student debt, then get a new car. I would like to avoid any repairs that aren't necessary, but I don't want to ignore the brakes.

Currently the brakes feel a little soft and the pedal reaches the bottom when pressed moderately hard. The car has always required pressing a little harder than modern cars, but has always stopped confidently until recently.  The car failed inspection about 6 months ago for the brakes ""not holding"". The mechanic cleaned and inspected the brakes. After adjusting the drum brakes(rear) by spinning the wheel the car passed. This mechanic and the toyota dealer both said the pads and shoes have life left. Right after this adjustment it felt better, and there was less pedal travel. Since then the problem has slowly returned. 

I ran a quick test by accelerating to 45 mph in an empty parking lot a few times and braking as hard as possible. The tires squealed and the car stopped hard, but the wheels did not lock up as best I could tell(no skid marks, and it just didn't feel like they did). I have high quality tires that are not old on the car. I assume the brakes should be able to lock the wheels at speed if to the floor(I know this is not what I would want when actually braking).

I am considering the following fixes:

    1) Tighten the adjuster on the drums about once a month to keep tight.

    2) Replace brake fluid(not done in at least 7 years)

    3) Replace pads and shoes, perhaps with more aggressive compound.

I am looking advice on which of these to try, and how much I could expect them to help, or any others things to try. Also is my expectation that I should have to press very hard to get the pedal to hit the floor correct? 

TLDR: Soft brakes, cheapest safe and reliable fix?

Bonus question: Timing belt last changes at 60,000 miles, is it worth it to change again at 130,000 when I'm only trying to get 2 more years out of the car. I probably average 9,000 to 11,000 miles a year.

First, I just want to say that owning a Camry is new to me. However, I do also own a 94 4Runner with over 216,000 miles!

The Camry I just bought a couple of weeks ago now has 50,755 miles on it.

Anyway, I noticed about 3 drops of oil on my garage floor today. Knowing it needed an oil change, I purchased some new synthetic and filter. When I jacked it up, I saw something that I have never seen before on a vehicle. It appears that oil is leaking somewhere above the oil pan, and running down. Timing chain cover, perhaps?

I've tried to take as many pictures as I could. All of these are on the back side of the oil pan, on the lip above the oil plug. It appears that there's some type of waxy substance that doesn't look like any oil I've ever seen that has dried. I placed some cardboard under the engine, and left it running for 10 minutes to see if it would leak, and there were no drips. So, it appears that it only happens when the car is driving.

I've searched Google, and I am aware of the stripped head bolt problem that the engine has. However, it hasn't lost a single drop of coolant in the month that I've owned it. For the moment, it appears to be a slow oil leak.


All of these pictures are from the rear passenger side of the oil pan, looking up at the engine.

It is still making the jerking movement/clunking noise when going from Reverse to Drive. Any other ideas what it might be?**

Hello,

I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with my Honda Accord, 123K miles (I bought it used at 94K, a little under 2 years ago, if that matters). It is not a v6. I drive a lot, and keep up with my oil changes. Recently I had the steering rack replaced and the exhaust system replaced.

When I pull out of a parking spot in reverse, then shift into drive, the car will jerk forward and sometimes make a noise that is like a clunk. 

It has been doing this for a while, but was only sporadic, so I did not think it was a big deal. However lately it has been happening more often and the clunk sound is louder. 

I read some various forums online, and it seems like it might be related to my transmission fluid. I plan to check it in the morning (too dark out now). 

My question(s) are: 
 
* If it is low fluid, is this something I should have replaced? Do I need to just have it drained and replaced, or do I need to have it flushed? 
* Is it worth doing this (I see some people say NOT to change the fluid)? Will it help my situation?
* Is it most likely better if I just pay someone to do this, as I have pretty much no experience with cars beyond changing a flat tire? (I really am worried about doing more harm than good on my own)

About 6 months ago I bought my used Subaru Outback at 130,000 miles. It seemed to be in good condition and I had my mechanic check it out prior to buying it. About 1.5 months ago, I started my car and experienced shuddering and shaking and a quiet-ish squealing noise. It soon righted, and my engine started acting normal. I took it to o'Reilly's and had them check it out. The code said it was a Cylinder 3 and 4 misfire. Since then it has happened a few more times, and just a couple days ago it was really bad, and stalled my car out twice, and made a squealing noise and was very slow, sluggish. After about a minute, it stopped and I took it to my mechanic and left it with him to diagnose. Unfortunately, he was unable to diagnose the problem. He drove it, put it up on the rack and didn't find a problem. He told me that it might be the head-gasket leaking coolant into the cylinder, and that plus replacing the timing belt, would be a $4000 job. Also, we would have to wait for it to get worse before correctly diagnosing it. 

My other problem, is when I took my car in to the dealer for the free oil change, they said I had some leaks, transmission pan, oil pan, and steering rack leak, the dealer wants me to finance over a $1000 to get that done. At my mechanic's, he said all of those were 'seeps' and not major leaks to be addressed right now. 

My last problem is this, when I start the car in the morning, all is good until I turn the wheel to move. At this point it is squealing (not horrendously loud but noticeable) and it stops after a minute or so. Mechanic said this might be a belt. 

So for my questions, is replacing the head-gasket and timing belt really a $4000 job? It will be very difficult for me to come up with that amount of money. 
When the engine misfires like that, what should I do? Should I shut the car off and wait? Should I try to give it the gas? 
Is this engine misfire affecting my fuel economy? 
Since this engine misfire is so sporadic, how can we diagnose the problem?
Is the squealing in the morning something to worry about?
My mechanic told me that my catalytic converter has a light code in the system, could possibly go bad sometime. Do I had a bad car in my hands? This is my first car, so it seems really expensive. I paid $5600 for it used at a Nissan Dealership. 
I am somewhat mechanically inclined, but I am also a broke single mother trying to get by, so I don't really have the resources to fix my own car. I am thinking I should try and buy a older Honda or something as a backup... 

Thanks for your time or advice. 

Edited to Add:
Thank you all for your responses. I am going to read more about replacing the head gasket. I forgot to say - my mechanic is different than the dealer where I got the oil change and they told me about leaks. Also - about 3 months ago I got a tune up done by my mechanic.

I recently took a trip, and the Jeep sat for ~10 days.  Previously it was driven every day for 3 years.  

Driving home the car started right up.  I drove home in the dark (headlights on).  As I got home (about an hour away) the dash lights started to pulse slightly.

When I got out, the car lost all electric power.  The dome light wouldnt come on.  The car wont start.  

Putting a multi-meter on the battery shows 12.10 volts.  When you turn the key, the voltage doesn't change, but absolutely nothing happens inside the car (no dash lights, no door chimb).  

The car can be jump started, and it keeps running (12.4 volts while ""running"").  All accessories work just fine.  But if you turn the car off, it loses all power again.  

The battery is about 3 months old.  Is it dead?   As the car keeps running after it being jumped, I assume the alternator is working (and providing the power), even though the voltage at the battery is low (&lt; 14 volts, which I would expect to see off a normal healthy car).

And is my ABS in use?,9,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1ffaxy/1992_volvo_240_master_cylinder_replacement_can_i/,"I found a [nice how-to](http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+1986-1993+Volvo+240+Brake+Master+Cylinder/8631/1) with good pictures, and this job looks pretty simple. Their master cylinder has the same part number as mine, so it should be an identical process. I *believe* my car has ABS (has the light on the dash), but looking at pictures of the ABS and non-ABS units on O'reilley's site, the [ABS model](http://i.imgur.com/VtmvyMP.png) has an extra outlet on the right (driver's) side that the [non-ABS model](http://i.imgur.com/hhIMyKx.png) does not have. Now my car is most likely an ABS vehicle and has the extra outlet on the right side of the cylinder. But if you [zoom in on this pic](http://i.imgur.com/UkjdCss.jpg) you can see that the extra outlet is simply closed off by a bolt, and there is also an extra outlet on the reservoir that is capped off (visible in the pic). So was my ABS system deleted at one point in time? I guess it is worth it to note that the ABS light does come on with the key and go away when I start the car, which would indicate a functional system.

My other question is about replacing the reservoir. In the how-to, they replace the entire unit including the reservoir. Am I going to be able to reuse mine? It save me well over $100 on the price of the part.

However, I want to know what I need to start looking for. I don't  feel like it is a common occurrence for cars to simply be working wonderfully one minute and have the engine and transmission drop out onto the road the next.

The video linked above is of the dash displaying the fault codes and the code reading instructions are listed [here](http://www.pelicanparts.com/bmw/techarticles/Mult-Code_Reading/Mult-Code_Reading.htm) if interested.

Quick story:

My 1994 3 series started sluggishly but turned over without a fight, I started driving and within 3-4 minutes had a random loss of engine power (felt like i was only running on some cylinders) but it was a breif ""hickup"" of an issue, about 5 minutes later i noticed the ""loss"" again and then it started to happen more often with more of a ""power loss"" each time until it finally died. 

Sob story:

Woke up on Saturday morning @ 6am to take girlfriend and daughter to the airport, its now around 8am on Sunday and I have not slept yet. It may be lack of sleep making me have difficulty understanding/translating the fault code/codes but im running out of patience/time.

Please any help would be much appreciated, I am also about to go and test all the relay pins to check to see if its a relay issue or crank position sensor issue.

I am dying to atleast diagnose it so i can sleep.

Please and thank you.

I can get into details about how the car was acting during ""its last drive"" when it broke down if it'll help and i do all the maintenance on the car so i can give pretty damn near exact info on history.


***UPDATE 1***

All 4 pins on the fuse panel for the fuel pump relay are functioning correctly, seems to rule out a main relay and the crank position sensor as faults, currently checking if any of the other relays are interchangeable with the fuel pump relay to see if its the fuel relay.


***UPDATE 2***

Removed the fuel pump relay and directly connected the always hot pin to the power to the fuel pump pin via a wire and checked the voltage to the power connector at the fuel pump itself, reads 12.2v and the ground works. Plugged it into the pump and gave it a minute to fully prime the engine and tried cranking. Nothing, fuel pump relay and all dependencies seem good. On to spark? did a quick spark check roadside and seemed to have it but hey, again, no sleep i could me imagining things.

***UPDATE 3***

Still finishing up the fuel filter replacement (I had one on my shelf of new parts/spare parts, the receipt dates it around 2 months after i bought the car so i apparently had planned at one point to replace it but forgot. After pulling out the old filter (massive PITA in the early e36's BTW) it had the BMW logo on it so im thinking there is a good chance its still the original seeing as this car sat for years before i bought it. I decided to see what would happen if i ran some water through the inlet end of the filter and nothing would come out of the other end so I am assuming that ""the perfect storm"" so to say happened with the crap in my gas where it was just building up at the right time to do this to me.

First post here, can you help? Video of problem above.

- 4 weeks ago my car wouldn't start - see video - I would crank it, very rough idle, and it would stall almost immediately. Left it overnight, next morning it started.
- After 5km driving, stalled while driving.
- Towed to mechanic, said oil had leaked through gasket cover, into spark plugs,  changed gasket cover, 6 spark plugs. Car started.
- Drove car 15 km. Brought back home.
- Car stalled while driving again, brought to mechanic in evening, next morning it started. mechanic tried to reproduce, couldn't.
- Drove car 350 km / 2 weeks.
- Last night, won't start. I took the video tonight. In the video, the rough idle only happens 1-2 seconds. Before it could sometimes happen for 30-45 second/until I apply gas (in neutral) or just stall right away.

I've done a bit of research and I've sorted the items here under my understanding of seriousness, with the less pressing matters lower down.

* Front shocks very soft, recommend replace.
* Rear brake pads uneven and low rotors close to minimum.
* Rear shocks leaking.
* Front brake pads low and rotors undersize.
* Castor rod bushes starting to split.
* Top radiator hose coolant seepage.

Those were the things that had me the most concerned. They also reported the following.

* Found coolant stains around water pump.
* Brake fluid flush.
* Tyre (3) replacement and alignment.
* Airbag light has come on.

 * I believe this is from the driver's front right door.

* Engine wash to diagnose minor oil leaks
* Number plate globe not working (I think they meant parking light)

I parked both in December, and in March-April I got around to staring them back up.  The 89 was fine, and started after hooking the battery back up. The 91 started first turn after a charge and ran for 30 or so seconds.

Then the trouble started.

It started to miss/chug/exhaust was smelling like fuel. It wouldn't run for shit, then it would die.

I pushed it around, added some FI cleaner I had lying around, and got it started again.  It ran fine for a few minutes before starving itself of fuel again and sputtering out. 

I'm pretty sure my fuel is bad at this point.  I heard tell of a magical elixir that can be added to the gas after the fact to help this situation.  I would like to avoid draining the tank, as it has 6-7 gallons in it that I have no where to put.

I'm going to do the fuel filter as a regular maintenance item as it is, but if there is a product I might be able to use to help with the gas, it would be greatly appreciated.

My rear brakes didn't work for a long time. Took it to a shop for something unrelated, they found illegal fittings on the brake lines and replaced the whole line system (I took it to a chop shop a bunch of years ago because I was broke and had leaky brake lines). They thought the calipers had seized, but after I drove it they started working again! Unfortunately for me, the rotors were covered in deep rust and when the brakes started working, it chipped the rust off leaving gaps that also tore apart the brake pads.

A couple days ago, after struggling with getting the ancient parts off, I finally replace my rotors and pads. The calipers turned back in just fine, luckily for me. I didn't really know/forgot to spray brake cleaner on the rotors, but I did wipe them off (maybe not enough). Anyway, now while I'm driving, I hear a bit of a squeak coming from the back. When I stop the sound changes a bit, but it's still a squeak-like noise. Could this be because I left too much of that oil on the rotors?

I created my proper coolant mix and filled up my reservoir at the proper level. From here is where I have problems.

My Haynes instructions say “to wait five minutes and recheck the coolant level in the radiator, adding if necessary.” Well the coolant level in my reservoir hasn’t gone down at all. With my heat on in my car and the radiator cap / reservoir cap off, I then run the engine. After the first time of doing this it starts to smoke after a minute or two. And the same thing occurs after a couple other times. Sometimes there is no smoke from the engine at all when I start my engine (this is all from the driveway, I am not driving this car of course). But nevertheless the problem is that the coolant level in the reservoir is not going down, ie it is not being sucked into the engine, when hopefully the thermostat opens up. There is not any leaking and all hoses are on tight so there does not seem to be any air leak ie there is a tight air seal. When I continually squeeze the upper rad hose I see the coolant level in the reservoir fall and rise and I can feel some coolant flow through the rad hose. On one occasion bubbles did come out of the reservoir while the engine was running.

He swears nothing happened besides just going offroad, but I've inspected the car as much as I can normally and can't find anything obviously wrong with it.

Here's the problem: When the car is in motion, it sounds as if something is rotating with the tires and brushing/lightly scraping something else. It is in time with the tire rotations. It is while driving, so I know it's not my brake pads. It might be one of the belts need re-adjustment, but I'm no mechanic. A friend suggested the dynamo might be going out because when I get to high speeds (60-75mph) the sound is very faint or not there. But I don't know why it would keep in time with the tire rotations if it was the dynamo.

So I bought a Datsun 240Z on craigslist a while ago and have been problems starting it.
This runs on a 2.4L carbureted engine, and this is what has been happening for the past few weeks:

Start car for first time. Oops forgot to change dead battery and attach coil + cable to coil.

Start car: It turns and starts within 1-2 seconds, but upon letting go of ignition, the car automatically dies. 

Apply Starting fluid and repeat

- Keep doing until a carb (2 stock su roundtop) floods. oops

Rebuild Carbs

- Take everything apart
- Boil in degreaser (simple green + water)
- Put back together with rebuild kit

Put cleaned carbs back on car

- car does same thing: Starts then stalls after letting go of ignition
- Carb floods after many attempts

My friend and I determine the float bowl setting is off, but we don't really know how to rebuild it so it gets sent to a carburetor shop

Since only one was flooding, only one was rebuilt.

- Piston was determined to be warped so it was fixed
- Float level adjusted

Put back on car, car does same thing. This time, the other carburetor floods

- Random event: not getting spark from plugs
- Determine coil to be malfunctioning


Currently: Getting another coil and sending other carb to shop

The main problem is the fact that the car starts for 1 second, and dies RIGHT after, practically within 1 second of the car starting. Also, one carb keeps flooding instead of not allowing more fuel. 

What could be the problem?
