1373310034.0,463,self.CubeWorld,1hvqub,"PSA: A reminder of what ""ALPHA"" means.",575,112,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hvqub/psa_a_reminder_of_what_alpha_means/,"**TL;DR** We knew going in what we purchased, if you didn't, you should have done more homework. Game is not finished. If someone posts an exploit, do not shame them. That is counter productive for a bugless finished product. You want bugs and exploits posted and shared so that they will be ironed out later. Class balance will be one of the LAST things touched, get used to it. Small game tweaks and what we perceive as ""obvious errors"" are often not obvious.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is normally common knowledge that Alpha builds of games, and software for that matter, are unfinished frameworks of what they are eventually going to become. Yet, a majority of the posts I see on this sub currently(aside from screenshots) are: ""Why things so obviously unbalanced for class X"" ""Don't exploit, that's cheating."" ""Wollay, why you not think of this OBVIOUS simple game design change"".


In an alpha, the main focus of the dev is going to be adding more content and expanding the game as a whole (when he's not trying to fix a busted ddos'd server).
Our job as Alpha TESTERS (Even though we bought into it, that's what we are) is to communicate our ideas and thoughts to the dev from what we've experienced. Wollay may or may not listen to it. He has already expressed his vision and that he isn't going to wander too far from it, if at all. Something you would know and understand and not be butt hurt about if you've been following the game for the past few years.


Most importantly though, as alpha testers, we should be actively trying to break the game. We should be using the exploits, repeating them, finding more, all the while making a list of these issues to pass along to the dev. Examples of this are the known crossbow exploit, retreat climbing/gliding, the ability to equip a two hand and one hand weapon and get stats from both, etc etc.


When these things are pointed out they are met with disdain and a holier than though attitude. ""I cannot believe you would exploit that. You shouldn't exploit things, that's cheating.""


If you want to play the game straight, awesome. More power to you, but for me and many others that understand what it means to be an alpha tester, I will be exploiting the hell out of everything I can find.


In terms of class balance: Wollay has said that there will be more classes and races so balance will probably not be coming along until late alpha or early beta after he adds more content. This is pretty standard for ANY game.


In regards to oversights: This happens in all things. The best thing you can do about it is not be so incredulous when you point out one of these oversights or exploits. This is an early open alpha, they are going to be all over the place.


The moral: stop pooping on the parades of people who Don't play the game like you do. This goes both ways.

""June 23 (I think he meant July), 2013  
- Added an option to limit the frame rate  (see options menu: FPS limit; default 111 fps)  
- Ranger ability 'Scout's switftness' doesn't crash on multiplayer servers anymore  
- Ranger ability 'Retreat' doesn't increase hang gliding speed anymore  
- The crossbow's right mouse button ability now only does damage when charged  
- You can now reset the day in inns only between 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.  
- Fixed a bug where multiplayer groups received too much XP for missions""

TL;DR - Rangers no longer reign supreme in the air or the ground, inns work like they should and CW now comes with at least 83% less power-levelling and computer-melting frame rates!

1373892099.0,258,self.CubeWorld,1ic3ug,So after leveling all classes up to at least 30...,288,30,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1ic3ug/so_after_leveling_all_classes_up_to_at_least_30/,"So as the title suggests, I've went ahead and leveled up everything to 30/31 as a means to get a basic understanding of each class and their play styles, and also pick my personal favorite. The reason I only went to 30 is I obtained gear on my level 42 so when they hit 30 they got blue/purple/yellows if I want to continue playing them.

 I figured I'd share my experience with each of the classes, though this is going to be very bias because I'm not exactly the best player and should be taken with a grain of salt.

- [Ranger](http://i.imgur.com/CMkjM6A.jpg): This is where the bias comes into effect (figured I'd get this out the way first), I've already got a 40+ ranger, and I still just adore playing this class. Albeit from being able to go prone and snipe enemies with your bow or crossbow from ranges where they're incapable of doing anything, to getting up close and personal with a boomerang (which is what I did on this second ranger) to flying around via Super Jump (Retreat bug) and then using the glider. Granted the rogue can level at a much faster rate, but if you're clearing quests, ranger is undoubtedly the fastest, due to using the glider bug to get between key locations you can reduce your run times by about 5 - 20 minutes per inn reset. Also the boomerang gives you some prowess and a reason to get close to enemies, and not try engage them from massive ranges, as the closer you are to them, the faster you can get your boomerang out and damage them, and then bring it back to you, I found this was a brilliant idea, and allows you to mix up your play style as to make it so it won't stagnate. I can't exactly choose a preferred specialization as not being able to play scout on the majority of servers due it crashing the client, meant I leveled as a Sniper, so (in the very low amount of cases) where I wanted to go and play with friends, I wouldn't crash the server we were playing on, though if I had to choose. It would be Sniper &gt; Scout even though that's probably not the case for most others.

- [Rogue](http://i.imgur.com/TYwtes0.jpg): By far the strongest, and probably the second most enjoyable class in the game. It's hard to describe what I enjoy about this class, there's just something too it that spins it off in a enjoyable fashion. Also significantly easier to level (assuming you go ninja, and are decent and using the dodge feature) you can easily engage, fight, and kill red difficulty enemies as well as whites. You're boundless, and this killing power only goes to ramp up incredibly as you get more and more gear. I most definitely enjoy using two daggers over the other choices, it just made it feel more authentic in my opinion (though too my knowledge fist weapons are *apparently** better.) If you're just starting out or wanting a second class, definitely worth taking a look at Rogues. Preferred specialization: Ninja, the plethora of critical strikes you get are just amazing. Though Assassination has it's place if you're looking to be more subtle. 

- [Mage](http://i.imgur.com/9F5IKg6.jpg): I've got a love hate relationship with this class. They can sometimes do an incredible amount of damage, and sometimes don't do enough, and sometimes they feel incredibly durable (as Water Mage), and sometimes just die before defending yourself is an option. While water mages have no need for food, as they are capable of using healing stream to heal themselves, rather than relying on potions. And the 3 different weapon types allow you to fit roles amongst friends, you can use the ***staff*** and use the AoE to heal your group up do some moderate damage, the ***wand*** if you want to deal a fair amount of damage and do some moderate healing, and ***2 bracelets*** if you want to churn out damage, but doesn't do much healing at all. Preferred specialization is 100% Water mage, to anyone out there who can play fire successfully I tip my hat to you.

- [Warrior](http://i.imgur.com/v3SkIzf.jpg):
While being one of the more resilient classes in the game, I also found they were also lacking in terms of DPS (though their crit damage can be insane when using 2 Handed Weapons, which is what I preferred using). As the majority of us know the first 10 levels are typically the most time consuming (and sometimes even the hardest) levels to obtain, this was incredibly so in the case of **my** warrior. I found I was getting my ass handed too me by white/blues in the majority of encounters. This resulted in me having to spend more time collecting materials for potions than I did leveling up. But this doesn't go to say that I don't find them incredibly fun after level 15 or so. While feeling significantly weaker compared to it's counter parts. Nothing beats the feeling of charging head first into a pack unsuspecting travelers, using smash to knock them all over, and follow it up with cyclone to live them all pretty much dead before they can ever get up. Preferred specialization: Guardian, offers a *LOT* more survivability over berserker, at the cost of a very low amount of damage.

Well that's all I have to say, if you're wondering why it looks like I've got sets on my characters, they're not I just mixed assortments from mainly multiplayer of different power level and rarities to make it look (somewhat consistent) Also if you took the time to read all this thanks, seriously I only just realized how much there actually is.

TL;DR - *God Dammit Loch Ness Monster, I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy.* (**Ranger &gt; Rogue &gt; Mage &gt; Warrior**)

Edit; Grammar. 

Edit 2; I didn't think this would be so well received, but apparently the majority of you enjoyed reading this.

What is becoming pretty obvious during this cubeworld alpha launch and the past few weeks is that despite how amazing cubeworld looks and how strong it is for an initial alpha, Wollay has made some very obvious, bad and *avoidable* mistakes that have damaged his reputation and cubeworld and make me very fearful for cubeworld's future.

Unfortunately no matter how good a programmer Wollay is, and no matter how amazing Cubeworld looks, I think we are all kidding ourselves if we think the following months are going to be good for cubeworld and that Wollay is going to change his ways with regards to the community, his fans and how he operates cubeworld from a business point of view. Development of the game has been horrendously slow over the past few years and now that the alpha version is out I am fearful that we are going to have to wait months and months for any meaningful update or new content/features to be added to the game. I certainly have no desire to play the current alpha for more than a few hours... I just have no direction in the game and nothing to do!

Not a lot of people know this, but before the few weeks that cubeworld alpha launched wollay would go many months without any news, updates, or even communications (on websites or twitter). Quite often he would go awol during very crucial moments in the development of cubeworld and we were simply left dumbfounded as to what was going on for months at a time. As someone who has been watching and waiting for cubeworld for over 2 years, it pains me to see new cubeworld fans/players coming to terms with how wollay develops cubeworld and also how he communicates with the community (never!). I completely understand the frustration of newer people around here who see this way of developing a game and interacting with your players/fans as rude and uncaring.

Let's take a closer look at some of the really bad mistakes that have been made recently:

* Releasing a closed alpha to very privileged youtubers and famous people - completely stomping on any fans or players who has been waiting patiently for the game for the past 2 years. Some of the people who Wollay gave early access to hadn't even heard of cubeworld until this moment.

* Deciding to develop his own website infrastructure with account registration and shop and also his own game downloader and updater that was pretty obviously never going to be up to the high demand of the players yet rather than use a solid solution or other platform that is know to be capable of handling this load, he went ahead anyway.

* Refusing to accept any help from the big players or support from people who do digital distribution all the time, instead choosing to roll with his own solution to a shop and digital distribution and file hosting. After problems started to develop in the first few days, a number of very prominent people that could help him offered to help (Tiyuri of Starbound is one) but he seemed to have refused to accept help, and instead was happy to have the constant downtime, unavailable service.

* Lack of communication or visibility of what is going on. (We haven't heard anything from wollay for **over a month!**)


I love cubeworld and the game looks wonderful and really is the game I want to play and to be developed into a full and complete game, I just think the sad truth is that wollay isn't capable of taking the game to the next stage, his reluctance to accept any help from people who know what they are doing, his lack of communications/updates and the general slowness of his development process makes me believe I wont be enjoying cubeworld for a VERY VERY long time. Maybe I will come back to cubeworld in 2015 and see where things are then.

**TL;DR: Basically wollay is a great programmer and cubeworld is good so far, but it is never going to progress into a GREAT game. Wollay doesnt really care for his fans, never gives updates, development times are slow and he constantly refuses help from anyone, even high profile people who could help him solve many of the operation problems of cubeworld**

*Update: So it appears* ***over a month*** *has gone by and still no word from wollay or anyone else about this, I really am starting to get some serious doubts about this and something fishy really does seem to be going on.

1372896071.0,221,self.CubeWorld,1hlomi,"An academic discussion and criticism of the alpha launch (or ""no, these bumps probably aren't a sign of the future, and here's why"")",278,57,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hlomi/an_academic_discussion_and_criticism_of_the_alpha/,"(Note:  I've made some comments earlier that are similar to this post, but I thought maybe we could generate some more productive discussion if I made a real post.)

I'm a software developer.  I do web development as a career (some of that time was spent working on a very large and heavily trafficked site where scale issues were at the forefront), and I like to develop games as a hobby (although nothing as refined or complicated as CubeWorld).

The reason I'm posting this is to provide a counterpoint (other than ""stop being a whiny little baby"") to the [current top post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hla9q/picroma_poor_launch_choices_a_sign_of_the_future/), which speculates that this bumpy launch is a sign of a bad future.

The short answer is this:  Launches are difficult, particularly really hyped ones.  You have the perfect storm of code that hasn't been tested under real world loads, and the initial surge of players (which are likely to be the largest load the code will ever face).  Wollay is, according to his twitter, already making progress on this front.  Once the scaling issues are fixed, it seems unlikely to me that they'll ever come back in a major way.  Even if sales do eventually increase past launch levels later on, the improvements made right now should carry it through just fine.  At the very least, there will be some amount of warning of impending scaling problems, because things will most likely slow down for a while before they crash.

That being said, there are certain areas for academic criticism of how this launch has gone thus far, both from the standpoint of a developer and of a fan.

From the developer side, most experienced developers will tell you that it's not a good idea to reinvent the wheel when you're writing code that will be used in production.  It's great to do it for hobby purposes as a learning experience, but when you're running a business, it's more important that things *work*.  It is of course entirely possible to be *too* gung-ho about reusing code.  Many developers have had a boss push a codebase on them that's unsuited to a particular task, and it's *actually faster* to write something from scratch than mucking around in the horrible innards of some badly written library or framework trying to hack in a necessary feature that it simply can't provide.

In the case of e-commerce applications, though, there are plenty of free (and open source) frameworks out there that have been tested extensively in the real world, and can be adapted to handle most situations with a little bit of custom glue code.  It is *possible* that Wollay ran into something that existing free e-commerce frameworks can't provide, but in all honesty it seems pretty unlikely.

If I were supervising a brilliant, creative, independently minded programmer and they wanted to reinvent the e-commerce wheel, I would require them to provide me with a solid justification for doing so.  I don't know the internals of Wollay's reasoning for rolling it himself (more critique on communication later), but what I state with certainty is that there are other perfectly viable options than ""build it all from the ground up in C++"" and ""pay someone else 30% of my profits to use their distribution platform"".  I can't really conceive of a hypothetical situation that would render existing e-commerce code useless -- if anyone can think of any possibilities, I'd love to discuss them.  Feel free to post them in a reply.

As a brief disclaimer, the above is purely speculation on my part, given the way things look with my limited knowledge seeing things from the outside.  I don't know Wollay, I don't know how much experience he's had with coding, and I don't know what reasoning he might have had for choosing to roll his own e-commerce code.  I'm just guessing based on what I've seen here and what I've seen other developers (myself included) do in the past.  If he ever writes up a postmortem of the launch, I would love to read it.

From the standpoint of a fan, CubeWorld is a great example of how *not* to handle communication with potential customers.  Contrast [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com/), which has daily status updates and keeps in touch with its fan base on the internet.  Now, Wollay is just one guy, so a daily blogging schedule might not be reasonable, but if you page back far enough in this subreddit, you'll find long stretches of time with no posts whatsoever, broken up with the occasional ""what happened to Wollay?"" post.  One or two tweets a week would have been sufficient to show people that the project was still moving.

Given the intensity of the hype surrounding the launch, I think it's reasonable to spend a minute or two every couple of hours tweeting a status update, even if it's something to the point of ""still trying to fix launcher, no progress, ETA unknown"".  

At any rate, you're never going to *completely* eliminate people clamoring for some sort of release date, but if Starbound's example holds true, periodically (and *reliably*) throwing people a bone in the form of a progress update does a lot to alleviate it while maintaining pre-release hype that sells games.

So, do people have a right to criticize the launch?  Sure, I think so.  This doesn't mean it's okay to berate Wollay or act like a jackass.  One thing that good developers should do is learn from their own mistakes and the mistakes of others.  This alpha launch is, for whatever reason(s), suffering from poor execution.  It's natural, particularly given the relatively infrequent communication during these issues, for people who are excited about the launch (and potentially frustrated that they missed their window to get the game earlier than everyone else), to speculate about the causes of the delay.

For Wollay's part, while I think some more tweets would be nice, he's doing the right thing by looking after the people *who have already paid* first.  While I think some mistakes were made, at this point he needs to deal with them as quickly and as well as he can, because it's too late now to go back and start making massive structural changes to his code.

In conclusion:  Yeah, things could be going better, but while it's okay to be frustrated that you don't have the game, there's really nothing to be angry at Wollay about.  He's just one guy, and you can bet that right now he's working his ass off to get the game released as soon as possible.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1372896291.0,,,True,t3_1hlomi,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hlomi/an_academic_discussion_and_criticism_of_the_alpha/,

But this isn't a bad thing, I enjoy a challenge. It forced me to get better at the game fast and now I'm doing pretty well. I will say, the difficulty of the enemies can be a tad on the hilarious side. I took out a squad of heavily armed Goblins no sweat but heaven forbid I encounter a SQUIRREL. *shudders at the thought*

2.) Wow, does it get dark... You don't see this much in games anymore, especially in RPGs. Minecraft got pretty dark, but nothing to this extent. That lamp you carry around is a freakin' lifesaver. It doesn't matter if your deep in a cave or outside in the deep of night, the area around is pitch black and you never know what's beyond your tiny circle of light. I was literally getting creeped out as a slowly moved through a pitch black canyon, lest I encounter an enemy that causes me to jump out of my skin. I haven't felt that kind of anxiety in an exploration game since delving deep into my first deep mine in Minecraft. 

3.) The graphics are beautiful. I'm a huge fan of pixel art and I loved Minecraft's graphics, but I like these even more. The lighting, the soft colors, the vibrant canvas created simply by looking out into the distance... wonderful.

4.) The game doesn't feel like an alpha. I'm not sure how everyone else has faired, but I haven't found a single bug (granted, I've only played for three hours). The movement, controls, and combat have felt incredibly fluid and responsive. All of the objects in the environment have functioned correctly, and I haven't gotten stuck or anything. At this point, it just seems like Picroma wants to add features. The fact that it feels so polished is incredible. Well done, Picroma.

EDIT: When I was talking about the game not feeling like an alpha, I was talking about the controls and how smooth the game felt, I wasn't talking about content. The game is CLEARLY missing a ton of content, which will come in the future.

Cube World is filling an RPG void that I've been trying to fill for a very long time! =D

Hi Xavier,
 
I am Scott and I have never posted in this thread before so please don't mistake me as any of the other employees you have had contact with as that is not the case. I am the proper marketing man at PlugPayPlay and skids should have never posted. To add, Sean shouldn't even have access to this account and I will make sure that any posts made from this account in future are by me.
 
I'd like to apologize on behalf of the company for the poor service you have received from us. I have looked at your support tickets and you have submitted ~5/6 since buying your server on July 14th and this is unacceptable on our behalf, I can't tell you how sorry I am for the issues you have had. We always try our hardest to fix the issues our clients are having with our servers but unfortunately that quality dropped significantly in regards to you.
 
I am currently in contact with a member of your community who wants to help us come to some kind of resolution for this. If you'd like to contact me personally my email is scott@ens-ltd.com or if you'd rather chat via Skype I can PM you my Skype upon request.
 
Once again I am very sorry for the issues you have had with us. 
 
If anybody else has a service with us and is also having trouble please submit a ticket with the name Scott in the title and then only I will respond to the ticket.
If anybody does wish to join one of our Cube World servers to test the IP is 93.189.7.106
 
 
 
Cheers,
 
Scott

After reading through this, I certainly would not be using them as a server host. I am aware this subreddit is using them as a sponsored host for their server, but wanted to get this more into the open because the consumers deserve to know.

Just list any bugs you find, and any suggestions you think will add to the game and I'll try and put them up for everyone to see.

----------------------------------

Bugs:

1.Fish reset bug, monsters in oceans reset often when attacked by ranged enemies, particularly when they get close, when you're directly above them, and when they get caught in a small trench.

2.Ranger glider glitch, using retreat and a glider causes the ranger to build up amazing momentum and basically fly for a few minutes. At 3 glider skill I'm able to cross most biomes in less than 10 leaps.

3.Dual wield bug, if you equip a two hander, then middle click a one hander you are able to gain the stats from the one hander while wielding the two hander.

4.Scout's 3 skill crashes the multiplayer server.

5.Ranger starts with a Wand +1 in the inventory, should probably be a Boomerang.

6.Shops don't seem to sell crossbows

7.I once had a mission inside a city (something about killing attacking Gnobolds), but the mobs in question failed to show up, as well as the quest text being in German.

8.Adaption cost for items has a calculation error and as a result is waaaay to high. As of now, the feature is more or less unusable.

9.Pets do not level up properly on multiplayer servers and will ""reset"" to their initial state at random intervals and/or when you equip or unequip them.

10.Hitting a menu button (tab, c, etc.) does not instantly bring up said menu and can cause death in certain situations if you get locked in a menu while in battle.

11.Bombs, Potions, and Food are not leveled in dungeons when found as ground objects

12.Generation clipping (most common is resurrection stone, rare is dungeon floating above ground a bit)

13.Pets lose levels when renamed / swapped when dead

14.Ranged AI never misses with channeled casts if you move (Mage staff, Ranger boomerang)

15.Some classes can spam Right Click and deal more damage than attacking with left click, even with 0 mana charged (Warrior - Guardian, Ranger - Crossbow... can't remember the others)

16.Some enemy hitboxes are very unintuitive (good example are the troll mission bosses)

17-19.There's a bug with the Ninja's unique class ability. Dodging attacks normally restores some of your mana and gives you a crit buff, but it doesn't activate against ranged attacks. Also occasionally using M2 against an opponent who is knocked down will automatically refill your mana to 100 as if you were dodging multiple attacks, even though you're not dodging anything. And I believe the crit buff just gives a flat 100% crit chance on all attacks, when it's only supposed to give the auto-crits to your next special attack.

20.It is possible to warp through building walls from the outside if there is a chair or bed along the inside wall; just hit R and you will teleport through the wall onto the bed or chair.

21.When you craft an item, you can get 50 of it, if you just keep the button pressed and turn on the minimap. 

22.If your pet dies whilst riding it you will continue riding an invisible mount at mounted speed.

23.You can jump or retreat while eating.

24.Changing your name to longer than 16 character crashes client

25.When sitting down, if you use the quick item slot it cancels the action, does not use the item, however still consumes one from the inventory. This also effects all consumable used directly from your inventory.

26.Occasionally running down hills my character flashes as if he is taking damage, without taking damage.

27.You can use the item in the quick item slot while dead

28.Occasionally when taming a pet it gets tamed, but is stuck in the taming animation and stays in the same location, even if you walk away. The way I have seen to fix it is just to go to your pet and unequip it then re-equip it again and the pet acts normally.

29.Holding alt will cause game to freeze. Longer it is held, the longer the freeze. I haven't crashed yet. Others should test to confirm.

30.Bats spawn in underwater caves.

31.Riding a peacock in water causes the peacock's neck to retract, leaving the player floating in front of them in a mounted position. 

32.Pets can be stunned while riding, resulting in the pet falling over but the player remaining mounted and moving at riding speed.

33.When killed while poisoned, if R is hit immediately, you can respawn poisoned. It'll still go away though.

34.Using any consumable while sitting consumes the item without gaining any HP.

35.The night time crickets keep chirping when I switch from night to day at the INN.

36.Sometimes when you die you'll respawn in a location that is impossible to get out of without bombs, like stuck between a cliff and the leaves of a tree.

37.When crafting, if the menu is exited before crafting is finished, crafting will restart when menu is opened back up This resumes even if the item is missing from inventory, in which case, the crafting completes without an item being consumed.

38.When crafting, if an item is removed from the inventory before crafting finishes, the item will not be consumed when the crafting is complete, but the item is still crafted.

39.Client locks up when no server is immediately found to join.

40.Joining a map immediately puts you in the map whilst loading, allowing enemies to attack when you have no vision and the 'Please Wait' loading screen is up.

41.Losing connection to a server immediately resets monsters on the map.

42.Inn Keeper's time reset notification is incredibly loud.

43.Cannot sleep while weapon is drawn (though this may be to keep from sleeping during battle)

44.If you stand near a window and use a dash ability of some sort, such as teleport, leap attack, etc. you can jump through, bypassing the bulk of most dungeons.



------------------------------------------

Suggestions

1.Lava lands and oceans need more ambiance, both in sound and visuals. Lava lands don't seem to have any actual lava for instance, and there doesn't seem to be any background sounds such as wind or anything there. Oceans could also use more to them, most notably at night. Perhaps occasional glowing seaweed or something like that along the bottoms. Oceans could also use slightly more murkiness during the day, but that's not a big deal.

2.Also in ocean biomes, I think that there needs to be something added to the fish that helps them close the gap on rangers and mages. On my ranger, I'm able to stand still at a good distance away, point at a fish, hold left click, and kill them through just auto attacks often before I even see their names or health. This gives around 10xp a pop, making leveling in the early game far easier if you can find an ocean than anywhere else.

3.Ocean biomes, if possible it would be good to have some fish closer to the surface, at the moment they all hug the ground. I imagine this helps deal with fish possibly attacking someone on a boat, but it might be better to make people in boats unattackable by fish mobs.

4.The berserker's 3 feels rather underwhelming, as does their passive. While I'm not against keeping either, I suggest perhaps allowing the 3 to heal the berserker slightly each hit, because as it is their playstyle is more based around hit and run instead of tanking if they are fighting enemies that probably won't die in a single whirlwind.

5.Fire mage's 1 also feels rather underwhelming, particularly compared to the water mage. Decent enough skill I suppose, although it could use more range, but fire mages probably need another more heavily offensive spell. Although perhaps not the wizard/witch lasers, unless those get nerfed.

6.Perhaps nerf the witches/wizards, or buff what you receive from them in terms of money and XP, cause at the moment they just feel like they aren't worth fighting, mostly cause they burst people down in 1-2 seconds.

7.Liches and cyclopses need a buff. My warrior has found and tanked down two liches so far, and they barely did any damage. Unsure if they are more threatening to other classes, but at the moment they are a joke. Cyclopses are in a similar spot, but not nearly as bad.

8.And while I think about it, are hell demons actually bosses? Cause I'm murdering them faster than pretty much anything else in the lava lands. Curious since the page lists them under bosses, but every one I've fought lives for about the time required to lunge in and finish a single spin attack on my warrior.

9.This'll probably get added in as more skills do, but most bosses seem to do one or two of the following: cause a fire explosion, summon an add of some kind(undead, clone of player, weak clone of self) charge attack, or spin attack. They probably need some more skills, although admittedly most of the left over player skills could lead to frustration rather than enjoyment(heals, scout 3 ability and kiting the player, more of the nearly instant leap attacks, etc.) 

10.Humanoid outdoor bosses have ungodly large healthbars. I'm all for hard fights, but wailing on a boss for 12-15 minutes is decidedly unfun, especially when said mob can oneshot you, resetting progress.

11.Berserker spec feels incredibly lackluster. I think the warrior in general as well as the assassin spec could use a little love.

12.The game could use a few money sinks. I'm sitting on heaps of gold with nothing to spend them on.

13.Shops are next to useless. Besides the glass bottles and the occasional low-level item, they offer only whites and occasionally a green. I'd like to see some blue+ items and recipes for extortionate prices popping up every once in a while.

14.While we're at shops, the occasional item reshuffle every 3 or so in game days would be a most welcome addition as well.

15.Hire-able mercenaries.

16.More variance in crafting recipes, require new items to find and gather.

17.A reason to visit specific biomes. Crafting ingredients would be good here, for example you need Ingredient1 from Ocean Biome and Ingredient2 from Lava Biome etc.

18.A way to locate teleport stones easier. Perhaps the mage in town could sense the general direction so you have a starting point.

19.A way to fast travel between towns like airships etc. And possibly something like a town portal spell.

20.Map markers for the world map. Left click to drop marker, right click to bring up box for it to add things to the marker like a title and notes.

21.Toggle map markers on/off

22.A system for inviting players to your party and kicking them in game. People do not auto join a party, they must be invited to play in one on the server.

23.Multiple item stacks of same item in inventory

24.More light is required in large towns.

25.Lava lands need to be a bit lighter they are too dark to see anything even with a lamp on.

26.Mark the place of your last death.

27.Give the rogue assassin a different #2 ability. Right now it only makes you invisible to when the mobs haven't seen you and moving in is really hard to actually want to use it. As soon as you get the #3 for the assassin the #2 becomes useless

28.I think he should add some items that give various bonuses like for example : boots that give +10 run speed and +5 jump.

29.Moving statics, clouds, rivers, waves, etc, as well as splashes along the sides of boats.

30.Add music for when using a vehicle or mount.

31.Include server browser with past addresses (and possibly server status)

32.Show player heads on map at all time

33.Make equipped potion redundant between game sessions.

34.Make different animals have different attributes while riding

35-39. More crafting options, such as: Being able to choose the base model for your weapon, Being able to name your weapon, more placable cubes for named weapons, maybe 48 or 64 cubes. And ""reforging"" weapons, that names them and possibly gives them a small stat boost or upgrades their rarity, adapts them and adds the customization bonus for being named.

40.For the world map. It would be nice if the names of the lands would show on the world map in the most zoomed out view, as well as the locations of cities or other major geographical features. 

41.It would also be nice for each land to be color coded according to type on the map.

42.Missions need to be biome specific, two characters can gain XP from missions despite being in seperate biomes. 


That's it for now, I'll try to update this post when people add bugs and suggestions to the comments, and when the cubeworld website is reliable again I'll copy this post and move it onto Wollay's forums.

You've been developing your game by yourself for years. Initial reports are favorable and then you get notch to tweet about the game. Basically the holy grail for an indie title like this. Then you get an Alpha version running that immediately get's picked up by the Yogscast and countless other youtubers and it's a giant love fest with literally not a single negative comment about the game despite some glaringly obvious bugs. 

It's obvious - this game will have a good launch. So being a person of at least minimum intelligence you understand that launch crashes hurt more than anything else because launching a game is like shifting into second gear - you MUST have some momentum for it to work or you are going to stall and you MUST keep that momentum or you will stall.

So knowing all of this you decide to... roll your own distribution and payment service and host it yourself? Wut da fuk? In the age of AWS you decide to risk the launch of your hugely anticipated game??!! Amazon will give you a freaking field of servers and bandwidth on the fly - the only problem you would have is keeping up with the demand.

&gt;**- A: Wollay is currently working on fixing this issue, and it should be finished soon. I would advise following Wollay's [twitter](https://twitter.com/wol_lay) to stay up-to-date on the issue.**
 

~~If anyone knows *for sure* what ports are used when hosting a server, or if you are able to select your own, could you please let me know so I can post that here. I cannot find any info on that currently.~~ Confirmed by /u/zarradeth. Give him your sweet sweet upvote love.


~~**I am going to be in a meeting at my work from 1 pm - 2 Pm. Durring that time I will be unable to update this list, but when I return, I will add in any new information that pops up**~~

~~Back to business.~~

Back at work and back to updating this thing. Honestly speaking, there are no new developments as to how soon we will see the shop opened up as of yet. We know that Wollay was awake at least 6 hours ago, but he has not tweeted anything as to the status of the shop in 12 hours.

In nearly every thread about Martyn's livestream there is some pretty severe criticism of his playing and an awful lot of whining about 'big names' getting to play the game early. I have to say, I'm upset that I don't have access to the game yet. However, I am not upset with any of the streamers or wollay.

I recognize that Martyn's not at fault for getting access to the game; what he does is play video games and have people watch. That wollay chose him to play is no problem of his. In fact, I think it's great that he chose to stream the game instead of just playing it on his own, in spite of knowing that he would be 'bad' for quite a while. Actually, it's probably good that he's not amazing at the game because a VAST majority of the people playing the game will not be great.

As for wollay's distribution style: I might not agree with his choice, but just because I disagree doesn't mean I'm angry. There are a lot of merits to be found with early journalist distributions, and I'm not going to argue those here.

Basically, just relax a little bit. It probably won't be that much longer until we're all playing. We don't need to hate everyone that has things we don't.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,False,,Blue-Head,True,t3_1guz5j,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1guz5j/lets_tone_it_down_a_bit_guys/,

The point of having a subreddit for a game like this is to share new ideas and experiences, which includes all of the sub-subreddits listed in the sidebar. 


I dunno, it's just something that peeves me with newer subreddits. If everything's in one place, chances are that the frontpage will end up with such a variety of posts that we won't as much of a surge of posts when a new trend rises.

Having to avoid so many mobs that I just couldn't handle made it really, really tough.

**Tips:**

1. Create two worlds:
    - One world where your character is in a town for access to crafting and other town related activities.
    - One world where you're at your farming location.
    - Swap between these to be efficient and replace old gear quickly.

2. Find a boss and farm around it.
    - I farmed for quite awhile (probably level 3 or 4 to level 6) before fighting the first boss
    - Boss areas have a high but manageable amount/density of enemies.

3. When you enter an area with a boss and get the quest pop-up for it, completing this will give you a ton of experience.

4. (I will test this to make sure. -Binsou) Another tip for those who dont want to endure the long darkness of the night: Create a separate character and place him by the inn. Play your main character. If its too dark : logout the main, login the inn character, talk to the innkeeper. This will set the world clock to 7 am. Logout the inn character, log in the main and you see the light again.  -Riverstomp


These are just the big things that I (Level 8 Rogue) found as I was playing.  If anyone has stuff to add, just comment on this and I'll try to add it.

Links to ""red"" items, links to unimplemented pet taming items, pets tamed that are clearly not able to be tamed, etc. I think it's interesting that people are exploring the game in.. unique ways, but these posts are not marked as spoilers, they are just hacks using CheatEngine to see what they can find.

Yesterday alone I saw so many posts about Red Items, and today I see a post about a pet Dragon for heaven's sakes. So many ""Look at this Red Blueprint/Mega awesome Sword I found in a dungeon chest!"" Now, it's *possible* these items do exist, but it's odd that each item a person gets just *happens* to be for their class, ya know?

I don't mind people picking through the game, but the more you do that, the less you have to look forward to. And the more you post it without spoilers, the more you're spoiling the game for people who don't want to cheat. I would much rather play the game and discover that Wollay added a new taming item in an update than see someone boast about their ""Leet cheat engine skills"".

Also the game is in alpha so I think it's a good idea to have a good discussion on things that can be improved, added and fixed.

**Games I have played** - *Just a list of relevant mmos/rpgs so you can get an idea were I'm coming from*.

* **Rift** since launch quit mid hammerknell in a top 20 raiding guild and just came back after they went f2p.(They did f2p very nicely)

* **WoW** since late BC quit many times and recently quit in patch 5.2 probably will go back at some point. *They all come back*.

* **SWOTOR** since launch quit after my guild beat the first raid tier. All of the end-game was extremely buggy and lack luster.

* **TERA** for about a week. I really just didn't like this game.

* **Runescape** probably what brought me into mmos like a lot of people. Can't really remember when I started or stopped this game.

* **Diablo 2** Didn't play that much, only single player nothing serious at all.

* **Diablo 3** Played it for like a week because I got it free with the wow pass thing.

* **Torchlight** I beat it. That's all I remember.

* **Torchlight II** See *Torchlight*. Also much better than Diablo 3 imo. Might be because I really enjoy the art style of this series.

* **Pokemon** This is most people's first RPG. I think I've beat the elite four in all the generations. Never played yellow version. Fuck yellow version.

* **Zelda** I have played a lot of them, but none of the newer ones though. The only one I remember beating is the mask one for N64. 

* **Minecraft** Has anyone not played this?

*That's all I can think of*.

**Tips** - *Few friendly tips for those just starting out.*

* If you aren't a water mage, collect every heartflower you see and learn to make potions because you will need to use them a lot.

* Kill range mobs first. If you come across a group of not-so-nice adventures always go for the ranged guys first. This is partly because range will never miss you, this is a semi-bug and I believe wollay has said he is aware of the issue.

* I wouldn't recomend adventuring at night at a low level. Go talk to an in-keeper and he will make it 7 am for you. If you do find yourself in a dark situation press 'F'.

* Don't buy a hang-glider or boat until you have spec'd into it. They require a level 4 min. and then at level 4 you must put all your points into the corresponding spec.

* Pets are always good you can find pet items you pick up in the pet tab. These items are then put in your pet slot of your equipment. Then while near an animal that likes that item you will see the animal get a heart above it's head then you will be the proud owner of a pet. ([Link to pets and what stuff the like](http://cubeworldforum.org/topic/3781-list-of-foods-each-pet-eats-in-cube-world-guide-spoilers/))

*I might write some kind of full guide at some point in time.*

**Bugs** - *These are things that are straight broken with the game.*

**Edit:** *Added a bug. The community should really keep up with these and submit them properly when there is a way.*

* Holding O restores mana to full extremely fast.

* Pressing left-alt at will freeze the game.

* Aggro distance for rare mobs. (a turtle chased me over three mountains)

* Going from in-game to the start menu the sounds of nature persist.

* I have a pet hornet and he makes foot-step sounds.

* Sometimes the foot-step sounds align at some magical frequency and it sounds bad.

* Groups of 2 or more witches/wizards will one shot you even though their name is blue. (This doesn't happen against any other groups)

* Drop Rates for single player suck (I was at level 3 on my warrior and had 12 class specific drops and none were for me)

* The ability to Alt-Tab seems broken for me.*It some how is fixed when I switched it from windowed, to fullscreen, then back*

* Equip a 2-handed weapon, then middle-click a one handed weapon in your inventory and you'll wear both. It boosts your damage tremendously.

**Bad Things** - *These are things that 'I feel' are broken with the game.*

* Level 1-3 is a pretty garbage experience if you are a warrior. The game-play consists of hit things, nearly die, run in circle, drink potion, repeat.(class balance discussed later.)

* Can't use a spirit cube with power 17 on a weapon power 14. Remove a bit of the restrictions at least at the lower levels. There is no worst feeling than working your ass off to kill a rare mob only to find out you don't have the exact right power level.

* The distance at which a mobs level can be determined. If I see a hornet in the distance shouldn't I be able to determine if it will destroy my anus, why do I have to stand right next to it.

* Aggro distance I mentioned this earlier but I think retreating should be a viable option at least at the lower levels.

* The cost of the hang-glider/boat needs to be increased I acquired 10 silver pretty fast only to find out it was useless until I spec into it.

* Not being able to determine if the area your in is too ""far out"". Though I could see this taking away from the immersion.

* Mobs are a bit too sparse feels like to much walking. This could also be fixed by lowering the xp needed to level for the first few levels.

* Iron is too damn rare. I could craft my mage a full set of gear 8 times and only craft my warrior 2 weapons and 1 piece of gear. This could be fixed by lowering the cost of iron to make gear or make smelting produce more than 1 per on a regular basis.

**Class Balance** - *Mage vs Warrior (Water Mage is OP and more)*

Class balance in any rpg is kind of a big deal and I know it will never be perfect, but that doesn't mean you can neglect the topic. Look at WoW, 8 years and they are still making class changes and over-hauls.

The water mage is OP. Everyone has probably heard this by-now and many are already screaming nerf. I don't think a nerf is the way to handle it really. I think the real problem is that the other classes are possibly under-tuned and need a buff. In my opinion I really enjoyed playing the water mage and thought by itself it made for a great single-player experience. 

**Edit:** *Got to level 10 on the Water Mage my thoughts on how the nerf should be handled are below.*

I believe I recall wollay saying something about advanced specs were going to be added to the game. If this happens it will probably change pretty much everything, but if it doesn't here are my thoughts on how the mage nerf should go down.

*General*

* Reduce all numbers for the Water Mage by 10%.

* From what I can tell tempo is kinda like haste from WoW and you gain haste per hit combo so by hit combo #20 you are insta-casting everything. I think that it's a great mechanic for probably every other class, but because of the healing puddle mechanic that Water Mages have they probably shouldn't have that hit combo increase tempo effect. I'm using braclets as a Water Mage and when I get to a 20 plus hit combo I look like I'm throwing punches faster than Mike Tyson.

*Healing Stream*

* Reduce the mana cost of the Healing Stream from 75 mana to 25 mana.

* Reduce the healing done Healing Stream from about 75% of the mages hp to about 25%.

* Increase the base casting time by just a second maybe less.

* Casting healing stream requires you to be stationary.

* Increase the time of stream part of Healing Stream.

* While Healing Stream is streaming you must be stationary.

* The stationary aspect to the nerf will allow for some 'skill'. When in combat you would have to recognize a knockdown proc from your 2nd ability, then use Healing Stream. This would give sort of a flow to single player combat with the water mage.

*Mana Shield*

* Make Mana Shield cost mana, probably about 10 mana because it really isn't great

* Allow Mana Shield to be put on friendly targets.

* Give Mana Shield a bigger graphic. Like a more solid blue sphere.

*Teleport*

* As it currently stands your mage will slow down while casting teleport then after the teleport he is still walking slow. This negates about half the teleport with 1 point into teleport and I imagine when you have 5 points in teleport it is good. Still fix the second slow.

* Maybe increase the cast time at max points. I don't really know about this one I haven't got a chance to play around with it at max.

**Edit:** *Reached level 10 on the warrior. General thoughts on the experience and how a buff could be handled.*

First off, I want to say that the warrior did pull through a bit in terms of not constantly dying. I did level 1-5 specing mostly into impoved pet and a bit into my skills. """"That is a mistake.** I changed it up going into level 5 by assigning all of my points toward the class skills. This approach worked better for me. The strategy of ""'zerg' shit before it kills you!"" is the strategy I chose and it seemed to work better for me. The warriors dps seems much higher than the mages, as it should be. I'll cover some skills and what I think could be changed about them, as well as how I used them.

* **Smash** - I believe this is intended to be a charge, but I used it more as just a cleave. This is a very strong attack I got it to crit for like 250, I think. (I was using a green quality weapon.) I Think that this ability is fine the way it is.

* **Cyclone** - I doubted this one at first, but later found it to be the most devastating. (This ability is pretty much just whirlwind btw) I did end up dying a few times, because it can't be canceled by just pressing the drink potion key. I would add something like reduces damage taken by 75% while casting. I don't think this would be too op because the ability does have a rather long cool down.

* **War Frenzy** - Still not really sure about this one. Doesn't really seem to flow with the combat as nicely as the other 2. It essentially allows you to use up your rage at a faster rate. I'd rather see something like an aoe rend. Really I just use this when the other 2 abilities are on cool down.

* My strategy for using these abilities usually goes Cyclone&gt;Smash&gt;War Frenzy. There 2 reasons for pulling with cyclone 1.) It has a longer cd, so using it at the very beginning allows for a possible 2nd use in the fight. 2.) It has a larger aoe than smash so you will hit more mobs if they are slightly spread out. Then that allows time for the mobs to gather closer so you can hit more with Smash.

* I also got a chance to attempt a dungeon. It was catacombs style. I started at level 8 with about 80 potions (50 made 30ish unmade) and I ended at about half way through level 9 with no potions. The mobs were blue +1. (not sure what the +1 on a blue name means). I did not finish the dungeon the trash respond on me about 3 times, but I was able to clear about 7 or so rooms of trash. The loot from the dungeon was amazing and loot in general since level 5 has improved.

* I think there probably needs to be some kind of buff to melee classes. My Idea was giving melee classes a chance to parry attacks randomly. I think this would increase survive-ability a bit.

* The game as melee right now is borderline frustrating challenging with a few buffs it could become more excitingly challenging.

**Ideas** - *Most of this stuff might not be good ideas just thoughts really.*

*Some convenience things I think almost need to be in game.*

* **KEY BINDS** (This is really a must most any respectable pc game these days has key binds)

* Make 'num-lock' key auto walk and maybe auto craft somehow.

* The ability to use scroll-wheel for scrolling in the crafting/store windows

* Make 'esc' key close all the windows that you may have open like crafting/store/inventory/weapon customize.

* A Tutorial. I know many people don't want the casualized walk in the park rpg, but the low level experience is pretty rough as it is now. This could also show you how to craft and what not, which imo can be not so straight forward.

* A guaranteed pet in the first town in the pet district that you could buy for like 1 silver. This would be in-case the RNG gods screw you over with pet drops. I had a pet at level 1 on my mage but didn't get a pet till level 3 on my warrior.

*The following are bigger ideas just more stuff I think that could add content to the world.*

* Specs for pets. There could be determined types of pets like tanking, dps, healing, hybrid and support and they should get maybe a single spec tree.

* The ability to dismantle items for more blocks. Might be kinda hard to tune this so that isn't the only way people obtain blocks.

* Crafting specializations. I like in cube world you can do all the crafting you want, but I think the ability to specialize would be cool. For instance you could specialize in cooking then your food could give buffs or specialize in crafting weapons could allow you to have a chance to craft a weapon with a spirit block already in it.

* The ability to hire a mercenary in single player. Something like, go to a town find an npc you like the look of and be able to pay him to fight along your side for 30 minutes or so.

* Factions of some kind. No one really seems to care that i'm a frogman or an orc in a village that is entirely made up of humans. Something as basic as a NPC mentioning my race could really add to the immersion. Or you could take factions to a higher level like the ability to steal from shops and if your caught then your rep is lowered. When quests are added doing a quest for a town might raise your rep. Then have rewards for having higher reputation with a town.

* Events like invasions, or helping npcs accomplish something. This might turnout to some what be what questing actually is. Invasions is something I really like the idea of, but maybe only on the multi-player side. Imagine buying glass flask so you can continue on with slaying mobs when a legion of orcs begin bombarding the city. If nothing is done about the invasion then the city could be burned to the ground or just ran by orcs. I think this idea could really go well with the factions idea.

I'm really having a fun time with the game and would like to hear others thoughts on the issues I brought up.

**Edit 1:** *Reached level 10 on the water mage. Added a bug and commented on one. Added/changed some stuff under class balance, mostly all comments on how I think the nerf should happen.*

**Edit 2:** *Reached level 10 on the warrior. Added comments about the warrior class level 5-10 experience under the Class Balance section. Also I'll probably make another thread more about comparing warrior and mage.*",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1373021014.0,,,True,t3_1hnx5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hnx5u/leveled_a_water_mage_and_a_berserker_warrior_to/,

Hey guys! A few days ago, /u/loboleal posted a formula to calculate the power in function of the level of your character. I searched high and low for similar formulas for other stats like HP, experience needed to level, etc... but couldn't find anything. So I figured I could start a quest to find those formulas myself!

Unlike /u/loboleal however, I used Cheat Engine to look at the assembly code of Cube World in order to find the code Wollay uses to calculate all the stats. I started with experience because I thought it would be the easiest to find, given the fact that changing your level using Cheat Engine is trivial (once you've found the right pointers ;)).

To keep a long story short, I've found the code responsible for the experience scaling at Cube.exe+4847F (This code is only triggered if you level legitimately by killing a mob and gaining its experience):

    Cube.exe+4847F - movd xmm1,[esi+00000190]
    Cube.exe+48487 - movss xmm2,[Cube.exe+344D68] (1.00)
    Cube.exe+4848F - movss xmm3,[Cube.exe+2FBDB4] (0.05)
    Cube.exe+48497 - cvtdq2ps xmm1,xmm1
    Cube.exe+4849A - movaps xmm0,xmm2
    Cube.exe+4849D - subss xmm1,xmm2
    Cube.exe+484A1 - movss xmm4,[Cube.exe+2FC8F4] (1000.0)
    Cube.exe+484A9 - movss xmm5,[Cube.exe+2FBD7C] (50.0)
    Cube.exe+484B1 - mulss xmm1,xmm3
    Cube.exe+484B5 - addss xmm1,xmm2
    Cube.exe+484B9 - divss xmm0,xmm1
    Cube.exe+484BD - movaps xmm1,xmm2
    Cube.exe+484C0 - subss xmm1,xmm0
    Cube.exe+484C4 - mulss xmm1,xmm4
    Cube.exe+484C8 - addss xmm1,xmm5
    Cube.exe+484CC - cvttss2si eax,xmm1

If we translate the code into a human readable format, we get:

    experience = 50 + 1000 * ( 1 - 1/((level - 1)*0.05 + 1) )

Or simplified:

    experience = (1050 * level - 50)/(level + 19)

The truncated result of that formula at the decimal point (ignore everything after the decimal point), is the experience needed to get to the next level!

We can use this function to make the following graphs for the levels 1 to 200:

[Experience needed to level up, in function of the level](http://i.imgur.com/EcpQk3r.png)

[Total experience needed to reach a certain level](http://i.imgur.com/crWp8Lf.png)

Using the power of calculus, we can find a formula for the total amount of experience needed to reach a certain level, starting from level 1:

    total_experience = 50 (21 * (level - 1) + 400 * log(20) - 400 * log(19 + level))

Sadly enough, this formula is not accurate. The discrete nature and the truncation of the experience introduces an error in our results. The graph above was created by summing all the previous truncated results, if we overlay our function:

[Discrete total experience vs. continuous total experience](http://i.imgur.com/WgR1wbL.png)

We see that our function slightly overestimates the total experience needed. However, it is certainly acceptable! We can go a little bit further and give a formula for the estimate for the amount of experience needed to go from level_a to level_b:

    experience_from_a_to_b = 50 * (21 * (level_b - level_a) + 400 * log(19 + level_a) - 400 * log(19 + level_b))

I'm going to hunt for the formula that /u/loboleal posted for the power level now. If you have any questions, don't be shy!

Let's hope this doesn't get downvoted to oblivion for having ""Cheat Engine"" in the title :/

**tl;dr MATH!**

****

Edit 1: Simplified the formula.

Edit 2: Added the promised graphs and derived a few formula's.

Edit 3: As /u/VicoSen pointed out, level 6 is the only exception to the formula (that I've found). Due to floating point arithmetic, the program makes an error in the calculation, so that 250 becomes 249.999985. The assembly specifically specifies that we must truncate this result, so that we end up with 249.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1373513562.0,,Bird,True,t3_1i1h4y,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1i1h4y/using_cheat_engine_to_explore_the_internals_of/,

There's now a text file that you can edit to redo bindings. Should be pretty obvious what's what. On each line, simply change what you want to the right of the colon (':'), adding in a comma (',') and another letter edits the alternate binding, which the TOGGLE key enables/disables.

You can add in letter or any of the keywords you see there: SPACE, L_CTRL, TAB, etc.

Be Gentle, I didn't have the longest time to test for bugs, so hopefully you wont make it crash by typing in the wrong stuff. Keep to the format of the file(meaning, leave the buttons in the order you see them. That's the order theyre assigned in).

One final note, regardless of whether or not you assign an alternate command to the left stick, it wont work. I'll have that changed soon.

**Edit: PS3 Controller Support**
If you want to use a PS3 controller, you can as long as you can fool Windows into thinking it's an Xbox Controller. To do that, take a look [here](http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller). 

Basically, download [this package](http://forums.pcsx2.net/attachment.php?aid=44084), put the folder somewhere, then run the ScpDriver.exe file (inside the main folder, then inside the 'bin' folder) (I 'ran as administrator' via right-click). Follow the link to the forum above for info about how the bluetooth works, but if you want it to run dirt simple just uncheck the Bluetooth option before you hit install. You'll have to play with the controller wired, but my program should work just fine with the PS3 controller after that.


**Original Post**

I saw a couple days ago that some people were looking for a way to use their 360 controllers with CubeWorld, but there was nothing helpful other than a few (terrible) Xpadder profiles.

Since Xpadder is not free (and because I was looking for a programming project), I made my own basic keymapping program so that I could play CubeWorld a little more comfortably on my couch.

Without further ado, [here it is!](http://www.mediafire.com/download/0nb0dc7a47srdyl/TacKey_for_CubeWorld_360_Keymapper.zip).

**Some notes:**

Custom button bindings aren't in yet, but ill hopefully have that cobbled together by tomorrow if people are interested. This is just a simple input generating program, nothing fancy, so there shouldnt be any issues running in on your machine. It certainly shouldnt break anything (but if It does, I'm not responsible. Use at your own risk! Although, in reality the worst that should happen is that maybe a key gets 'stuck' in the OS, meaning you have to click it a few times on the actual keyboard or mouse to undo it, although I think I ironed out all of those scenarios).

You can also just use this as a dirt simple way to get an Xbox Controller working with Windows, eg like a remote control for VLC (that's how I use it when watching movies on my TV).

I'm currently running Windows 8 x64, although this is compiled/run as a 32bit program, and with some dirt simple, basic stuff, so I *think* this should work on 7 for sure, maybe even Vista and XP.

**Setup/Run**

Make sure your Xbox controller driver is installed before running. I just plugged in my wireless receiver and Windows 8 picked it up automatically, should be the same with a wired controller as well. If you arent on Windows 8 or 7, you might have to use the install CD the controller/receiver came with.

Other than that, once its installed just make sure the controller is plugged in (or if its wireless, make sure its paired with the receiver), then just run my program. It will ask you to hit Enter when you're sure your controller is connected, then you should be good to go!

**Controls:**

Left stick = WASD, Right Stick = mouse movement.  Until I make the mouse sensitivity explicitly configurable, you can increase/decrease the sensitivity in the Control Panel. Not sure if the in game sensitivity helps at all. The in-game inversion definitely does work.

*The left trigger is used for alternate button/key bindings, see below.*

A: jump
LB/RB : left/right mouse buttons respectively 

X: 1 ability
LS: 2 ability (see below for why i chose this)
Y: 3 ability
B: Dodge 


I did this because most of the #2 abilities are self-buffs, like the mages shield/stealth/retreat, so its easy to use in combat while moving/dodging. Dodge is next to jump since I double jump frequently.

RS: Pick stuff up

DPAD:
(This may be a little confusing, but I swear my intentions were good and it works OK)
UP: Glider/boat
...LT+UP: Zoom in
LEFT: map
...LT+LEFT: R (ride pet, examine stuff, talk to people, revive)
RIGHT: Quick Item
...LT+RIGHT: T (pet toggle)
DOWN: Lantern
...LT+DOWN: Zoom out

Start: Item bag
...LT+Start: Crafting
Back: Options menu

**If you have issues/suggestions**

I'd love any feedback. PM me or post here I guess.
Any suggestions on key swapping would be good, although hopefully by tomorrow I'll have it so you can pick your own mappings.

1373459121.0,105,self.CubeWorld,1i04d1,Just got my Water Mage to level 100 playing solo. Here is my strategy for the Water Mage and some general tips.,126,21,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1i04d1/just_got_my_water_mage_to_level_100_playing_solo/,"First I'd like to state that i'm aware that this is alpha and everything I say will possibly be irrelevant in the future.

The way I got to level 100 was not by grinding dungeons or cheat engine. Also I don't have a problem with people using dungeons or cheat engine to get to a high level, but I feel that you are shorting yourself on the amount of content that you experience. [Here](http://imgur.com/VkXm6Wb) is my current map as a sort of proof that I didn't do those things.(The map begins to cut off some of the further zones when it gets too big) So as you can probably tell the way I played the game was sticking to one seed and running from mission to mission and then moving to the next zone. I feel like this gave me the best chance to experience all the content currently available in alpha.

**Terms**

* Aggro - Attention/Threat
* AoE - Area of Effect
* LoS - Line of Sight
* Tank - Getting hit
* DPS - Damage Per Second
* Crit - Critical hit

**General Tips/Strategies**

* *Second Seed* - I did use a second seed (world) to re-spec and obtain flasks in the early game. This might be viewed as not playing completely legit, but I feel running to town to re-spec becomes tedious and slows down experiencing the game.

* *Resurrecting Pets* - If you click your pet out of the equipment slot then re-equip it, it will automatically be standing by you side no matter if it's dead or alive. This is also useful for when your pet becomes lost. This frequently happened to me when using the hang glider.

* *Turtle is the Best* - These guys are tamed with cinnamon rolls and they are complete bad-asses. The more I try different pets, the less this is becoming an opinion. [Here](http://imgur.com/8ni2o1B&amp;bilyKg2) you can see that the thing has about 500 more hp than me. He is the only pet that isn't completely useless on boss fights. All other pets I have tried are just constantly dead from general AoE during boss. Also I think I heard that it also has a stun and on occasion he will grab aggro and tank for a few hits.

* *Visiting a Town* - When visiting a town I get 50 flasks and 50 water filled flasks and make sure I've used all my Heartflowers to craft as many health potions as possible. This allows me to craft the maximum number of health potions without returning. Also check stores for lanterns, gear and recipes. Buy all green quality items (or higher) relevant to your class and level. I would also buy stuff that was above my level so that when I hit that level I wouldn't have to travel back to that town.

* *Crafting* - This should be done at every town visit while leveling at lower levels. Crafting at lower levels offered me many gear upgrades. Also I would recommend not using wood/gold for customizing at the lower levels because you won't have the same weapon for very long and often times you will be able to craft a better weapon.

* *Traveling* - I see a lot of people spend their skill points on hang gliding and riding before they have access to all their combat abilities. 
This is a horrible idea at low levels. I really didn't get any method of faster travel until around level 25 and even at that point I didn't put points into hang gliding AND riding. I would recommend putting skill points into riding first before hang gliding because you will get more combat efficiency putting points into your pets health than climbing. Climbing is pretty useless to put points into as a mage, because teleport can be used in almost every situation that climbing would be used. Also if your using hang gliding at a low level you will miss out on a ton of xp as you fly over it.

**Water Mage Abilities**

* *Torrent* - When you hit your enemy consecutively it builds a combo. The higher your combo the faster your cast time is, until the number turns blue, which I think means you have reached the maximum effectiveness of the combo. (not 100% on this part)

* *Puddle Mechanic* - When using bracelets or wands you will see a blue circle appear at the feet of your enemy and if your standing inside the circle you will receive some minor heals. (The Effect is the same with staffs just no visuals)

* *Mouse 1* - If you have a staff it's *Water Swirl*, a wand is *Water Drop* and bracelets is also *Water Drop*. This is your spam ability that costs no mana. If your at full health you should probably be using this ability. This ability also has splash damage, no matter the weapon of choice.

* *Mouse 2* - If you have a staff it's *Water Vortex*, a wand is *Water Salvo* and bracelets is *Water Splash*. All of these do more damage, cost 30 mana, have a cast time and have a chance to stun you enemy. The chance of stun seems to be about every 3 hits. That chance decreases if you enemy has a orange name or higher.

* *Healing Stream* - This ability is unlocked by spending points in the *Healing Stream* box in your skill tree. Spending more points in this ability decreases the amount of mp used when it casts. With one point in the skill the base cost is 93.18 mp and it heals for about 70% of your total health.(When you cast it for it's full mana cost.) You don't have to have the full mana cost to cast it. It will just heal for as much mana as you spend.

* *Mana Shield* - This ability is unlocked by spending points in the *Mana Shield* box in your skill tree and requires at least 5 points in the *Healing Stream* box. Spending more points in this ability decreases the cooldown. With one point in the skill the base cooldown is 19.09 seconds. It absorbs damage, but I can't seem to find out exactly how much.

* *Teleport* - This ability is unlocked by spending points in the *Teleport* box in your skill tree and requires at least 5 points in the *Healing Stream* box and 5 points in the *Mana Shield* box. Spending more points in this ability decreases the cooldown. With one point in the skill the base cooldown is 15.09 seconds. *Teleport* will send you in the direction of your reticle a good distance and it can be used in a horizontal or vertical fashion.

**Water Mage Spec**

[Here](http://imgur.com/GAGsNQm) is my current spec. The reason for no swimming or boating is because I don't care for Ocean biomes so when I run into them I just turn the other way. Spec is only really important in the early game, gear becomes much more important as you progress.

* Focus on combat skills in a manner of *Mana Shied* &gt; *Healing Stream* &gt; *Pet Health*.
* I dumped a huge amount of points into *Mana Shield* in early levels because it seems to be the better combat ability.
* Don't feel the need to get *Teleport* early on because it won't really help your combat abilities all that much.
* Like I said above wait a while before you spec into anything travel related because it will hinder your combat efficiency in the early game.
* I recommend *Riding* over *Hang Gliding* because *Pet Health* &gt; *Climbing*.

**Water Mage Combat Strategy**

* *Puddle Effect* - Make full use of the puddle mechanic the self heals might seem small, but once you gut a full hit combo going they really start to add up. So stand in melee of use LoS to pull in range mobs.

* *Pre-Shield* - When approaching a difficult mob or group of mobs I will cast *Mana Sheild* and then wait for the cooldown to come up before engaging. This allows me to use another *Mana Shield* as soon as that first one falls off. Also whenever you are in combat you should always use *Mana Shield* when it comes off cool down, as it costs zero mana

* *Son-of-a-Witch* - My strategy for taking down witches/wizards (and most difficult encounters) is to use a Pre-Shield, then engage with one *Mouse 2* ability and then spam *Mouse 1*. You should engage in melee range to take full advantage of the *Puddle Effect*. If they start using more lazers than Lazer Floyd, I will spam dodge until they stop. (Pre-Sheilding should buy you some reaction time). If you refrained from blowing all your mana you should still have some. Use this mana to cast *Mouse 2* for the stun and wait till they stand up before you use *Mouse 2* again. (You can't stun while they are already stunned)

* *+4 Melee Bosses* - Some Melee bosses tend to just crit you for three times your health. The way I deal with this is to never let the boss hit me. This is done by kiting the boss in a linear fashion by teleporting past the boss, then dps'ing, then when the boss gets close spam dodge past him, then run for a bit, then turn 180 and use teleport. Use all your mana for *Mouse 2* for the stun. (This will buy you extra DPS time.) I'd recommend just using health potions rather than using mana from *Healing Stream*, if you do manage to get hit and not one shot.

* *+4 Range Bosses* - For difficulty boss fights that involve a heavy hitting range mob I tend to use Athene's PvP Strat. For those not familiar basically just find a column of some kind and continuously LoS. Spam *Mouse 2* then go back to LoS'ing until you get back to full mana. Also use Pre-Shielding and Heal if you get knocked down or hurt some how.

**Conclusion**

I feel like the game kinda plays backwards in that the level 1-20 is the hardest. Now at level 100 I nearly one shot everything and leveling is going much faster. The only challenge now is +4 dungeons.

Thanks for reading let me know strategies you use and why. Don't reply ""LOL that's stupid I spent 40 points in hang gliding before I even got a pet."". Let me know why you did that. Did having a hang glider enable you to kite better? Do you feel like having a pet just got in the way? Be constructive please.

Hi All!

I have now updated the map with all portals, cities, and useful info that everyone provided.

Really wanted to say thanks to everyone for providing so much info!

Having all these portal locations mapped out is fantastic!

And I wanted to apologized to anyone that tried to make it to the Lava Lands in my [previous map](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hwdqw/map_of_seed_26879_the_default_server_seed/). It turned out to the Jungle. :(

BUT!!! A Lava area has been discovered (and I personally ran down there just to confirm it was legit) and added to the new map. And there is a discovered portal there too! yay!

Please let me know your feedback, and if there is there is anything else you'd like me to add.

##What is the ""Grid"" and what is generated on it?
***

The Grid is, for lack of a better term, the way the map is formatted. Essentially it is a set of lines that travel infinitely through Cube World that serve as guidelines on which **Cities**, **Dungeons**, **Portals**, and **Overworld Missions** (all of which will be simplified collectively as ""Locations"") are created. When these lines intersect, a location is generated. Without any context, take a look at **[this](http://i.imgur.com/ywy64fch.jpg)** to see what the grid looks like. After reading this post, it will hopefully make sense!

**The Grid is a guideline for you to travel along if you are hoping to discover more locations and can be useful when attempting to find portals in already-explored regions that you are no longer near.**

***
##Limitations of this post
***

Ultimately I can not do much about bringing in more data on my own. It takes time to explore, track down bosses and clear dungeons to ascertain plvl. Also, rather than exploring multiple landscapes within a single seed I am creating new seeds per trial in order to make screenshots of the map look tidy. The bonus of this is that these different seeds are still vastly different. My sample size right now is only 1 1/2 of two fully cataloged seeds and 1 seed that does not have any plvls tracked BUT has 90% of the spawning region fully explored, even between the grid spaces.

Also, all of this data has been tracked through gameplay, not from delving into the game's code / design. This is partly because I do not know how to do it (though it's not impossible to learn) and mostly because this is how I have fun in these types of games.

If you would like to contribute to this project, I'd very much prefer data that has not only the screenshot of grid exploration, but data on the plvl of that region + boss information if possible (what kind of spirit cube and what level). When clearing out a dungeon, the data is only valuable if the data was NOT marked as a mission location. Missions convert dungeons to the player's level rather than the generated level.

##Creating a Grid Guideline
***

The Grid is generated along cardinal directions (North, East, South, &amp; West). Each location is generated either within a chunk on in a merged section of chunks. Chunks are the squares you see on your map in the game.

The trick is to identify the spacing between each mark on the grid. So, starting with a Town, we can identify the first parts of the grid by drawing lines that expand over the cardinal directions: [Fig. 1](http://i.imgur.com/gxRzVLYh.jpg)

Also, it is worth noting that the spawn point on EVERY seed is South West of a City.

Now that we have the first intersection and guidelines, we can craft a grid. Each location is separated by roughly 8 chunks in a cardinal direction. When I first set out on this project I wasn't 100% sure how things would turn out so I didn't use a flat image of the map, so bear with me here: [Fig. 2](http://imgur.com/j2gBFx3)

(Not 100% to scale on chunks as you'll see in a bit, just a visual example).

Each intersection is a potential dungeon. If you do not find a dungeon, then it is either a portal (more on that in a bit) or Overworld Mission location.

This [album](http://imgur.com/a/PEg9a) can be helpful for people who want a bit more on generating the grid with the commentary of learning about it as I traveled it.

**Traveling the grid is as easy as following a cardinal direction from a location until you reach a new location.**

##What is plvl?
***

plvl, or Power Level, is the level rating system of Cube World that is relative to your character and enemies. For more information on how character level corresponds to power level, check out the **[wiki](http://wiki.cubeworldforum.org/index.php?title=Level)**.

(This is partly speculation) If your character is plvl 55, enemies and locations below plvl 45 will have their names show in white. Between 45 and 65 will show in blue. Above 65 and below 75 will show in orange. Above 75 will show in red.

Locations typically spawn with enemies at a set plvl, but drop items of varying plvl. Some of the dungeons near the spawn will have a plvl range of 1-1 and only drop plvl 1 items. Some will have a range of 1-14. Then as you start to level up more, the plvl range starts to swing over the bell curve. Most dungeons seem to favor being with a range of 10 plvls (25-35, 30-40, 90-100... etc) but there are still a few very niche ones that fill in for about 5 plvls (most common in later is 96-100, but I've seen a 77-82).

In addition to plvl, enemies can also be ranked as elites. This is represented by a **'+'** next to their name. For example: **Human+4**. All elite enemies are more difficult than +0 counterparts and drop higher quality loot. Here's a quick summary of the elite rankings:

* +1 = Green quality

* +2 = Blue quality

* +3 = Purple quality

* +4 = Yellow quality

Elite enemies only spawn in Dungeon locations generated along the grid, though some camps of that dungeon may lie outside the boundary.

Overworld Missions are set to a specific level. For example, the Troll mission will always be set to plvl23 iirc.

***
##How to find a location relative to your level
***

Unfortunately I do not yet have a definitive method to do this. I can, however, give a few observations based on exploration on multiple seeds:

* Low level dungeons will ALWAYS spawn near the town. Some may also spawn out further, but there will always be at least two dungeons possible to complete at level 1 directly connected to the City.

* Overworld mission locations favor spawning on the outskirts of a region and can be in large patches near each other. Occasionally they will spawn within the first extended radius of a town (see Seed 43110 in link below)

* Portals tend to favor spawning on the outer rim of a region (but not always. see Seed 101010 in the link below)

The first page on **[this workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqEJC1GHyz7ddEtjaFhPWktJallRZW5UNGNUcWNkZVE&amp;usp=sharing)** shows examples of how a location can be branched out. The individual seed sheets show location generation on the grid along with plvl information.

***
##How to find portals
***

Portals spawn along the grid just like everything else, but are not as easily noticeable.

I'll defer you to an earlier album I put together found **[here](http://imgur.com/a/TasGB)**

The most important thing to remember: Portals do not show up on the map unless you zoom in enough to see them. You can view them from any angle/tilt of the map so long as you are zoomed in enough, but it can still be difficult to find them for fast travel unless you know where previously discovered ones lie.

I plan to add more to it in the future as I have time to explore. Now that my warrior can handle it, I've been trying to kill bosses in every dungeon to also pull in Spirit Cube data in addition to plvl + grid.

***
##Predictions
***

I'll preface this with the disclaimer that I have no idea what will/will not be ultimately added to the game. This is mostly just informed guessing based on what exists and what has been mentioned by Wollay.

* **Portal generation will be adjusted in the future.** In their current form, the portal stones are not particularly useful. They're neat for traveling across multiple landscapes instantly but are generally so far from cities that their usefulness is questionable. A key factor in my reasoning is that cities are major pieces of the game; They are the only place you can buy/sell items (most importantly being flasks for potions and platinum coin use) or reset missions / instantly set the time to 7:00. My prediction is that they will either spawn near dungeon entrances or on a separate grid. I do not think they will be added to cities as Wollay already seems to have other plans for traveling between major locations. Plus I'm really hoping for scrolls of town portal or something similar.

* **Overworld missions will begin to scale in level.** The current format is fine for plvl 1 - 50, but I can almost 1-shot the Saurian boss on my Warrior with Smash. More importantly, there have been some item models uncovered that were hidden in the game files that seem to be related to overworld bosses.\

* **Boss health and AI will be finely tuned in future updates.** After killing every boss in every dungeon I've gone through, I've noticed inconsistencies in health pools that might be from some sort of math error. For example, an Orc Rogue plvl 94 (based on loot dropped) took about 2 minutes to kill, but a Human Rogue plvl 88 took about 6 minutes. And this isn't just as a result of having to kite / heal / dodge more or not -- My smash crits for about 2200 on both. On the plvl 94 Orc, it did about 6% of its HP in damage. On the plvl 88 Human it did about 2%. And I'm just hopeful the AI is developed to make combat more interesting than stun-and-run.

* **CPU usage and Blue Fog will be optimized in the future.** This is a given, but probably worth saying to calm the fears of others. I honestly can't explore too quickly because I hit blue fog walls fairly often. My GPU is great, but my CPU not so much. Built this duo core rig the summer before they started announcing quads and a teased the intel sandy bridge. It's an Alpha and the game has not been fully optimized yet.

* **The grid will remain in all future updates.** For an infinitely expanding world to work, you're going to have to cut some level of immersion / randomness to relieve people of the stress of finding new locations and make the generation easier to achieve. Hopefully the plvl distribution will be adjusted in the future, too. If you look at the google docs link, you'll see that there always seems to be a higher level dungeon directly connected to a town that can leave players with a bad taste in their mouth.

* **Random packs of enemies/creatures off the grid will scale in level, but not like humanoids.** While they do already have level ranges (I'm sure you've come across a pack of enemies such as Wolves that have different colored names), they do not scale to player level nor distance from spawn/cities. And in case you didn't already know this: The random roaming humanoid packs (both friendly and hostile) will ALWAYS have blue names. They are generated to scale with your level. I think it would be great if these packs could also be randomly assigned elite values instead of always being +0, but I'm not sure what the design intent is there. I am pretty sure the design intent is to put tougher mobs further out from the city, though.

* **Ocean and Lava regions will be revisited in the future and have different/new/updated Dungeons added.** Wollay has already gone on the record to say he plans to add underwater content in the future (looking at you, Ocean landscapes). Trees and Lakes seem out of place in the Lava region in most cases and the pyramids seem a bit weird when there's a complete lack of ruins, catacombs, castles and stuff that have the potential to look awesome there.

* **Level scaling will stay relatively the same, even if there are some adjustments to distribution.** By this I mean each region will ALWAYS have dungeons that are set to a plvl range. If you're plvl 1, there's still going to be 90-100 dungeons. If you're plvl 100, there's still going to be 1-1 dungeons. Same goes to my earlier prediction about random packs receiving some scaling. Skull Bulls will still always be above plvl 70 (clvl 46). Sheep will always be below plvl 20 (clvl 6).

I've seen a lot of new people just learning about the game now joining the subreddit, so I compiled a list of all the major points of the game.  This is meant for people who are just coming to the subreddit for their information regarding the game, and hopefully will serve as a quick way to see all the information.

Most of the information in this post came straight from the website.  Much of it is direct quotes or paraphrasing.  This is a *zero speculation* post.  If you see any errors in the content or spelling (this was all typed manually), or have any additions, feel free to comment.

------------------------------------------------

**CUBE WORLD**

**Pricing**
&gt;* The Alpha Version will be available at a lower price than the Beta version and the Final version.
* Updates will be released regularly.
* Updates are free.

**System Requirements**
&gt;* **OS**: Windows XP SP2, Vista, 7, and 8
* **CPU**: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz, Core i3 or AMD Athlon 64 X2
* **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce 7800, ATI X1800, Intel HD 3000 (256MB of vRAM and Shader Model 3.0)
* **RAM**: 2GB
* An Internet Connection is required for Updates and Online Multiplayer

**The World**
&gt;* Landscapes are generated procedurally using math and random numbers.
* The World Map is a zoomable, turnable, 3D voxel map.
* Seeds can be used to make the same exact world again.
* Worlds are generated during gameplay.  This means no long precomputations or large save files when the world is initially created.
* There are no artificial borders.
* There are multiple climates and themes including: Greenlands, Snowlands, Deserts, Jungles, Lava Lands, and Oceans.
* Common areas are now called ""Lands of ..."" ^[[Source]](https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/264674626536366080)
* Special quest areas of names like ""X Mountains"" ^[[Source]](https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/264674626536366080)
* Some special land names also depend on climate. ^[[Source]](https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/264675227647213568)

**Adventure**
&gt;* Five major adventuring skills include: Climbing, Swimming, Diving, Hang Gliding, and Sailing.
* There are Dungeons integrated seamlessly into the world. These are full of rare loot, stronger than normal enemies, and bosses.
* Different types of Dungeons include: Castles, Ruins, Temples, Pyramids, and Catacombs.
* There are also Overworld Dungeons, which are less structured and consist of disconnected buildings.  They will have a boss somewhere in the center.
* Portals can be found in the world, and players can quickly teleport between discovered portals.
* Everyday in Cube World, new missions are made available that send the player to a dungeon or boss monster.
* Because new missions are made available everyday, you can stay in the same land forever should you choose to.
* Mission rewards include: Weapons, Armor, and Platinum Coins.
* Platinum Coins are used to upgrade Weapons and Armor.

**Classes**
&gt;* There are four main classes: Warriors, Rangers, Mages, and Rogues.
* **Warriors** use charged attacks (building up MP with normal attacks to charge up powerful special attacks).  They are heavily armored melee fighters, and use one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, and shields.  [[Click here for even more details on the Warrior class]](https://picroma.com/blog/post/2)
* **Rangers** similarly to Warriors use charged attacks, but with ranged weapons.  They use bows, crossbows, and boomerangs.
* **Mages** cast spells that have varying cast times.  Normal attacks are faster, while special attacks have longer cast times and consume MP.  They use wands, staffs, and bracelets that can attack enemies, heal allies, and protect themselves.
* **Rogues** are more fast paced and the special attacks are instant.  They are agile melee fighters that focus on stealth and evasion.  They wield daggers, fist weapons, and longswords.

**Class Specializations**
&gt;* Each major class has two specializations that change playstyle and the abilities of that class.
* Specialization can be changed at the class trainer.
* **Warriors** can specialize into:
* *Berserker*: Attack speed increases with each hit.  Attacks charge more quickly.
* *Guardian*: Can block attacks with all weapons.  Has increased health.  Can become immune against stun attacks.
* **Rangers** can specialize into:
* *Sniper*: Has camoflauge and aim abilities.  Attack speed increases with each hit.
* *Scout*: Special attacks have a chance to become instantly chargeable.  Can sprint.
* **Mages** can specialize into:
* *Fire*: Special attacks have a chance to become instantly chargeable.  Can cast fire explosions.
* *Water*: Attack speed is increased with each hit.  Has healing spells.
* **Rogues** can specialize into:
* *Assassin*: Special attacks increase stealth.  Has improved stealth abilities.
* *Ninja*: Dodges during special attacks.  Can throw shurikens.

**Skills and Progression**
&gt;* With each gained level, players can assign skill points into a skill tree.
* There are both class specific skills (attacks / spells) and common skills (adventure skills).
* Your character's progression is infinite.  You can level up infinitely and put infinitely many skill points into skill trees.
* This does not mean you become infinitely powerful.
* The power of players, creatures, items, and skills don't scale linearly or exponentially, but rather tangentially.
* So while levels can be between one and infinity, the corresponding power is between 1 and 100.  A power of 100 can only be reached with an infinite level.
* In lower levels, power increments are more notable than in higher levels.
* For each world, the game generates creatures and dungeons evenly in all power ranges (1-100).  This way the player can travel freely from land to land and always be sure to find creatures and dungeons of similar power.
* The advantages to this are: no level cap, player has no feeling of an end-game, and your power cannot be infinite.

**Combat**
&gt;* Based on player skill, movement, and reaction.
* Skilled players can beat high level monsters, while lesser skilled players can be beaten by low level creatures.
* **Manual Aiming** means enemies must be targeted manually with the crosshair.  There is no target locking in melee or ranged combat.
* **Active Dodging** means that most attacks can be dodged with good reaction and proper timing.  Dodging will cost stamina and makes you immune to damage for a short amount of time.  Skilled players can avoid damage regardless of the strength of the opponent.
* All creatures have armor (decreases physical damage) and resistance (decreases magic damage).
* **Combos** mean that every successive time you hit an opponent, you get a combo point.  The more combo points you have, the more armor and resistance of your enemy is ignored.  Skilled players will be able to deal damage against high level enemies.
* Special attacks have a chance to stun opponents.  Stunned enemies are easy to hit, can't heal, and can't deal damage.

**Races**
&gt;* There are currently eight playable races including: Elves, Humans, Goblins, Lizardmen, Dwarves, Orcs, Frogmen, and Undeads.
* There are separate models for males and females.
* They have different voices.
* There are no class-race restrictions.
* Characters are customizable during character creation by choosing a combination of face, hair, and hair color.
* Lizardmen have scales rather than hair and Frogmen have different eyes.

**Pets**
&gt;* Players can have a pet accompany them on their journeys and assist in combat.
* Players can have as many pets as they want, but only **one** can be active at a time.
* Remaining pets are stored in a special pet bag in the inventory.
* Most animals and some monsters can be tamed.
* In order to tame a pet, you feed it with it's favorite food.
* There are five major pet categories: Melee, Ranged, Tank, Healer, and Mount.
* **Melee Pets** are the most common and attack from close range.
* **Ranged Pets** shoot bullets from a distance.
* **Tank Pets** deal less damage but have high endurance and generate more aggro.
* **Healer Pets** have healing abilities that can heal the player and friends.
* **Mount Pets** are ridable and enable fast traveling.

**Monsters**
&gt;* Common monsters include: Slimes, Zombies, Ogres, Skeletons, Vampires, Werewolves, and many more.
* Boss monsters are the strongest creatures in the game.
* Defeating a boss monster requires lots of skill and experience.  Players need to study their attacks and react properly.
* Defeating a boss monster gives valuable rewards including: rare weapons, rare armor, and lots of experience.
* Some bosses are: Trolls, Dark Trolls, Yetis, Cyclops, Saurian, Mammoth, Lich, Golem, Ember Golem, Snow Golem, and Hell Demon.

**Items and Crafting**
&gt;* Items can be obtained from: enemies, treasure chests, missions, and vendors.
* Items can be crafted from: Weapon crafting, Armor crafting, Jewel crafting, Cooking, and Alchemy.  Many crafts require recipes and ingredients.
* **Weapon Crafting**: Each class can craft weapons available to that class.
* **Armor Crafting**: Each class can craft armor available to that class.
* **Jewel Crafting**: All classes can craft rings and amulets.  These have secondary stats that are useful for all classes.
* **Cooking**: Players can craft food for cheap out-of-combat healing or buffs.
* **Alchemy**: Players can craft healing potions and other useful potions.

**Weapon Customization**
&gt;* Weapons can be upgraded and customized on a per-voxel basis.
* As an example, Iron Swords can be upgraded with Iron Cubes which can be freely placed on the weapon.  This increases damage and changes the looks of the weapon.
* **Spirit Cubes** are rare magic cubes that are obtained by defeating bosses.  They are more powerful than normal cubes and have additional effects when placed on a weapon.
* Spirit Cubes have four potential effects: Fire, Wind, Ice, and Unholy.
* **Fire** spirit deals additional fire damage.
* **Wind** spirit increases attack and movement speed of the player.
* **Ice** spirit slows attack and movement speed of the target.
* **Unholy** spirit deals damage to the target and heals the player.

**Multiplayer**
&gt;* Multiplayer is optional and the game can be played completely offline.

——————————

So, you wanna be a fire mage? Got a love for all things toasty? Your idea of a hot night out is immolating your date? Love the smell of fresh napalm in the morning? If so, than this is the class for you! Here are some tips and guidelines to ensure your survival, so lets get down to... *SEAR*-ious business!    
- **You're Not Doing Yourself Any Favors**: Unfortunately, as it stands currently, water mages are simply better. They can achieve similar damage to us while having uber-utility in heals. In group situations they're unique skill is an asset, while yours is an annoyance. That said, I find fire to be *INFINITELY* more fun to play, which trumps any min/maxing.     
    
- **Ding! Oven's Pre-Heated (Fire Spark)**: Fire Mages unique passive, Fire Spark, allows them to instantly cast their M2 ability for free. This is proc'd by hitting enemies with your M1 abilities and is indicated by a loud ""DING"" and a fire aura surrounding your character. This allows for a lot of potential burst/stuns when used in chains or off dodges. Try to use this ability as soon as you can, since any additional procs are wasted while it's up. It's also useful as a quick stun that can be fired between dodges (I.E. dodge -&gt; fire -&gt; dodge).  
    
- **(Don't) Let Me Stand Next To Your FIRRRRE (Explosion)**: Hendrix FTW. Along with Fire Spark, us pyros get the ""Explosion"" skill. This skill is a short-casted point blank area of effect that causes mediocre damage, but will usually knockback and/or stun anyone caught in the blast radius. This means we trade off healing from water for a more crowd-control role. It also has a very quick cooldown, making it usable to chain stun enemies. This can be cast while running/jumping and should be used anytime you need to get someone away from you. It can also be used offensively by pushing a group into a wall, bunching them up for easy AE melting.   
    
- **Don't Stand In The Fire!! (Mobility)**: Standing still is for those fat, lazy water mages. We need to stay light on our toes. Since you can't heal, you gotta be dodging, teleporting, and mana shielding whenever you can to avoid taking damage. Combine this with explosion, or insta-cast M2s, and you'll be dropping groups without breaking a sweat. For best results, combine this technique with...    
        
- **Too Hot To Handle (Using Line of Sight)**: Ranger/Mages got you down? Go hide behind a wall. If they can't see you, they're gonna run to a spot where they can. Use this to your advantage. Pull groups around a corner and you'll have ranged stacked up with melee. If you're retreating, you can use Explosion here to scatter your enemies or start firing away as soon as they round the bend for some awesome AE goodness.    
    
- **Bringing The Heat! (Gear/Pet Choices)**: For gear, a nice mix of tempo and crit will do you good. I favor crit, but you definitely want some tempo, especially if you wanna use staff. As for weapons, check out the breakdowns below. I personally recommend carrying bracelets or wands for soloing and staff for grouping. 
-----*Bracelets*: Single-shot M1 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; M2. This is my personal preference for soloing. The pros lie in their mobility. Each attack fires super quick and is easy to weave in between dodges. The DPS is probably the lowest, but since it's easier to hit and aim with, it is still very deadly. Also, these are just fun, for me at least. One major drawback for bracelets though is the fact that they are dual wielded, meaning you need two of them to drop to be useful. Makes upgrading to better damage a pain in the ass.      
-----*Wands*: Single-shot M1, Three-shot burst M2. Wands are middle of the road, not as mobile as bracelets, not as powerful as staves. All-in-all a decent choice, especially if you tend to lag, since M2 can be moved while being fired, so much so that you can hit/stun targets that are far apart by swinging the mouse after first shot is fired. Another note, each shot can crit independently and even hit a target that dodges (they try to dodge first shot and end up getting hit by the last shot). That said I found two drawbacks; you have to lead targets with M2 if they are moving perpendicular to you and I have yet to find a wand that doesn't look down-right stupid...    
-----*Staves*: Ground-targeted Tornado M1 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; M2. Staves are a skill-check weapon, requiring a lot more attention to detail to get the full benefit. They are very strong, with each attack consisting of several hits in quick succession if enemies are in tornado radius. Each of these hits can crit and and proc Fire Spark.  This damage gets insane when you have groups that are bunched up, or you drop a proc'd M2 on top of a M1. To add to this damage, staves are very good at quickly building combo streaks, which makes it a great choice for fights that would take longer (bosses, high HP targets, etc.). It's not all love, though. Spells are slow to cast and dodging will cancel M2 even after it's been fully cast. Add to this the fact that since tornados are ground targeted, enemies can move out of the effect before every hit is delivered. It is also difficult to pull at range, since you gotta aim for where your enemy will be, not where they currently are. Compare this to bracelet or wand shots which can be fired down a line and will be almost guaranteed to hit (AI pathing is very simple in this game). All that being said, if you are good with the staff and can master the timing necessary to still be mobile, go for it! The damage is great and worth carrying for group situations where you won't (hopefully) be tanking.     
  
As for pets, no competition here: turtle. Hands down best pet in game. Naturally tanky, has spin attack, and can stun. If you want a ranged, Spitter is best, Snout Beetle is okay. Pet won't make a huge difference, so you are free to roll with whatever, but min/maxers want dat turtle.    

- **Sparkin' It Up (Early Levels)**: When leveling, I found this skill order to be very effective and efficient.      
---*L1-3:* Points go into Explosion to unlock Mana Shield. Mana Shield is an amazing survival skill and is definitely your first priority. Points in Explosion also benefit survivability through better CC options. 
---*L4-6:* Points go into either Pet HP for Riding skill or Climbing for Hang Gliding. This is down to personal preference, with pets being better for solo players and gliding better for co-op players. 
---*L7-9:* Points go into Mana Shield to unlock Teleport. Teleport is another survival skill, with some niche travel uses. It's nice to have, but hardly mandatory and will be fine with a one point investment. 
---*L10+:* I'd say pump up Mana Shield, best use of points. Mine sat at 10 for awhile, did me good. Its also a good time to level up travel skill, since by now, you're probably hiking a ways to get to next dungeons. The higher level you get, the less useful points are, so at this point you can't go wrong, do what ya want. If you want a boat, go nuts!    
        
- **Playing With Fire (Last Tip)**: This is, by far, the most important tip. Have fun with it. Seriously, its a new game, and even though we might be ""gimped"" in comparison to water mages, at the end of the day it comes down to what you like doing. I found Water Mages to be painfully boring, YMMV. With advanced skill trees coming, we'll probably be seeing a lot of changes, so for now, just focus on having fun!

RE performance, I too am experiencing rather crap performance - even turning down fps limiter to 20fps and using SMCFanControl at max (6500 rpm) still gave me mostly unplayable gameplay.  *sigh*, more research required!

Need I say more?  ^.^  
I've been following the news on the crossover port - it was working on linux, but still no cake for intel cards.  Problem fixed ;)  
For the record I'm running the macbook air haswell (i7/8g/256gb) and it works fairly well for an alpha game and unsupported port.  Instructions below, enjoy.  

1)  Download the Crossover trial (Or full version if you have it) from here: [linky](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/)  
2)  Download the .tie file from here:  [linky](http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=11886)  
3)  Double click the .tie file / open it in crossover, and do ""Choose installer file"" and select CubeLauncher.exe, and finish that installation using the prompts  
4)  In crossover go to ""Programs &gt; Run Command"" and type ""regedit"" and launch that  
5)  Navigate to ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; software &gt; Wine"" and right click &gt; new ""key"", call it ""Direct3D"" and create a new string value called ""useGLSL"" and modify that to ""enabled""  
6)  Close out regedit, and do run program again and select your cubelauncher.exe (OR if you have already authenticated you can do cube.exe to skip the launcher) and run!  

If I've missed anything please let me know, these steps are primarily from memory as at the moment I'm struggling with my own problems relating to overheating - testing fps limits ;)  

I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do, I personally bought in the first stages before the store committed suicide, and now I can play it - and it's a damn nice game.

Just imagine being able to throw a hook onto any block and then being able to swing around and climb on the rope attached to it, or it could be more like Just Cause 2, using it in conjunction with the Hang Glider to reach new speeds and heights.

I will post a video of a typical run later, it is currently rendering. From the 4-5 runs I have done so far I usually get 5 legendaries, 4-6 epics. I'll post screencaps since it can be difficult to find.

The power level of the items is around 52 and I recommend you to be around power 80 to efficiently farm this dungeon, however anything around 50+ should be able to do it, however with friends this becomes much easier. (although you have to then share the loot)

On topic: Here's a discussion!

What's your favorite character/spec to play solo/in a party?

My favorite to solo right now is a Ranger/Scout Spec with a Boomerang,
because he's versatile with his high dps/stun output, and the quick combo buildup is killer. 

For party play I like to run a watermage for its awesome healing abilities, combined with the bracelets to work with the passive of the water mage you dump out insane amounts of damage, while creating a buttload of healing pools underneath the enemy to keep your melees healed!

What's your opinion on favorites? Share them here! :3

This can be done by Googling ""Port forwarding on Router xxxxx"" where Router xxxxx is your make and model of your router.  Set the port to 12345 and restart your router.  
2. Double click Server.exe and let it run in the background.  There is no need to type anything inside of this prompt.  It is used to notify you when others connect.
3. Google ""What is my ip address"" and at the top of google it should say ""Your public IP address is xx.xx.xx.xx""
4. tell your friends your public IP address so that when they sign into CubeWorld, they used this address. (it is unnecessary for them to use the :12345"" at the end of the IP when typing into CubeWorld)
5. you must also connect to this server to join them.  (even if the server is running on your comp.

Note: This has nothing to do with a multiplayer world (thats for LAN)
Note: IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO HOST A SERVER

Hope this helps.

ps: I do have the game, no I'm not handing it out (please do not ask) and even if I did the game doesn't work without a proper account.

Edit 1: It is important to note that when you're in the menu, you have three options:  
A) Create Multiplayer world  -- This is a LAN GAME not a server world  
B) Create Single Player World   -- This is a normal Single player world

Also, a tutorial:

1) Download/unzip the latest version of Vireio ( http://www.vireio.com/files/Perception_1.1.0.zip )

2) In the \Perception\cfg\ folder open the profiles.xml file and add the following line to the end of the file, just before &lt;/profiles&gt;:
&lt;profile game_name=""Cube World"" game_exe=""Cube.exe"" game_type=""100"" separation=""0"" convergence=""0.169193"" swap_eyes=""false"" yaw_multiplier=""25"" pitch_multiplier=""25"" roll_multiplier=""1"" /&gt;

3) In the \Perception\bin\ folder open the Perception.exe application and make sure it is set to Oculus Rift and OculusTrack (if you have a rift)

4) In your Cube World install directory, open options.cfg and edit the following:
resolutionX 1920
resolutionY 1200
cameraSpeed 10

5) Start Cube World as you would normally

Note: some people may need to copy the d3d9.dll, hijackdll.dll and libfreespace.dll files from the \Perception\bin\ folder directly into their Cube World install directories before launching Perception.exe.  I didn't have to.

After playing with this a bit, I'd definitely say that ""1st person""/""zoomed in mode"" is not the best for play.  This is because of a small FOV (if there is a way to manually configure it then please let me know).  3rd person however is great and the environments are still really immersive.  3rd person still needs an FOV adjustment, but it's less drastic.

The snow runner and Leaf runner are **UNCOMFIRMED**, they are just Martyn's personal guess based on what the other two took, and items that they had in game.

Edit: Got it

Just gonna toss in some other stuff I've heard about pets now that this has gotten pretty popular.

A level 3 **Turtle** had somewhere above 400 hp, which was more than someone else's level 14 or so **Horse** on Martyn's stream today, so they seem to be ideal for tanking and the like.

Monkies are tamable, are found in the Jungle biome, but I personally did not hear them say what tamed them. However, it was apparently a bug that you could ride a monkey, and Wollay removed it, so not all animals will be rideable it seems.

1373567116.0,66,self.CubeWorld,1i3i1q,"Gliding: Hints and Tricks for Non-Rangers (And Rangers, too!)",74,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1i3i1q/gliding_hints_and_tricks_for_nonrangers_and/,"The following is a brief note of some hang-gliding boost methods that may not have yet been noticed/realized, plus some of the more well known ones.

**Rogues**

I've noticed a neat little trick with the rogue's Ninja specialization. Namely, that using your third ability mid-glide will cause you to leap upwards, and you can immediately pull your glider out again at any point during the leap. 

This gives you a nice height boost, but the best part is, while leaping, you will regenerate stamina, increasing overall glide time significantly.

As well as this, if you have a friend on the ground (Or see some NPC combat, or have high enough damage to one hit an enemy with your 3), you can get a hit on them from afar, and continue gliding, allowing you to gather experience without ever touching ground and ever losing any speed.  

I've currently only tested this with my brand new rogue (Edit: 25 in 3rd ability, 10 in hang-gliding), and would estimate an approx 30% increase in flight time using this, primarily due to the restored stamina. 

I'll note that the rogue's second ability can also be used to restore stamina, but as it gives you forward momentum rather than upward, it can very easily cause you to use more than you gain, due to rapid dropping in use. However, if done quickly, it seems to give a slight bit more than used, and will give you a bit of extra distance due to the rapid forward dash.

**Mage**

Only a quick note here, in that their third ability (The teleport), if used while falling or gliding, (and assuming it does not hit any blocks in its range), will teleport you to the closest block below you at the end of the abilities range. What does this mean? It means that if you're a million miles up in the air, about to fall to your death, you can teleport and appear safely on the ground with no fall damage! 

**General**

Just a quick explanation of the more common methods of longer gliding.

*Ranger Retreat Gliding*

Face away from the place you wish to go, pull out your glider, and use retreat, and you'll fly extremely fast. Note that this is a momentum effect, and turning/changing direction will be extremely awkward. Also of note is that while using this bug, you will actually *rise* when holding space, rather than just maintaining altitude.

*Infinite Flight*

Mid-glide, hold space and press enter once to open the chat box. Then simply don't press anything. Even once your stamina is drained, you'll continue to fly at the same altitude, though you will be unable to control your movement, and after a short time, your glider will start to waver, turn, stop, or otherwise move oddly. Press enter again to end this glitch, but note that this will leave you in mid air with no stamina. 

*TO THE MOON!*

The combination of the above two. You will rise forever. 

*Bomb Flight*

Using any bomb (preferably one of a lower level, so not to hurt yourself too much), you can give your flight a small boost. Simply place the bomb, stand in front of it, and start gliding just as it explodes.

*Prat Fall (Or, You are Link)*

If you fall off a cliff, you can hold shift and the dodge button (Middle mouse) to dodge as soon as you hit the ground, allowing you to ignore fall damage. Not technically a glider trick, though, as it never seems to work for me when doing this from a glide.

This will be for MSI Afterburner but if anyone has any other programs they use, please list them and I will add links and how-to for those other programs.

**EDIT 1:** Here's a 1-picture guide for the MIS Afterburner information below: [Image](http://i.imgur.com/kqcPyaK.gif)


**EDIT 2:** If your 'More' button is greyed out, /u/Ichimaruu says this:
&gt;I found out, go to 'monitoring' then you want to enable GPU Temperature in On-Screen Display at the bottom, just check that box.
Now go back to 'On-screen Display' and it should be available.

**First download this:**

[MSI Afterbruner.](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm)

Afterburner has an FPS limiter and also some other tools like temp/fps/v-memory etc. It should work for Nvidia and AMD cards, I have no clue if it works with integrated as I only have a desktop.

**Limiting the FPS:**


1. Once you install the program, there should be an icon in your tray that looks like this: [Image 1.](http://i.imgur.com/2Q6HiDR.png)

2. Click on the tray icon to open this screen, then select settings.
[Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/KwL6wXo.png)
 
3. After you open the settings menu there will be some tabs at the top, go to **On-Screen Display** and click the **More** button near the bottom. Once you do this click the big **PLUS +** sign and find the cube.exe in your game folder. Next make sure you have it highlighted in the list, then click the **wrench** at the top right and it should have a box where you can enter the limit you want. Here is an image of what I just explained: [Image 3.](http://i.imgur.com/auaYCa4.png) **Make sure you minimize both windows. If you close them the settings won't save and Afterburner will close.**


**Some NVIDIA Tips:** If you are going to enable v-sync and find yourself with bad input lag I found that enabling triple-buffering and v-sync in NVIDIA Control Panel aswell as limiting the FPS to 59 instead of 60 (if your monitor is 60hz, idk about others) it will reduce the input lag by a lot. If you decide to just limit the FPS you will be fine.

**DXTORY:** Refer to this thread [linky.](http://www.overclock.net/t/1184518/how-do-i-use-dxtory-to-limit-my-fps)

**EVGA Precision:** Refer to this [thread here.](http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=357381)

**RADEON PRO:** Refer to this image, the option is called[ Dynamic Frame Control](http://media.bestofmicro.com/V/A/357526/original/Radeon-Pro.png)

• This game isn't difficult. Don't get me wrong, I've died a lot, but it's not difficult. It's not penalizing, either I go to attack something and I don't make it, in which case I either die and respawn five secounds away, or I manage to murder him and move on.
  
EDIT: To clarify, while there are things that instantly kill you, and things that are really hard to kill, there's no punishment for not killing them, and there's not real point in killing them. ( Usually, the reward of killing a really difficult guy is not very different from the way easier. )
  
• The graphics are beautiful, but not *THAT* beautiful. Pixel and cube graphics in general is overrated in my opinion. While I like floating around on my hang glider looking at the world, it does get old.

And here are my own thoughts on the game;

• For an alpha, this game is very complete. I've found maybe 5-10 MINOR bugs, and generally nothing disturbing else. 
  
• Weapon customization is very well done and enjoyable. I've spent a lot of time working on a few great weapons to make them look better, and feel personalized. Really good.    
  
• The most annoying part of the game is the menus. The inventory, crafting menu, options, ETC. These all have quite a few flaws, you can't walk with the menus up, for example.  
  
• Infinite leveling is not a good idea ***in my opinion***, it feels like instead of my power scaling slowing down you could just cap my level altogether, or atleast make me feel like there's a point where I've accomplished something. Now there's always a higher level, but you slowly stop gaining power for it, which is annoying.    
  
• This game is very ""grind-ish"", but, they somehow get away with it. The only thing you do is grind away at things and then get rewarded with minor things that you can do while not grinding, and yet it makes you only see the good and exciting moments.    
  
• There's a lot of travelling. Of the time I've been playing, I would assume that ATLEAST 2/3 of it was spent on flying towards the next place to go. Luckily, the game gave us hang gliders, meaning that it's not strictly boring to fly around. Just not very enjoyable either.    
  
• Riding/Swimming/Sailing seem like pretty bad skills to me. Riding is pretty much crap when compared to hang gliding, even on flat land. You rarely need to swim or sail (Generally the only times that you would need to swim faster or sail faster is when travelling over oceans, which won't happen very often / can still be done using hang gliding. )  
  
• Different biomes are brilliant. It mostly doesn't really change anything at all, but it makes the game feel more alive and makes travelling less of a pain when you can just switch out to the desert after being bored of the snow. ( Snow biome is the best one by the way. )

Since joining this Subreddit a few days ago, I have seen nothing but ranting posts/comments about slow updates and leaving CubeWorlders in the dark. I have several high-level characters, and I still think the game is fun. Coming from me, personally, I never had the patience to play WoW, and Minecraft is just a snooze-fest now (Played since 1.2 beta)... But I think for an alpha, this game was worth $20, and I think it deserves more recognition than it is getting. Leave a comment/argument, and I'll probably see to your reasoning.

**[FINAL UPDATE NUMBER !] Current Twitter Post from Wollay's [twitter](https://twitter.com/wol_lay):**

&gt;You can also install it to a different location and copy save files if you worry about your working installation.

- AND

&gt;The new launcher is necesary to fix the updating system which overloaded the site yesterday.

- AND

&gt;We have finished the new launcher.
Everyone who has the game so far should download it from the 'My Games' section.


- **Q: Is Cubeworld available for purchase?**

&gt;- A: The Alpha build has been released to the public, but due to server issues, the online shop has been taken down.


- **Q: How much does it cost?**

&gt;- A: About 15 euros. |||| [Click here for that amount in US Dollars](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=15&amp;From=EUR&amp;To=USD). |||| [Click here for that amount in British Pounds](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=15&amp;From=EUR&amp;To=GBP).

- **Q: Exactly what does the 15 euro's Get me?**

&gt;- A: You will get access to the Alpha release of the game, as well as all other future versions of the game with no additional purchases required. [Source](http://cubeworldforum.org/index.html/_/wuww/) (Please note that Wollay makes no mention of any DLC and what that may cost should he impliment it. So I cannot say that the DLC will be free.)


- **Q: What methods of payment are there?**

&gt;- A: Currently, reports (^thanks ^/u/ZaccieV ) indicate that you can only pay through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), however others have said that you can also pay with your credit/debit card, and that the transaction is just processed through pay-pal.


- **Q: Why can't I buy it?**

&gt;- A: Currently (As of 12:00pm EST) the shop page has been disabled due to the massive amount of server traffic.


- **Q: When will the servers be up?**

&gt;- A: There is no clear estimate, however you can stay up-to-date with the status by following along with Wollay's [twitter](https://twitter.com/wol_lay)


- **Q: I downloaded the demo, so why can't I play?**

&gt;- A: The Demo is a *Tech demo*. It is meant to see if your computer can handle running the demo. If it get's to the main-menu screen with the exit button and the Website's link, your computer should be able to run Cubeworld.

- **Q: Do the multiplayer servers require Port-forwarding?**

&gt;- A: Yes.


- **Q: What port do I need to use for port-forwarding?**

&gt;**- A: The port used is ""[12345](http://i.imgur.com/QvNBZEA.png)"". Picture courtasy of /u/ zarradeth**


- **Q: I bought the game! Yaaay! But it doesn't show up in the ""My Games"" Section! Wat Do?**

&gt;- A: Wollay is currently working on fixing this issue, and it should be finished soon. I would advise following Wollay's [twitter](https://twitter.com/wol_lay) to stay up-to-date on the issue.
 

- **Q: Is there a Max level in the game?**

&gt;- A: According to several sources, there *is not* a max level in the game, however all equipment maxes out at +100 Powerlevel for the time being. If anyone else has more information, please let me know.

- **Q: I want to pwn face once I get in-game! What's the strongest class for that?**

&gt;- A: Currently, the Water mage is considered the strongest class in the game due to the fact that it has healing spells as well as good damage dealing.

- **Q: How do I use the Hang Glider?**

&gt;- A: You have to unlock the skill to use the hang glider by putting 5 skill points into climbing, then 1 into hang gliding. The same for unlocking the ability to use boats, as well as riding pets.


~~If anyone knows *for sure* what ports are used when hosting a server, or if you are able to select your own, could you please let me know so I can post that here. I cannot find any info on that currently.~~ Confirmed by /u/zarradeth. Give him your sweet sweet upvote love.


~~**I am going to be in a meeting at my work from 1 pm - 2 Pm. Durring that time I will be unable to update this list, but when I return, I will add in any new information that pops up**~~

~~Back to business.~~

~~Back at work and back to updating this thing. Honestly speaking, there are no new developments as to how soon we will see the shop opened up as of yet. We know that Wollay was awake at least 6 hours ago, but he has not tweeted anything as to the status of the shop in 12 hours.~~

Just got home from work. Looks like there are some new developments.

Here's my best tips:

* Never EVER be cocky. You'll probably end up dying.

* If you're gonna play alone, water mage isn't a good choice. EDIT: Seems like it is a pretty good choice after all, thanks for clearing this up and sorry for misinforming!

* When leveling up early in the game, don't start with upgrading your climbing/swimming/pet skills. Focus on unlocking all your combat abilities, they will help you get to 
higher levels.

* When visiting a town make sure to stockpile lots of bottles. (buy 50 bottles, fill them with water and make as many potions as you can - buy 50 more bottles and fill as many as you can with water - buy as many more bottles as you can. This will be very helpful for when you don't have access to a town for a long period of time.

* Turtles and spitters are great pets. Turles because they have very high health and can stun the enemy - spitters because they are ranged mobs who output quite an amount of damage and can heal you (i've only heard this last thing from a friend, and i can't comfirm it.)

When I would get a ""please wait"" screen it would take forever to load, then I would move 2 feet and fog would come back and another loading screen.

My friends were not having this problem. We were all connected to my server, hosted on my laptop. I was using my PC to play the game. So if it wasn't the server, and my friends were not getting loading screens then it was something with my PC.

After several attempts to fix the problem using everything I found on here and other forums, I tried something then magically... no more loading screens, and fog stays away nearly all the time.

What I did was use a program called Defraggler and did a check on the Cube World folder. (right click folder and select defraggler, then check)  Several files were fragmented, mainly the server world file. After i defragged just the cube world folder my game has never ran smoother. I only got two loading screens in 8 hours of game play, but that was on the ocean traveling at 200% speed. the loading screen only lasted maybe 1-3 seconds, rather than 10+ seconds.

This helped my game so I do not know if it will work for others.

TL:DR- Defragged Cube World folder with defraggler, nearly no loading times.

Edit: I'm sorry if this made your game worst, I do not know why it would do that. Defragging the folder makes all the files in one area of the HDD making it access them faster. I have not had any of the blue fog problems since. The only problem i had was around 6 hours into playing on my server it was starting to lag, but I don't know if this was the server problem or the ton of spitters attacking. Resetting server fixed that. ",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1373387421.0,,,True,t3_1hwvwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hwvwt/how_i_fixed_my_blue_fog_or_the_many_please_wait/,

I think you might be wondering why I brought up the full price and I felt like Minecraft was a first of its kind and not comparing Cube World to Minecraft but saying as a lot of people had no clue what Minecraft was till down the road. Where Cube World would not benefit as much if it went cheaper now and expensive down the road since I think most of us are locked into buying it at full price no matter what.

As I'm sure most of you have noticed, the formulas used to calculate skills have diminishing returns built in. What this means is that every skill point you add gives less of a buff than the previous skill point. Anyway, so this is what I have come up with:

* **Pet Master:** 40 points -&gt; 40% increase in HP

* **Riding:** 30 points -&gt; 175% speed

* **Climbing:** 29 points -&gt; 75% reduction in stamina usage

* **Hang Gliding:** 50 points -&gt; 400% speed

* **Swimming:** 40 points -&gt; 90% speed

* **Sailing:** 50 points -&gt; 350% speed 

**TOTAL:** 239 points -&gt; Level 120

Once you reach these levels, it is somewhat useless to increase the amount of points dumped into any given skill. If you have tonnes of points to dump, though, I'd suggest climbing.

For a rogue (ninja):

* **Intercept:** 50 points -&gt; 10 second cooldown

* **Sneak:** 40 points -&gt; 32% speed, 80% increase in stealth

* **Shuriken:** 25 points -&gt; 10 second cooldown

**TOTAL:** 120 -&gt; Level 60

If you drop 50 points into Shuriken, it will go down to 9s but I generally use Intercept to bring myself out of the air after Shuriken so having the two skills on the same cooldown time makes sense.

A level 180 rogue (ninja) Will have all skills at a very high level and a Power level of 91. Anything past this point is largely unnecessary. The claim of infinite leveling in this game is genuine but only technically. Once you reach these levels, the motivation to level seems to disappear, since the effort to level is far greater than the reward.

I'm not really a fan of the anti-exponential formulae used to make this game ""infinite"". I think there are probably better ways to go about it. I guess we'll have to wait and see what else Wollay adds~

Edit: It's worth noting that 285 climbing gives you about 96% stamina reduction. 100,000 gives you 99.99%.

So i made a little launcher for my self. I at first wasn't planning on sending it anywhere but i tough why not. Its not a fancy launcher; it just has some basic stuff: it can launch the game, launch the server, launch the official launcher, go to some sites, change the seed for the server, and go to the installation folder.

I at first wanted it so you wont have to trow it in the installation folder but that seemed harder then needed. So you have to put in in there or it won't work!!!!! just create a desktop shortcut for it.

this is in 99% of the cases in: C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World and if not then right click the thing you normally use to launch cube world and then open file location.

I play with a group of 3-5, and we kind of just trekked around doing dungeons. We found a blue-named Castle on the map, and decided to head towards it. Me, being a ranger, got there first with retreat/glide, and decided to test the waters.

**Bug or feature:**
**Go through the windows.** Using mobility skills (teleport, leap, retreat) will phase you through the windows. Not sure if this is a bug or not. Keep in mind enemies can do this as well. These have to be the high windows with the crosspiece.

I accidentally retreated into the boss room and ended up luring every single enemy human in the entire dungeon (army of I would guess 20-25) to the entrance trying to get out. My party at the entrance were at first glad to have finally caught up with Mcspeedypantsranger, but that feeling was lost when they saw the stampede behind me.

It was almost like a cartoon punch cloud, and we had one heck of a brouhaha. Two deaths later, we emerged victorious, and each 3 levels higher.

Infinite leveling and world is awesome. However when I beat the big bad monster in a mission I don't want it to just come back to life when I talk to an inn keeper. Some of the most concerning things are when I read about people just traveling between an inn and a mission to farm loot and xp. Whats the point of a great infinite world if the game mechanics encourage you to travel between two points doing the exact same thing? It would be great if the mission bosses didn't respawning, and there was some sort of region completion (Guild Wars 2 style) so that you got a trophy or something for your efforts, and this could become quite an accomplishment as more quest types are added. To me this simple change would add a lot of reward to playing the game, which is what makes rpg's so addicting.
I had to say this because its been on my mind bugging me. Also I'm really curious what other people's opinions are on this. Finally despite how it may sound here I love this game and see incredible potential. Thanks for reading!

Edit:I forgot to put this in earlier. For the people who are interested in the grind of power leveling and looting (including me at times). There are the locations with +1,+2,+3, +4 monsters that will be able to respawn. This is a great feature that serves the role of a farming/power leveling location.

Edit: This thread has been getting great feed back and I wasn't expecting nearly as many good suggestions. My initial hope was for this to start a discussion about what people thought about my somewhat controversial ideas, and for people to be able to build on my ideas. For anyone thinking that what I'm saying isn't constructive I did put in a fair number of specific points, but this post was to start discussion not purely for suggestions.

1373268480.0,44,self.CubeWorld,1huo88,I just discovered that seed 26879 is the default seed for every server. Can we start a list of where to find cool stuff in this seed?,56,12,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1huo88/i_just_discovered_that_seed_26879_is_the_default/,"I originally thought that Servers were getting a randomly generated seed. But it turns out that every server, by default, is using seed 26879.

I figured a lot of us are probably playing on this seed, so I thought it'd be neat to start a list of where to find cool stuff.

I've started a simple map of what I've found so far: http://imgur.com/8yzhtyY

Other points of interest:

* The Thaldar Mountains are by far the most rich in ore mountains ive come across. I maxed out on iron in about 5 minutes. And there was easily at least 10 emerald deposits, and a boat load of silver and gold.

* To the west of Spawn Point is the desert area. Its not the map because I haven't actually gone there yet. Someone else using the seed told me about it.


Hope you all can add more cool things to find!

Our website is built off a lobby system where you can communicate with those that you have accepted to join your party.
We have built an awesome notification system to keep you up to date with all group related actions. Everyone also gets a profile which keeps track of
each users connection history and reputation. This allows for group leaders to keep tabs on those making incoming group requests. With all the features currently
complete and all those to come, we have had to make it manditory to register an account. We understand the creating an account can sometimes be a noosance
but all these awesome addons wouldn't be possible without it!

We are just releasing this so there may not be any listings but we hope that it will catch on and provide an awesome location to find people to play with!
It is bound to have bugs so please bare with us while we continue to improve it.  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Updates:
- Groups can no longer have more than the max defined during creation.
- Noise Alert on new notification

• [Entertainment] I do understand all of you are unhappy with the amount of updates wollay &amp; pixxie are putting out every now and then. I myself do tend to get a little bored when playing cube world cause, all in all... it is a grindfest until we get quests. Please just be really patient... wollay &amp; pixxie work their asses off to provide more of this game for us. There is much more content to come such as houses, complex skill trees, more classes, more races, etc.

• [Bugs] Yes of course their is bugs. This game is labeled (Alpha) for a reason. Alpha is the start of a game. When you create something, it will not always functioned as planned. Bugs can actually be good and bad. Please report them on the Cube World forums website.

• [Cheaters] There is many many many cheaters. That's okay cause all that does it help wollay and pixxie block off the exploits to change code with Cheat Engine, and Cube World player editor.
There is going to be quite a few for a while. Its like wollay and pixxie are building a castle and the cheaters just so happen to find a way to get into it without being caught.

• [Waste of Money?] Nobody told you to buy this game right now, and if they did then that's your own fault . Wollay &amp; pixxie did not promise content rich updates every 2 weeks. What they did promise you was, a low price and free access to beta and the full game for $20. It is not a waste of money cause, I am sure that at full game release this games price will go up. You won't regret that will you, but you regret buying it now. No it's not a waste you actually save money. Minecraft was fun althrough its stages. You really would have started playing it last year? Gees. 

• [Communication] I also agree with all of you saying you wish for more communication. I also wish for the same thing. Wollay &amp; Pixxie both have twitters. @Wol_lay @Pix_xie. Follow them for latest news updates. I do believe it is a sign of greed (somewhat) that they refuse to have anybody else work on their team. As of right now they need all of the support they can get, or wollay just might lose his fans. Taking longer than usual to fix things. For example his forums on picroma have been down since the alpha has released; yet the game is still buyable? Im starting to believe they just took our money and ran...

I have been leveling various classes, trying them in various specifications.
Bottom line is that I feel spirit cubes are ""Practically"" being too weak, given
that you need 100+ hit combos to properly trigger a noticable effect.

I've tried it with +97 spirit cubes (16) on a Staff. That being said, I needed
a +50 hit combo to make myself heal for about 20 per right-click (about 2 per tick)
and a mind-whopping 1000 hit combo on a single dummy for it to tick for 20 per hit. So, is anyone else with me that those things are too damn weak for the time you spend farming them? 

Undead spirits for instance should be allowed to crit-heal, like the water mage's heals and the damage bonuses of the fire spirit should be counted as an extra number, that is also given the extra chances to stun/crit, so that the damage is noticeable. 

Also, the curves on how the effect build up should be.. well, curves, not a linear build-up. Much like the power-level you could say, gain a lot at the start, then let it flatten out at the end.

A: They're truly 3D since the latest video.

Q: get some shadows on objects....  &lt;--- Burn him!

A: If you're referring to the bench: usable objects get highlighted when in range, which makes them appear brighter.

Q: kann man die Rüstung der Tiere genau wie die Rüstung für Spieler selbst pixeln?

This is how I greet my current Mod team every time there is some sort of long boring text, but this time you have got the chance to experience the same. I am looking for up to 4 new Moderators for the team in order to keep moderating relaxed.

The reason for having a relatively big mod team is in order to allow each individual Mod to engage in Moderating freely without having to fill any quota. It is a free-time activity after all and that is what it should stay like. For that very reason applicants are not chosen by the time they have available, but for their interest and motivation in moderating itself. If the workload is getting too high, I can always look for more people willing to Moderate. So here is your opportunity.

For this Subreddit I follow a policy to provide an open and neutral discussion platform for everything related to Cube World. That is the reason, why there is no list of rules and i.e discussions about piracy are allowed. It is also the reason why posts, which provoke no base for discussions are removed (i.e quickmeme posts). The only thing to check is if posts are Cube World related and that can make moderating easy. Considering you can endure some stupid posts. The key for moderating in here is the ability to remove as little as possible, even though it might be another thread about a topic discussed several times already.

As all current Moderators, new moderators will have full permissions and act as individuals. That means, they can do pretty much everything I can do as creator. Previous Meta posts have been announced in the Mod section, but executed by a single Mod. If something goes wrong, I will fix it so that it fits to the policy explained above. That is part of the learning process and will not result in a demotion.

The only thing I expect from my Moderators is to check reported posts and posts which are stuck in the spam filter. Everything else is optional.

_

In order to apply as a Moderator respond to this thread with an informal application. There are no guidelines or a minimum of text required. Every reply, which is not an application will be removed from this thread. Posts which are beyond the so called ""ninja-edit"" (the ones marked with *) will not be taken into consideration, you can either remove the post and repost it or respond to an application with things you might have forgotten.

Deadline is in a week on the 16. of July. I will check the applications on the 17. though, there is no exact time where it officially ends. When checking I will sort the Thread by ""old"" and will expand posts which might have received too many negative votes.

_

That is all, normally I prefer to write more... normal, but you know how it is with distinguished mod posts. Anyway, I hope to find 4 People, but if I won't receive approval by the Mod team for 4 applicants then it will be less.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,False,,Bird,True,t3_1hxxql,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hxxql/rcubeworld_is_looking_for_up_to_4_new_moderators/,moderator

A: Currently just pets and other players can be companions.

Q: Hey wollay! Just wondering what your currently working on with Cube World! Thanx

**A:  I'm working on an auto-updater.**

Q: Will the treasure chests in the dungeons refresh?

A: No, they remain empty once you have looted them.

Q: Will there be a side editor that someone can use a voxel editor to make their own weapon DESIGNS and put them in-game?

A: Currently I don't want this feature, so the only way to obtain  special looking weapons is by fighting monsters.

Q: what is minimal requirement configuration for CubeWorld ? :)

A: I would say, at least a dual core CPU, 2 GB RAM and an NVidia or ATI graphics card. Still need to find out the exact reqs.

Q: Hate to bug you but I have to ask, did you do any concept art for Cube World?

A: Just a few sketches. I designed/programmed most models, items, biomes etc. directly, without concept art.

Been playing with my girl and I gotta say, I think Cube World is the ultimate couple's game.

I honestly wouldn't have been turned onto the game at first, except when I showed it to my woman she was very interested. 

So we gave it a shot together. I've never played the game solo, we've just played together.

We're pretty busy with all the crap going on in our lives so we've only been able to play a few hours so far, but it's been a blast. 

For her it has:

* Cute Art Style
* Taming Pets
* Fun Exploring
* Engaging, Fun Combat

For me it has:

* Challenging Enemies (I'm always biting off more than I can chew lol)
* MMO style skill Trees and gear customization
* 3rd person Shooter type action with Mage
* Healing role with mage - can I keep myself and my woman alive even when we fight stronger enemies?

Completely worth the purchase price of this alpha - especially knowing that I'm locked in for future updates, and future mods from the modding community. 

(there's a super cool pokemon mod out now, give it a few years and the awesome community will end up with almost a fully fledged pokemon-type game i bet!)

Anyways. Thats all I wanted to say I guess. 

**What do you guys think? Ultimate Couples co-op game? or is there something better?**

We're having fun and doing our best to contribute to the community by promoting the game by recording our playthrough [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAb9VUXhc8Q&amp;feature=share&amp;list=SPOFizd9_D4iFWuBH-LrxXs51zBfxBJCCK)

I'm back with more Cheat Engine shenanigans! Instead of talking about power like I promised last post, I accidentally found the code that dictates your health (If you want a preliminary formula for calculating your power, look at what /u/VicoSen found [here](https://pay.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1i1h4y/using_cheat_engine_to_explore_the_internals_of/cb0ak5f)).

Anyways, just to make this clear: I'm going to talk about the **base health**, without any armor/weapons equipped that change your health stat. Turtles, or in general other mobs/bosses, are also not included in this formula. This only applies to your character with empty equipment slots.

Without further ado, lets get to it! Because of the size of the code, I can't paste it here without taking up too much of the allotted space. You can find the relevant piece of code yourself at Cube.exe+45620 if you're curious. The formula that defines your maximum health is as follows:

    base_health = scaling_factor * class_coefficient * 2^(3 * (level - 1)/(level + 19) + 1)

Where scaling factor is always 100.0 and class_coefficient one of the following:

    class_coefficient = 1.00 for mages
    class_coefficient = 1.10 for rangers
    class_coefficient = 1.20 for rogues
    class_coefficient = 1.30 for warriors

Keep in mind that guardians get an extra 25% health!

*Full disclosure: this expression is already simplified, it isn't a carbon copy of the formula as found in the Cube World binary.*

Now to the fun part: plots! If we plot the above function for all the classes, we get the following curves for levels 1-500:

[Health in function of the level, for different classes](http://i.imgur.com/eJetWBF.png)

The topmost curve is the health of a warrior character with the guardian bonus, followed by (in descending order) a warrior, a rogue, a ranger and a mage character.

If you want to change your health without touching your level, you can try to find the scaling_factor and change that! It is stored near to where your current xp is stored, but isn't saved to the disk when switching your character or exiting the game.

Next stop: the power, armor, tempo, regeneration and critical stats. And the stats of the class skills of course!

Again, questions and comments are appreciated!

CubeBot is a FAQ bot for this subreddit. It will track self posts and comments to answer some of the repetitive/common questions.

If you notice any problems with the way it is posting, PM me with the subject 'CubeBot' so that I can look into fixing/adjusting it.

I'll be trying to keep all the answers it has up to date and provide sources in each reply for people to validate information, as well.

**edit:** Bot will be turned off at 6PM PST (GMT-8) so that I can update it for the various misfires. I've drafted solutions to the 3 that have occurred that will help me fix it for other potential misfires.

**edit2:** Turning the bot back on tomorrow around 8AM PST (GMT-8). I think I addressed most of the misfires but time will tell.

Also, to anyone who misread the title... Sorry. I was excited. I probably should have called this post ""FAQ Bot is now running our subreddit"" to completely negate the chance of overhype

**edit3:** CubeBot is up and running again. Will leave it running all day today. Please report any bugs / misfires to me. If you feel like CubeBot *should* have responded to something and it did not, send me a PM and I'll look into it.

**edit4:** Hit 2 more misfires and created some tentative fixes. Tested to see if I could apply hotfixes without restarting the bot... but it seems I cannot. Not a big issue. Gonna wait to restart the bot until later. Almost 5 hours and it's running pretty smoothly.

**edit5:** Turned off CubeBot as of 1:50PM PST (GMT-8). Lots of misfires in the most recent loop, want to make sure I have the time to fix them before the next.

- Pets can attack with you.   
- They level up just as we do.  
- Upon death, an estimate of 10 seconds will go by before reviving where you are.  
- You can mount and ride most of the pets for fast traveling. (Ability in your skill tree)  
- You can upgrade a pet's health through an ability in your skill tree.  
- Pressing the ""T"" key will call your pet to come to you.  
- A pet's natural ability will affect the way they follow you. (i.e A Plain Runner naturally runs faster than other animals, so he will follow behind you quicker than most pets.)  
- When a pet is in battle, unless you get out of battle and lose the enemy, the pet will continue to revive and try to kill the enemy.  
- One you obtain the mount skill, you press the ""R"" key to ride them.  
- The speed of a mounted pet depends on the level of your riding skill.  
- How to tame a pet: Once you hold out the food, the animal will instantly run over with a heart above it's head if it likes the food and he will be tamed after eating the food. If he does not like the food, nothing will happen.  


***!!!SPOILERS WARNING!!!***
  
  
**Taming:**  
- Pigs like Pumpkin Mash.  
- Plain Runners like Milk Chocolate.  
- Collies like Bubble Gum.  
- Sheeps like Cotton Candy.  
- (Not 100% sure) Green Slimes like Yellow Slime.  
- (Not 100% sure) Blue Slimes like Gelatine.  
- Terriers like Waffles.  
- Monkeys like Banana Splits.  
- Bunnies like Carrots.

Have also tried to include pictures from the subreddit as examples. Please update me with any incorrect/new information!

**Cold plains/forests** occur at temperatures of 5-17C and humidity 30-70%, they feature falling leaves and colorful trees. In appearance, they are cold forests or possibly temperate forests in autumn season. These are a common spawning location.
**[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/TJSD0dj.png)**

**Deserts** occur at temperatures of around 34-39C and humidity of around 2-7%. As you would expect, the desert contains lots of sand and features oasis-like desert trees. 
**[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/iu74dG9h.jpg)**

**Oceans** occur at temperatures of around 5-35C and humidity of around 55-96%. Most of the creatures are found underwater, but many features including the city are on islands.

**Polar plains/forests** occur at below freezing temperatures around -20C and varying humidities from 1-95%. These are similar to the other plain/forest biomes but feature a frozen landscape and cold-climate trees. Snow falls. 
**[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/6efLpl1.jpg)**

**Temperate plains/forests** occur at temperatures from about 15-30C and humidity from about 30-55%. These are warmer, summer-spring like climates with warmer climate trees and varying flora. The trees are less colorful than the cold plains/forests and do not drop leaves. This biome is the other possible spawning biome. **[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/1KBmWfl.jpg)**

**Tropical plains/forests** Occur at temperatures around 35C and high humidity of about 90%. I have only seen one of these, so it has a poor sample size. These biomes are very tropical with palm trees and many rivers. **[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/At4C9II.jpg)**

**Volcanic fields** Occur at temperatures from 30-40C and humidity as low as 1% but as high as 40%. Self explanatory. Fields of volcanic rock and lava. **[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/gbPGVCF.jpg)**


Edit 2: OK, gone through about 150 more starting biomes, the observations below are pretty conclusive at this point. 

High temperature/high humidity (16C/50%) leads to pure green colored foliage

Low temperature/high humidity (4C/66%) leads to many orange and yellow colored foliage

High temperature/low humidity (14C/32%) leads to a small density of pink colored trees mixed in with mostly green

My company CWProHosting is planning to launch tonight providing we do not have any serious hiccups. We have been in the server hosting industry for several years now with our MCProHosting branch which is the leading provider of Minecraft Server hosting. We host the biggest names in the community (SkyDoesMinecraft, PaulSoaresJr, MinecraftWB,  CyanideEpic, just to name a few of dozens)

In partnership with PhonicUK we are able to provide the CWMyAdmin control panel in addition to an automated provisioning module, so no lengthly setup times!

In order to achieve this feat in a shared hosting environment we are using a modified executable which allows us to ensure increased stability and makes this possible.

Our dev, sysadmin, and networking teams have been working tirelessly through the past weeks to get this stable hosting platform online and working and we're proud to announce that for a limited time only servers will only be $4.99/mo for unlimited RAM and a high slot count (TBD)

Any questions, comments, or concerns? Let us know! We also have 9AM-9PM live-chat available at our site, http://cwprohosting.com

Best Regards,
Matthew Salsamendi - Co-Owner (CEO/CTO) MCProHosting LLC.

* **Pet stats / abilities** - As the bullet point suggests, have different pets give certain abilities. Horses give additional riding speed in certain biomes (grasslands), camels have longevity in desert biomes, monkeys can collect plants for you, bees can guide to honey (when buff foods become a reality), etc etc. That way people aren't locked down to a certain pet. You use the best pet for the current goal / situation 

* **Skills drop** - Not a typo, but after playing PoE (Path of Exile) I found that it has been the best use of skills I have ever seen. Having 1-4 being based on your profession makes complete sense. That being said I would [personally] love to see skills like 'Ground stomp' or 'Poison Weapon' be available in a special '8th' slot. These skills are not upgrade-able but get the default +powerlevel stat. So Ground Stomp +5 will be great at level 2, but not at level 12. These skills would be a random drop but a higher chance on dungeon bosses with corresponding aesthetics, IE crypt bosses have a higher chance of dropping 'Raise dead' which would allow you to resurrect any ally that dies before he disintegrates entirely (with so much health depending on the power level of skill).


* **Olympus Temples** - As the title suggests, after watching [Bebobs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLv5pl3m6C8) YouTube video and watching them climb that mountain made me want to see some sort of Greek style temple on top of a ridiculously high pillar mountain (imagine the temple on the cliff from '300'). Where you would either need a high climb skill or just patience. Where falling == instadeath. 

* **[More] Classes** - Coming from a background of things like Dark Souls / Elder Scrolls / Dragons Dogma / Monster Hunter. Would like to see some hybrid or unique classes. He [Wollay] has on picroma that more classes / races were a planned feature. So might as well throw my hat into the arena. **Necros** A Personal favorite, wielding scythes, they would build MP like a warrior / rogue and unleash it by raising 'pets' on their *Grave* side, with the ability to raise any of the major role pets (Healer, Tank, Range) depending on the situation. On their *Death* side they would be more or less a 'true' melee mage (or a more dps version or the Mystic Knight from Dragons Dogma). **Magic Archer** This come directly from Dragons Dogma (my current favorite game), you are able to target multiple enemies with magic arrows, though they don't do as much damage as normal arrows, they can AOE better than a standard archer. **Paladin** suggested over and over, they are a 'pure tank' that can also heal allies (halfway between guardian and a water mage).

* **Map Markers** - Simple, you purchase 'flags' from vendors which you can throw down on the ground, basic flags with no text cost 5 copper, text flags cost 20 copper each.

* **Road Vendors** - Simple (again), vendors that wander the roads, sell anything and everything at random and have limited quantities

* **Flares** After watching hours of footage, would be nice to be able to see more than 5 blocks in front of the player during the night. Flares would burn for 10 minutes, could be tossed on the ground or thrown (think DayZ). The would cost 7 Copper each from general merchants

* **Utility Scrolls** These would be 1 time use 'spells' sold by vendors for massive amount of money, by random chance drop or finally by a 'roulette style' vendor. During my watching of livestreams, after purchasing the 20 silver worth of boat/gliders, no one ever spend any real amounts of money. Having a money sink would be nice, the scrolls themselves would provide things like *rewind* which makes the sun rise again but not reset the time (for running towards a distant objective). *Portal* (again ripped from Dragons Dogma) where you can buy a portal stone (for &gt;20s) which can be put anywhere, but using a portal scroll burns the scroll. You can relocate the portal stone, that way you can put a stone outside a dungeon (inside would have a buffer zone), run back to town for supplies than burn a scroll and return to the stone.

* **Hunts** Another way to burn money, a 'huntsman' in any given town could give you a timed quest (based on how far away) to hunt (for rare drops) or capture (for rare pets) rare mobs that are only there for the duration of the quest, to capture the mob you would need the correct food of course. These pets would only be slightly better than their normal counterparts (shadowmere / unicorn). Would mainly be used as a status symbol or money sink.

I am fairly new to reddit (posting anyway) so i'm sure most of these have been brought up. But i'm burning  time between @wol_lay refreshes. Sorry for any crappy formatting, like I said, new to posting with formats

Updating: Without a demo release all my idle thoughts while working turn to CubeWorld, felt like throwing out some more, especially after reading some you guys threw out there, forgive my formatting.

* **Town Hero [Gabe_b]** &gt; Becoming a **Town Hero**. Once you've done enough quests for a town they make a statue of you in the town square (effectively just your character model at the time you trigger the metaquest with all colors shifted to grey) and you get discounts at the shops. Also, perhaps a house. You'll outlevel an area anyway and be ready to leave around that point if it's balanced right and it would give a nice sense of having cleared a province and wouldn't be too hard to implement, just track the number of elites and dungeons beaten in a province (or of given quests beaten once they're implemented). If you have random townsfolk have their dialog replaced by statements about your recent victories for the following day or so you could also give a good sense of having an effect on the world.&gt;

* **Abyss Dungeons** - Pure dark dungeons, no lights, just the players lantern. They would be Maze like in design, the defining feature would be the fact the boss would roam the halls at random, he would be invincible until you reached his chambers and broke his 'spirit link' where he would become vulnerable. Upon his death the maze would become lit, allowing you to see if you managed to avoid any potential pitfalls and the like *Andro30 gave me the inspiration*

* **Boat and Glider Customization [innadril &amp; Vanto]** - Pretty straightforward, Vanto's idea of earned customization would simply be icing on the cake 

* **Ships** - This could be handled in a lot of different ways **Player owned** Simply put a massive ship which, once deployed, was a permanent fixture. This would cost 10+ gold to build, but would allow you have a 'home' of sorts, especially if oceans become larger or breathing apparatuses become a thing. Such as able to store 'tanks' on the ship if your spelunking underwater, you'll need a home base if there is no land in site to refuel. **NPC Owned** If you ever played FFXI this should be familiar, you pay to board a ship, which has a given port it travels too, while it's in transport, you are in a separate instance for 5-15 minutes, during which you can fish or chill, fishing there can net you rare fish but sometimes creatures will be caught and you'll have to fight them. Just something to add an ability to travel to 'a new map' in which and entirely new map file is generated letting you switch between maps without having to reload (trivial i know) **Ghost ships** Easy, ships that aimlessly travel, perhaps a fog around them. But just a water born dungeon

* **Destroyed towns** - A dynamic or random event, but a previously occupied village would suddenly be destroyed when you travel back there. The prompt for this could either be villagers in another town having dialog saying things like 'survivors of [village] are streaming in'. Whereas upon investigation of the ruined (possibly still burning) village you discover something such as a hole somewhere in the village that reveals that the village itself was built upon a huge dungeon (mine, crypt, hell-portal, etc) and the surrounding area of the village is now higher level. This would let previously low level areas to now be interesting to re-visit.  Could be themed, like crypt theme makes it night time in the surrounding area and all the trees are dead. Hell themed would make surrounding area into lava lands, however the difference is that your seeing the transformation, trees+town are burning. etc etc  

* **Aesthetic rare items** Inspired by **Zantrix** and other games. But either legendary weapons in the vain of GuildWars 2, which are no better than other weapons, but have unique looks + effects. Would be a huge money sink since you have to farm and buy massive amounts of things in order to create them. Another would be dyes, this one is straight forward, but with CW's ability to add cube by cube, you could color each cube, which would allow crazy amount of customization, especially to creative people. Dyes would only be drops, and once 'consumed' are endless (pretty much ripped from GW2).   Hyper-rare dyes would add 'auras' around you, depending on color and effect (would have affixes such as cloud, glow, etc). So super rare 'Black Cloud' dye, when applied and making a majority of the current armors cubes would cause you to have a mist around you that would be black. Pretty self explanatory, these dyes would have &lt;1% drop rate and would only drop from mobs who had a majority of that color on their bodies (IE Striders could drop purple, Lizardmen would drop forest green)",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1372753853.0,,,True,t3_1hf6ve,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hf6ve/a_large_idea_thread/,

With this glitch, you can keep flying with your hang glider, but without control.

* Go to a high place. *optional*
* Start gliding.
* Hold space and then press enter.
* When your stamina runs out, you'll never start to descend.

You can't control the direction after you press enter and sometimes your path may curve.
You'll need to press enter again to get out of the flight.

If you use this with the bomb boost trick, you can get upward momentum and fly way above the clouds. Thanks.

Abra kadabra. It works. Destroyed the wood cube I removed, but the spirit it allowed me to put on makes up for it.

I think the general community view is that there should be rules to stop the incessant posting of 'let's players' who are trying to jump onto the YouTube money train, which has been full for about 3 years, and maybe in that case the other subreddit is justified as there is such a wide dislike for the posting of these.

BUT I don't want this community to die and/or be awful. I think we should do all we can to stop that from happening.

I am simply expressing my opinion. If there is a better more efficient way please present it.

&gt; Example Title: 
&gt; *Seed : ##### Catacombs with +6 Mobs, Epic Boss at Spawn : Vendor : Chocolate Cake*

Provide screenshots detailing the location of explored regions. 

Unexplored ""Crossed Swords"" is not automatically a dungeon. Please be specific.

Technically the game considers everything; castles, ruins, temples, pyramids, and catacombs and overworld dungeons as dungeons.

So be clear. Explore your seed. Take sensible screenshots that display your findings.

Always check the vendor to check for pet food/lamps/recipes. This is all useful information.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,False,,,True,t3_1ht0cs,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1ht0cs/lets_start_setting_standards_for_the_presentation/,

I feel like you might strike me down because I feel as if I'm over-stepping myself,
but I am responsible for all things 'graphicsy' for PlugPayPlay (So long as they keep me - we have a running agreement with each other) and since PlugPayPlay are now sponsoring /r/cubeworld's official server, they asked me to create some graphics for you guys, this included banners for both reddit and a large cubeworld community as well as a Cube world themed Reddit Alien.

I do free designs for anyone, but anything I make (for free) I largely use secondary sources, but the minority who do support me I spend a lot longer creating my own content for my designs.

I know that my designs are not the best, I am a Graphics Student not a professional, but I'm here to say that if [/r/CubeWorld](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/) ever need any Graphic design work done, or even any single redditors, I can do so for free (But ofcourse donations help but aren't required).

Here's an [album](http://henrybartonwong.imgur.com/) of some of my images to date.

Thank-you for reading :)

A: Yeah I'm planning to add barbers in villages for that.

Q: are pets going to be available to all races and classes?

A: Yes.

Q: Hi Wollay. Where can I get ice \ Air \ fiery cubes? 
The house can accommodate storage items?
Your fan Decembrist

A: You get spirit cubes from bosses. Housing isn't finished yet, but yes there will probably be chests to store items.

Q: Wie wird das Spiel verkauft werden wenn es einmal draussen ist? Per Internet wie Minecraft oder wird es in Läden erhältlich sein?

A: Per Internet.

TRANSLATION: How will the game be sold when it's out? Virtually like Minecraft or in stores? 

Online

Q: Will there be an option to disable this? &lt; --- Referring to terrain regeneration

A: No. Why?

Q: you're working on a paladin class, but are you planning on making a class that uses shadow dmg like a warlock or something similar?

A: Yeah I think a warlock-like class could be possible in the future.

Q: Hello mr.Wolfram! i just watched the trailer this morning and its awesome.. and im wondering are there any house building in here?

A: I'm still working on the housing system.

Q: Hallo Wollay,
Ich hätte mal eine Frage, kann mann sich auch in verschiedenen Tieren verwandeln? und kann mann auch fliegen?

A: Man kann sich nicht verwandeln, aber evtl. später mal. ;) Richtiges Fliegen ist nicht möglich, ist so spannender beim Entdecken.

TRANSLATION: Not positive, but I believe he is asking if it is possible to change into animals. Wollay says it is not, but may be a feature later.

Q:  I'm curious, how is the animations/rigging done for this game? :)
If I've understood right you use a custom voxel editor for models

A: I'm modeling the different body parts in my voxel editor and animate them with C++. :)

Q:  is it possible to change your character's name after creation?
Expand

A: Yes, there's a console command for that (/name myname).

Q: cool! Are there any other interesting console commands? :)

A: There's /namepet and /connect (to connect to a server). Other commands like /port and /level are just for me for testing.

Q: Is it still possible to play Cube World with an Xbox controller?

A: Yes

Q: Will you make clouds move? Also, will there be higher capacity servers for pve/exploring?

A: Moving clouds: maybe. Higher capacity: still need to test how balanced and manageable 5+ players would be in dungeons.

Q: Huh? Why dungeons? What the problem with that?

A: 10 players, each with a pet, running together through a dungeon would be a bit much.

Q: You say the higher cap servers will be for PVP like CTF or DM. How then there is no higher cap for pve? Limited pvp maps?

A: It has nothing to do with lag or performance, just with game balance. Just like you can't play Diablo with 10 people.

Q: How is live in Germany? Cold?

A: Currently the weather sucks but usually it's okay. :)

Q: Is there some new Spirit Cube in Cube World?

A: No, just unholy, ice, fire and wind by now.

Q: Are you planning on adding different types later on?

A: Yes!

Q: Hey, what do u think about a 5v5 Dungeon race? 2 teams get placed in a dungeon that are excatly the same and who finishes first win

A: Sounds fun. :) I'll keep it in mind when I start working on PvP.

Q: Are you planning on completing all the features, you have recently been talking about, before release?

A: No, I'm planning to release the alpha without these features and provide updates later on.

A: No, that's not possible. The game generates all area names.

Q: Hello, I asked a question, the characters will be connected to the server or account?

A: Characters are stored locally. I'm thinking about adding server-stored characters for online mode.

Q: Is it possible to walk on clouds :D ?

A: No, you can fly straight through them with your hangglider. :)

Q: Are you guys gonna make Cube World merchandise, because I would buy some :D

A: Yes probably! :)

Q: Ich fänd's besser wenn alle Charaktere client-side wären, dann könnte man diese auch hin und wieder im SP. weiterspielen. :S

A: Finde ich auch. Spätestens wenn ich PvP einbaue muss ich jedoch sichergehen, dass Spielstände nicht gehackt sind.

TRANSLATION:

Q: I think it would be better to store character data clientside, that way you could continue in single player.

A: I think so too. But I'll have to make sure that PvP scores are not hacked.

1373908416.0,27,self.CubeWorld,1icmhh,[GUIDE]Running Cube World (And other games) in Borderless Windowed Mode,30,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1icmhh/guiderunning_cube_world_and_other_games_in/,"Hello /r/CubeWorld! Today I figured I'd make a small informative guide how to run Cube World in Windowed Borderless Mode. This is mine, and many others, favourite method to run games. It combines full screen gaming with easy alt tabbing. 

To do this first we need to download and run this small, safe, executable. Sadly, the steam forums are down right now, and this is the normal host place for the file. (http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769)

EDIT: Back up now! Grab it there, or with my mirror!

Because of this, I've provided a mirror. You can download the program [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/91n2ug7vqqfl1gk/WindowedBorderlessGaming.exe)

After downloading the file, put it in any place you prefer, after running for the first time it will create an .ini file for your config in the same place.

Run the application, this will create an instance of itself in the taskbar. 
Now, start Cube World in Windowed mode. After you've done this, you can right click the Windowed Borderless Gaming icon in the taskbar, and click Add Window (F3).
Afer you've done this, make the Cube World window active and press F3.

This will make Cube World full screen borderless. However, you might find it is out of place (Mine was, probably has to do something with my 3 screens). 
To fix this, right click the Windowed Borderless Gaming icon again, and click on Open game settings. Now make sure Section says Title:Cube;Class:Cube and then edit Pos X. to 0 and Pos Y. to 0. Also make sure you enter the resolution of the screen you want to play on. (1920X1080 in my case). Click save and then Apply and enjoy Cube World in Windowed Borderless Mode.

You will only have to follow these steps once, WBG will create an .ini file with your settings, and automatically apply them next time you run the game. You can enable Run at startup for the perfect setup.

Hope you enjoyed this little guide, and feel free to post any and all questions!

It's an AutoHotkey script that toggles autorun using the forward mouse button:
http://pastebin.com/0Q7bWZd8

Note: I didn't fully write this script. I pieced it together from parts that I googled and then changed a few things.

Things it does:

- Toggles on/off autorun using the foward mouse button.

- ""w"" key turns off autorun like it would in many other games and acts like normal.

- ""s"" key also turns off autorun and acts like normal.

- If you enter chat mode, the script won't interfere with typing.

- ""Pause"" key suspends the hotkeys if needed for whatever reason. You can remove this if you want.

- The script only works while Cube.exe is the active window.
  


If you want the toggle to be something else, then just change ""XButton2"" in the script to whatever key you want.

The backtick/tilde key may be a good choice, since it's close to the ""WASD"" keys and isn't being used by anything.
You would just need to change ""XButton2::"" to ""`::"" as such: http://pastebin.com/s82cnV7R

You can't start the autorun if you are holding down the ""w"" key. Not sure how to get around that but I may look into it later.

 
Also, just as if you were holding down the ""w"" key, you can't open any menus while autorun is on.

That being said, everything seems to work fine and the script hasn't given me any trouble.

 
If you don't have AutoHokey and/or don't know how to use it:

1. Downlaod it here: http://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Install it.
3. Copy/paste the script from the pastebin above into a new notepad document.
4. Save the document with "".ahk"" as the extension, i.e., ""Cube World Autorun.ahk"".
5. Go to wherever you saved the script and then double-click it.

If anyone has a better autorun script or knows how to get this one to work while the ""w"" key is held down and then released, that would be great. Otherwise, this seems to do the job just fine for now.

EDIT: Changed the ""~w::"" part of the script. It was causing the toggle key not to work on the next press if you accidentally pressed it while holding the ""w"" key before. It wasn't doing this when using ""XButton2"" as the toggle, but when using a key, it was. Should be fixed now.

Via Bootcamp it runs as well as it would on a regular Windows PC of similar specs. If you want to play, bite the bullet and install Bootcamp.**

(09 July 2013)

Original post:

I had suggested the other day that we should run an omnibus Mac support thread to reduce the likelihood of duplicate ""Does X solution work?"" and ""how well does it work on Y?"" threads. Not seeing any in the New stream, I'll submit this one here (obviously, as a self-post, I receive no sweet, sweet karma for this, so I'd encourage upvotes for visibility). If this ends up being a duplicate by the time I'm done, let me know and I'll delete it.

I propose formatting comments for minimum clutter: just indicate demo or alpha, your hardware, what solution you're trying to run the demo or alpha with (WINE, Bootcamp, Crossover, Parallels, VMWare, etc), what Windows version you're using (XP/Vista/7/8) and results (doesn't work/works + framerate or performance).

For example:

* CubeWorld Demo
* Retina MacBook Pro (mid-2012)
* CrossOver
* WinXP and Vista
* Does not work: Error: ""Unable to initialize XAudio2"".


**UPDATE: 08 July 2013**
So this thread has calmed down since the release, but now that folks are getting their hands on the full version, it's worth a quick recap for folks who search this in the future. 

As a number of other people have noted (and I can confirm), Cube World currently doesn't play in Wine or any of its derivatives. I haven't gotten past the launcher with Wine, WineBottler, or Crossover - they seem to fail at updating and don't allow me to fully install the game, and I never get to a title screen. I've also tried copying over my install from my PC to run in a folder, with no success.

Some folks are reporting mixed success with Parallels, but Bootcamp really seems to be the only way to get solid performance out of Cube World for now.

So while [Wollay has promised a Mac client eventually](http://wollay.blogspot.com/2011/11/extended-cube-world-faq.html), given the development cycles he's been on I don't think we can realistically hope for that to be surfacing any time soon. For now the best bet really seems to be to stick with a Bootcamp install.

I saw an older post where people complained of input lag, sometimes up to 30 seconds to get their lantern on, toggle riding, etc. A lot of these people, and I, have great rigs, that run without issue on maximum settings, which led to my investigation as to what was plaguing me with the inability to do anything unless I was standing still for long periods.

Anyways, I run the game through steam for the overlay, and suffered from this crazy lag, though it was only about 5-15 seconds usually. One time while I was waiting for my chat to open, I popped up the steam overlay to send a message to my friend I was playing with because hey, it would be faster to say what I needed to that way. But when I opened the overlay, the message box filled with w's and whatnot from my in game movement, leading me to conclude the keyboard was spamming the game and it bugged out the menus and whatnot. So here's what I did:

Go  into your keyboard settings and lower the key repeat rates, located under the keyboard settings. I didn't use filter keys, since it didn't help me at all, but some people might want to give that a go if they want literally zero key repeats on their computer. Anyways, if the speed to repeat keys (like if you want to hold down a to say aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh) is set really high, it will spam the game with these key inputs and lag out your menus and chat. Lowering these to a more basic level should more than likely fix your issues. It did for me, anyways, and I hope it works for you.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1374090324.0,,,True,t3_1i6fhi,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1i6fhi/my_input_lag_fix_laggy_menus_chat_lantern_etc/,

Today my friend and I stumbled across a way to find out all different creature skins and pets. using cheat engine we managed to change pet id's to different creature skins allowing us to see every different creature as a pet. We found the id's went from 0-155 including player models, pets, enemies and even bushes. 



http://i.imgur.com/TFRTltYh.jpg for example a troll and a lich blue health bars showing they are pets. 



http://i.imgur.com/z9zflqM.jpg ID 1 being the player model Female elf. the player model pets seem to change they appearance every time you take them out of your inventory(hair/face like when creating a new char).



I do not have a link to the cheat engine table sorry.
You need to change the item type to 19 and then the sub type to one of the following ID's.

ID's that you should look at if you do this:

117 &amp; 118 &amp; 119 (Some cool bosses)

2 people made Cubeworld.

2 human beings. 2 created this entire game.

I got high earlier and as I was playing the game.. this simple idea made my stoned mind quiver.

My problem with minecraft (which I've posted [about](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/ko41a/what_minecraft_could_be_if_notch_truly_embraced/) and changed my mind about haha, but regardless) before has always been that the core game is merely a platform for what the hive-mind of humanity can achieve working independently and together. Vanilla MC is great, but in my opinion the modding community has made some of the best stuff ever.

Cubeworld is beautiful, responsive, immersive and fun. It feels incredibly open and the random world it generates feels endless. The key which enables all this is how simple the graphics/animations. It is how 2 people can create all this... you don't need an art team or 20 other people.

So what we have with Cubeworld is a beautiful engine, running a random and open world RPG, but the content is only going to be made by 2 people, and currently they have some plans to add a few more things.

My suggestion is for the makers to create a steam workshop-like system in the game, focusing on simple additions (such as single skins/animations/skills/ effects/models/buildings/etc.) not entire packs. Anyone can add content and anyone can download and play.

Another difference with the workshop (and more like TF2's community patch system) is that once a mod/gets popular or the creators of the game like it enough, the mod can achieve ""golden"" status and actually become part of the official game version.

What this system enables the game to become is something immaculate. 1000's of mobs? New worlds? Tons of spells? Custom castles? Towns? Quests?

The makers of the game could continue forward for years, nay I say, DECADES!

The only thing would be compensation or lack thereof, so to make it simple, if you added something to the workshop the creator is agreeing to allow the makers of Cubeworld to use their content in the game and maybe have an NPC/item/town named after them or credits given to them. People have been making mods/skins for years now for many games without expectation of compensation. Or if they could compensate, that'd be great to.

Ideas? Thoughts?

I'm not sure about other video cards, or other operating systems.

I have a NVIDIA video card built in to my laptop, but cube world ran by default on integrated intel graphics (with maybe 10-25 fps, compared to post-adjustment 40-100 normal fps, with an average around 70).

I don't think every control panel is the same, but what I did is first locate where cube.exe is, open the NVIDIA control panel, go to manage 3d settings, on program settings click add then navigate to where you found cube.exe, and on the drop down chose the nvidia processor. After you apply the change(s), you'll notice a great performance increase in your game. This also worked with minecraft and tekkit, by finding Java.exe, and giving that the ability to run on the video card. 

http://imgur.com/a/s3RZw These pictures go with the paragraph there, broken down in to 4 steps with pictures. I could make a video if you feel it necessary, but I think it would be easier to mail you a VHS than to try to upload a video with my terrible internet.

If you're not sure where your cube.exe is though, open your task manager, click the processes tab, right click cube.exe (it has to be running for it to show up of course) and do ""open file location"". You can either remember the path yourself, or I'm sure you can copy it to your clipboard.

Just for those who are curious, my specs:

i7-3610QM CPU

NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M

8GB DDR3 RAM

And running Cube World off of an SSD (laptop had 2 hard drive bays)

With all this, my normal fps fluctuates between 40-80ish seemingly at random, I'll be walking in new lands, getting 80 fps, a frame drop down to 40 for a minute or so, then back to 80 again.

So from my understanding, this game is essentially the opposite of other games, in that the first few levels are the most important, while end levels mean nothing at all. According to the spreadsheet [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hnl64/levelpower_spreadsheet/), it takes 27 levels to get from power level 91 to 92. This system means that the farther into the game you go, the less your level matters at all, since you can fight things 27 levels higher (and much further at even higher points), and seemingly have no trouble whatsoever.

So, while the system adds another infinite aspect to the game, it means next to nothing, since you hit a point where nothing really changes anyway. This is very counter intuitive, because the purpose of leveling up is not just to see a number get bigger, so I feel being able to reach a solid cap would make more sense.

This is a beginner's guide for forwarding ports.

-----

So I bought Cube World a few days ago, and a friend and I were trying to figure out how to get a private server set up so we could play together. I've had nothing but trouble with Hamachi, so I wanted to avoid it at all costs. Turns out, it's pretty easy. I thought I'd make a simple guide for everyone to help you get one set up too!

-----

**1.** Open up your command prompt. Enter *ipconfig* into the prompt and you will receive [a list of information regarding your IP address](http://i.imgur.com/jphxoro.png). What you're looking for is your **Default Gateway**, which in [this window](http://i.imgur.com/jphxoro.png) is *192.168.1.1*. 

**2.** Open up your browser and put that IP into your address bar. This will take you to your router settings. You will probably get prompted to enter a name and password. Unless it's been changed manually, your name is **admin** and your password is **password**. Once you're in you need to find a screen titled **Port Forwarding/Port Triggering**. [It should look something like this.](http://i.imgur.com/9F26yny.png)

**3.** You'll need to click **Add**. This is where you'll open the port on your computer to allow people to connect to your server. Name your port option and enter **PORT 12345. AGAIN, THE PORT FOR CUBE WORLD IS 12345.** If your router asks for a host IP, enter your [IPv4 Address from this picture](http://i.imgur.com/jphxoro.png), which in the picture is *192.168.1.2*. Save your new port and exit your router settings. 

**4.** Now you need to start your server up. First, go to your folder location of Cube World (usually located at C:/Program Files(x86)/Cube World) and [open the file **Server.exe**](http://i.imgur.com/zWt3iFu.png). This is your server, officially up and running.

**5.** Now we need to make sure that your port was forwarded correctly. Go to http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ and enter **12345** into the Port box and click *Check* If it's open, it will say something along the lines of ""Port 12345 is open on xx.xxx.xx.xx"". If not, go back to your [router settings](http://i.imgur.com/9F26yny.png) and make sure you did everything correctly. **EDIT:** /u/Cybernetic_Sasquatch provided an amazing website that helps you find how to forward your ports on pretty much any router. You can find it here: http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/

**6.** Now you can have your friends connect and play! If you're all on a LAN, you can use your [IPv4 Address](http://i.imgur.com/jphxoro.png). You, personally, will use this IP to connect to the server. If you have a friend online wanting to connect, you would use the IP found on http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ and send it to them.

-----

I hope this helps everyone! Happy hunting!

-----

/u/Rivius says:
&gt;You can also use your external IP to connect to rather than the internal (LAN) IP.

&gt;If you have several devices that use the router, and if you turn your computer off for a length of time (overnight), you may be re-assigned a new internal (LAN) IP and will have to change the port forwarding to that new internal IP. In most cases with broadband you will not get a new external IP very often (but its possible if you don't pay for a static IP).

**[Visualization Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqEJC1GHyz7ddEtjaFhPWktJallRZW5UNGNUcWNkZVE&amp;usp=sharing) - It's a google docs link that helps you see numbers + locations a bit easier.**

For people looking for information on Portals:

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/TasGB) | [Reddit Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hy67i/portal_spotting_what_to_look_for_and_how_to_check/)

Seed: 43110

If you want to contribute to this, please try to orient your map screenshot the same way as the ones in the album WITHOUT any modifications (so, pointed South West and directed as vertically as possible). You can pan the map with the middle mouse button.

**THE THEORY:** Dungeons spawn in a cardinal direction, within 8 chunks and in a 4-chunk radius depending on the dungeon type. ~~Dungeons will NOT spawn if there is a road or river that would affect the placement of the dungeon (catacombs seeming to be the only exception).~~

**THE EXTRA:** The other point of this project is to determine how plvl and +value are done for each landscape. Understanding this will help players have a better idea how to find an area to grind for better gear appropriate to their level.

And, most importantly **PORTAL THEORY:** Portals will spawn in the aforementioned style. Within 8 chunks and a 4-chunk radius of a dungeon.

My computer can't handle my quick traveling through the world so I can't do this in a timely fashion on my own. Hopefully if a couple of people split up the directions I can complete this project a bit faster. To get the plvl, kill a few mobs and see what kind of levels of gear they drop. The boss will always drop the max level, trash can drop min to max.

A note on the portals: I haven't found any in this seed yet (have barely started working on it) but on the seeds I have played, the portal does not show up until you zoom your map in way too damn close. It is within 8 chunks and a 4-chunk radius on the map I'm looking at right now. When you enter a chunk with a portal in it, the chunk will be named after the portal and become apparent even if you can't see the stone.

**edit: UPDATE ON PORTALS** (from another seed)

For starters, portals always form with a [rock formation](http://imgur.com/WVd5p1p) surrounding them. Hard to see it on map because of gradient shading, so I drew it in. Here is the path between the two portals: [image](http://imgur.com/v8KVUKm)

There seems to be no correlation between the grid position in relation to each other. They do not connect via a straight line either through cardinal directions or diagonals cut through. It is interesting to note, however, how they both spawn within a grid space of a Ruins. (ninja edit) I should clarify: They DO FOLLOW MY THEORY about 8 chunks + 4 radius.

**UPDATE 2**

I've debunked my theory that roads/rivers affect the spawning of dungeons. Originally I anticipated that these spaces would be reserved for Overworld bosses (trolls, saurions, cyclops, etc), but I've found more than a few dungeons that cross through a road. One in a buggy sort of way (palace cuts through road), one in a nice mesh (road travels through canyon). I'm learning instead that Overworld bosses simply get reserved spawn points and they just happen to be more common around rivers/roads. An updated album will be available in a bit.

**UPDATE 3**

Okay, updated the imgur album. Also, created a spreadsheet to help me visually see the way power levels are generated for each location. File can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqEJC1GHyz7ddEtjaFhPWktJallRZW5UNGNUcWNkZVE&amp;usp=sharing). Yeah... I got no explanation for that. Parts of it make some sense -- Lower levels are more common near spawn/town, higher levels are generally further away, but not consistently. Portal and Overworld locations don't seem to have much rhyme or rythm to them aside from Overworld locations favoring the outskirts of a map.

**UPDATE 4**

I have no idea what happened but all my progress on the map has been lost. I have not been modifying / hacking / cheating / playing online, so something must have just gone wrong in the game itself.

Oh well. I might resume the project on a new seed and just make a spiral around town to see if I can get a better understanding of how levels are assigned.

**UPDATE 5**

Haven't had much time to resume working on this. I think I'm going to just use the google docs thing in the future and upload screenshots completely unmarked. Makes more tangible sense that way. Also, added links to my Portal Spotting album/post for people looking for that.

**UPDATE 6**

Portals definitely seem to *favor* the outskirts of a Landscape, but are not limited to it. As with Overworld mission locations, they can still spawn in other areas. Hopefully today I can explore more of a new seed and update the info with that. I'm liking the google docs format so I'm going to keep that going.",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1373826070.0,,,True,t3_1hupq4,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hupq4/working_on_a_project_to_get_a_better_idea_of/,

I've been playing for about a week now, taking time to try each class. So far I've had a lot of fun with my Rogue and my Ranger, and varying amounts of success on my Mage. 

Then I tried playing a Warrior. The experience was very...meh. Typically I enjoy playing the Sword n' Board class very much, but I felt rather under-powered for the early levels. I know Cube World's early game can feel tedious, but Warrior damage in particular felt very low.

If there's a high-level Warrior out there reading this, I must ask: does it get better? I'm more than willing to stick with it so long as the pace picks up. I'm willing to forego putting points into traveling skills to max out my combat skills. 

Thanks for the guidance!

For me, every 5-10 seconds, I'd get a small stutter that would seem to pause the game for a split second and my framerate would drop from 60 to 55 FPS. I tried various GPU and CPU settings but nothing made any difference.

In other threads, it was suggested that connecting to a local or an external server would fix the stutter. Tried it. Sometimes it solved the problem but sometimes it didn't and if it did, the stutter would just come back eventually.

So, I was watching the save folder and I noticed that the map, world, world_server, etc files were updating quite frequently. Around 5 seconds frequently. 0_o. So, I assumed that that was the culprit and I defragmented my 7200rpm, secondary drive that I was running the game from. That did nothing.


So, my temporary workaround:

1. Downloaded and installed the free version of [AMD Radeon™ RAMDisk](http://www.radeonmemory.com/software_4.0.php)

2. Created a 300MB RAMDisk.

3. Copied the whole Cube World install folder to the new virtual disk.

4. Ran the game from the RAMdisk.

5. Played for a few hours without any stutters in single player or on a server.

6. From time to time, I backed up the save folder, so I wouldn't lose progress if my computer crashed.


It's not the perfect solution for everyone who's experiencing this problem, as it may be too much of a hassle. If you're not comfortable with doing this, then just don't do it. I'm just letting letting people know of an option until wollay optimizes the saving. 

------

TL;DR: Run the game from a RAMDisk. Just be mindful and backup the save folder or the whole disk to another drive from time to time.

The Water Mage tree also has a passive (he mouses over the water icon when he switches trees), called **Torrent**, which ""increases your attack speed with each hit."" It doesn't specify whether it means spell hit or weapon hit. He doesn't mouse over the Fire Mage tree icon, so I'm not sure what the passive is.

There is a skill before Hang Gliding which he doesn't mouse over, but it looks like someone climbing up a rock, so I assume it's Wall Climbing as he showed in earlier videos. There is also two skills at the bottom which he doesn't mouse over, but they look to be Swimming and Sailing given their icons.

**Skill Trees**

FIRE

Fire Explosion &gt; Mana Shield &gt; Teleport

Pet Master &gt; Riding

Rock Climbing &gt; Hang Gliding

Swimming &gt; Sailing



WATER

Healing Stream &gt; Mana Shield &gt; Teleport

Pet Master &gt; Riding

Rock Climbing &gt; Hang Gliding

Swimming &gt; Sailing

-----------------------
**Notes**

It appears that the only thing changing from the two trees is Fire Explosion and Healing Stream. Also, all of the riding and sailing, etc abilities are on both trees and seem like odd places to put them, but that can be changed in the future. 

I'm not sure what it means by taming being more ""effective"" upon leveling it.

This is a time-limited pre-release that will stop working on the 1st of August. An update will be released before then to allow it to be used permanently.

README.txt:

This is an *EARLY* build of CWMyAdmin.

Because it is based so heavily on McMyAdmin, expect to see the odd reference to it 
here and there and misplaced update messages. These will be removed with time.

Make sure to place the following files in the CubeWorld directory:

 - Server.exe
 - zlib1.dll
 - msvcp110.dll
 - mscvr110.dll

After starting CWMA with default settings, you can reach the panel on port 8080. So
on the local machine simply browse to http://localhost:8080 - the default username
and password are both ""admin""

Under GNU/Linux, CWMA requires that Wine is installed to run the Windows-only
CubeWorld server. Wine isn't used to run CWMA itself.

This build is *UNSUPPORTED* and therefore tough luck for now if you have any problems.

A website for CWMA will be made available shortly.

Make sure to join #CWMyAdmin on irc.esper.net, or follow @PhonicUK on twitter!

EDIT:

If you want to run it under Linux, grab http://mcmyadmin.com/Downloads/etc.zip and unpack it in /usr/local - then unpack the CWMA_glibc25.zip in the root of where you unpacked CWMA, and run ./CWMA_Linux_x86_64",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,1373048481.0,,Wollay,True,t3_1hozzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hozzr/cwmyadmin_web_admin_panel_for_cubeworld_servers/,

1. Eat them.

2. Make a fish stew/soup that would work like a potion, only stronger/weaker.

3. Tame some kind of pet with it. Depends on the type of fish though. ( Altough these fish could be raw. )

This is just an idea that i had today. Please comment on what you think.

Edit : Also, user u/Logarek commented with a good idea of some sort of Minigame style fishing. Not the classic World of Warcraft or Runescape fishing, but more like The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Minigame Style fishing. And there would be another option apart from normal boat fishing, Scuba Diving. There would be a special skill called Scuba Diving ( just like Sailing or Climbing ) that you could to activate, and after that you could buy a Scuba Diving outfit from a special Merchant in order to actually be able to do it.

Bonus : you would have a special Profession called Fishing, where you would get expirience for it by cathing fish.

So i made an app for cube world.  I programmed it, made the layout and tweaked a lot of images. Right now app contains 159 unique images.


Anyway, this app is similiar to other wiki like apps, best feature i think is that you can search pets and what food it needs to tame it.

App has been available for a week now, i have updated 4 times since and there yet to be any crash reports. *phew*


There are few things missing right now like:
*races
*monster list?
*Some helpful text
*biomes

I haven't implemented biomes or races yet because im afraid of big images taking a lot of space in app and i can't decide how will i display biomes.


If you think there is something missing or there is something tottaly wrong with this app, please comment or email me at :  teddydevelopers@gmail.com  before giving bad rating in google play!

I have the biggest boner for this game right now.

I've never been into building stuff, i mean it's cool but I prefer adventuring which this focuses more on where as minecraft is all about building things now days. So it seems like multiplayer servers instead of being people showing off what they can make in casual-creative mode, it would instead be people going on adventures and having fun fighting enemies and finding temples and just oh god!

A few weeks back I made an Android application for Cube World that contains a list of all tamable (and some non-tamable) pets, and what food you need to tame it. If you're interested already you can find it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brops.cubeworldpets


Some screenshots:

You can click on each one to go into its detail screen and find additional information like whether the pet is mountable, where you can find it, etc. Also in this detail screen there are checkboxes that you can tick when you want/have the pet. When you then go back to the main screen and you go into the menu, you can find filtering options. You can filter the list to e.g. only show wanted/not acquired pets, or only mountable ones.


There are also sorting options to sort alphabetically by pet name or by food.


More features are on the way, for example combining filters, so you could for instance filter all mountable and not acquired pets. I also want to make it so you can add your own notes for each pet.


So as I said, it's been out for a while, but I totally forgot to post it here.


An iOS version is being made, but it's not known how long this will take as the guy who will make this version (a good friend of mine) has some other stuff to take care of first.


If you have any suggestions/bugs, please post them!


-Edit-

Version 1.6 has been published to the store. It'll be up shortly! Changes:

--- Version 1.6 ---

- Added checkbox for when you have food for a pet in the pet's detail screen
- Added filter options for showing pets you have/don't have the food for
- Added category dividers to the filtering options

--- Version 1.5c ---

- Added non-tamable pet Koala
- Data is now more efficient, loading times should be a little faster
- Biomes are now sorted alphabetically

After reading through every application in the [application thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1hxxql/rcubeworld_is_looking_for_up_to_4_new_moderators/) from last week and then getting input from the current mods at that time I can now present the results. Additionally, there will be the main reasons I could discard 90% of the applications.

The new moderators are:

/u/kasukali

/u/u_ok

/u/Syberz

I felt like taking 4 new Moderators in total, but at the end Tom_Luthor started working on integrating the AutoModerator and there was no one where I could say that they fit well enough. That person I had in mind will never find out how close he was, so you can all imagine to be that potentially fourth candidate.

Anyway, here is what most applicants lacked. There were a lot of applications, which stated how they got Cube World, but not telling me why they want to moderate. Another problem has been that I had people showing off how many moderation experience they have as if it was some kind of Job they apply to. Often the sentence ""I would love to help the Community/become a mod"" fell, but everything listed in the application could have been done without being a mod. Being friendly is also not a requirement to become a mod.

Generally it showed me really well, which people like to show off a lot by making the application style informal. Since there was nothing to abide or Guidelines applicants could not just build their application in a way it was expected and that is how only those with true motivation were really considered. That is really what I wanted, someone who makes a post like they usually would, so I can see if they fit.

To disallow any edit after ninja-edit also allowed me to discard 2 applications right away. It was generally a training for the mod section, since you cannot edit posts there. It also removed the risk of someone reserving a place as one of the first and then edit good stuff from other applications in theirs.

1374068775.0,19,self.CubeWorld,1ihgus,"As another user said, We need more discussions! :D (Discussion inside)",31,12,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1ihgus/as_another_user_said_we_need_more_discussions_d/,"So, what do you guys think would be good additions to Cube World? There are many unfinished things in the game, and even more things that Wollay probably hasn't even thought about. I have a list below of some ideas I had and some things I noticed:



**1. A Problem With Surplus Money**

I dunno about you guys, but I ALWAYS have a surplus of money. Everything in the game is extremely cheap after you level once or twice (aside from the boat and glider). It's ironic to say it, but I just wish things were a bit more expensive (excepting glass flasks). The economy of Cube World is really inflated, so the prices should be increased, and there should also be more buyable items.

**2. The Ocean is Fucking Boring**

In my first world, over half of my lands were oceanic. I did a lot of sailing. I also did some underwater exploration. There are marine caves which are cool, and new mobs (giant fish). But in the other biomes there are semi-excusives: Deserts have cacti for potions, and Snowies have ice flowers which you have to melt. But the oceans have little heart flowers, but they are very scarce, and can only be found on islands. Sure, this adds difficulty, but I think it'd be better if you could harvest seaweed or coral and use that to make a potion. Furthermore, it'd also be great if you could use seaweed to strengthen or craft armor. For instance, instead of *Immaculate Iron Armor*, you could craft (or enhance it to) *Immaculate Iron Armor of the Sea*. Anyway, you get the gist of it.

**3. Automatic Boat/Glider Switching**

Most experience Cube World players (or Cubenauts as I call them, because naut means explore [eg. astro*naut*]) know the feeling of having a boat equipped, being chased by an ogre or some other powerful enemy, and then having to stop, press **I**, and switch from boat to glider so you can escape his pursuit. This is frustrating, as you probably know first-hand. So, I propose that the switching between them be automatic. If you're in air or on land, the glider will be equipped when you press **G**, but when you're in water the boat will be equipped when you press it. makes sense, and keeps you from dying. I think this would be a great and useful addition.

**4. Something Fucking Special**

*... With all due respect....* Seriously, for the love of God! It's so frustrating to play the game for the first time, and examine things, just to find out that every single thing has the exact same description of *There's nothing special.* I understand that this is probably a planned feature, but I just wish that Wollay/Pixxie hadn't implemented the ability to examine things if there's never something special about the objects you can examine. I personally think they should have waited.

**5. Bats in Underwater Caves?**

Yes, there are bats in underwater caves. If I recall correctly, they fly as if through air, even under water. I may be wrong about that, though. I'd personally rather there be no mobs in marine caves than bats. But as for the suggestion, there should be something scary like an octopus or something in marine caves. Maybe floating spike ball things (I forget what they're called, but they are marine creatures with spines and spikes like porcupines) in caves that you have to evade?

**6. Brighter lanterns for Marine Caves**

As I said before, I've spent a good amount of time in oceans. From that time, I know that underwater caves are DARK. The lanterns should be sold exclusively in ocean cities; this will give more motivation to visit an ocean city, as well. Also, I feel like in ocean cities there should be a place to customize the sail of your ship; this way, people can't create crazy models for ships, but instead just edit the sail. I mean, you payed 10 freaking silver for the ship, so make it your own, right?

**7. Better World Map**

When you zoom out on the world map as far as you can, it still shows the names of the dungeons, forests and towns. Instead of this, the map should show the names of the lands because that's what we'd care about knowing from that distance away form the map. The text of the names of dungeons and whatnot change according to difficulty, but why don't the colors of the lands' names? How are you supposed to know where in your world is best suited for your level? Also, the colors of the lands themselves should change according to biome. All of this improves the maps clarity, and I don't see why it wouldn't be implemented in the future.

**8. Lagging Hotkeys**

Sometimes, when I press **M**, it takes awhile to open the map. This also happens with gliders and boats occasionally. I'm not sure why this happens, but it's not just me. I've heard about it happening to other people (including my brother).

**9. Pet Call Key**

**Edit: The T key already does this, but only when your pet is out of your rendering range**

Has anyone here ever played Red Dead Redemption? In that game when you press one of the D-Pad directions (I forget which one), your character whistles, and your horse comes rushing towards you from wherever it was. In Cube World, I don't expect something so mainstream. So far, pets are slow when compared to us on our gliders, and fairly glitchy, too. Some times, in the middle of combat, your pet isn't with you, so to respawn it you have to hit **I**, and un-equip the pet, then re-equip it. This causes the pet to respawn right next to you. I suggest that Wollay/Pixxie implement a key (the **Z** key, I guess, because everything else near to **WASD** is already taken) that automatically does this. 

**10. Those Repulsive Rocks**

Okay, don't get me wrong. I like having the rocks in the terrain generation. They add variety and uniqueness to the landscape. But they just look so.. Fake. They're so perfectly round and symmetrical, and they protrude out of sides of mountains; they don't even look like they have slowly eroded the mountain and sunk into the dirt. They look like they are sticky and are just stuck to the side unrealistically. I often see a beautiful mountain, and while my eyes scan it, [I come across something that truly bugs me.](http://imgur.com/RHcdgIX) Seriously, though; imagine the mountains and hills without those protruding, unrealistically shaped boulders. It'd look a lot better. I like the rocks, but I just wish they were more naturally broken and random looking. 



Anyway, thanks a lot for reading my post. Before commenting in anger of something I wrote, realize that this is entirely IMHO. I love this game, but I also love the idea of constructive criticism. So what does /r/CubeWorld think the game needs? What do you want it to have? What did you think of my ideas? I kept my ideas pretty close to the Cube World basics, but feel free to think and comment abstractly, and think outside the box! :D

Perhaps if this is an alleged ""militant"" band of MC fans they should remember where Notch and Co began and give the creators of this some slack.  

I'm only ranting as I'm fed up of the state of the communities when it comes to new releases of what could be in their opinion too similar.  

Did we all rant when developers made sprite based side scrollers e.g Shadow of the Beast and Turrican 2, no.  Did we all rant after Quake when other devs made 3d shooters like Duke Nukem 3D, no.

It feels odd to be able to kill all the mobs around the boss easily, and to not take too much damage from the boss's attacks, but to then take 20 minutes or so mindlessly bashing away at it to bring it down.

Personally, I'm primarily looking forward to an action-oriented game with heavy roleplaying elements and a deep questing/crafting system.  Luckily, that's what we're getting!

However, I'd also feel like it'd be a missed opportunity to not give us the tools to build our own structures.  We already have the voxel system, an ability to build onto our gear, and a focus on creating our own stories and characters in a giant world.  I feel like it's a natural -- and necessary -- step to let us create our own structures.

That said, I really don't want the depth of building that Minecraft had.  I don't necessarily need a a deep triggers system (beyond opening doors, etc), and I don't want to see the game turn into ""look at this computer I built!""  I just want to come home after an adventure to a custom home I've built into the side of a mountain.  Which, I suppose, also means I'd like to be able to terraform.

As far as gathering materials, instead of mining a la Minecraft, just gather materials off fallen creatures and/or chests.  

So, what do you think?  Yay/nae to building?  Yay/nae to terraforming?",,False,self,t5_2t4bs,False,,,True,t3_1gxp2q,http://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/1gxp2q/is_the_cube_world_community_generally_against/,

I've been experiencing cubeworld quite excessively and what I've been finding out is that crafting materials for the most part is only good if you drag someone lower level than you into having better equipment. I'd love to use it for my own good, but finding legendaries (and partially even mythicals) that fit my level in just about every castle i come across makes the crafting system kind of awkward.

I would rather use my found diamonds/rubies/sapphires/emeralds/gold/etc. for enhancing my current armor/weapons with special spheres/elements that you can put on your weapon, or even enchant it with. 

For instance, 10 Cubes of diamond (for 1h, 2h might be more expensive) would give the weapon something like Diamond hardening, which makes the weapon stronger. Things like that would really make me as an end-game character want to farm loads of minerals to enhance my gear.

I'd say I started off Gaming on PC with TF2 and then my PC became outdated and I moved onto Xbox and played games such as Halo and Call of Duty. I remember torrenting Minecraft and playing it for two weeks and had a lot of fun and bought it the on Halloween night (The night the Nether was implemented) very much enjoyed the game but I never really stuck with it, it was more of a rare treat to come back to. As I went back and played it for about a week with a couple of buddies playing Tekkit. Which I find weird as I've done a lot of Minecraft animating for friends such as Dreamreaver23 who's known for Minecraft parodies.
           

Anyways, anxiety runs in my family and I've had history with things such as pill abuse so I refused to take a prescription for my anxiety and have tried to cope in other ways. My anxiety has always been terrible (Not necessarily in social situations just in general) but the past month or so it's been at an all time high. I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago and haven't spoke since (We've known each other for about 3-4 years) and was hoping to work things out with her, and my father and I recently finished the tile in Kitchen (We're currently renting, but were fixing up the house as we've been overpaying on it for years) So after taking a standard basement used for storage we laid drywall, carpet, painted the walls, etc. And basically re-painting and re-doing carpet and several other rooms we just finished the Kitchen and were mostly finished with the house.


 We sent the pictures over to our landlord, and the next morning he replied with an email containing two of my fathers mugshots (Taken not to long ago from when the FBI raided our house a few months back. I have a video talking about it if anyone's curious) and an eviction notice. After paying $1600 a month for this place for 3-4 years (Not including utilities) we have 14 days to move over a weed bust. Luckily my brother-in-law does things with real-estate and such so he was helping us find a place. Well we did, and it was pretty nice not great for our two chihuahuas though. (Yes they're rat dogs, but it's all my parents would allow when we got the first one and the second was a rescue. And I love them.) It was definitely a downgrade but I didn't mind as it was short notice, everything was basically set in place until they ran my parents license plate after meeting them for the second time and we haven't heard back since. We were hoping to move in the 14 days, but that's not looking like it's going to happen.


So in summary of all of that, it's been a terrible month, anxiety at an all time high from other things as well like my dogs getting out and one almost getting ran over by a speeding prick. And I've been playing Cube World to cope, and how I've loved it. I'm an Undead Warrior and don't quite understand how mechanics such as blocking work and the secondary mouse attack. But my companion Collie (Named Ally after my Ex) who's always been at my side and I are learning. I never quite understood the addiction or that feeling to play more of games like Minecraft or World of Warcraft and as a guy who plays FPS's and Twitch Shooters competitively I didn't expect to like a game like this. Sadly the servers were down so I had to torrent it, but planned on buying when I had the money. But I fear I'll lose my character and my dear Collie if I do. I still play CS:GO usually daily, but whenever I get stressed out or need to just get away from the world I either boot up and play with my buddy Austin on his server or by myself. And I don't think I've felt this piece of mind in a long time.

2) How do you think this class will function in various different scenarios? (Farming mobs/Bossing/PvP/Etc.)  
3) What strengths/weaknesses will be associated with this class?  
4) Do you think that any specific class will be heavily favored by the community? (Large percentage of players playing only that class)

Take for instance, Dark Souls II--while I am extremely excited for the game, I am content with waiting for it to be completed, and don't intend on wasting my time in constant anticipation until its release.

But Cubeworld...

Cubeworld is another story.

Today alone, I have refreshed the Cubeworld page a minimum of ten times, hoping for something to change. In the mean time, I have watched the same gameplay videos for probably the twentieth time, contently, as well as stare aimlessly at the collection of screenshots on the Picroma page. I even created a Twitter account--something I care nothing for--just to follow Wollay for updates.

I'm the type of person who purposefully tries not to set high expectations for upcoming things. But for an amalgam of reasons, I cannot stop thinking about Cubeworld in my free time. And though I'm keeping my expectations chained, I would realistically pay $100 for the alpha version of this game. If that was the price, I would gladly pay it, with no reservations. I have never been so impatient for something in my life. And have reached the point of mental instability.

I know, Wollay needs to take his time. I know, I know. And usually I'm a calm enough individual to respect that and just let things be. But god dammit, I would give anything for a release date. Even a seasonal estimate. Summer? Fall?

I'm about as dumb as it gets to this game; I've been playing for about a week, and while I wish I could contribute as much as you all do, but I alas, I think I only have one thing to share, and some of you might have already figured this out.

Let's say you want to make like 20 potions. Instead of holding down the mouse and wanting the cute progress bar, you can hover your mouse over the button, then press M to bring up your map. While you're looking at the map, hold the mouse down, which not only moves the map around, but also creates the item you wanted to craft. It's a neat little trick to do when you're standing by the saw, cutting up logs, or filling up bottles, or creating life potions. I'm sure there are others ways to entertain yourself while crafting large quantities of items, but I found this out last night. Hope this helps someone!

Airships: Buy-able with platinum coins and only accessible after 100 in gliding is spent, assuming they are very fast and can house many people

Companions: Know all those awesome Blue guys that walk around and will sometimes help you in Combat? why not have a system where if you stick around and help them they grow to like you and stick around to help you

A potion shop: I dont care how much money they are, but I think this is something everyone would want. Actually I do care, make the potions expensive enough to the point wheres its cheaper to make potions, but for the rich its just a convenient.

A barber shop: Somewhere in a town, with a fee of course, you can kinda re-customize yourself(i.e new hair,face ect.)

Customizable Pets: You know like the character creation screen, but for pets

PVP: Maybe if a player walked up to another and challenged them to a duel, combat between players would be allowed till one died

A storyline: This ones obviously ambitious/wishful thinking, but maybe some evil plague or ruler or epidemic has overcome Cube World, and its your goal to travel threw different continents collecting clues as to how to reach him

A Karma System: With the storyline Idea, as you did things to work to restoring Cube World you  would gain karma, which would effect things like drops and the amount of times you get 2 or 3 things from one iron nugget, ect

So yeah, just any suggestions with ways to implement them.

I haven't been monitoring Wollay or Pixxie, but I would like to lay out some of my own ideas and get some feedback.

First, the talent system. I would like depth and separation between the talents. As it stands, your 3 class skills then the same Pet skills, Climbing, and Swimming skills are just thrown together in one page. 
For this, I think we could separate future talents in the vein of ""Strength"", ""Intelligence"", and ""Dexterity"", or more likely closer to ""Courage"", ""Wisdom"", and ""Guile"" to avoid the usual fantasy tropes. Things that increase physical damage/the effectiveness of Strength related attacks or reduce the amount of Stamina used on your dodging, climbing, etc would go under Strength/Courage because endurance is generally related to Strength. Things that reduce the mana cost of abilities or say...increase the duration of crowd control effects go under Wisdom. As for Guile, Pet Skills or things that increase ranged/melee damage of Dexterity related abilities.
Of course, this is just the foundation, and a rough idea. More skill types could be added and really make the character progression interesting.

Which is where the larger ideas come into play. Total overhaul of how characters work. Stay with 4 classes and unrestrict weapons. To make sure that a Mage doesn't kick your ass with knuckles, they would have to adjust the stats to reflect between having a weaker body (Mage/Ranger) and having a weaker mind (Warrior/Rogue). I would go with 3 simple stats, like I mentioned above, along with a few of the ones in play already like Tempo and Armor.

The important part is that a Mage with certain skills or stat changes could cast a (not super strong) Fireball, and then start beating your face in with a two handed mace. Two weapon presets to set and switch to. That sounds fun. 

They could even make different modes of the game. One would be a simple version, without the deeper talents and gameplay elements that draw some people, and then one with those changes. That would complicate the process, so it isn't the best answer, but it's an idea.

House building should be a relevant, but not overbearing experience. Somewhere you go to maybe keep a small farm of rare herbs or foods to make interesting foods, rest to get a small temporary stat bonus, and decorate it with unique things that you can use for your adventures. If they are going to go with premade rooms that snap on, a decent number of types of materials/shapes/styles should be available. 
You could go with the idea of making a few pieces of furniture the focus of where your house is. The bed would be the prime respawn point within a certain radius of your home at a reduced or no cost, but after that you would spawn at the angels.


Quests are on their way, which will definitely open the way for an UNDER THE HOOD reputation system that isn't simply point based and has desirable rewards that aren't breaking the idea of these isolated towns. Each town (and people who pass through it) have reactions to you and your actions. With the additions of more buildings and places in the wilderness, they could create a situation where you could do something evil like stealing/murdering/etc, but lose reputation IF someone got away and there was a decent distance from any peaceful travelers.
No rep grinds. We did too much of that, this game should be fun. 

This is all I have for now, but I'll post later when/if I have any improvements on the ideas I presented here, or if I get any new ones.

 Thanks for reading and thanks to [Wollay](https://twitter.com/wol_lay) and [Pixxie](https://twitter.com/pix_xie) for making something with so much potential!
