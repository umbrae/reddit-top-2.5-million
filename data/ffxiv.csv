Obviously we're all impatient for Phase 4 to start and answering the same questions all day every day is likely frustrating but it's worth remembering that FFXIV hasn't really started off on the best foot. With that trainwreck of a launch in 2010 making Square a total laughing stock people are hardly going to be rushing in droves to buy ARR, sure the loyal FF fans (as many of you likely are) don't care about that sort of thing but Joe Blogs does. 


Love or hate the common folk the game needs subscribers to succeed - development isn't going to fund itself. Should people read the FAQs before posting? Yeah. Are they all going to? Of course not. It doesn't really take that much effort to simply give them a helpful answer and maybe a polite link to the FAQ where they could have found it along with whatever else happens to be in there. 

Downvoting them to oblivion, or hell even telling them to leave with a rehashed insult or two, doesn't really seem constructive to building a community now does it? Good word of mouth can convince people this game is worth a second chance.


But hey, that's just the unwanted 2cents from someone who dodged the bullet of FFXIV to begin with. Like those newbies asking silly questions I never purchased the original game, I'm not a diehard [legacy member](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/Gouki22/FFXIV/hipster.jpg), I'm just a gamer hoping Square has learned from their mistakes. Community matters to the success of this game, maybe just keep that in mind eh?

1376449406.0,222,self.ffxiv,1kbp3v,(Honest Advice) Don't Join A Reddit LS/FC Just To Be With Redditors.,273,51,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1kbp3v/honest_advice_dont_join_a_reddit_lsfc_just_to_be/,"I've seen a lot of comments in this subreddit about players trying to find out which server all the redditors are going to play on. I know this might sound like heresy by saying this on the /r/ffxiv subreddit, but please hear me out. Do not let this subreddit influence your choice of server destination or LS/FC choice. Instead, **I would encourage players to choose whatever server they want, regardless of where the majority of redditors will be heading.**

I played the first two months of 1.0 almost exclusively with redditors. 
I was one of the original sack-holders for the 1.0 Reddit LS, Karma Knights:

http://www.ffxivpro.com/player/Aegis/Seiken-Valk


When MMORPG players start a fresh new game, many have lofty expectations and goals. Everyone wants to specialize in something, or be a big contributor in another way that will give them a good reputation among their LS. ""Hey, I'll be the LS Alchemist."" or ""Hey, feed me shards and ore and I'll make the LS weapons!"" As you would expect, this turns out to be a logistics and diplomacy disaster. What I don't think many people realize is that Reddit is not a small, exclusive entity. If you look at the side-bar, **there are about 14,500 FFXIV redditors.** While I don't think we were this large back at 1.0's release, this only further emphasizes the point I am trying to make. There are many nice and helpful people in this subreddit, but there are also a lot of inconsiderate, whiny, and immature players. Karma Knights had its fair share of both groups, but I am not sure if the good outweighed the bad in Karma Knights. 

During the first few weeks of 1.0's launch, the Reddit LS became a complete headache to manage. Soon the players who were fed mats were barraged by requests to synth them gear. I mean after all, they gave you their shards and mats, so isn't it fair for you to craft them free gear when they ask for it? With hundreds of Redditors in game, you can imagine how terrible of an idea this was. Players who cared even less just stopped responding to requests and quit FFXIV after being fed tons of mats. This is what happened with the original Karma Knights leader, Hito Goroshi. **What initially started out as some kind of semi-socialistic endeavor to help out other redditors soon became a disjointed and somewhat jaded group.** 

It wasn't until only about 8 players were left that we decided to abandon the Reddit name. Those of us who remained started an independent endgame LS called Dancing Mad led by a redditor who wasn't active in the original Karma Knights. Now 3 years post-release, I think only 4 of the original Karma Knight redditors are left in the LS. 

I know that the launch of FFXIV 1.0 was a fairly unique situation. Many players were very disappointed and under a lot of stress. Should they keep investing their time and energy into a game they did not enjoy? Or should they cut their losses despite any obligations they had towards others who helped them? I'm not trying to judge anyone. However, I do want to warn others who might have been as optimistic/naive as I was. Instead of basing your gameplay expectations from being in a Reddit LS, I would highly encourage everyone to play independently of this subreddit's members. If you happen to meet some good players who are also redditors, then that is great. But **don't let your expectations of playing with people who you have never met or really interacted with influence how you will play the game.** I hope players reading this can save themselves a little bit of a headache and have a more rewarding experience in 2.0.

**Edit (8:45 am EST)**: A lot of people are commenting that the problem was a lack of leadership or that the problem was crafting related. I understand, and I think I could've written my post better. The crafting part was just one example and it represented more a symptom than the disease itself. There were a lot of reddit players at launch that were very impatient and immature in many areas. As several of you have commented, think of many of the repetitive questions asked in this subreddit or the vitriol many have when responding to these questions. These were the kinds of players in Karma Knights at launch.

I want to share this website we have been working very hard on since the start of beta 3. 

* XIVDB: http://xivdb.com/

We've extracted a lot of data from the game and we are proud to be one of the first and most community driven websites for FFXIV database related information! The database contains information related to Items, Recipes, Skills (still being modified) and various game related features: Companions, Achievements, Emotes and such :D

We recently completed the Maps tool which shows all the maps in the game with overlays for: F.A.T.Es, NPCs, Camps, Important Places, Landmarks, NPCs, Gathering Points and Mining Points. Icons have tool-tips to show what they are and you can click on zone lines or use the drop-down menu to navigate :)

* Check it out here: http://xivdb.com/?maps

The site can be viewed in 4 languages: English, French, German and Japanese. A big thanks to the translators who helped us achieve this.

XIVDB, like XIVPads is very community driven, anything you'd like to see, want changed or your opinion on how something looks, let us know and we will work on it right away! You can talk directly with us on XIVPads or here or on the site! We're everwhere! :) I'm PV!

Hope you enjoy the site! Lots more to throw in!

* Thank you to everyone for the lovely words. We are working to implement a lot of suggestions posted below :D This is going to get fantastic!!!

I basically learned (or attempted to learn) Rainmeter *while* creating this, so things may be done inefficiently. Having said that, I created this skin as a project to keep me busy until FFXIV release. I did have fun making this, so I may piddle with it more in the future.

Everything that needs to be configured should be able to be set up through the @Resources\include.inc file. This skin does also come packaged with a layout, which will load the skins in the proper configuration on your desktop.

Used [nVidia Inspector to Overclock](http://www.techspot.com/downloads/5077-nvidia-inspector.html). This is all the overclock I am doing on the video card: (you can see default clock are the value set by default, ie: no overclock)
[Here were my settings (you will need to find your own)](https://cdn.guildwork.net/files/517ddcc4ab0eed3377627acb/51fb2bf9c16e4d37c58fac6a.jpg)

*Edit (you can use MSI Afterburner for Radeon Cards)*

[Here is a nice guide](http://redd.it/1jqaap) for the how to overclock the video card if you want to do that part.


Then I use this [Razer Game Booster](http://www.razerzone.com/gamebooster) What Game Booster does is create a 1 button toggle to kill and reboot tasks and process you may not need while gaming. I left it at the default setup but you can configure exactly what processes it manages. I know, terribad name, and I never thought I'd see the day I would recommend a Razer product. But although it does jack for my desktop, it makes a large difference on my laptop and I can't argue with results.
[It looks like this](https://cdn.guildwork.net/files/517ddcc4ab0eed3377627acb/51fb2ba9c16e4d33b916e303.jpg)


Now, Maximum settings is a benchmark flexing muscle thing. I'm a Senior Technical Artist, optimizing graphics is what I do. It's what gets bread on my table. 

**The following tweaks** on the graphic settings (those with red dots) will help you out getting better performance and you also won't notice anything visually different from Maximum settings. (unless you are looking with a magnifying glass and pause the game and compare on a pixel per pixel basis) 

**[The following image is max settings with changes only where the red dots are.](https://cdn.guildwork.net/files/517ddcc4ab0eed3377627acb/51fbc165c16e4d33b916e60c.jpg)**

With the ""Red Dots Tweaks"" I scored [5438](https://cdn.guildwork.net/files/517ddcc4ab0eed3377627acb/51fbc169c16e4d3af2cb16e3.jpg) on my laptop

Here's the visual difference between [Max Settings](https://cdn.guildwork.net/files/517ddcc4ab0eed3377627acb/51fb38acc16e4d355cb115ff.jpg) and [The Red Dots Changes](https://cdn.guildwork.net/files/517ddcc4ab0eed3377627acb/51fb38a5c16e4d3af2cb14f8.jpg)

**What can help you most, but will be noticeable visually:**

* Lowering Screen Space Ambient Occlusion &lt;– this is the bigger bang * for buck for most older / slower cards
* Turning off Depth of field &lt;-- This is only during cinematics (The benchmark is a big cinematic so take this one with a grain of salt)
* Turning off FXAA
* Lowering x16 of anisotropic filtering &lt;- this one is more for older cards (more than~5 years old). Depends on if you card has hardware support for anisotropic filtering or not.
* Turning off radial blur
* Turning off HDR
* Turning Transparent Lighting Quality from High to Normal  &lt;-- This one shows, but not a lot, but is a pretty big chunk of improvement in perf if you are GPU bound. *(Edit: I went from 5.4k to 6.6k On Red Dot setting with this change alone)*

YoshiP himself noted in the internally famous interview about subscription vs. free-to-play that there are really only two companies around making MMOs on their own dime without investors funding the game: Blizzard and Square-Enix. 

It looks like Blizzard is heeding the alluring call of cash shops. It doesn't look like it's going to be particuarly pay-to-win in any meaningful way, but it sure breaks immersion pretty badly if you ask me. While cultivating a game world that captures passionate players is certainly a means of generating sustainable revenue, cash shops can glitter a lot more brightly in the short term.

My point is, I hope we all recognize just how lucky we are that the head honchos of FFXIV seem to be adamantly against ruining the experience with in-game cash shops or other free-to-play trappings. You pay once a month and then never think about real-world money in-game. They really love us!

Edit: Great conversation folks. It seems a majority of FFXIV redditors active today are pretty solidly against a cash shop, but we heard some pretty good counterpoints as well. I can't say I agree with them, but it's always good to see some spirited debate.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1375310605.0,,uldah,True,t3_1jfrfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1jfrfx/ffxiv_may_be_the_only_largescale_mmo_left_on_the/,

Even if this topic drifts far away from the front page, I intend to keep the information as current as I possibly can.  If you have questions, found this page from searching, or have new information to share, feel free to reply to the thread, or send me a PM.  I will respond to all inquiries based in this thread.*

**What is early access?**

Early access is a period of time before official service begins where those who have permission will be able to play the game.

**Isn't that the same as phase 4/open beta?**

No.  There are two key distinctions between them. 

First, open beta is available to all who have met the requirements for beta access; early access entry has different requirements.

Second, there is a chance that open beta's data will not carry over into release.  Early access' data will carry over.

**When does early access begin?**

It starts on August 24th, and will continue through August 26th.  

[Source.](http://i.imgur.com/PMW87Se.png)

**When and where can I put in my code?**

The site will open on August 20th, so you can enter your code then.  We don't have a link for the site just yet, so please look forward to it.

**How can I get early access?**

There are only two ways to gain early access:  Legacy-designated accounts and those who pre-order.

**Do 1.0 players automatically get early access?**

No.  For a 1.0 player to get early access, you must have a Legacy account or preorder.

**Do Beta testers automatically get early access?**

No.  You must have a Legacy account or preorder.

**I have my early access code.  What do I do now?**

First, [go to this website](http://preorder.na.finalfantasyxiv.com/us), and input your email.  That's as far as you can go at this point in time.  Square Enix will send you further information when it is available.

[EU version here](http://preorder.eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/gb).

**I inputted my early access code, and it shows up in my games profile.  I'm done, right?**

No.  There isn't a way to tie your early access code to your FFXIV service account just yet.  You most likely entered the code on Square Enix's member's site, which is a pseudo-social networking area, and has no bearing on actual gameplay. [(Example image.)](http://i.imgur.com/1WawRTT.png)

**I ordered from Square-Enix directly, where is my preorder code?**

Square Enix has said that they will email you your code at a future date.

For Digital River related downloads, see [this dev post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1k8g1p/dev_clarification_on_early_access_code_from/).

**I ordered from a third-party retailer, where is my preorder code?**

Generally speaking, if you ordered from a third party, you should have your code by now.  Most brick-and-mortar shops will print out the code on a receipt.  Online retailers often send the code in a second email, after your order has been confirmed.  

If you preordered from a third party, and do not have your access code, you should contact them.

Please be advised: it has been reported that EU online orders are sending their codes out at a later date, so if this applies to you, keep it in mind.

**I ordered from NewEgg, where is my preorder code?**

NewEgg is not part of the early access program, and so you will not be receiving a code from them.

**Can I just buy an early access code?**

Square Enix has not made this option available.

**What does a preorder code look like?**

It is an 18 character code, with a mix of numbers and letters.

XXXXXX - ### - XXXXXX - ### is the general format people have been reporting.

**How will I play the game before release if I don't have my software and product key?**

Square Enix will contact you with directions on how to download the client.  You will not need your physical products for early access.

**Once I input my preorder code, will I be able to play on PS3 and PC?**

Yes, the current information suggests that early access is platform free.

*After doing some thinking about this, there is a potential roadblock.  It may not be possible for PC users to gain access to the client on PS3.  During Beta, the client download was accessed by a code, which was emailed to testers who applied for PS3 beta.  There is no real way of knowing what will happen, but I wanted to make sure this disclaimer made it in.*

**Do I have to preorder the Collector's Edition to get early access?**

No, any valid preorder will qualify.

**Will the Collector's Edition Digital Upgrade qualify me for early access?**

No, it is not available for preorder, but release day purchase, and as such, will not come with early access.

**Gamestop gave me more than 1 code -- what happened?**

They simply printed multiple codes, either through associate error or other factors.  You should be okay.

**My Gamestop told me they were out of codes -- what happened?**

The computer is reporting that codes are exhausted at the time of preorder, but if they include a backup code in your transaction, it is confirmed working.

**I preordered with Green Man Gaming, and they sent me a ""registration code"".  What is this?**

The code you got from GMG is an early access code.  Your FFXIV:ARR product keys will be emailed to you at the release of the game.




*That's all I have for now.  I apologize to our regular subreddit users for putting this up, but hope that our newcomers will find it helpful.  If I have misrepresented an answer, or should add something else, please let me know.  Thank you.*

I was just pointed at a thread regarding the early access pre-order codes that I hadn't seen before.

I just wanted to follow up and clarify a couple of things:

* First and foremost, I'm really sorry if any confusion caused you stress. 
* Please PM directly if you're having problems receiving or redeeming your early access code. 
* FYI we've also added an additional $5 credit to the pre-order so now, if you pre-order you'll get $5 general Amazon credit and $5 Digital Video Games Credit. Both credits last for 1 year, anyone who as already pre-ordered will get the additional credit without having to take any further action.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm here to answer them!

**Ordering from Square Enix: Early Access Codes**
These will come from a different distributor and will be sent out *next month* that is all they know and the codes will be sent to the email your ordered on.  It is NOT the same as the code you received in the email saying *Pre-Order Bonus Package* even though it might look the same.

**Ordering from Square Enix: Pre-Order Bonus Package**
This is a code to register the game itself on your Square Enix members page.  They are currently doing maintenance and the first phase of this went in on the 12th, this also explains why many users are experiencing interesting/unexpected behavior.  Additionally, because of this maintenance codes might behave different, for example I pre-ordered the PS3 CE and when I registered the game it said it was the PC version.

**Square Enix Members: Disappearing Games**
As stated above, they are doing maintenance and they will not touch your account until this process has been completed.  They have no ETA on this and expect your previously registered games to show back up when this process has completed.  If they do not, THEN you can call back in and they will help try and restore them.  Again no ETA.

**Square Enix Members: Should I register my ARR game then?**
If the instructions say to register the game, or do a specific task then do what it instructs to do.

That is everything I was told and tried to ask as much and be as specific as possible.  Hopefully this helps answer some outstanding questions/confusion we might have had.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,False,,uldah,True,t3_1iuth6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1iuth6/i_called_squareenix_customer_support_and/,

If you want to make your tank a happy tank, run towards them instead of away from them.  A tank has to keep steady control on positioning so that everyone else can do their job with as little trouble as possible, and when the tank has to run around, things start to feel hectic.  As a result, frontal cone abilities can hit people that they shouldn't and situational awareness suffers in general.  It's much easier for us to snag enmity if we have the mob nice and close beside us, and this way we can keep the rest of what we are tanking relatively stationary to keep everyone else happy.

Just thought I'd share this tip to help everybody be successful in dungeons, it also helps lessen the drama that can come if your tank isn't the best at managing aggro.

The sim uses Javascript (GASP!!!) to run the sim. The reason why I chose javascript is because it is a client-side language. Which means it will use YOUR processing power to run the sim rather than the servers. This keeps me safe from my host and any harassment from their end in case the site gets busy. It also allows me to develop rapidly instead of using a low level language like C++.

Instructions:

You input your lodestone ID; If the job is available it will import your character and run a parse to the precoded priority system. 

You can set iterations; Fight Length;  and up to 2 bards to personally buff you.
Food/consumable support coming soon.

I'm currently using the available DPS formula (95% accurate), Skill/Spell speed formula(99% accurate) and crit formula (95%) accurate as discussed by the hardest working theorycrafters right now.

I will have options soon to adjust your stats manually (in the case of gear optimization and stat allocation)

EDIT: For those who want to see what it looks like, I pulled some random sap from lodestone:
http://chocobro.com/sim/?lodestoneid=361126&amp;iterations=100&amp;fightlength=300&amp;bbqty=0&amp;bbmp=2500&amp;tpsettings=0
-----

For the future: 

1. Set up a beta release repository for modules so trusted module developers can make fine tuned adjustments to increase damage.

2. Move to C++ and a GUI with biweekly/patch releases once a stable web sim is completed.

3. Only DPS classes will be supported right away, but I do have plans to optimize tank emnity generation and damage. No plans for healers at all right now. (sorry :[ )
There's really not a reason to sim healers besides to have grumpy people compare throughput which has always been a pretty sore topic (imo).

4. Show the priority used for criticism by the playerbase. All priority rotations will be tested and verified under a ton of iterations. 

5. Tons of other stuff!

Please leave any questions here!
&lt;3!

EDIT: Just a note - Since lodestone beta will go down and characters erased, there could be some issues with loading characters into the sim. I'll try and stay on top of it.

Also, since the site was designed using CSS3, there could be some issues using old versions of Internet Explorer. If this site doesn't run well on ps3 or other non-traditional browsers, let me know!

EDIT: If you're a free company that wants to crosslink send me a message!
I want to make a FC's Using Chocobro page called 'Chocobros' :)

EDIT:
I'm also planning on setting up some documentation of the features available and what is in place for each class. When I do patch notes, that documentation will be updated. So if something doesn't look right, I'll have an email form where you can send hatemail, and I'll have it fixed asap. Be sure to leave your name so i can credit you on the bugfix :)

1372366437.0,149,self.ffxiv,1h7cf9,The Macro Thread,164,15,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1h7cf9/the_macro_thread/,"I'd like to start a helpful, non-spammy macro thread on this sub.  I see more questions regarding macros popping up, and I think they need addressing.  Macros are incredibly useful tools, but they can also be abused.  So, here we go.

First of all:

###[**Official Current Command List**](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/36955-Instruction-Manual-for-Beta-Test-Phase-3-%28Windows%29?p=686800&amp;viewfull=1#post686800) as of Beta Phase 3

I'm not sure if people who don't have access to the beta can access this site or not, but if you can't, there is no NDA blocking us from discussing this, so ask away.  Don't be afraid!

###**What is a macro?**

A [macro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_\(computer_science\)), for the purpose of MMOs, is a quick way of hitting a single button or key which will then do multiple things sequentially, and sometimes conditionally (unsure of this in FFXIV:ARR) if certain circumstances are met.  For FFXIV:ARR, they must use the commands in the aforementioned link to work.

###**Why are they necessary?**

Macros are not *necessary*, per se, but they are a useful tool for those willing to put in only a little extra time to set them up.  Rather than hitting multiple buttons, or saying multiple things, you can have a macro button you just hit and it will do this for you.

Scenario:  Let's say I am a CNJ or WHM and I want to [Raise](http://www.xivdb.com/?skill/125/Raise) someone after our group just had about five people die.  Then let's say there is another CNJ/WHM.  What if we both start casting Raise at the same time on the same target, but didn't pay attention to the fact that we are targeting the same person?  It casts at the same time...on the same target.  One of them was wasted, since it could have been used on another dead player.  There is a 12 second cooldown between Raise casts.  Annoying.

Macro Solution:  As a CNJ, you could have a macro set up to announce to the group whom you are Raising, as well as cast the actual Raise spell, *without typing a thing* and only pressing one button.

The Macro:  Here would be the macro to do that:

/s Raising &lt;t&gt;

/ac Raise &lt;t&gt;

You prepare this macro ahead of time and assign it to a button.  All you have to do to use it is target a dead player and press that button.  Let's say the dead player's name is Quina Quen.  When you use this macro, the people around you will see you say ""Raising Quina Quen"", and you will immediately and automatically start casting Raise on Quina Quen.  

This is just a very small, basic, two-line macro.  If this sounds like a great thing to you (and it is!), then welcome to the world of macros!



**Basic Commands** to get you started (non-exhaustive list)

Please note that [brackets] and ""quotes"" I do not believe are to be actually put into the macro.  ~~Will confirm this weekend.~~ **Update:** Brackets are definitely *not* needed, and neither are quotes, but I'm not sure if quotes are needed if you are using two words for a target or ability. E.g., a player's name.

Command | Description
:--|:--
/? [command_name] | Gives a detailed explanation of specified command. Abbreviations can be used. *All command names must be one word or in quotation marks.*
/say (/s) [message] | Sends a message to all PCs within a small radius. Typing /say or /s without a message switches the default chat mode to [Say].
/party (/p) [message] | Sends a message to all members of your current party, regardless of their location. Typing /party or /p without a message switches the default chat mode to [Party].
/action (/ac) “action name” “PC name” | Uses an action on specified target. Uses current target when not specified. This cannot be used with actions you have not yet learned, or when restricted by other factors.
/target (/ta) “PC name” (placeholder) | Targets the specified target. Target must be within range for this command to function.
/targetenemy (/tenemy) | Targets the closest enemy within a certain radius.
/battletarget (/bt) | Targets the closest enemy within a certain radius that is attacking you.
/assist (/as) | Targets the target of another PC or NPC. (A target must be specified.) Assists current target when not specified.
/facetarget (/ft) | Immediately turns your PC in the direction of your current target.
/marking (/mk) [target type] “PC name” (placeholder) | Set a sign on the specified target. Uses current target when not specified.  Target types: attack1–5, bind1–3, ignore1–2, circle, cross, square, triangle, off (Turns off enemy sign.)  Example:  /marking attack1 (Sets sign “Target to Attack 1” on current target.)
/wait [wait time] | A macro command for adjusting the pause between commands. A wait time amount of 1 equals one second. The maximum wait time allowed is 60. If the wait time amount is over 60, it will be counted as 0.
/recast | Displays time remaining until the specified action can be used again.
/battlemode (/bm) [subcommand] | Toggle between active and passive mode. Switches to opposite mode when no subcommand is specified. Subcommands: On – Draw weapon.  Off – Sheathe weapon.
/check (/c) “PC name” (placeholder) | Examines the specified target. Examines current target when not specified.

**Placeholder Commands** (FULL list)

Command | Description
:--|:--
&lt;t&gt; | Displays current target name.
&lt;tt&gt; | Displays target of current target’s name.
&lt;me&gt; | Displays your character’s name.

&lt;tp&gt; | Displays current TP.
&lt;class&gt;,&lt;job&gt; | Displays current class and level.
&lt;pos&gt; | Displays coordinates of current location.

Please post MORE of your macros in the comments, BUT, before you do, follow some basic macro etiquette:

* Don't use macros that unnecessarily start throwing /say, /yell, etc. around like they're going out of style.  No one likes extraordinarily spammy macros.

* DO post macros that have excellent functionality, and be (reasonably) sure they work.

###**ADDENDUM**

#""**Ugh, I *hate* people who use macros!**""

There can be much consternation with some when it comes to people using macros.  Typically though, they are referring to people using /yell, /say, etc. excessively.  For example, don't be that guy/girl who will use macros like ""/s I call upon the power of &lt;insert diety here&gt; to heal &lt;t&gt;!"" *every time* you cast Cure.  This is going to get on people's nerves when they are trying to focus on the fight.  In social settings, RP settings, sure, but use your macros with your community in mind.  Don't be an annoyance; be a boon.

#**Turning off error reporting in your logs**

You may want to do this, because the parts of your macro that aren't executed (because other parts are) will display errors saying they couldn't be executed.

[My Beta Thaumaturge at 31](http://i.imgur.com/MRAtZwh.jpg)

[Lodestone to see level 31 THM stats (all points into INT)](http://na.beta.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1896196/)

---

**Playstyle**

Right now the most important aspect of being a THM is managing 
your two main buffs: *Astral Fire* and *Umbral Ice*. Both buffs last 10 seconds and refresh when you cast a spell of their same element, [Fire I](http://xivdb.com/?skill/141/Fire) or [Blizzard I](http://xivdb.com/?skill/142/Blizzard), and are removed when casting an alternate element. At level 20 and 40 you can put a 2nd and 3rd stack of *Umbral Ice/Astral Fire*.

&gt;What do they do?

*Umbral Ice* gives INSANE MP regen. I literally go from 0-100MP back to full 1064 in 5 seconds. You essentially have infinite mana as long as you keep this buff up by spamming Blizzard. *Astral Fire* stops ALL Mp regen and makes Fire I/II/III spells cost more, but in return makes them do much, much more damage. In order to quickly swap elements without having to remove it first, you quickly learn [Transpose](http://xivdb.com/?skill/149/Transpose) at level 4. The basic gameplay idea you will realize as a THM is to spam Fire for optimal damage until you run out of mana, Tranpose to Ice, and spam Blizzard while waiting til MP returns and Transpose back to Fire.

    Note that Tranposing Ice II/Fire II only carries over one stack to the alternate element.

**Other Skills**

[Thunder](http://xivdb.com/?skill/144/Thunder) and I have a love-hate relationship. At first this spell seems really weak, because it is. I would avoid it entirely until you get the [Thundercloud trait](http://xivdb.com/?skill/90077/Thundercloud) and Thunder II. Even if the math of its cumulative Potency supposedly outdamages Ice and Fire, I can assure you it does not from counting the real, in-game damage. Once you get Thundercloud, you have a chance at some interesitng interactions. If you want to plan on using Thunder in your rotation early, I would do it while you're in Umbral Ice and getting MP back. When you're in Fire, don't waste the time or mana on anything but fire spells.

[Sleep](http://xivdb.com/?skill/145/Sleep), later enchanced by [Deep Sleep](http://xivdb.com/?skill/90072/Deep-Sleep), is your awesome Crowd Control skill. There are two types of enemies. Crackhead bosses that are immune to sleep and the narcoleptic rest. Anyone who isn't immune to sleep will be put to sleep. I swear this spell has a 100% success rate.  The first cast of sleep lasts 30seconds, then 15 seconds, then 7 seconds. This spell lets you sleep adds in dungeons, run away from a fight, give you time to Cure yourself, turn 2v1 guildleves into 1v1, and even cheese through story quests by sleeping enemies instead of fighting them.

[Scathe](http://xivdb.com/?skill/156/Scathe), which is unlocked via a level 15 class quest, is the last spell worth mentioning to a new THM (You'll figure the rest out as you go). Unlike every other THM spell, this one has no cast time so you can use it while kiting. The downside is it's weaker than both Blizzard I and Fire I and has no relation with the buff system. Also, its [trait](http://xivdb.com/?skill/90071/Enhanced-Scathe) is underwhelming. Still, being mobile has its advantages.

Sprint, which we get at Level 1, is a great skill for Mage classes. We don't need TP so abuse the shit out of this when you're in a dungeon and need to get from A to B fast, out of a red circle, or kite a mob.

**Cross Class Skills**

* [Cure](http://xivdb.com/?skill/120/Cure)[CNJ Lv.2] - The single best skill I took from any class was Cure. With Umbral Ice giving you infinite mana, you can cast Cure all day. With Sleep, you can fight a mob til you're low on health, put them to bed for 30 seconds, get all your HP and MP back, and then resume the fight. This skill is a must.

* [Protect](http://xivdb.com/?skill/123/Protect)[CNJ Lv.8] - At level 17 when I first got this skill, it was giving me 7 Defense. At level 31, my Lodestone says I only have 92 Defense. So I'm sure at level 17 this skill was giving me more than a 10% increase in Defense. It also lasts 30 mins so you can cast it and replace it with another cross class skill. Replacing it does not remove the buff. I never take it when there's a CNJ in the party, since their version has [Shell](http://xivdb.com/?skill/90058/Proshell) added on to it.

* [Raging Strikes](http://xivdb.com/?skill/101/Raging-Strikes)[ARC Lv4] -Increases damage dealt by 20% for 20s. I like to use this when I have all my mana back right before I Tranpose and starting spamming fire.

* [Inner Release](http://xivdb.com/?skill/59/Internal-Release)[PGL Lv12] - 30% Crit for 15s. I use this one right after RS because it lasts 5 seconds less. Same idea with use. Using them together, I saw 330!+ crits versus the Haukke Manor boss with Astral Fire II nukes.

* [Second Wind](http://xivdb.com/?skill/57/Second-Wind)[PGL Lv.8] - Instant cast and you get back 15% of your max HP immediately. Sometimes we eat a nasty spell or hit from a boss and need a way to get back HP fast. I pop a Hi-Potion and this bad boy at the same time and usually get back 50%~ of my HP immediately. Feel free to Cure to get the rest back.

* [Foresight](http://xivdb.com/?skill/32/Foresight)[MRD Lv.2] - Some defense never hurt, especially when you're squishy. Last choice for the five slots.

* [Bloodbath](http://xivdb.com/?skill/34/Bloodbath)[MRD Lv.8] does *not* work on magic spells, so don't even bother trying it.

**Dungeons - Big Bada Boom!**

The most important job of a THM in a dungeon is to sleep adds. Add a marker to your hotbar if you don't want to keep pressing Shift+M and let people know what mobs you will sleep. In a 3 enemy encounter, the first thing I do is sleep two enemies and let the whole party beat up on the 3rd one. BE CAREFUL NOT TO WAKE UP YOUR SLEEPING BEAUTIES WITH FIRE II AND BLIZZARD II AS THEY ARE AREA OF EFFECT SPELLS. 

The second role of a THM is the obvious one of nuking your enemies. Pop some cooldowns, eat some food, and watch those suckers burn and freeze. This is the easiest one to manage. Your same skill rotation applies here. If your tank wants to pull multiple mobs(see: Marauder)  then you will most likely be using Fire II and Blizzard II to do AoE damage. If he wants to pull one at a time and use your sleeps, then Fire I and Blizzard I will do fine.

The third role of a THM is to use the AoE Limit Break, Skyshard. There are certain instances where killing a bunch of adds quickly is supremely important for party survival and takes priority over higher defense, getting healed and single target DPS. You'll have to figure out situations where you should have priority with the Limit Break.

The last role of a THM is acting as an offhealer. Yes, a healer. Our MIND stat is not lacking. In my Lodestone, even with all my extra points put into INT, my INT is only 27 points ahead of my MIND. I mainhealed every GuildHest up to level 30 and every dungeon up to Haukke Manor on my THM before we needed a CNJ in the party. CNJ's have mana problems in long fights. We don't thanks to Umbral Ice. Even with a CNJ in your party, you can help offset the load by throwing some Cures in critical conditions when the tank dips a little low or when the damage is spread out and serious (Ifrit's Hellfire). Later on the Cure probably won't heal as much and we won't have access to it as BLM but right now it's amazing and you should use it. Sometimes I barely even cast Blizzard/Thunder while under Umbral Ice and choose to Cure people instead.

**Spell Speed and Food**

Physical classes have instant skills and a 2.5s GCD recast timer that is affected by Skill Speed. Mages have a cast AND recast timer that is affected by Spell Speed. Having more spell speed makes you cast faster and it lowers cooldown. They both go down in a 1:1 ratio so you should be able to spam a spell immediately after finishing a previous one.

I started off using Dried Prunes for the 8% spell speed (max 2), Vitality and Accuracy, but quickly moved to another food item (Grape Juice) that gave Spell Speed, Piety and Vitality instead. Accuracy wasn't that important.

**AS OF JULY 1, 2013, WE HAVE FOUND THAT SKILL AND SPELL SPEED SUCKS SO JUST BUY A CHEAP FOOD FOR THE EXP BONUS. PREFERRABLY ONE WITH VIT/PIE AND CRIT CHANCE.**

---

**Criticisms**

Having a bigger MP Pool didn't seem to make a difference for two reasons:

* I never ran out of mana under Umbral Ice buff.
* Cost of fire spells increased proportionately with my level. I can only ever get off 5-6 fire casts before being out of mana.

If you were playing under Fire buff, you'd be mana starved no matter what you did. If you were playing under Ice buff, you could spam all day and never run out of mana.

I haven't really tested to see if the cost of spells is affected by level, base stats, or total stats. Maybe adding PIETY can help make a difference. It'd be nice if I could keep spamming Fire until Raging Strikes ended. Right now I still have enough time on that buff left to Tranpose to Ice and get a Blizzard and Scathe off.

Another criticism is [Manaward](http://xivdb.com/?skill/157/Manaward). It claims it only works for magic damage so I haven't really found a niche for it yet. I'm hoping I'll figure something out next weekend.

**Beta experience Pros and Cons**

Pros:

* Infinite Mana ^^if ^^you ^^keep ^^ice ^^buff ^^on
* Sharing loot only with the healer. If you're the healer and there are no other THMs in your party, you get all DoM gear.
* Cool long range nukes
* Good AoE capabilites
* Current rotation allows room for all spells to be cast
* Lots of CC - Sleep, Heavy, Slow, and Bind
* Being able to offheal comfortably with a decent MIND stat
* Has Scathe as an option for kiting

Cons:

* Squishy - Low HP Pool with cloth armor
* Rooted while casting. Moving interrupts all casting spells.
* Burst style of damage due to skill rotation
* Not as much damage as LNC or PGL class
* Not really sure how they will compare to Arcanist

Tips:

* Mash the hell out of your spell buttons. You can atually start casting  your next spell before the animation of the previous one finishes. This will severely improve your DPS and Cures.

* use /action ""Cure"" &lt;tt&gt; as a macro. This let me keep my target on the boss while still healing the tank. &lt;tt&gt; stands for ""target the target of my target"". That's why I have two Cures on my hotbar on f10 and f11. The second one heals me or my current target.

* There's a bit of a sync issue with the game. That's why you can get hit by red circle skills if you move out too late even if you're not inside when it finishes. You can abuse this as a THM. You can start moving towards the end of your cast without interrupting. In the case of Blizz II, you can reposition at the last second with this. This is important because Blizz II uses you as the center of the AoE.

* Sleep is my favorite spell to [Swiftcast](http://xivdb.com/?skill/150/Swiftcast).

While doing so, he opened up his character stat window and showed his VIT and his max HP. Here are some (blurry) screenshots of them:

http://i.imgur.com/bqoudQc.jpg

In Beta Phase 3, HP was calculated using:

Total HP = (65 * HP multiplier) + (VIT - 189) * 15

You could find your HP multiplier value from this table:

http://i.imgur.com/SNoCQyF.png

Some players might have noticed that in the Beta 3, players' HP values were always some multiple of 5. This was due to the +15 HP/VIT and the base HP values being multiples of 5. So when the Live Letter showed ACN/SMN/SCH all having HP values not divisible by 5, this indicated that the HP algorithm had been reworked. Following a similar methodology as with the original HP algorithm derivation I found the following table:

http://i.imgur.com/iyBPGYH.png

This new HP algorithm appears to accurately calculate both the 2309 value for ACN and the 2858 values for SCH and SMN. Also, the '17' and '18' multiplier values are the exact same as the classes ARC/PGL/CON/THM (17) and the jobs BRD/MNK/WHM/THM (18) in the old algorithm. This lends some credibility to the new formula. With this in mind, we could actually calculated the new ""base/naked"" HP values for every class/job. I'll do this over the weekend when I have some more free time.

All in all, what does this mean?

Tanks will have about 200-250 more HP Naked compared to Beta 3.

BLM/WHM/MNK/BRD will ahve about 312 more HP Naked compared to Beta 3.

A naked WAR will have about 2750 HP. With 400 VIT, he should have around 5229 HP. With Defiance and 400 VIT, around 6536 HP. 

Until we have access to Phase 4, I can't really confirm if this is the true new algorithm or not. However, it does indicate that SE has tweaked at least one basic algorithm and most likely has tweaked the others such as damage output and healing output. Once I can confirm these things I will update my website, but I thought I'd give you guys another thing to talk about before Phase 4.

1376157812.0,126,self.ffxiv,1k3kzs,We're almost there: Getting the most out of experience chaining at release.,154,28,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1k3kzs/were_almost_there_getting_the_most_out_of/,"For those of you that may not have tried experience chaining in groups, this thread is for you to get the most out of your grinding. Why do I say grinding? Though you don't have to really grind at all to get to max level, this thread is about maximizing your time to get there faster.

Before I found out about the beta function that allowed you to get your classes from 1 to 15 by talking to an npc, I began figuring out the fastest way to get experience, like I usually do in MMO's and any RPG's in general. I leveled two classes to 20, each level getting faster and faster by finding new ways to jump experience. Then when I figured out it could have been easier in beta, I felt like an idiot, but an idiot that will have an easier time in live then most.

Experience chaining is not really a new thing. FFXI had chains, and other minor MMO's included chains as well to increase what you get the faster you are at clearing mobs.
Here is basically what I found out about FFXIV chains specifically:
    
**The obvious:**
    
* When you kill two mobs that are your level, you begin an exp chain timer.
    
* When you kill more mobs after the timer begins within the time limit, you gain a bonus to experience per mob (10% bonus -&gt; 20% -&gt; 30% and so on).
    
**The not so obvious:**
    
* For each member in a party, the maximum experience bonus increases (this includes half and full parties). The bonus goes from 80% cap, up to around 100%~160% cap per mob.
    
* In order for you to get full experience, you either have to ping a mob with enough damage (usually about 30% of it's hp down to about 10% depending on number of attackers on the mob), or be alone in your party and mark a target for yourself. (Marking a target means hitting it so it becomes red for you and purple for everyone else)
    
* Killing marked targets count towards your chain. Most people never realized this, but targets that are taken by other parties will provide you with experience if you deal at least 30% of their max hp in damage and will provide that party with full experience. What does this mean? It means grief every party you see fighting a mob at your level. They will thank you for it, because they lose nothing out of you doing it.

* Exp chains in FATEs are broken as hell. Why do I say this? I had the fortunate chance to join a FATE party under the level of the mobs in the FATEs. Though I did not always gain the full FATE exp bonuses, I was able to get up to about chain 19 each time battle began.

 * What does this mean? The exp chain caps around chain 8, so each kill after 8 gave me an exp chain bonus of about 160%. I gained two levels from 14 up to 16 in less then 20 minutes.
Now you might say, ""I thought you had to ping mobs to get the exp chain???!"", and the answer to that is ""yes...most of the time"". The unique instance with FATEs is that, all mobs that are part of the FATE are automatically pinged for you if a member of your immediate party kills it. This means...GET A FULL 8 MAN PARTY AND GRIND!!! Try to get your party to ping as many mobs as possible so others doing the fate don't remove your chains. Don't worry, they still get full FATE exp and mob exp as long as they keep fighting, so you're not grieving them for real.
    
* Increasing the number of party members does not decrease experience gained. This means the more the merrier! Get your friends and go kill stuff. Quickly!!
    
 * **One VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:** When you are in the last 10 seconds of the Exp Chain timer, if you kill a mob before it hits 0 (sometimes up to 3 seconds earlier due to server lag) THE CHAIN RESETS TO 10 SECONDS!!! This allowed my parties to blow up mob after mob and group mobs together killing one at a time so we can keep the chain going.
    
* And last, but certainly not least: POWER LEVELING WORKS!!!! Example: Player 1 is level 1. Player 2 is level 25 and not in the same party.
     
 * Player 1: Attacks target mob that is at least his level or higher.
 * Player 2: Kills target mob that player 1 attacked.
 * Player 1: Gets full experience.
 * Player 2: Gets reduced experience due to mob level. (who cares, this is not about you, you selfish prick!)
 * Player 1: Attacks a second mob at least his level.
 * Player 2: Kills the second mob.
 * Player 1: EXPERIENCE CHAIN!
...rinse and repeat! I've gotten a friend up to about chain 14 before he outleveled the mobs we were fighting around level 8. Before level 8 you probably wont get past chain 6~8 before they level again.
 
I hope this helps! Good luck in your chaining!!

Hi guys, I'm new to reddit posting so if I mess this up if someone would let me know that would be great. After playing every class and studying what they can and can't do and figuring out things that amazed me and frustrated me, I figured I'd share my thoughts with the reddit community. Keep in mind this is only phase 3 in testing and nothing is final and I had no real level 50 content to test this on (Reason why its not a guide). This is also opinion based so don't take this as fact.

I'd like to introduce myself a bit before I begin(Boooooring stuff). I play a lala on Sargantas named Lavieh Sevald (Call me **Lavi**) and I played during the end days of 1.0. I have level 50's of all DoW/DoM classes and I'm a pretty versatile player, though I'd easily consider WHM as one off my mains (as its the first relic I went for...). So this is all coming from an experienced healer.

Ok , where to start? Let's start with the good things:

* **Cure Combo'ing** - Instead of the boring ""Click the highest cure number and win"" mentality SE decided to make our level 2 healing skill our bread and butter. With a scaling potency and no gimpy cap, you will be using Cure I until the day you and your party dies. At level 50 with some decent healing gear I was curing roughly ~400 with my Cure I and it only costed me 133 mp! **Free Cure** is also what will make or break a good WHM. What I was doing was using Cure until I got free Cure active and then waited for the tank or some DD to drop below 70%~ and then use Cure II. I found that this really saved on MP and made WHMing a whole lot easier. Of course, if something bit hit someone I would cast Cure II no matter what.

* **Medica II/ Cure III** - Ok so both of these are AoE heals. Cure III stands at a 400 Potency and Medica II stands at a 350 potency with 50 pot 15 second Regen ( 600 Potency over all). Medica II also cost ~200 more mana but it is also the strongest healing spell aside from benediction that a WHM has. With that being said Medica II will probably be your go to AoE healing spell, that is if you can afford to take a step to the melees. The times when to use Cure III would be if **Overcure** is active or it is extremely dangerous to run up and AoE heal the DD's. I like having those types of choices though.

* **Divine Seal / Presence of Mind** - Though content is lacking I can easily see both of these being crucial to WHM's kit come the last 25% of a bosses health. DS alone will save you tons of mana and probably best paired when you have Free Cure or Over Cure active. PoM isn't what it was before (Sadly) but the minor casting speed increase that it gives can save lives and when paired with Raise... well can bring back lives. Getting the THM **Swiftcast** also helps out immensely.

* **Cleric Stance/ Aero II/ Holy** - Cleric Stance is amazing, it literally boosts your damage up almost double when used and the cool thing about it - you can deactivate it about 3 seconds after you activate it. This brings up a whole lot more activity for a WHM to do. You can easily Cleric Stance &gt; Aero II during a boss fight and click Cleric stance off the moment Aero II lands, the same applies for Holy. I'd also like to say that the burn on Aero II is effected by your potency at cast, *meaning when you click off cleric stance the damage of the tick will be the same as if you had cleric stance on*. Not to mention that Holy is on the GCD for only 500 MP and is an AoE stun, you can create a lot of opportunities for your party. Finally WHM isn't just a curing bot!

Ok now the things that disappointed me :


*  **Regen** - I had to put this first, this was my biggest upset. Regen costed me 399 MP to use and over 21 seconds healed for a potency of 350 and was not effected by divine seal. My Cure I costed me 133 MP, healed for 300 potency, could critical, was effected by divine seal and could possibly proc Free Cure. Now before you say ""But its instant cast on Regen! And you can leave it on a DD!"" - It takes up the GCD and burns your mana rather quickly for such a small effect. If you want to regen everyone you are better off casting Medica II, If you want to heal someone you are better off casting Cure I. As it stands... Regen is useless. Even if the WHM AF boots do give you increased Regen Potency - The cost is still to expensive to justify casting it.

* **Stoneskin** - Can I tell you how much I hate Stoneskin in 2.0 ? Don't get me wrong- It is a great spell... For tanks ( Or anyone who has over 4000 health). I just hate that it scales off of their HP and not something you can control, makes you feel disconnected with the spell and makes using it very situational. Obviously you can use it before you enter a fight where you can regain that MP you used but aside from that the only class it has viability on is Warrior during combat. Maybe a health stacking Paladin? I'm not to sure, hopefully we get another way to control how much this blocks. On a side note this skill is bested used on a WAR with Defiance up and Thrill of battle : D.

* **Shroud of Saints** - In 1.0 SoS actually meant... SoS. Now healing seems to build up almost no enmity, I'm almost always last on the hate list even when I'm spamming heals like no other. Meaning that the Half Enmity part of this spell may as well be useless. Now I can see some strategic advantages to this- Like everyone dies but you and you raise the tank and tank provokes and SoS... Very situational. The MP refresh is nice but because of the enmity effect on it you feel like you are wasting it. IMO SoS should be cast if your Hate is 2 or 3 or if your MP &lt;50%. There program that gambit in! 


My overall thoughts:

SE did a good job in making WHM very interesting. You could easily click 1 and 2 all day and get some sort of results but good WHM's will be Healing, DoTing, Stunning Adds and making a lot of micro choices through out a fight. I like decisions because it will often separate the good from the bad.


Anyway, if you guys thought this was helpful let me know because I can probably write one of these up for every class.

It's in Japanese, I'm far from fluent, and google translate still leaves a lot of gaps to be guessed at.

But, from the best that I can tell, Yoshi-P finally got a perscription for the bug he caught at the JapanExpo in France and is feeling better.

He took some time to test out the late-game content with the staff, using the gamepad exclusively.

[This screenshot](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1077615_485152204906165_652237290_o.jpg) features a full party setup, and the scholar faeries are floating around.  Looks to be at the very beginning of a dungeon.

[The second screenshot](https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1072276_485152218239497_389901778_o.jpg) shows a light party in a dungeon. EDIT: Demon wall?

Yoshi-P was quick to point out that the DPS numbers printed in the chatlog were a debug mode of the game, and that there were no plans to put them in the final version of the game for users to see.

1371348006.0,115,self.ffxiv,1gfk33,FF XIV : ARR the best mmo experience since EQ1,132,17,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gfk33/ff_xiv_arr_the_best_mmo_experience_since_eq1/,"For me FF XIV : ARR is the best mmo experience in the past decade. Here's why:

* **Graphics:** Something everybody agrees on. The game beautiful, graphically flawless, it's amazing how everything in the game looks fantastic. I find myself stopping to watch the scenery and zooming in and out on NPC's and Views in all kind of places and that’s something i never do in games. It's mind blowing how good the game looks.

* **The FF Factor :** Playing this game, you know you're playing a final fantasy game, and it feels so good. If you are a fan, well you will be ecstatic about all the references to the franchise and if you are not a fan, it won’t really matter for you. The world, is a FF world, the characters, the humour, the graphics, the chocobos, the materia, the story line, everything is branded Final Fantasy.

* **The Music :** Something i never cared for in a game until now. After playing every FF game there is, it’s awesome to just hear and recognise some classic final fantasy music and sound effects. Each time i level, i finish a quest, or comes a cinematic, the music feels so nostalgic and just reminds me of past gaming adventures. 

* **The Cities :** The cities in recent MMO’s are really just these hubs without much to them. In FF XIV : ARR the cities are awesome, and you spend time there because you need to, but also because you want to. The quest lines of each city are really interesting and teach you the lore, you have many establishments you need to visit which create a link to the city. It’s not 1 daily quest giver or the AH, it’s many many place’s and NPC’s that give it the feeling of the old mmo’s cities. 

* **The NPC’s :** Like every FF game, the NPC’s are really charismatic and add a lot to the story and the world. They are funny interesting and very well designed. It’s not your average game, where you click on the NPC’ without paying attention, scroll as fast and you can and just gtfo. You learn to like them, appreciate their humour, and let them finish their text.

* **The Mechanics :** The game isn’t breaking the mold of the MMO genre. Nothing is really new, but you have a lot of mechanics that are proper to FF games that you don’t find in other games (linkshells, Great Companies, levelhest, Guildhest, Materia, all the guilds and their quest lines, a typical FF class and Job system etc) and some innovations like the Fate or the Armory systems. All the systems in place are really solid. The game have everything in it and more. It won’t be a GW2 without a Group Finder system, or a half ass Guild/Friend list interface or incomplete stuff. This game have everything, and everything is working smoothly.

* **The Interface :** I beta tested the game back in 2010 and hated the interface, and it was obvious to me that the interface was more adapted to console gaming than PC gaming, that and some other reasons made it that i never purchased the game after that beta test. The interface of the 2.0 version is just amazing, you have all you need, it’s pretty ergonomic and have a FF feel to it as you will recognise some of the interface parts from other games. It can be adapted to your linking and there is plenty of options to mess around.

* **The Gameplay :** If you are a PC gamer, rejoice ! It is working very well with the mouse / keyboard and you will be feeling at home immediately as it’s your typical MMO gameplay. For the specific gameplay of class’s. You can look for a typical gameplay with the good old caster/mele fighter and if you want something that breaks a little bit the mold you can play the pugilist or probably other class’s i didn’t try. The thing is, they are pleasing everyone with new and old school gameplay mechanics.
For me, the multiple class / jobs mechanic is really interesting, because it shows that there is plenty of content, grind, and customisation around your character. You can level many class’s with the same character, mix their spells, and build your own class out of what you got or you can tailor a job that is meant for a specific role, it’s a little bit restrictive compared to the freedom of the class system but also more efficient and powerful for the role you want to fulfil and you don’t even have to choose since you can’t have and do both !

* **It feels like an MMO !** There was people all around i swear ! i talked to some, even grouped with some, and we used the chat too ! crazy right ? It wasn’t instanced bullshit where you are all alone. It wasn’t about how you are the hero and you do everything alone and you are pushed to never speak to nobody. The game is built so that people interact, talk to each other, and get that urge to just play together and group and socialise which is something nonexistent in the recent games. The World is huge, the cities are huge, everything is overwhelming and it have that 1 hours part that the old gamers know very well where you are lost trying to figure out things and wonder around the main city  trying stuff.
It have content ! and i’m not talking about the late game content, or enough quests for you to level to 50. There is already so much stuff to do aside from your main quest / leveling your character. There is a lot of stuff to do, and you have the choice to do it. It’s definitely more a sandbox game than a themepark game, but not as sandbox as an archeage. It’s just enough for the fans of both types to enjoy themself a lot.

&gt;While I understand that there are some of you who feel that it would be better if you could clear everything by yourself, from an MMORPG business perspective, there is a necessity to make it so a large amount of players continue to play for a long time. Because of this, it’s critical that players interact with each other and build a strong community. This is why we have implemented party content in the main quest line and removed the stress of forming parties with the Duty Finder which automatically matches players. 

I believe he is absolutely correct in making mandatory partying to advance the story line! Community, in my opinion, is the most important aspect of an MMO and I believe this is the a step in the right direction in making FFXIV: ARR's community a great one!",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,False,,limsa,True,t3_1gzm5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gzm5e/this_is_my_favorite_paragraph_from_producer_and/,
1371776119.0,117,self.ffxiv,1grk6c,No /tells or Linkshell Chat in Dungeons based on server structure,138,21,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1grk6c/no_tells_or_linkshell_chat_in_dungeons_based_on/,"**People are saying Linkshell chat does work in dungeons; I want to make sure that is noted and will see if it works completely or not myself, but do not want to spread incorrect information.**

I don't know how many people ran across this during actual gameplay (I didn't notice it myself), or saw the comment made, but this is something that made my heart stop a bit.

The actual Dev response to the topic is [here.](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/45178-No-whisper-or-chat-while-in-Dungeon?p=763734#post763734)

Essentially, you cannot send /tells or utilize Linkshell chat while in a Dungeon. I assume you cannot utilize Free Company chat, either. This effectively cuts you off from anything going on with your friends while you are in a dungeon. What if you are doing multiple runs, and someone in your shell/FC signs on and wants to do something? Maybe you would have dipped out to go play with them, but now you have no clue they even said hello of offered to do content in lS because you can't see it. It's a huge detriment to this game and is the first thing that legitimately cuts into the social aspect of the game (Duty Finder itself as a concept does not, nor does fast paced gameplay).

I think this is something that SE needs to get some more noise about. Every other game can handle this, but SE can't seem to. I'm not sure what's going on with their hardware or software that these instance servers can't seem to handle that extra data flow, but this is something I would have expected out of 1.0 and not ARR. They say it is impossible, but that's a load. If they made it impossible then they need to make it possible, or they're going to severely hurt the experience of their game. 

I'm generally not one to complain or make a big fuss, but this seems like a very legitimate thing to be upset over.

EDIT:

[Here is a general discussion thread in the beta forums which you can go and upvote/reply to.](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/51032-No-whisper-or-chat-while-in-Dungeon)

EDIT2:

Some people are saying that Linkshells work in dungeon, but /tells do not. So, while it's not as horrible, the inability to send /tells in dungeons is still unacceptable in my eyes. My apologies for stirring additional flames that may not be accurate, however.

This means there is no limit on how many plots of land are in the system. 

&gt;Housing will cost a lot of gil. It has been said that in order to buy a medium sized plot of land you will need to spend the equivalent of levelling a class to 50 on quests three times and put all the gil you earned into your house. Large plots will be insanely expensive and there will only be 3 such plots per instance. It may be better to start small and work your way up. But there is a twist. Land prices will fall over time if the plot has not been bought up. So it is effectively a good gil sink, the rich will buy early and high while the less well off will wait until the prices are more in line with their savings. 



&gt;Two types of housing will be available. These are free company housing as well as individual housing, however free company housing will make it into the game first. These are essentially the same thing, except that with free company housing any bonuses (more on this later) will be available to everyone within the free company. There will also be a shared item safe within free company housing. Free companies can increase in rank and this will bring more housing features to them over time. 

**Customization**
&gt;In each house you will be able to build parks and towers, which are used to give bonuses to all members of your free company, or in the case of individual housing - yourself. This may be one of the most attractive parts of FFXIV: A Realm Reborn's housing system as it gives it a sense of purpose. Some examples of possible bonuses that producer Naoki Yoshida **has mentioned include a 25% bonus to experience points earned, making crafting faster to level, to aid in HQ crafting or to increase the rate of gil acquisition.**

1372976635.0,101,self.ffxiv,1hnqoi,Paladin - Phase 3: Things to look forward too (Bonus WAR vs PLD comparison at the end!),127,26,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hnqoi/paladin_phase_3_things_to_look_forward_too_bonus/,"Ok so I refilled my cup of coffee and I'm ready to talk about our knights in shining armor. If you were to talk about MMO Tanking and what the usual MMO tank looks like I would immediately point my finger over to Taric and than over to PLD. Sword and Shield with white shining armor it looks just as heroic as it sounds. While in ARR a Paladin looks like its iconic self throughout the series I found that it wasn't as iconic as I thought it would be. For starters - Paladin's can deal damage and they heal for very little. Well let's get to chattin!


Things to look forward too:

* **Sword Oath** : I underrated this skill so much... and in the end I was so wrong. This is a straight 25 Potency that is tacked on at the end of your auto attack (Two numbers pop up) and for me it was doing roughly 1/3(?) of the damage my AA's were which leads me to believe that Paladin's AA is at a potency of 75. Regardless this skill adds a lot of damage. I must applaud SE for making PLD a competitive DD in such a creative way.

* **Shield Oath** : This is a PLD's answer to Defiance. Essentially you lose out on 30% of your damage but you get a straight 25% damage reduction and double enmity generation in return. I must say for PLD this skill makes holding hate extremely easy. So basically PLD has two forms : Deal Damage and Tank or Tank something that hits really hard and I like that choice!

* **Savage Blade Combo** : So unlike Warrior paladin doesn't get some fancy damage increasing Combo but what they do get is a fancy enemy damage reducing combo. Most of you have probably been spamming this already since you have access to it in the beta. Honestly this is the only legitimate TP combo you get as PLD and most of the time you will be using it. But that's good since 10% STR reduction is probably extremely awesome( I don't really know).

* **Riot Blade** : This skill serves a niche role and is only really viable when you **NEED** mana. But regardless it will really help you out in a pinch.

* **Spirits Within** : This skill has a really cool name and looks really awesome. While a situational 1s Silence is nice I'd like to think of this skill as DPS tool. I think it should be used whenever its off CD and you are &gt;90% HP. This skill does up to 300 Potency with full HP and does less damage with lower HP ( I don't know exact  numbers : ( ).


* **Provoke** : For those of you who missed Valkky's description on how this skill works : Basically it takes your current hate value and matches it +1 with the person with the highest hate value (All credit to Valkky for figuring this out). This makes Provoke an extremely useful skill! Just not in the way we are used too. Obviously this skill will be best used after you die and you wanna snag hate back but it can also be used to offtank. I think this skill will create a lot of different strategies involving two tanks and I can't wait to see what the end game content brings.

* **Flash** : This is your only real AoE threat skill but it comes with a huge mana cost. I think the most useful thing about Flash is its level 20 trait that gives it the blind effect. I will cover more on good Flash uses in the tips section.

* **Shield Swipe** : I think this skill will go underrated as well. Basically you need to block to use it but it only costs ~40TP(?) and gives the mob a 5 second pacification effect. From what I've seen this applies to bosses to. Pacification means that the target can't use skills for that duration. This will make PLD the more ideal ""Stand still"" tank and will definitely relieve a lot of stress from the party. 

* **Bulwark/ Rampart / Sentinel / Convalesence / Hallowed Ground** : Ah the panic buttons. These skills are obviously pretty self explanatory. Bulwark will give an almost guaranteed chance to block which is good for Proc'ing shield swipe. Rampart and Sentinel are both good for mitigating damage, Rampart lasts longer but mitigates for less while Sentinel does the opposite. These abilities are probably best used towards the end of the fight but I'm sure you could get 2-3 uses out of them throughout the fight. Convalescence is another great skill to use and I would easily consider it another panic button as it will make a WHM's heals go further. Hallowed Ground is the ultimate panic button and with a 7 minute CD should only be used when you can't afford to take any damage at all!

Things that I'm a little less excited about :

* **Shield Bash**: 150 TP and on the GCD. That should sum up why I'm not to fond of this skill. Can you spam it and keep a mob stunned? Yea you can but you will burn TP pretty quickly and probably lose hate eventually. Not to mention that MNK/DRG/WAR all have a stun that are off the GCD and cost no TP. I don't really find a use for this in a normal party setup. My opinion : Take it off the GCD and remove the TP cost or just lower the TP cost.

* **Blocking** : Now I didn't spend an extremely long amount of Time on my PLD but while using my Hoplon ( A shield that specializes in blocking more often) I noticed that blocking sucked. It felt like I had a natural 15% chance to block and when I did I was only blocking for about 8% of the damage. I mean if I'm gunna block something with my shield I wanna take no damage. Maybe it is just me but blocking seems very underwhelming. I was looking at some numbers that Valkky posted and they were rather discouraging too. If you are gunna play PLD don't spec for blocking since the results don't seem worth it. I could be completely wrong. If someone else played GLA/PLD extensively and agrees or thinks otherwise please comment below.

* **Lack of a specialized self healing spell** : PLD can get cure and that is great. At level 50 it heals for about half of what my whm can heal - Which still isn't that bad. That really isn't my problem and I'm not sure if this is a problem at all. Just in every FF game I played where a Paladin is present they get a pretty decent healing spell. Maybe the answer to this is to just raise the MND of PLD a bit or give them a spell like Holy Succor. Maybe its just my Cecil fanboy coming out but I'd like to PLD have a bit strong healing magic side to them.


Some tips from playing Paladin :

* When going through a dungeon keeping Sword Oath up until you run into a miniboss/boss is more than likely ideal (Though I can't tell you how hard the mobs will hit in later dungeons) and then use Shield Oath vs. the harder mobs.

* Don't use provoke at the start of the fight or if you already have hate.

* Flash is cool and all but you could probably use that mana else where. Try splitting apart your Savage Blade combo onto different mobs to keep hate if your DPS aren't focusing them down. Try to become less and less Flash reliant when it comes to tanking mobs.

* Don't spam shield bash. Your WHM has MP and you have MP and a slew of other skills to protect yourself. You are probably just going to end up losing hate if you keep blowing all that TP. Only waste the TP if you absolutely need too.

* IMO don't stack all your reduction skills. Spread them out over the fight since consistency is ideal.

* So at level 50 THM gets a teleport skill. If you ever run into a big pack of mobs have to BLM nuke them all and teleport to you. Then you cover them and let them finish it off.

* Healing and Stoneskinning yourself will always be good choices in combat. Figure out which one you need more (Damage mitigation or Damage healing) and use one!

* Don't use Riot blade when you are missing a little bit of MP, only use it when you are running low and you know you need mp!

My coffee is getting cold!


______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Now let's talk about Tanking in general**



First a few tips :

* If a trash mob in a dungeon slips by and starts attacking a DD don't make a big deal about it. This goes for the tank and the other players. Trash mobs really don't hurt all that much and they don't really live that long. It isn't the end of the world if you or your tank can't let that one sprite hit your precious DD. Now I'm not discouraging you from trying to hold all the hate just saying that it isn't the end of the world.

* Single target enmity holding is easy in this game. If Provoke didn't make it easy already the enmity bonus on the two tank buffs make it extremely easy. Honestly - There is no excuse to lose hate on a single target. You can almost do it mindlessly.

* Sometimes you will be splitting your priority in some fights. SE likes to shake things up (Ichorous Ire). So watch the hate meter and warn someone if they are holding the 2 mark on the hate list.

* Dodge, Dodge, Dodge! Don't take damage you don't too but learn to dodge in a way where you don't make the boss run all over the place. Your DD's  will appreciate it if you can master the ability to keep the mob facing the same direction. 

* Love your WHM.

* Be the party leader, by this I mean be the one to lead the way in the dungeon. No point in keeping the squishys in the front!

* Tanking is easy in this game so don't stress over it or build a superiority complex over it.



Now time to put on my big shoes and start stepping on people toes. ( I really feel this deserves its own post... but w/e)

**Paladin Vs. Warrior - Job vs Job**

So you can basically classify every tank in any mmo into three different categories: Straight HP Tank , Mitigation Tank, Evasion Tank. Each of these different tanking styles not only cater to players preference but will often cater to different situations. A straight HP tank is probably the truest to the tank nature. They usually pack on a lot of health and can take an insurmountable amount of damage before they die. These tanks are mostly used for mobbing where mitigation won't make a big difference and a higher hp pool is preferred such as against mobs with absolute/true damage. A Mitigation tank has several spells and abilities that reduce the damage they take. Mitigation tanks usually have lower hp but higher defense and are often preferred in instances where monsters deal a ton of damage in a single hit. Evasion tanking is where evading is the main characteristics of the tank. The usually have low HP and have a ton of abilities and spell that make moves miss all together. Obviously in FFXIV ARR the WAR would be the Straight HP Tank and the PLD would be the mitigation tank. So my first advice, before reading any further, is asking yourself ""Which type of tank would I rather be"". I can only hope that we eventually get an Evasion tank! (Monk does not fill that role lol ) 

Now to actually compare them. **Both Jobs are very similar** and I'm positive that SE will make it so each on can tank whichever instance since that is the path that they seem to be taking but ATM I feel WAR has a slight advantage. Here are my reasons why:

* **Tanking** - Holding enmity is easy for either of the two jobs so no point in comparing but let's talk about taking damage. PLD has a lot of mitigation spells in between Sentinel / Bulwark / Rampart / Hallowed Ground / Rage of Halone they can significantly nerf the amount of damage done to them, while Warrior only has Foresight to use to their advantage. Well not really, this is where Stoneskin plays a huge factor. WAR's will generally have a good amount of HP over a paladin meaning that stoneskin will generally block for more damage. While this seems pretty minuscule take the WHM/WAR interaction I mentioned earlier. This is probably the only situation where stoneskin is a cost efficient buff and not only that but it makes for a very interesting battle setup. With good communication you can essentially let a war take however much damage they want &gt; Stoneskin and then let them heal it up (Since they won't be taking anymore damage for a few hits). I can see this as a big mp saver and also allowing the WHM to DPS a bit since stoneskin doesn't change while in cleric stance. ATM the only time I see Paladin optimal is when a mob has the possibility of taking out any amount of hp in only a few hits. I highly doubt that though because SE wants to make it so any tank class can tank anything and that would make PLD mandatory for that fight. I can see this being the case where a mob has a strong and wide frontal AoE skill where standing still is ideal. **I'd like to note that while this is obviously an advantage the difference is probably really small**. **I made a mistake : (. After the facts being pointed out to me and looking at things from a different angle PLD wins the damage mitigation race  xD but not by a whole lot so don't be discouraged!**

* **Dealing Damage** - Warriors will deal more. I can tell you this hands down. My Warrior with a ilvl 65 Serpent Axe was dealing 40-50 more damage with Butchers block than my PLD with an ilvl 80 Garuda's weapon Spirits Within. Sword Oath will catch PLD up in terms of DPS to an unstanced WAR but if both of them have their main tanking stances up (Defiance/ Shield Oath) I'm afraid that WAR will pull ahead. Why ? Well first there is the fact that WAR gets Unchained/ Berserk and Infernal release at their disposal but also because Warrior gets skills that are not bound to the damage reduction (Steel Cyclone , Inner Beast) and a free Critical Hit chance to boot. They also get Maim and Storm's Eye which will boost their damage up a bit. Warrior also wins in the AoE department with Overpower alone. Bottom line WAR's will deal more damage while Tanking. Argue that if you want but if you want to argue it play both classes at 50. 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

* So WAR is better and I should just invite them right? **Absolutely not.** Dungeons are easy with any tanking classes and I feel the difference between the two tanking is pretty small that it won't make a difference. **Let people play what they want.**

* So I should just level WAR then right? **No.** I don't know what end game content will look like, you don't know what end game content will look like. PLD's mitigation could be far more useful because of how hard end game mobs will hit. Pick based on what tank model you fit into. You like high hp? Go War. You like high Def and shield? Go Pld. You wanna be ready for anything? Level both! **Don't base your decision on my comparison of the two.**

* How would you make PLD better ? Probably fix block so its more impactful on the game and up the damage of Spirits.

Anyway... Thats that. I'm sure someone will disagree with me - And thats fine. Opinions are ok as long as you understand mine and I understand yours^^

I may get to BLM tonight.. Maybe...

In FFXI I read everything.  I sat through cutscenes and read all of the NPC garble every time (albiet not airship/chocobo/guild NPCs/etc...).  

Since then I've played WoW, RIFT, Ragnarok Online 2, Path of Exiles, GW (1&amp;2), many of the copy/pasta games, etc... Since then I've learned that the story lines and plots are generally empty and meaningless chatter between fights and fetch quests.  

I caught myself rushing through FFXIV, I'd glance at the dialogue and click through waiting to rush through.  I would read snippets here and there concerning the quest and just follow the log.  I started slowing down and actually reading what was being said.  I can honestly say that I feel as though they have put an incredible amount of effort into developing the storyline and making it just as immersive as FFXI, if not moreso.

My point?  If you have been caught up in the MMOs for the past few years, you might understand what I'm talking about.  Do yourselves a favor and read what's being said (or listen when the VA starts).  It's meaningful, deep, witty, clever, funny, sarcastic, snide, irritating (some of the NPCs can be real jerks!

Folks, I didn't see any topics like this lying around, and I know of quite a few players who are from Asia and even if their ping to the JP servers are good, they settle into NA servers even if they have higher ping because of the communication barrier.


Which is why we, at www.FFXIVguild.com want to invite all English speaking players in ASIA (or even around the world) to join the Tonberry (JP) server.


Help us build a quality English speaking community in Asia!


Have you tried testing your latency and compared against the US, JP, EU servers? Those few milliseconds of lag can make a huge difference in your overall game performance.


Try pinging these servers:

North America Datacentre | square-enix.montreal.com | IP address : 184.107.107.176

Europe Datacentre | eu.square-enix.com | IP address : 209.130.141.243

Japan Datacentre | jp.square-enix.com | IP address : 202.67.53.202


Or for those who want a guide on how to test your latency, check out our guide: http://www.ffxivguild.com/how-to-test-your-lagpinglatency/

And I played World of Warcraft for 6 years.

WoW, at least at first, filled me with a sense of wonder. I wanted to explore, I wanted to know EVERYTHING about the world and it's lore. On my lunch breaks I would read the WoW Wiki just to learn more lore. 

Each Final Fantasy game that I played, I felt that feeling, I wanted to explore this world. 

This is a feeling I have not felt in about three years. However, once I got started with the beta for this, I actually shed a tear. My chest was tight as I stepped into a new adventure, I felt amazing. When I watch a trailer for this game, I get a dumb grin on my face and feel my eyes water up a bit.

Guys I am ready for this game. I am ready to explore, I am ready to find treasure, I am ready to learn more lore, I am ready to fight fantastic creatures that tip their hats to the old Final Fantasy monsters that I remember from my childhood. I just thought I should share this.

New link submitted by [gualdhar](http://www.reddit.com/user/gualdhar).  
**Dates and test time**  
Saturday, August 17, 2:00 a.m. to Monday, August 19, 2:00 a.m. (PDT).  
Saturday, August 17, 9:00 a.m. to Monday, August 19, 9:00 a.m. (GMT).  
    
**However, users who fulfill any of the following requirements are eligible to participate starting from Friday, August 16, at 2:00 a.m. (PDT) / 9:00 a.m. (GMT)**  
Played Version 1.0.  
Legacy Campaign members.  
Registered a Beta Test registration code by Tuesday, July 30, 2013 9:59 p.m. (PDT) / Wednesday, July 31, 2013 4:59 a.m. (GMT).  
Received a PlayStation 3 promotion code in the days before the start of Beta 4 testing.  
**Testing Requests.**  
**Stress Testing on the Housing Zones.**  
    
""Mist,"" the housing area in Limsa Lominsa, will be available for players to explore. Housing samples will be placed in the area for players to take a look at, so please explore the area. The development team will be tracking the server load in the background so feedback will not be necessary.  
**The ""Mist"" housing area is accessible from Lower La Noscea.**    
  
**Testing the Basic System of PvP**  
The PvP content, ""The Wolves' Den,"" will be available for players to test. Once players complete the quest ""Bowl of Embers,"" ""The Wolves' Den"" will be added to the duty finder and the PvP battles will be accessible. The development team will monitor the matching precision of the packets sent between the players and see how far of a distance they can successfully attack from, as well as the server load in the background. Therefore, feedback will not be necessary.  
    
**PvP-specific actions will be unavailable.**  
**Since the requirement to enter ""The Wolves' Den"" is level 30 and above, only the players who have transferred character data from Version 1.0 are eligible to participate.**  
    
**Housing areas and PvP content will be implemented in patch 2.1.**
    
**Test Worlds**  
For phase 4, the following worlds will be made available. The character data from Beta Test phase 4 will be carried over to the official release version. Once you select a world, you will be unable to change it, so if you are planning to carry over the character data from phase 4, please select the world you are planning to play on in the official release version.   
    
**Changing the Appearance of the Characters from Version 1.0**  
As announced in the past, the graphics engine has been completely redesigned in FFXIV: ARR and players from Version 1.0 will receive a one-time opportunity to change the race, appearance, Nameday, Guardian and character name of their existing character(s).  
    
Starting from the Beta Test phase 4, players will be able to make this change when they log into the game with a character transferred from Version 1.0.  
**Please note that if the change has been made during the Beta Test phase 4, you will be unable to make a new change in both Early Access and the official launch.**  
   
**Log-in/World Restrictions**  
When the login server is heavily congested, testers may receive the following error message when attempting to log in to a world:
""This World is currently full. Players in queue: XX""
This message will also indicate the number of players waiting to log in. In the event you receive this error message, please wait until you are automatically logged in to the world.  
    
**Also, depending on the circumstances, we may restrict the number of players allowed to log in to a world.** In the event login restrictions are put in place, testers may receive the following error message:
""This World is currently full. Please wait until an opening is available and try again.""  
In the event you receive this error message, please try logging in at a later time.  
    
**Use of Copyrighted Material**  
Beginning with the start of the official launch, you may stream, upload or share the videos you record of FFXIV: ARR. However, please note that these things remain prohibited during Beta Test phase 4 and the early access period.  
Please see the following for more details on the use of copyrighted materials.

**You'll be allowed to capture video footage during phase 4, but you cannot release the footage to the public until the launch of official service.**  
    
**After the Beta Test Phase 4 Comes to End**  
Characters from Beta Test Phase 4  
Unless there happens to be a critical bug, both character data and the game data from beta test phase 4 will be carried over to Early Access and the official release version.  
    
Game Client from Beta Test Phase 4  
**Both the Windows PC and PlayStation®3 versions of the game client that was used in Beta Test phase 4 can be used going forward as the official release version in both Early Access and official service launch.
You do not need to uninstall the client after the end of phase 4.**

I am making this post to provide some clarification on a subject that seems to be confusing to a number of people. Specifically, how the class/job system works and why. I don't really want to get into the armory system, but I may touch on it once or twice. Rather than trying to tabulate the confusion and concern and then clarify each of those independently, I will go over how and why the class/job system works the way it does and address those issues as they come up. For most examples I will use the relationship between Pugilist and Monk as it is a currently available frame of reference. I will also use Arcanist/Summoner/Scholar as examples of how you can expect the system to work in the future. I am not making this post to convince people that they should or should not LIKE the system. I will address concerns only where system itself inherently addresses them.  Lets get started. 


The class/job system in FFXIV:ARR is in place to provide a fairly simple service to the players. That is, to provide a plethora of options for playing your character. This is implemented by way of the Armory System, in which the tool you have equipped determines your class. This enables you to play every class on a single character. This is fairly well understood and I don’t think it requires any further explanation. 


To begin illustrating HOW the class/job system works we will assume that I am playing the game as a Pugilist. I gain levels through quests and combat among other things, and as my level rises I gain access to more Pugilist abilities. Now, as a CLASS I also gain a cross-class slot every 5 levels. This means that by level 20, my Pugilist can equip 4 cross-class abilities. Cross-class abilities are abilities that can be slotted by classes other than the class that learns them. So by way of the Armory System, let us also assume that I leveled Conjuror and Lancer both to 15. My level 20 Pugilist can slot 4 cross-class abilities from those to classes to compliment the Pugilist’s own abilities. Lets say I slot Protect and Keen Flurry. This means that Pugilist can use the Conjuror ability ‘Protect’ and the Lancer ability ‘Keen Flurry’.  I have 2 empty cross-class slots that I can fill with cross-class abilities from any other class I have leveled. I can even slot more abilities from the same class, like Conjuror’s ‘Cure’. You can extrapolate this system all the way to level 50. At level 50 my Pugilist has 10 cross-class slots that can be filled with any cross-class abilities available from any other classes I have leveled. 


Before we move on with the HOW, lets address some WHYs. The reason the system works like this is twofold. Firstly, it encourages a player to play multiple classes to gain access to as many cross-class abilities as possible, which increases play time. The other reason is that this system boosts the versatility of classes, making solo play less punishing. Through cross-class abilities all classes have access to healing, damage-dealing, sustaining, and defensive abilities. If a player wanted to run some minor content solo (dungeons and such REQUIRE a party) then this system facilitates that by giving the player access to the full gamut of necessary skills.  


Lets move on with the HOW. Eventually, I would gain enough levels as Pugilist to be granted access to the job quests for Monk. This happens at level 30. HOWEVER, before these quests can be undertaken a sub-class must be leveled to 15. 


**To clarify; in order to qualify for a series of job quests you must have the PRIMARY CLASS to LEVEL 30, and a specific SUB-CLASS to LEVEL 15.**


 In the case of Monk, this means my Pugilist must be at least level 30 and my Lancer must be at least level 15. Assuming I meat those criteria, I can take and complete the quest to unlock the Monk job. Upon completion, one of my rewards is an item. I’ll call the job souls because I can’t recall the technical name (somebody please help me with that). This particular job-soul, the Soul of the Monk, is only equipable by my Pugilist. Once equipped, the item confers various stat boosts and a separate pool of attribute points to allocate. Another effect of equipping a job-soul is a change in the number and type of cross-class slots. While a job is equipped you are only granted one cross-class slot every **TEN** levels, effectively reducing the number of available slots by half. Furthermore, you can only slot abilities from two specific sub-classes. In the case of Monk in ARR these subclasses are Lancer and Gladiator. This means that I can continue to slot ‘Keen Flurry’, but my access to ‘Cure’ and ‘Protect’ is denied. To compensate for the reduced number of abilities, job quests award five job specific abilities unique to that job. On top of all this, you would notice that all descriptions of my class have shifted from “Level 30 Pugilist” to “Level 30 Monk”. This is an illusion we will talk about later. 


This was a bunch of information, so let us take another break from the HOW and consider the WHY. There are a few reasons for the implementation of jobs in ARR. One of the reasons has nothing to do with game mechanics, and that is simply that iconic Final Fantasy jobs are familiar to and desired by fans. Another reason is that jobs provide better party play. Without jobs, party play would feel like a potluck mishmash of same-y characters. Everybody would have access to cure and raise and second wind and invigorate, and party roles would blur into nothingness. With jobs, every person in the party has a role to play, and their class is designed and buffed to excel at that role, at the sacrifice of versatility. One of the concerns I see pretty frequently is that there is not enough diversity between people of the same class, or even between the class and that class’s job. I think these concerns come out of a misunderstanding of the class/job system. Players of the same job all feel the same and all jobs feel extremely similar to the base class for a reason; because the list of available jobs is not yet complete.  Lets go back to the HOW to illustrate what I mean. 


Our current list of classes has been carried over from 1.0. Jobs were implemented in the restructuring of 1.0 to showcase where the new development team was headed and to facilitate more party-centric gameplay. Now that we are on the verge of ARR, that system feels incomplete. Because it is. As will be demonstrated at launch, a new class that is the base for TWO jobs will be released. The class is Arcanist, and the two jobs are Summoner and Scholar. Because I believe these elements have been fairly adequately explained by the developers, I can tell you how I think the class/job system will work in the future. Arcanist will gain access to it’s jobs in the same fashion we talked about earlier, though there will likely be a separate quest line for each job and different sub-class requirements.


 To give a bit of reference, Arcanist has been announced as a pet based class, the focus of which is damage over time and debuffs. This puts the Arcanist in line to fill the role of Offensive Support. The class will likely lay down DoTs and Debuffs to bolster the overall damage to the target as well as reduce the effectiveness of the target through debuffs. Should the Arcanist equip the Summoner job, it is likely that the number and effectiveness of its DoTs will increase, making its role more DPS than Support. The developers have said the Scholar job will grant Heal over Time abilities to the Arcanist, likely pushing the role of the class to Heal/Support rather than offensive/support. 


If you take this same job system and apply it to the rest of the list of classes, then you can assume that in the future each class will get a second job (indeed this has been confirmed by the devs). This means that each class will have a slightly different role available to it, derived from its base mechanics. As the number of jobs increases, so does the amount of diversity in the player community. Pugilist will get a second job that operates slightly differently than Monk, likely even changing the function of some base abilities (like the Elemental Fist stances). Additional classes will be added to the Armory System to accommodate other unaccounted for weapon styles and jobs. 


Now another concern that often pops up, comes from people who are already familiar with all the above, but misunderstand that nature and purpose of the class/job system. More to the point, a number of people claim to be upset at the prospect of being unable to experience the leveling up process of a job when the sister job has already reached max level. For example, if you were to level Arcanist to 30 and get the appropriate sub-job to unlock Scholar, then continue to level Scholar to 50, your Summoner would also be level 50 despite having never equipped the job-soul. While I can understand the reason most people find this upsetting, I think that they miss the point of the system. 


**JOBS DO NOT GAIN LEVELS!**


This is imperative in understanding the function of the system. If we go back to our HOW then WHY format, then this is the HOW; Classes are the only player entities that gain levels. When you equip a job-soul the only thing you are doing is equipping a piece of gear that imparts three things; Bonus Stats, Unique Job Abilities, and Cross-Class Restrictions. To signify to yourself and other players that you have this gear equipped, your designation changes from class name to job name. You shift from a level 50 Pugilist to a level 50 Monk. The level does not change because jobs are independent to level and the level is irrelevant to the job. Even the Unique Job Abilities are independent of level. The reason they have a level attached to them is because you must be a specific level to accept the quest that awards them. I will repeat; **JOBS DO NOT GAIN LEVELS**.


And now I will explain WHY. Jobs are designed to be specializations. It is confusing because currently, each class only has one specialization. It is like having a tech-tree that goes straight up. When Arcanist and its corresponding jobs are released we will be able to see how the system is meant to work. Whether it works well or not is yet to be determined. But that is the design. You always play as a class and gain levels as a class. Most of the time however, you will do so while having a particular specialization equipped, and it is simpler to call yourself a Monk than a Pugilist/Monk. This is where more diversity comes from. Two players can play as Arcanist but be diverse because one specializes in DoTs with Summoner, and the other specializes in HoTs with Scholar. This will eventually happen with all classes. Jobs serve as Final Fantasy flavored tech-trees (that you can freely switch between). Later, when the level cap is bumped up, the differences between sister-jobs will increase as they gain more job abilities and cross-class slots.  


This is HOW the class/job system works, and WHY it works that way. Try not to get hung up on the feeling that the system is incomplete. Because it is. The point is that the missing parts are on their way. When they arrive, you can determine for yourself whether the implementation was successful. 


**THIS ENDS MY EXPLANATION** 


In my opinion, the class/job system has the potential to be very successful. There are a few things that need to happen for that to be the case, but those things seem like no brainers so I have high hopes. As an example, I think certain class abilities that bleed into a job, like the Elemental Fists the pugilist has, need to undergo a function shift when a different Pugilist job is released. It would seem silly to have fists of earth and wind without fists of fire (a Monk exclusive). So if those abilities change to different abilities on a different job I think that would go a long way to making this system successful. As an example if Pugilist gained the Dancer job, then those elemental fist abilities could change to dances while you have the dancer job equipped. The same would work for Arcanist, and this would be when we could determine if they are going this route. While you are Arcanist, you have a Summon Ruby Carbuncle and a Summon Diamond Carbuncle ability. Since you can’t summon Carby while playing as either Summoner or Scholar, those skills would be rendered useless. Unless having a job equipped alters the function of those skills. As an example Summon Ruby Carby might change to Summon Fairy when you equip the Scholar job. I look forward to playing Arcanist and Scholar to see how they handle this little issue. 


Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you found it informative.

1365889662.0,83,self.ffxiv,1cahpm,I feel defeated...I want to correct stupid testers' ridiculous judgements of this (incomplete) game but I just can't keep up.,118,35,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1cahpm/i_feel_defeatedi_want_to_correct_stupid_testers/,"Seriously, everywhere I look I see people breaking NDA and spreading false information about this game.  ""There's only a handful of quests""  ""The introduction is incredibly boring""  ""Nothing to do but grind"" ""Only one kind of zone""  ""Combat is too easy"" ""No cutscenes / voice acting"", ""bitch"", ""moan"", etc.

I realize the whole ""it's only beta"" thing was one of the reasons FFXIV 1.0 failed (yeah, I was there, and yeah, I said it) but when people are flat out critical about things that

* A: have been specifically talked about by Yoshi P
* B: are explained in the beta test road map
* C: could be easily understood by reading the info posts on the beta forums

...and then take their ridiculous thoughts to the uniformed masses as a critique of the final product....I don't know, it makes me sick.  I want to correct these ignorant posts...but as soon as I do, I find someone else saying the same uninformed things and I just feel defeated.  

**TLDR:** Anyone else upset about the amount of NDA breaking by people who really don't understand what they're talking about?  I think SE has done a great job of being transparent as far as their goals and intentions here, and people are either missing the point or just ignoring them because ""LOL this game is just like WoW, I quit""...and I'm afraid the game will suffer for the misconception. 

**edit:** Maybe I should've been more clear or something, everyone thinks I'm white knighting for the game when in reality I'm far from doing so. All I'm asking for is that people don't break NDA with unfounded opinions based on a product that's not complete.  It's the reason we have the NDA in the first place...so people's *opinions* about the purposely unfinished game don't leak outside of the beta forums and influence the opinions of those who aren't in the beta and don't fully understand the scope of each phase.

**more thoughts:**   Since this thread is getting way more exposure than I thought it would, I feel the need to voice my opinion about the game, since everyone else is.  

My opinion is that we shouldn't have ANY opinions yet because no matter how any of us feels about anything we've seen in the game so far, we're all wrong. 

We have no idea how ANY of these seemingly disparate systems intertwine because we have yet to see the big picture. Don't like the combat? Well maybe you will after you see limit breaks and have more classes to pick from. Don't like the enclosed spaces of Gridania? Maybe it works as a contrast to the open air of Limsa. See what I'm getting at? Our view of this game is so narrow that quite literally having any opinion at all at this point (and I'd argue even up until beta phase 4) just makes us all, collectively, worse.

We aren't playing, we're testing. I feel like I'm the only one who understands the difference.

A comparison, if I may: The japanese guy at Nintendo in 1985 is responsible for testing a level of super mario bros where mario swims for the whole level. All day for weeks all he does is test the swimming level over and over again. He goes on the (then non-existent internet) and starts screaming ""THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS, ALL YOU DO IS SWIM"". Everyone says ""wow that sucks, I surely don't want to play a game where all you do is swim all the time."" Again, do you see what I'm getting at? It's about the bigger picture. And quite frankly, we don't know what that picture is yet.

**TLDR (pt2):** Everyone needs to **STFU** about their personal feelings (be they good or bad) towards things until we have a more solid understanding of the game as a whole.  We're not playing, we're not reviewing, we're simply testing.  And if you honestly have so much passion that you can't contain your feelings about an aspect of the game EVEN after reading all of this, *knowing* how *ignorant* we all are to how the game actually works...then there's a place for you.  The feedback threads in the beta forum.  

**Next day update:** wow you guys.  This has become the most discussed post in my reddit history and I couldn't be happier about the discussion that's ensued.  Glad to see we have such a dedicated community here at /r/ffxiv, regardless of which side of the fence you're on about ARR.  /cheer!

I have never had that feeling here.  Almost everyone here has been wonderful and inclusive.

~~Thank you for your time and good luck!~~



A bit info about me and why I'm doing this is below here.

If you would like to play with me, I will likely be rolling a char on the Moogle server. I am from Sweden.

For those interested, I bought [110 copies of the game](http://imgur.com/a/D3LG7), I used one myself, and gave 21 away during version 1.0. I only barely played the first free month because I felt the game was very, let's say, stale and dull. I had built up too much hype for the title, as I am doing once again for ARR, however the game didn't deliver what I hoped for.

As a fan of Square Enix and their Final Fantasy series I just wanted to share their game with some other people who was interested in the title. I stopped handing out copies because I didn't want other people to feel like I did, that would be such a waste of my copies. 
I want people to play the game and most of all, love it, just as I have done with many Final Fantasy games in the past!
 
As the legacy campaign was getting to its end I though that maybe I could get it by telling Square Enix about this, as it was too late to get it by paying for 90 days. They said it was fun that I was doing this but it wasn't possible to get Legacy other than paying for 90 days, even though I paid more than those 90 days for all my copies. ""...our system just does not allow us to make exceptions."". It would be fun if they would give me a little something for it though. A signed poster, a cactuar plush or whatnot. I don't own anything special made by them, exept most of the Final Fantasy games!

Many of those I gave my keys to during 1.0 didn't have a computer capable of running the game, that's why I made it a requirement to post a screenshot of the benchmark score in order to be eligible for the giveaway.

Please give me some time to reply, I have to open and copy the codes from unopened cases. I will be doing this over a couple of days I think!

EDIT 1: I have now handed 3 games out. I will wait for more entries before I start handing them out again!

EDIT 2: If you'd like to watch my box of games and once in a while see my hand grab one, here's my [twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/qulith)! You could also chat with other people there, if you'd like :)

EDIT 3: 10 copies got a new owner now! I will wait for more entires before I start handing them out again!

EDIT 4: I've decided to hand out 10 copies each day until beta phase 4 starts. You are still able to enter the giveaway but there won't be any winners until tomorrow! Congratulation to all the winners today! Also, if you didn't win today your entry still has a chance to win tomorrow and all the other days until this event is over! So no need to make a new entry!

EDIT 5: I've noticed that one of the winners has removed their enrty, please leave them in this thread. And when it's possible, could all the winners post a screenshot of you successfully registering the game as proof. Another note, even if you delete your entry I have noted your name down so you won't be able to enter the giveaway again!

EDIT 6: The stream is up again and I will start giving some keys away in about 10 min! Check EDIT2 for info about the stream.

EDIT 7: Todays giveaway has ended! I will start the next one tomorrow at [4pm/16:00 GMT+2](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/europe/european-union/sweden/) I'd also like to apologize to all day 1 winnners. I noticed that the links in my PM were outdated. I've updated my PM so the new winners won't get as confused as the first ones probably got! These should be the correct links: [Exclusive Square Enix Member signup](
https://membership.square-enix.com/register) and [Square Enix EU account site](http://eu.square-enix.com/en/seaccount), please correct me if I still got them wrong!

EDIT 8: The giveaway for 13/08 is over. The next one will be 14/08 at 4pm/16:00 - 5:30pm/17:30 GMT+2.

EDIT 9: Today's giveaway, 14/08, is now over! Come back tomorrow at the same time for the next chance to win!

EDIT 10: The giveaway today, 15/08, **will start at 6pm/18:00 GMT+2**.

EDIT 11: **The giveaway is now over! Thanks for participating and congratulation to all the winners! Remember that the registration still isn't up yet. Redeem your keys around the 27th of august. If the keys still appear invalid, leave me a PM and I'll double check your keys!**",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1376665693.0,,,True,t3_1k5da3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1k5da3/eu_final_fantasy_xiv_giveaway_more_info_in_thread/,

I think this should aid many other people. Now, this is assuming that the new Client creates a new folder within ""My Games"", and doesn't use our currently existing one.

**1)** Go to ""My Games"" folder. It's in ""My Documents""

**2)** Go to ""Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (Beta Version)"" Folder
______________________________________________

[Now, you should see folders which are very similar to this image](http://i.imgur.com/ql12DX4.jpg):

The Folder **""4AXXXXX""***, which is boxed in Red is where all of your UI Layout Data, Macros, Keybinds, Hotbar Action Layout and Gear Sets are location. You get multiple of these folders for each character you have.

The Folder **""FFXIV_CHRXXXXX""**, which is boxed in Green is your Configuration Settings. This is for what Hotbars you have enabled, as well as other Character Settings. You have multiple of these folders for each character you have.

The Files **""FFXIV_CHARA_BETA0x.dat""** which are boxed in Blue are my Character Creation files which I can import when creating a new character.

The 6 numbers at the end of the folder ""4A"" represent your character ID. This ID is also the same as the last 6 numbers of your ""FFXIV_CHRXXXXX"" folder. So these two folders are linked together. This may prove difficult to find out which Character ID goes with which one of your characters (if you have multiple).

(*for example, my main character ID is 412554, which you can see at the end of both of these folders. This is not the same as your Lodestone ID*)

**NOTE**:  You may have **01**XXXXXX instead of **4A**XXXXXX. The first two letters/numbers are server related *
______________________________________________

**3)** Go into folder **""4AXXXXX""**

Now you'll see a bunch of new .dat files. I'll list what each one does

* addon.cnf - **THIS IS YOUR UI/HUD LAYOUT FILE** If you want to use your existing HUD/UI layout, make sure you save this file up. It is important

* gearset.dat - This lists all of your gearsets and what items are currently in the sets

* hotbar.dat - This all of the actions which are on your hotbar. This will save the layout of your actions on your hotbar, including your potions etc. 

* keybind.dat - This is fairly obvious. Its your keybinds. What button does what command

* macro0.dat - I don't know if you can get many macro files, but I think each macroX.dat is for each page of your macro list. This backs up your macros

______________________________________________

So if you want to back-up your entire UI layout, make sure you save these Files and Folders:

What you'd want to do is go into your desired characters folder, and back up:

* addon.cnf
* every file inside the folder ""FFXIV_CHRXXXXX""

You can also transfer these files to your other characters.

Enjoy your remaining last few hours of P3 and get ready for Open Beta/Phase 4!

**NOTE**: It's important to back these up as we will be using a new client for FFXIV:ARR. If you want to keep everything for P4, then just transfer the entire contents of this folder to the new, assumed folder which we'll get with the new Client.

Like everyone else in this subreddit, August can't come soon enough for me and I'm eagerly awaiting ARR. That being said, a lot of discussion and comparisons to other top MMO's always present themselves to make people feel like their purchase is justified.

The circlejerk hype-train always rolls on by a new MMO project and quickly leaves as it endlessly looks for that same feeling it got from its first MMO experience X years ago (*we are all guilty of this*). For the first time in a long time however, I'm looking forward to ARR not because its a *new* MMO (it technically isn't), but for the ideology it's built around.

For a bit of backstory, I pre-ordered the 1.0 collectors edition after I heard how FFXI was a great MMO in its own right and wanted to try something new. I thought because this is the second MMO they have developed it must be better than the first one right?

What greeted me was without a doubt the worst MMO experience I have ever had. I put it down 25 minutes later, used the mug it came with a pencup, and immediately erased it out of my mind. 

Square Enix burnt me so badly I never even considering going back, until some cursory research and just plain boredom made me try the ARR beta. Not only has it won me over in spades, I'm starting to get myself back into the Final Fantasy culture I left in disgust several years ago.

That being said, I do firmly believe ARR won't be a 'wow-killer' (*hate that term*) but there are several aspects to it that make me believe it will gather a **loyal, mid-sized and most importantly friendly community** that will stick through it thick and thin. Here are some finer points about ARR and what makes it a unique MMO development to anything else we've ever seen:

* Square Enix knows its development team screwed up royally with 1.0. It not exactly everyday when a company fires pretty much all of its development team, removes its subscription model from its game for like 9 months or however long it was and takes it down to entirely relaunch it. This indicates they have a lot of faith in this new project as a whole and want to see it succeed at any cost.

* The expenditure required of the point above means that they really need to make sure this is a game that can justify its asking price. The fact they are **so quiet** about its marketing to me says they are very confident they have a product that appeals to it's demographic that will sustain and justify its ongoing costs. *And from what I've seen so far I have to agree.*

* Square Enix seem insanely humble about the failings of 1.0. How often do you have publishers openly admit their mistakes?

* Naoki Yoshida and his team are a breath of fresh air from the stuffy shirts from other MMO's. They're down to earth and have no qualms praising elements from other games for their inspiration and ideas. Have you ever heard of Blizzard or Trion praising other for its elements that it lifted from it?

* The game is social! It sounds stupid considering how obtuse and clunky the chat system is, but not having a general chat (other than /shout) is just about the best thing they did for it. If you want to be social, you have to start looking for linkshell groups, or make your own. If you want to be a introvert, you don't have to do any of it. 

* They have openly and frankly detailed the game design plan and implementation going forward. This is a wait and see kind of thing if they are actually going to stick with it but it means you know exactly what you are getting this time around and any deviation or back flipping on this will be met with open anger and losing its community. Points 1 &amp; 2 seem to infer they can't afford to do this.

* Besides the first 10-15 levels, the game does not mollycoddle you. Once the training wheels are off, they're off. Most game companies are entirely risk-adverse in everything they do so its great to see someone not treat us like idiots for a change.

All in all I think that its upfront design nature, and the pedigree of the designers (Yoshi being a hardcore DAOC player gives him a lot of e-rep in certain circles) means that ARR will have a very loyal playerbase to draw from for years to come. 

The mentality nowdays from publishers seems to be that it has to be ""#1 or go F2P"". Marketing teams tend to overplay their game features or make just utterly insane claims about how their games will redefine the MMO market and how it will bring world peace etc etc. 

**What makes ARR so brilliant is that its not aiming to be #1 or to change the industry, its aiming to bring a fantastic, polished experience for a group of people it knows it will appeal to and that kind of mentality hasn't happened in a very. long. time.**

**TL:DR** ARR isn't going to bring the *WoW crowd*, and that is probably the best thing about it.

In reponse, a Japanese developer [has made this post:](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/89777-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AF8%E6%9C%8820%E6%97%A5%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B%E3%81%8B?p=1064735&amp;viewfull=1#post1064735)

    

   &gt;Hello.
&gt;
&gt;This topic has certainly become widespread on the English forums, hasn’t it? This piece of information has developed into something rather complicated, so after this the rep teams for each language will make a response as necessary, but for the time being we have not announced the date for Early Access in any region. In order to prevent confusion, we would like to make this point clear.

&gt;    The current status is the same as is displayed [on this page:](http://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/product/index.html)
&gt;
&gt;*Early Access    
&gt;Those who pre-order Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn and register a special early-access code will be able to play FFXIV a few days prior to the official release date!*    
&gt;
&gt;As is mentioned above.    
&gt;Until we make a further announcement, please stay tuned.

&lt;Translator’s Note: The Japanese product info page has one specific word of note for when Early Access is : 下旬. This means the last 1/3rd of a month.

As a person who played FFXI and WoW extensively (and competitively raided in WoW for a bit) trust me when I say you're looking at the corner of a frame and missing the painting entirely.

I'm writing this not just to explain to those people that their complaint is wrong and just to give an overview of DPS mechanics and buttons. But also to give a small primer in how to become good at DPSing in General. In order to do this, I will explain a little bit of what PUG does by itself (not even MNK, just PUG) and how pressing buttons willy-nilly is just plain bad.

---

I'm a subscriber to the school of thought that it's better to give theory and have people 'discover' the proper playstyle through trial and error, rather than just looking at a flowchart of priority or tell them to press buttons in order. So I'm going to try and explain things in such a way that will show you why you're pressing those buttons rather than just what order to press them.

**Playing a DPSing Class Effectively**

This really only comes down to two things: Survival and Total Damage Done.

Ironically, the actual DPS number doesn't really matter much until the very end of understanding how to DPS effectively. Why? Because DPS as a number is actually mostly irrelevent. Consider the following. In a fight against a particularly challenging raid boss you are (a Pugilist) DPSing 1000 DPS and were alive for 30 seconds. There is another Pugilist who DPSed for 400 and was alive for 10 minutes. Guess who the raid leader and the rest of the group would rather have?

In order to DPS well your first job in a raid or any encounter, as simple as it may seem, is to NOT DIE. That's it. Just DON'T FUCKING DIE. Use potions, use defensive cooldowns, just stop DPSing if you're going to die. Just stop. Walk away from the monster. But muh numbers! No. Shut up. Don't die.

In order to improve the second aspect, read stuff. Theorycraft for yourself. Read other people's reasonings for changing their priority. Hell read this if you're a Pugilist. Learn your class inside and out. Look at each ability, what it brings to the table, the cost of it, the cooldown, and ask yourself these questions. Why did the developers give me this skill? Where should I be positioned? What if I used this one instead? Am I sitting on dead air? If you can reason through these questions and look at your DPS priorities in this way, I can tell you you're already better than 80% of the people that simply look up a rotation and press those buttons mindlessly.

Now to get to the meat of what I said earlier, people are complaining about how there's very little in terms of abilities and stuff and while true... this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The developers didn't build skillbars horizontally, they're actually built vertically and in three dimensions. Abilities and positioning matter most in FFXIV moreso than any other MMO. We're going to look at Pugilist to try and understand what the developers have tried to do in this game.

**An Overview of Kickpunching, The Pugilist**

Like every class/job in FF14, PUGs have a list of active and passive abilities. Active abilities are just that, they require you to active them and the passives work in the back giving you buffs, altering your active abilities and so on. Let's take a look at the PUGs active abilities.

---

**Bootshine** - Lv.1 - Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 2.5 

Delivers an attack with a potency of 130.

Opo-opo Form Bonus: Critical damage if dealt from behind target

**Additional Effect: Changes form to raptor**

Duration: 10s

---

&gt;Hold the phone? What the fuck does that mean?

Alright this is the first step down into the depths of understanding how to DPS. A lot of the active abilities of the PUG makes her switch forms. There are **three** different forms to switch around in; **Raptor, Coeurl, and Opo-Opo**. Each form may affect your next button press(es) and utilizing the proper form order as well as positioning will be paramount in maximizing our DPS. For example, Bootshine itself gains the ability to have 100% crit **IF** you are both BEHIND the target, and in Opo-Opo form. Sadly, since Bootshine is usually our starter ability until the rotation gets goin, your first Bootshine will usually be not of the 100% crit variety.

---

**True Strike** -Lv.2 -Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 2.5

Delivers an attack with a potency of 150. Chance for critical damage increases by 5% when dealt from behind target. Can only be used when in raptor form.

Additional Effect: Changes form to coeurl

Duration: 10s

---

&gt;The second piece of the puzzle

Bootshine leads us to Raptor Form, and this has 20 more base potency than Bootshine, so bam. We now have a 1-2 combo. Easy enough, Bootshine gives us Raptor and this can only be cast in Raptor. Hmm but this doesn't give us opo-opo to take full advantage of Bootshine's properties. Let's keep looking

---

**Featherfoot** - Lv.4 - Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 90.0s

Increases evasion by 15%.
Duration: 10s

---

&gt;Defensive Cooldowns

Our first defensive skill. This isn't kickpunching at all! However, this does fill a defensive gap in soloing but also in what I talked about earlier. SURVIVE. Ninety seconds isn't a terribly long amount of time, don't be afraid to use this if you pull aggro. Your job is to DPS at the maximum of your ability and sometimes, lesser mortals can't keep threat off you. Use this to survive in those occasions. Or maybe sometimes you just fuck up.

Another way to think about it is this. Raid encounters are tuned around your Healers' mana bar VS the raid's overall DPS. The less burden your healers have to brunt, the more leeway you have in not being the best at DPSing. Evading attacks = less healing = more mana = more time to try and kill the boss.

---

**Snap Punch** - Lv.6 - Cast Time: Instant - Recast Time: 2.5

Delivers an attack with a potency of 140. Potency of 180 when delivered from a target's flank [from the side].

Can only be used when in coeurl form.

Additional Effect: Changes form to opo-opo
Duration: 10s

Additional Effect: Grants Greased Lightning
Duration: 12s
Greased Lightning Bonus: Increases damage dealt by 7% and attack speed by 5%

---

&gt;Out of the pan and into the fire; The Early level Triple Combo

We have now leveled to level 6 and we have our first 'rotation'. If you want the easy answer: Bootshine -&gt; True Strike -&gt; Snap Punch -&gt; Bootshine -&gt; True Strike -&gt; Snap Punch etc etc. Read the skills again and it's really easy to see WHY we do this. However, Snap Punch does something that's actually far more important. Greased Lightning.

&gt;Greased Lightning

Greased Lightning is what is usually called a 'priority buff'. You want to keep the uptime of this ability up as much as possible. At level 20 you unlock the passive ability to keep 2 stacks up, and at 40 you can keep 3 stacks up. At full stacks, that's a whopping 21% damage dealt increase and 15% attack speed. Your highest potential to DPS hinges on the speed at which you stack and your ability to maintain this buff while avoiding raid mechanics.

The priority is actually pretty easy at this point, Try to keep up Greased Lightning and try not sit on any dead GCDs. However, at higher levels Twin Snakes and Demolish effectively demolish (pardon the pun) the idea of rotating between Bootshine -&gt; True Strike -&gt; Snap Punch forever and moves PUG into the one of the better designed DPSers in any MMO I've come across. The Stance-Based Dynamic-Priority Kickpuncher.

I really want to write more of this but I actually have to leave for a bit right now. I would hold off on posting this right away, but I want some feeback. Is it good? Do i need to work on something? Should I bother continuing?

1372726437.0,77,self.ffxiv,1hgr7l,Dragoon : Phase 3 - Some things you could know and my thoughts.,99,22,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hgr7l/dragoon_phase_3_some_things_you_could_know_and_my/,"Ok my second and last post for the night - Dragoon. This is the one battle class that I probably spent the least amount of time on. Though I did spend time on it, did a few dungeons as LNC/DRG and beat around on cancer with a parser and even walked around killing mobs a bit. So if you feel I got something wrong let me know!

There isn't really anything I was disappointed in when it came to DRG so I will just list some of the good things I found and give you guys some tips.

* **Heavy Thrust / Feint / Straight Shot** - These are the few standalone skills that I found out to be really great. I know Straight Shot is from the ARC tree but I find it necessary to mention it and how it should be on every DRG's bar. Heavy Thrust is LNC's answer to Twin Snakes and the duration of the buff gets boosted to 15 seconds later on making it a must in your rotation. Feint is another skill that needs to be pointed out - I don't know the full effects of a 20% Slow but I'm sure it can't be a bad thing. Feint won't always be ""required"" but I feel it will definitely be important in your decision making.

* **The Full Thrust Combo** - This combo is mindlessly easy to pull off. Really its just a 1-2-3 button push and bam! 300 Potency skill. I feel like the simplicity in this combo is a must considering all the actions you can pull off in between skills.

* **Chaos Thrust Combo** - This will probably be the first combo that you pull off in a single target fight. All you have to do is land Impulsive Drive in the back (I hate talking about DRG combo's makes me feel weird...) and Disembowel /Chaos Thrust can be performed anywhere. This whole combo does a good bit of damage, smacks a good DoT on the enemy and gives you a nice boost in piercing damage towards a target. Against trash mobs I don't see this combo being as important.

* **Jump / Spineshatter Dive / Dragonfire Dive / Elusive Jump** - Jumping! Wouldn't be a FF dragoon without jumping! And they sure do give you a lot of them. Actually all your DRG skills involve jumping. While at first they may seem underwhelming they all cost no TP and all of them are off the GCD, meaning they are great fillers in between GCD skills. I feel this is where DRG and MNK really begin to differentiate.

* **Power Surge/ Life Surge** - Power Surge will make your next Jump / Spineshatter Dive deal more damage. Obviously this skill is best used on Jump and it times up perfectly to boost every third jump. Life Surge is a DPS skill and a life saver, I think its most important use is the fact that it will always force a critical which makes it ideal to use when you are using Full Thrust. While some people may disagree I think Life Surge should almost always be on CD while in a party setting as you want to maximize your damage as much as you can. The healing effect is just a bonus : D.

* **Leg Sweep** - I think this skill is best saved for whenever a boss is charging a skill since interrupts are priceless but in an all out DPS race keeping this on CD isn't a bad idea. 3 seconds worth of stun is priceless towards the end of fights, so use it when you see the boss charging up some move - Your whm and pld will thank you for it.

* **Invigorate/ Blood for Blood** - Invigorate restore 450 TP at level 36 meaning that when your TP drops below 550 Use it!!!! You can easily make it the end of fights faster if this skill is used properly. I found on DRG Tp problems were a myth (Though I'm sure in 10+ minute fights it would become a problem =P). Blood for blood is another skill that is best paired with Full Thrust and Dragonfire Dive. When you use it be careful! I could only imagine a DRG with Blood for blood up and getting hit with a primals astral flow : (.


Quick Tips :

* Coming up with a solid combo for DRG is hard but I can at least get your brain thinking : **Straight Shot &gt; Impulse Drive ( Back ) &gt; Disembowel &gt; Chaos Thrust &gt; Heavy Thrust ( Side) &gt; True Thrust &gt; Vorpal Thrust &gt; Full Thrust.**

* Imo Dragoon's playstyle is a bit different than MNKS, where MNK is trying to maintain their buffs and positioning DRG is trying to maintain their CD's. Using your CD's when you can really will increase your damage over all. Such as  taking the last part of that combo : **Heavy Thrust &gt; Blood for Blood &gt; True Thrust &gt; Power Surge &gt; Vorpal Thrust &gt; Life Surge &gt; Full Thrust &gt; Jump &gt; Straight Arrow &gt; Raging Strikes &gt; Heavy Thrust (Side) &gt; Dragonfire Dive.** Would probably be a good rotation to maximize your dmg, over course this all theory crafting - I could be absolutely wrong. 

* IIRC using a standalone GCD skill will break your combo link, so if you start a combo finish it.

* If you are AoE'ing Trash mobs Dread Spike is probably going to be your best bet but if you are AoE'ing mobs centered around a boss Heavy Thrust ( Side) &gt; Ring of Thorns will probably produce better results. DFD also makes a great AoE skill.


Overall:

I'm mostly happy with DRG in its current state because as it is you can easily just Spam the Full Thrust combo and be useful but again if you wanna be your best utilizing all of your tools is going pull you ahead. Dragoon definitely has a ""Fast Burn"" effect while Monk is more of a ""Slow Burn"" class and I'm really glad SE made them comparable but still different. I really feel DRG is in a really good place and I hope they change almost nothing about it : D.


Sorry if for the lack of information here, if you guys want anything tested let me know and I will try to get to it next beta phase^^


Hope this helped someone  - Lavi.

Here are some suggestions.,95,22,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hzt38/so_we_have_5_more_days_in_phase_3_are_you_feeling/,"I'm copying this directly from my blog on the beta lodestone. I apologize for any errors I have made, spelling or grammatical. I can easily say English isn't my first, but truth be told, i'm just dumb. 
Here you go!

**Before reading, note that this doesn't apply to everyone, this is for the people simply looking to do something a little extra while they wait for Phase 4 to begin or if they feel a little burnt out already.**

Well, it seems SE needs us for another 5 days and many of us will wonder: ""Well, what now? I grinded as fast as I could to get to 35 before the wipe, now what do I do?"" Fret not testers for there is still a lot of untapped content that we need to help SE with!

First and foremost: Duty finder! Repeat those instances on your level 15s. Need to know how to get an instant level 15 DoW/M? http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gubii/instant_level_15_on_jobs/

Get those jobs to 15 and try out classes you would never try and abuse that Duty Finder. Your info isn't going to save anyways so dont worry too much about your 35 not getting exp. Unlock the rest of those GHs and see what the heck to do. You never know, you might end up mentoring someone who buys it day 1. 

2) CRAFT

Now that you've had time to hunt a crazy amount of mobs you should of gathered a ton of crafting materials (pending you didn't sell them all). Not only that, you most likely amassed a ton of crystal shards. Craft craft craft. Saving your guildleve cards will pay off now because if you do a craft leve, **Edit: ~~you'll be able to craft an item for free~~ steph26 informs us that crafting for leves aren't free anymore, sorry! (might have some costs associated), receive exp AND gain materials. 
Why craft? because it's going to be essential to this game. Instanced armor is great and all but crafted gear is still going to be a strong point when you can stack materia into it like a bauss. Another reason is that it'll give you a feel on how much time it'll take to get to a certain level. However, if you feel low on materials, just go do #3 which is...

3) Gathering!

Ah yes, the most relaxing of the three (imo). Get that mining license or botany certificate and seek out those pesky rocks or dastardly weeds. Not only will you find material for crafting, you will find tons of crystal shards needed to craft. 
If Hamlets do make a return, Gatherers and Crafters will play a big part of PvE and finding crafters will be as much needed as White Mages. Everyone should find at least one Gathering and one Crafting that they can devote their time into. Having one at the ready will be most valuable in the most surprising times. 

4) Bug Report

The more bugs we submit the better. Most likely a lot of people have experienced bugs but haven't reported with the reasoning ""I bet someone's already done it"". Who Cares! Write it down anyways on Notepad or Google Docs, go to the forums, Search your bug and if its not there, post it! Follow the post guidelines of course. Don't forget to take lots of pictures. Pictures are great evidence and they need all the evidence they can get. 

Lastly, 
5) EXPLORE

While a ton of areas are closed off, explore explore explore. find every nook and cranny, find every NPC, locate every zone.This will be a great way to plan your route for phase 4/open. If you can find xx NPC that'll sell xx item so you can craft xx, come p4 you can make your first few levels that much easier. 

Oh and I guess an extra/tidbit
6ish) Be Open, make friends but do not fall into a clique

Use duty finder, get friendly with your members, see if they wanna be ff buddies. I know a lot of you already have created FC and LS with the intent of carrying over to P4 but don't let that be a reason to become a clique. Don't fall into 'that group that only invites Betas'. Now that you explored Eorzea, come release you should be there to help fellow new adventurers out. Do not exclude them from the content. Yeah it can be easy saying ""google it"", but it's just as easy to say ""Central Thanalan 32-23"" if you know the answer. 

Remember, we want this game to succeed, we know it has potential and everyone working on it have given it their all. Let's be the front line in heralding a great game.

Take care Eorzians.

Producer/Director Yoshi-P here.

Thank you all so much for your feedback.
I'd first like to start off by apologizing for the heavy lag caused by the increased frequency of FATEs during our previous test. A majority of the problems with auto-attack not activating and position lag stemmed from this, so everything should be working relatively smoothly during the next test session.

Now then, I have a lot of ground to cover here, but I think it's about time I address the battle system. It's been quite some time since I've written a long post like this, so get comfortable, grab a cool drink, and prepare for a good read. In the future, I hope you guys keep what I cover in this post in mind as you continue to provide feedback.

■The Idea Behind FFXIV:ARR Battles and Content■
I've talked about concepts for the game's battle system and content in interviews before, but as a response to feedback here, I feel the information in my interviews doesn't quite get the point across. The last thing I want is for you guys to start debating back and forth over points that have yet to be made clear, so first I'd like to set some groundwork and clear up a few things. 

■Monsters and Their Role in the Game■
Rather than focusing on encounters with common enemies out in the field, we want to place greater emphasis on FATE, dungeons, bosses, and other content we're preparing for A Realm Reborn. At the end of the day, normal enemies seen running around outside the cities aren't meant to require a great deal of effort. In contrast, when facing a boss while trying to clear a dungeon, for example, we want players to give it their all and have a fun time doing so.

■FFXI and FFXIV■
When FFXI released on PlayStation 2 a little more than 10 years ago, console gamers were able to experience an MMORPG for the first time. Although FFXI is no longer the only MMORPG on a console, there are but a few, and FFXIV will again be the first MMORPG experience for many console gamers. With this in mind, we designed the battle system based on three key principles.


- Playing in a party should not be necessary until level 15. This includes story-related events.
- Regardless of the learning curve, new players should not feel overwhelmed.
- The game's core design should allow for leisurely play over a long period of time.

Because there are so many things to remember and keep in mind when playing, MMORPGs can be fairly difficult compared to games from other genres. And because you're playing with other people in a world that's constantly changing, this is a problem that cannot be easily resolved. This is also, perhaps, why some consider MMORPGs to be so interesting. 

■Perplexity, Simplicity, and Replay Value■
Many games on the market attempt to rationalize needlessly complicated game features with phrases like ""Dynamic Action!"" or ""Revolutionary Gameplay!"" but with FFXIV: ARR, we have no intention of misleading our player base. There are only two things we wish to emphasize.

- If players have a goal, they should not be impeded by overly cumbersome obstacles.
- Players should not feel the need to avoid or sneak past enemies to enjoy any given content.

Considering players should be able to enjoy an MMORPG for months, or even years at a time, obstacles simply for the sake of having obstacles hinder the gaming experience. 

Unlike games from other genres, the use of a subscription model makes this much more important. Looking at MMORPG demographics, for example, your average player is younger now than when the first generation of MMORPGs were released. Nevertheless, players tend to be older due to the use of a subscription model. So when they come home from work or school and decide to play, even if it's only for an hour or two, they should be able to enjoy themselves. In other words, the use of mundane grinding for hours on end is no longer an effective means to stay competitive in the current MMORPG market.

Also, because these concepts will dictate the game's core design, any updates or new content released will inevitably be dictated by said core. This leads to three aspects of an MMORPG that must be carefully balanced to promote productive gameplay.

1. MMORPGs are based on the premise of party play.
2. If the game has a wide variety of exciting game elements, players will be compelled to try them.
3. The over use of non-targeted / area of effect skills can result in bland gameplay.*
* Encounters meant to be challenging such as dungeons tend to become unbalanced.

Even now, party play is a key element often focused on in the online gaming industry, and I believe it's what makes MMORPGs so appealing. To effectively incorporate party play into FFXIV, we first eliminated the stress of needing to form a party in the beginning of the game, and by mid-game players will start to find more content that requires teamwork. By end-game, players should be fairly comfortable with the duty finder and accustomed to group play as they take on the more challenging content we have prepared. 

Although some may come to the conclusion that constant interaction with others can become tiresome in an MMORPG, the alternative to a game that emphasizes party play must also be considered. If everything were designed to be completed alone, player retention would become increasingly problematic, and the lack of interaction with other players would detract from what it means to be an MMORPG. Mind you this is a comparison of one extreme to another (completely party focused versus solo play). In the end, an MMORPG is selective in its audience, which is both its strength and its weakness.

Regardless of how particular FFXIV: ARR may be in choosing its audience, as producer and director, the ability to attract new players is absolutely imperative.

This is where the remaining two aspects necessary for productive gameplay come into effect. But with so many games out on the market, in order for FFXIV: ARR to be accessible and interest new players enough to delve deeper, a certain sense of simplicity is necessary in the beginning of the game. Interesting game content and proper balancing are also important in motivating players to continue playing, but this is a given. As mentioned previously, however, no matter how hard one tries to attract new players, no MMORPG is capable of appealing to all audiences effectively. I personally believe an attempt to appeal to and retain every type of gamer effectively is too idealistic.

To speak specifically about game balance, I believe it's important that content is enjoyable, accessible, and does not hinder party communication when playing through it. Moreover, there should be a variety of things to do to keep players interested. Gameplay should also have a steady pace, but not simply devolve into spamming weapon skills.

As many of you know, I'm also an avid gamer, so you can expect end-game content as challenging as Version 1.0, along with an assortment of quests and stories befitting a Final Fantasy title. For those of you concerned about a lack of challenging end-game content, if Version 1.0 is any indication, you can rest easy knowing there are fierce battles on the horizon. 

In short, we've placed emphasis on quality gameplay that's easily accessible, and can be enjoyed in the long term.

■Research and Analysis■
The title of this section speaks for itself, but I've spent a fair bit of time studying other large MMORPGs currently on the market. More importantly, I've been monitoring their retention rates. Of course, people tend to concern themselves with sell-in and sell-through, but the longevity of an MMORPG depends on retention. This is why it's important to understand that game developers for online games always make their decisions based on retention rate. Because I'm a gamer myself, I also take time to play the game, as well as take feedback from players, which I believe is also very important.

This, in a rather big nutshell, outlines the basic concept we have in mind for FFXIV: ARR. This applies not only to the battle system, but all aspects of the game. Whether it's a simple FATE against a wave of enemies, or a gritty battle against a powerful NM, offering players a variety of options to have fun is our goal.
(Speaking of FATE, you can expect a separate post on this in the near future )

FFXIV:ARR and the Battle System Part 2 (Another long read!)

Now that I've gotten the groundwork out of the way, let's get down to some of the finer points of the battle system.

■GCD and Planning Time■
The current implementation of the GCD (Global Cooldown) is a result of our aim to keep things simple while ensuring players can enjoy the game for a long time. Unfortunately for seasoned MMO players, the beginning of the game may seem dull and boring. However, the GCD is in place to give players time to think about what their next move is going to be. I know that the beta test is still somewhat laggy, and you guys haven't had a lot of time to really dig into the game yet, but as you progress in level, your characters will acquire a variety of skills to use in battle. This includes combos, weapon skill and action rotations, debuff skills, and crowd control skills. As you acquire more skills to use in battle, the 2.5 second GCD won't seem as long as you think it is. I hope you all will continue testing and explore the potential of the current system.

■Skill Rotations and Adjustments■
While our goal is for players to have access to more skill rotations as they level, it shouldn't take too long to reach that level of gameplay. As we read over your feeedback and look over our own data, we'll be making adjustments so that combos and skill rotations are available at an earlier level. 

Archer in particular has no actions that combo, and we feel its skill rotation is lacking. When fighting one on one against a powerful enemy, such as a boss, this lack of combos and skill rotations is much more noticeable. Over the course of the beta test, we will continue to make adjustments to actions while taking in your feedback. 

■Auto-attack■
There's been a fair bit of debate as to what purpose auto-attack serves in ARR, but the answer is simple. Auto-attack is the source of your character's base damage. Based on all the feedback received relating to auto-attack and its utility as a source of damage, we've been working significant changes since the end of alpha testing which should be ready by the latter half of the beta test. Although I can't go into detail about the changes yet, one thing I can tell you is there are be no changes such as the use of auto-attack to restore TP.

It may be hard to tell when you experience the first dungeon at level 15, but by the time you can explore the level 25 to 35 dungeons, the finite nature of TP and MP should become more apparent. That is, you will have to make smart choices with your skills to not only use TP and MP effectively, but to survive more dangerous encounters. In the event you do run out of MP and TP, however, you will still have auto-attack as a constant source of base damage. There are still more adjustments to be made, but in the meantime, your feedback is always welcome and appreciated.

■FFXIV is Like Poker?■
This may be a stretch, but I'd like to take a moment to break down the combat system by comparing it to Texas hold ‘em poker

- There is little time where you will be sitting there doing nothing. (However, there's always enough time to strategize)
- You won’t start with a full hand, overwhelmed by too many options
- As more cards are revealed (as you level up and acquire more actions/traits), the number of options (skill combinations) available to you increases
- Each weapon skill serves as a ""card,"" with combos and triggered effects serving as ""hands.""
- You change your ""hand"" according to how a fight plays out (but you’ll always have time to think on your strageies).
- Limit breaks, which are planned for implementation in phase 3, will serve as ""hands"" shared by the party.
- Auto-attack serves as one of your ""cards"" when all other options have been exhausted, as it's still a means of sustaining that base damage.

This is the premise of the battle system. I know poker wasn't the best analogy to describe how the battle system will work, but I hope you guys get the general idea. 

■PvP Actions■
When discussing the design of actions and weaponskills, we originally planned for actions geared toward PvP to automatically be learned by leveling, just as is the case with PvE actions. However, realized this would create problems. For those who only play PvE, they would have no use for skills catered to PvP. In contrast, those who do play PvP would inevitably have too many to sort through. What we've decided to do is create two separate sets of skills for that players will have the freedom to interchange depending on whether they’re playing PvE or PvP. These PvP actions will be obtained through participation in PvP.

■Constantly Contradicting Elements■
Phew, I think that about does it. Thanks for sticking around to read all of that. By now I'm sure everyone who's read through both posts is a little more aware of certain MMORPG elements that are constantly contradicting themselves:
- It's great when solo play is easy, but if there's no community, the game can't thrive.
- If you make a game simple, it's easy to understand, but it can also be stale and unoriginal.
- If you make the game complex and action oriented, it can be exciting, but also convoluted.

Unfortunately, these three contradicting points are intertwined, so it's impossible to try and fix one issue without tampering with another. Nevertheless, a happy equilibrium between these three points must be met in order to make an enjoyable game. As we continue making adjustments and planning for the future, we are always mindful of our preferences for one idea over another, and we ask that you do the same, but don't worry about it too much. Leave the sleepless nights discussing designs and game mechanics to us (as well as the lag problems... We’ll working on those, I swear!)

Your feedback is vital to balancing the game, and I've read through the battle feedback threads thoroughly. Between the manual, the schedules, the developer's comments, and all the tester feedback in here, I realize there is a lot to read through, and I thank you all for taking the time to do it.

I can say with confidence that only FFXIV could receive so much feedback and support from around the world for a beta test that's only getting started.

* The Chocobo License costs 2000 GC seals
* ACN get a 400 potency heal called Physick. It is available to every class as well as WHM, BLM, SMN, and SCH. They still queue as dps though.
* When you explore and unveil part of a new map you get xp, when you finish an entire zone you get a decent xp bonus on top of the achievement
* If you fail a Duty, the next time you try it you are given a buff that increases your hp and damage output (which makes it too easy and is a little disappointing imo)
* They also added a feature that puts little green x's on items in your inventory to show if you can currently equip them or not.  Very helpful for second classes!

For those of you not experiencing these issues, there are plenty of great concrete examples of sluggish response such as a combat log where someone is healed for well over 16 hp and then takes a 16 hp hit and dies due to the lag between client side calculations and server side calculations even though the cure was in their battle log first.  There are a number of big bad red circle AoE's hitting people that are clearly out of them.  These issues extend into simple item/npc interaction and even falling damage.  These people are on NA/EU servers, and have good connections.  These issues seem critical and need to be addressed now before release. Do make your voice heard on the forums if you are or are not experiencing these issues.  If you aren't experiencing this, then your input is just as useful so that SE can figure out the cause.

Here's a list of things I've found. Discuss any others you've found too!

* Footsteps on different material - Very easy to test in somewhere like Limsa Lominsa where the material you're walking on can quickly change from grass to sand to stone to metal to wood to carpet. All are quite distinguishable.

* Environmental visual effects on appropriate attacks - I noticed this the first time I used the Marauder's Skull Sunder ability, which is a strong, downward vertical slash. I was standing in a grassy field and I noticed that leaves were being kicked up around me. I thought I'd test it on the sandy path that was nearby. Lo and behold, there were no leaves for that attack!

* Dynamic lighting - In areas with multiple lights, you cast multiple shadows. What happens when you move something closer to a light source? The shadow you make is larger too. This is exactly how FFXIV's lighting works. It's incredibly obvious in low-lying areas such as the Conjurer's Guild in Gridania where you can jump up and hit the lights - and your body will cast a much larger shadow than normal.

* Weather effects - Self explanatory. It's simple but it adds so much to the atmosphere of a living world.

* Music changing instruments depending on the time of day / current weather conditions - This just adds so much more onto the previous point. Sunny weather has happy, playful music. Raining weather is a bit more sombre, despite playing the same song. It adds SO much to the current mood of the zone.

* Location-sensitive SFX - If you have a weapon with a loud sheathe, this is incredibly obvious. When I walked into a stone building or cave that was relatively empty, sheathing and unsheathing my Greataxe resulted in an echoed sound in the area. The moment you're back in open area, the echo is no longer there and the sound effect produced feels much less cramped.

* Player-sensitive ambient noise - I didn't even realise this one until the last few moments of Phase 3. If there are a lot of other PLAYERS (read: Not necessarily NPCs) then you will have a lot of ambient voices  to give the feel of a lot of discussion in the area. If you move to a less crowded place, this will eventually die down.

&gt;For phase 4 we've implemented the quest objective symbol to sit on the zone line when your next objective is out of your current area. Please check it out soon and tell us what you think!

&gt;The design of the culinarian is somewhat different from that of other crafting classes, and the proper balance is still required for certain recipes and ingredients.

&gt;To strike a better balance with the other classes, however, we will continue to adjust and eliminate unnecessary ingredients as well as change the number of items yielded from recipes. Aspiring culinarians everywhere, please continue to provide your feedback as we enter Beta Test Phase 4! Bon appétit!

&gt;I'm afraid saving the setting (visor on/off) per gear set won't be possible, so be sure to toggle it on/off from the Character menu when changing to a different gear set.

&gt;While joining an instance after its started may make you lose some early dungeon monster exp or drops, you can still enjoy the remaining exp along the way, and after all, the best drops are at the end. While it's not ideal to join a dungeon in progress, there are still lots of benefits, especially saving time!

We've been busy wrapping up the mod applications and haven't had much time to reply to every offer, but I wanted to try to get something in return for those that help the subreddit. In this specific case, artwork &amp; design!

Our subreddit is still using the design from 1.0 and we're likely to overhaul it in the future. To get it started, we're looking for some artwork.

**Guidelines:**

* Should be original artwork you created for the subreddit.
* Related to FFXIV:ARR in some way.
* As high-resolution as possible (we can downsize if needed).
* Transparency (if any background) preferred.
* Submit it to us [via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fffxiv) (upload it to a file share or image host).

**Example submissions we're looking for:**

* Icons (upvote/downvote, sidebar buttons, etc)
* Sidebar image (~300px width)
* Top header banner (~1300px width)
* The words ""reddit"" or ""/r/ffxiv"" in a FFXIV:ARR style.
* Overall subreddit background (large resolution)
* Anything else (reddit themed FFXIV characters, etc)

A sample image for the subreddit would be the current reddit alien Moogle in the upper-left corner. If you're not sure what kind of theme to make it, [our white/black discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1ikg93/meta_subreddit_style_discussion_white_or_black/) is a good start.

If you're not too talented with artwork (like me), you're also welcome to attempt some CSS to style the subreddit. The best way to do this is to create your own subreddit and edit the CSS to how you feel this subreddit should look. Then submit the link to that subreddit to us.

You can take a look at /r/diablo3 how many custom images were used to make a stylesheet, although that does not necessarily mean it's how we'll end up styling /r/ffxiv.

I have spoken with the reddit admins and they offered to provide **[Reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/gold/about/)** for us to hand out. We will not simply be having a ""winner"" (you're all winners!) but for the submissions we end up using or find exemplary, we'll most likely hand out Reddit Gold to those people.

A preemptive {Thank you.} for all those that put effort into this.

You will all be able to see the results updated in real time, with some expanded statistics such as male vs female healers, and individual stats for the top four servers. Additionally, you as a community will be able to view each individual result, download and play w/ the spreadsheet if you'd like, and comment/help me police for bogus results.

This nonsense needs to stop. You can still feel pride and accomplishment in raising your character without it taking over a year to reach cap. 


Having a long quest/keying process in order to reach end game content and struggling to find people who are actually keyed does not make end game content challenging. 


Stream lining things does not make it easier, it makes it more accessible to those of us who started to lose the ability or patience to devout 4+ hours of play time in a single sitting. A lot of the mmo market has started to change their priorities, and we are looking for different things. As much as I loved FFXI, I would go batshit insane if I had to wait on a 30 minute boat again or sit in jueno shouting for a party for over an hour when I logged in at an odd time.



Yoshi-P seems to understands this. I hope you guys will too. Times are changing, and so are we.


**EDIT: Removed the 6 word quote about how the mmo market has grown up. It was poor wording and people went off on a tangent about age and adult responsibilities. Everyone no matter their ages has varying levels of responsibility. This is not what this thread was addressing or talking about. It was focused on tedious gameplay and needless time sinks. It doesn't matter how much free time you have, your time is precious.**

1372969907.0,63,self.ffxiv,1hnjdc,Warrior : Phase 3 - Lavi babbling again. (Things to look forward too),81,18,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hnjdc/warrior_phase_3_lavi_babbling_again_things_to/,"Hey guys it's Lavi again and today I want to cover the tanking paradigm of this game. I'm a big believer in the Holy Trinity, as long as it is done right, and I think SE hit the nail on the head with 2.0. I've played a few tanks in my MMO History, something about having a sword and a shield and saving people always gave me a good feeling. In FFXIV 1.0 I wasn't a big tank player though my first Ifrit win was done with me tanking : D. I can't say I was really excited to see what became of the good old Paladin and Warrior paradigm but as I started playing around with them both on my level 50 jobs I started to really get into them. So without anymore explanation I'd like to start with Warrior.

Note- I'm going to make this two posts, at the end of the Paladin post I will try to give you guys some general tanking tips and even give my thoughts/insight on how each of the tanks compare.

Things to get pumped about :

* **Defiance** : This is your first Warrior skill and right off the bat it lets you know that Warrior was designed to be a tanking class. It increases your HP by a straight 25% and drops your damage dealt by 35%. It also increases the enmity generated by each attack (This may be double like PLD, but I have no clue).  While the damage hit may seem a bit frightening, it isn't that bad and you get some good things out of it. First off the HP increase - This effects a good number of things like Stoneskin, Second Wind( w/ Conv too), Mercy Stroke and Thrill of Battle. Obviously all of these spells now heal/ protect you for more. The fact that it gives you an enmity boost too makes performing your level 50 Warrior combo a bit easier without having to worry about hate issues as well. Again don't sweat the 35% damage chunk - You get plenty of things to make up for it. One of the things is the fact that every time you use certain skills you gain one stack of defiance and each stack gives you 2% Critical chance. At 5 stacks you become ""Infuriated"". I'll touch base on that in a bit.

* **Heavy Swing &gt; Maim &gt; Storms Eye** : I really love how SE gave Warrior their two damage buffs/debuffs all in the same combo. Maim will give you a 10% Damage boost and Storm's Eye will lower the targets Slashing resist by 10% and even lower their healing done by healing spells by 50%. That latter part may be extremely important in later dungeons so don't forget about it! Another note is that this combo will give you **1 Stack of defiance.**

* **Butchers Block Combo** : Your best damaging combo is also combined with your best enmity generation combo. This is extremely ideal and I really think SE wanted to give Warriors a break with this. This combo also provides you with **2 stacks of defiance.**

* **Unchained/ Inner Beast / Steel Cyclone** : Each of these skills require you to be infuriated, have 5 stacks of defiance, and by using one of these you lose all of your stacks. Unchained is stupidly important to Warrior DPS imo, which helps with keeping hate in return. Pairing Berserk and Unchained together will give you 20 seconds of pure hard hitting damage. I can see this type of damage spike important in fights like Ifrit where taking out the Nail (Fetters) becomes very important. Inner Beast is another nice skill since it heals on a 1:1 ratio. On my warrior my Inner Beast was doing 230-280 damage regularly making this is a very nice healing effect. It is also good when Paired with Infernal Release  or Berserk to optimize the healing a bit. Steel Cyclone is definitely a shadow of its former self but that is a good thing. This is probably going to be best used in Boss fights or if you come across adds when you already have 5 Defiance stacks.

* **Infuriate** : This skill basically gives you 5 stacks of defiance. Now I can see this being used for a lot of things such as : Starting off the battle with unchained, Needing a strong AoE or needing a quick 250~ Heal. This skill gives you some choices and I think its probably best used in emergencies, but maybe that is just me.

* **Thrill of Battle / Mercy Stroke / Blood bath**: ToB is an excellent skill because not only is it an instant 20% Heal but it also boost your max hp by that much giving you some more wiggle room to survive strong attacks and it also *increases the potency of a WHM's stoneskin by 20%*. This is definitely an emergency skill and tell your whm when you use it! Mercy Stroke is a skill that is very potent to, as long as you can land the killing blow. A lot of bosses spawn adds and just a simple communication with a DD to leave one with a sliver of health will possibly result in you netting 20% of your health back (Which at level 50 this was like ~1k). Bloodbath is a skill that I feel is underrated. Overall the numbers do look pretty small but if you imagine them combined with Berserk/ Infernal Release/ Unchained for 20 seconds and 10 seconds unbuffed it actually starts to add up a bit. I'm pretty positive in a single Bloodbath you can get back 300-500 hp : D.

* **Overpower / Fracture** : These two for sure get notable mentions as Overpower is a pretty strong and spammble AoE that also nets you a good amount of hate. Fracture will also deal a pretty hefty sum of damage in a long fight and considering that DoT's don't seem to be effected by damage boosts I wonder if they aren't effected by damage reduction.

* **Brutal Swing :** Another note worthy mention  - a 5s second stun not on the GCD with a 30 second CD? Wow...

Underwhelming Abilities :

* **Storm's Path** : Maybe its just me but at 100 Potency I don't feel like this skill is going to heal for a whole lot. Maybe it would be more viable at like ... 180~200 Potency?

* **Vengeance** : Joking, this skill is amazing and works great as DoT when you are tanking, was just seeing if you were paying attention.

Some tips to go along with Warrior :

* I already mentioned this but - Communicate with your whm when you use ToB!

* There may be an interesting interaction with WHM/WAR since Warrior can heal themselves quite a bit and have a lot of HP I think they would make perfect candidates for stoneskin up keep. I'm thinking like - Let them take some damage, Stoneskin them, let them heal it up: Rinse and Repeat. This is just theory crafting but it sounds neat on paper right?

* Flash is cool and all but save it for when you need it, mana is precious to a brute warrior who can't understand magic.

* Don't use Inner beast when you are full health, having that 10% Critical hit chance is nice and no use in wasting your stacks if you don't get the full benefit.

* Fights get harder at the end, this is when Foresight/ ToB / Infuriate/  Blood Bath and Convolesnce(Sp) will play a good hand.

* Warrior Combo'ing is pretty simple just rotate in between Storm's Eye and Butcher Block combo's with a Fracture thrown in when its needed and using Inner Beast / Steel Cyclone when you are infuriated.

* To get stacks of Defiance on your TP skills you have to use them properly in the combo. Also Berserk/ Thrill of Battle and a few others buff gives you stacks ( I don't have a full list on hand but it tells you in the description =p)

Going to skip the overall review part since I'm going to cover it when I Cover PLD ( Ha you get it?!)

I’m here to talk to you about my experience in the latest beta, I am a keen role-player however, so I’ll be focusing on how immersive the game felt to me and less about actual mechanics

**Graphics**


*What it does well*

* The graphics in ARR are simply breath-taking, character models are some of the finest I’ve seen in an MMO and incredibly detailed, environments feel spectacular but don’t go over the top, there’s a fantasy feeling to them without feeling too out of this world, Eorzea has this fantastic quality where one minute I’m slaying monsters in a faraway land yet at the end of it all can chill out in the local tavern and speak of our adventures over an ale.

* There’s an attention to detail that should not be overlooked, shrubbery sways in the wind and leaves fall around your character, rain creates tiny ripples on the water’s surface, coming out a dark cave into the light makes the screen brighten and your retinas adjust, NPC’s that seem to have a purpose and a drive and many other small touches combined with the fantastic lighting engine in ARR and you have one of the most fantastic believable worlds I’ve seen in a long time.

*What needs work*

* Combat effects are fantastic but get a tad too much if too many people are involved, though SE have already said they’re going to tune this in the near future.

* My only real complaint currently is that the in game AA is incredibly poor, to the point I am not even sure if it’s working! As a result some areas look a lot worse than they should, vegetation suffers from this the most as trees and grass look awful with the amount of jaggies going on, I forced it in the end through NVCP but it had a knock on effect of text appearing slightly blurred, hopefully this is addressed in the near future


**Animations**

*What it does well*

* Overall the world is well animated, characters are full of expression thanks to not only a well fleshed out series of emotes but also a mood system that adds to their depth, in general animations are smooth and it’s clear an emphasise has been placed on making them feel responsive, this translates well into combat where you never feel tied down into actions, there’s a mild sliding issue when moving and using weaponskills, but I feel that the sacrifice is worthwhile for how fantastic they feel during combat, attacks feel weighty and playing mostly as a Lancer I felt my characters animations portrayed its weight and length well.

* Additionally the world is interactive and chairs and beds were all able to be sat and lied in which I believe is a small feature but pretty much essential for any game hoping to capture the RP crowd.

*What needs work*

* Currently the animations are in my view, what are stopping ARR from being a true great, whilst some of the animations are truly fantastic I feel that there’s some odd decisions from the developers that may prove to be ARR’s Achilles heel.

* Firstly, there’s no idle animations for your characters, you stand there motionless without even taking a glance around you to take in the sights, you don’t stretch or scratch your elbow, you’re incredibly static, now I know this may not seem like much, but compare it to the last of us, Joel strokes his stubble, shifts his backpacks shoulder straps, Ellie shifts the hair out of her eyes, it all adds to making your character feel believable, and when you combine this with the following it really makes your character feel dead.

* I mentioned above that ARR has this fantastic setting where I feel I could walk into a tavern and discuss my adventures with the locals, yet nobody will ever do this because there’s no motion when your character talks, Eorzea feels incredibly lifeless due to this in my eyes, characters don’t gesture or motion when they talk, and combining this with no speech bubbles makes towns feel lifeless, I’m in no way a WoW fan but they nailed this feeling, I lost count of the amount of times I’d join in conversations with strangers in that game around the towns and cities as I’d overhear them, and the subtle things such as ending a sentence with an exclamation mark changing the animation is fantastic, perhaps most importantly, it has become the standard that any aspiring MMO must now follow.

* There’s also the issue of mouse turning not actually turning your character, instead it feels like you’ve been placed on a large dish and someone if just spinning that around whilst you remain static, however using the arrow keys does provide a nice turning animation, currently it just looks incredibly cheap and I hope they animate the mouse turning as that’s what 90% of players actually use.

**Sound**


* I don’t even need ‘a what it does well and what needs work section’ here, because ARR nails the sound, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and adapts to the time of day it is, the songs are classic FF songs that I found myself humming even after a few short hours, but most importantly, they’re not just good songs, but songs that sum up the area brilliantly, it’s not only the soundtrack that is so beautiful, crowded areas play ambient voices depending on how many players are present really helping areas feel alive.

* Combat sounds fantastic and with the excellent combat animations really make you feel like you’re inflicting serious damage to your opponent even in the early levels.

* Footsteps in a cave echo and give that sense that you’re all alone in isolation and you’re more than happy to hear the reassuring sound of a Chocobo’s chirp as you manage to stumble back into town


**Conclusion**

People dismiss us RP’ers as being a small bunch who shouldn’t really have a game tailored for them, and to some extent I agree, but people greatly dismiss how much the feeling of a truly immersive world actually matters to a games success, if it all came down to combat, I’m fairly sure we’d all by playing Vindictus.

SE are on the brink of something special here, in some ways they’ve had flashes of brilliance, when it comes to the ambient sounds in busy areas, and the fantastic soundtrack that evolves with the time of day, but unless they implement some of the key features listed above such as chatting animations and bubbles and improved character animations when doing something as simple as turning, then Eorzea will be the most beautiful world that never let us love it.

Since Final Fantasy 11 to be exact. I am ready to dump A LOT of time into this new 2.0 version. They have done a GREAT job revamping it. The new director is doing a fantastic job, the graphics manage to look better even though they don't require a very strong system, unlike 1.0. The combat feels fun, and innovative. I love having to move around and dodge abilities that the mobs cast. They actually pose threats. My dungeon experiences have been through the roof. Aside from it being difficult to find a healer and a tank, I was actually hoping to wander inside and get wiped. I wanted the challenge. Copperbell Mines was fantastic in that aspect. The crafting, is unique. Equipping different armor that will eventually end up helping you manipulate the item you are crafting and actually being able to use abilities to help make the item instead of just going up to an NPC and saying ""i have the ingredients, craft it!"" *You obtain a high quality......"". I like being able to have an input in the HQ chances and being able to take the risk when deciding if your abilities will be able to finish the synthesis before the Durability hits 0. 

Although the fast leveling progression will take some time, i do like the fact that none of these quests are repeatable on one character which will end up forcing you to most likely party through lower levels in order to maintain chains, as well as Guildhests when available and FATE hunting. I really like the idea I have in my head where if i have a higher level class but my friends are just starting, i can lower my level and play a different class and level that up at the same time, and have it be beneficial to my character.
I have been in the beta for 3 character wipes, yet i keep coming back to level it all up and do it again.
My concern is endgame but i guess we will have to see what they have planned. I am sure it will be just as good as the rest of the game so i don't have a problem with that at all! :)

Anyway enough chit-chat, this game is amazing.

Tl;dr: I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME.

1373030748.0,65,self.ffxiv,1hotu0,First impressions up to level 6-ish. I can safely see why this game is sub based.,106,41,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hotu0/first_impressions_up_to_level_6ish_i_can_safely/,"The polish. The freaking, raw, undiluted amounts of POLISH this game has alone justifies the sub fee. It's obvious a ton of work has gone into making this game run smoothly yet look as good as the single player FF games.

But here's the funny thing; the only other FF game I've ever played was aaaages ago on the GBA remake of the first game, on an emulator. So this would be my first 'modern' FF game.

The game does a stellar job of melding the line between a personal story and multiplayer features without breaking up the gameplay or story (See WoW, GW2, TOR. They all succeed to an extent but overall the immersion of the story breaks up a little bit in all of them).

The controls are responsive, the graphics are incredible yet somehow don't make my rapidly aging hardware cry (I'm looking at you, Guild Wars 2. Everything looks like an N64 game on lowest yet it still runs at about 6fps in cities) and the soundtrack, oh man the soundtrack. It's far better than the single looped tracks in any other MMO I've played, the combat music especially and even the music changing from day and night. Did I mention the dark nights? I love 'em, WoW is still suffering from absurdly bright nights where everything just gets a slightly blue tint on it instead of being, well, NIGHT.

My only complaint is that it took quite some time before a quest introduced me to combat, granted I reckon this may be a byproduct of mimicking a single player RPG but I still somewhat wish the game had set me in combat earlier. Possibly with the RPG trope of granting me a full set of abilities to mess around with in that opening segment in a fight, giving me a brief idea of what I can expect in high level combat (See Xenoblade, Custom Robo DS, Lord of the Rings: The two towers on the PS2 and other games) to help hype me up for leveling. As is I seem to just be mashing one or two abilities over and over, then again, not much different from typical MMO's or RPG's, so I won't let that ruin my enjoyment and I'm sure it'll pick up later.

My other, rather less troublesome, fiddle with the game is that under the stellar graphics and top notch polish is a rather standard MMORPG. So far the game doesn't seem to bring much new to the table; see dude, get quest to kill X of Y/Gather X of Y, return to dude, repeat. The FATE's however break this up nicely and the overall presentation makes what would be considered generic kill quests much more enjoyable than they would be in WoW for example.

I haven't had a chance to try switching classes or anything yet, but it does sound pretty sweet. How often I have wanted to try out a new class but didn't have the character slots or time to roll an entirely new character, bugger that! Just stick a staff in my hand and let me hit a few things with it instead of a sword!


I would happily subscribe and buy this game on launch if I already had my allowance of cash being funneled into World of Warcraft. Say what you want about that game but I still love and enjoy it. But I'd be lying if I said XIV didn't tempt me, I'm unlikely to buy the game after the beta, but who knows? Maybe it'll go on sale and I'll dip into the 30-day trial, maybe pay for a month or two every so often. While I'd love it to go free to play, I can safely say that if you don't play WoW but don't mind paying a sub fee, you'll -definitely- be getting your Gil's worth here (See what I did thar?) and this is quite literally the first MMO besides WoW which I can look at and say ""This shouldn't be free to play.""

In case I don't post here again; I wish you all the best in the future of A Realm Reborn, and hope it's much better than the original version. (Which I never played but I heard had copy-pasted environments, absurdly long travel times and tedious grinding abound).

1375241844.0,60,self.ffxiv,1jecm6,New Beta Nvidia Driver 326.41 available for download as of today. Some people may see a small increase in their benchmark scores.,73,13,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1jecm6/new_beta_nvidia_driver_32641_available_for/,"I just updated my Nvidia driver to the 326.41 beta from the 320.49 WHQL driver and saw a slight increase in benchmark scores.  With the 320.49 driver, I was hovering around 7350 on max with a GTX 760 but with the beta driver, I got a score of 7789.  Overall, it's only an average fps increase of three to four, but an increase is an increase, right?

I'm curious to see how this beta driver affects other people's rigs.  Please post your results if you end up using the new beta driver!

For reference on my benchmark score of 7789, I'm running it on the maximum preset settings at 1920 x 1080 resolution.  For hardware, I'm using an i5-4670K @ 4.0GHz, GTX 760, and 16GB of RAM.

EDIT:  Also, for those using Nvidia drivers, don't forget to go into your Nvidia Control Panel and switch the power management mode from adaptive to ""prefer maximum performance"" to obtain an increase in frames.  For those using a single monitor, you can also change the ""Multi-display/mixed-GPU acceleration"" option right above the power management mode option from ""multiple display performance mode"" to ""single display performance mode"".  That should also increase your fps.

EDIT:  /u/rodgerdb did some snooping and found that the ""Multi-display/mixed-GPU acceleration"" option actually does not impact performance so the increase in score you guys are getting are likely just due to the power management mode change.

What this means is if you have 250 max HP or less, you are completely wasting hi-potions. I assume this trend continues with higher level potions. Just wanted to make everyone aware!

I've decided to write up some of the things I've learned about in Phase 3 for the benefit of the new players joining us in Phase 4 and release, and I opted to post them in our FC's subreddit's wiki. Since it's close by, I thought that everyone else might be interested in it as well, so I'll post the first one here and see what you guys think.

My goal is to provide information that's relevant for both new-to-MMO players as well as t3h h4rdc0r3z players, so whether you've never played an MMO in your life, or you've played literally every MMO, please take a look and correct what I've gotten wrong.

In this first installment, I'm covering ARR's equivalent of 'daily quests', because it's kind of confusing, it's very different, and it's super cool.

Take a look, see what you think, and let me know in the comments if I've gotten anything incorrect. I've already incorporated suggestions from our FC, but I'm looking forward to more information to incorporate into the guide, so if you have any suggestions I'm glad to hear them! I'm thinking of doing a similar guide for how jobs and classes work (from what we know already) so if there's a positive response from this one I'll post that here as well.

If it is a noteworthy mention back in the day when I was younger I used to main Bard in FFXI and I have always played a pretty mean support in other games (Except LoL), I also had an extreme love for ranged classes and in most games where there was a ranged DPS I liked, I played them (Like LoL). I also played Bard quite a bit in 1.0 and was a bit disappointed in it, needless to say come 2.0 I was ready to be extremely critical on the class. Well, I was awfully surprised and I can easily say that BRD/ARC is in my top 3 for classes I will play in 2.0.

In 1.0 BRD was basically a support that could deal some damage, but their damage was always significantly lower. In 2.0 the tables have turned and BRD has turned into a relatively strong DPS that has a little bit of support in them.

Anyways let's start with the good stuff:

* **Barrage** - I wanted to start with this one first because when I first saw the skill description I was like ""What place do auto-attacks have in a skill spammy game"" and it wasn't until I learned that AA's happen at set intervals regardless of what you are doing that I truly began to appreciate this skill. Basically even if you are shooting out skills like crazy you are still doing AA's even though it doesn't seem that way and Barrage triples your AA damage for 10 seconds (Roughly 2-3 hits) and that added damage is pretty amazing, especially when stacked with your buffs.

* **Raging Strikes / Increased Action damage** - Holy mother of straight up damage boosting potential! Combine these with Blood for Blood and if you can't see an Archers damage potential then you need new glasses! I know you get Raging Strikes relatively early but when you consider at level 40 that you get a 20% boost in action damage passively, this skill starts looking better and better. Raging Strikes, Like Barrage, should always be on cooldown.

* **Heavy Shot / Straight Shot** - This is why I absolutely love this game, its not that the battle system is extremely original but its how they make almost every skill in the game count. From level 2 all the way to level 50 This combo is your bread and butter with Heavy Shot being your primary used skill. Straight Shot is absolutely amazing as well, a 20s buff that gives you 10% Critical strike chance! Lancers and Dragoons alike will be trying to fire their lances like arrows to use this skill! I'm actually not really sure if Straight shot boosts your Critical hit rate by 10% or it takes the critical hit rate you already have and boosts that by 10% (Ask me if you didn't get that) but either way this skill makes Crit hit builds seem very viable.

* **Venomous Bite/ Wind Bite / Blood letter** - If I had a nickel every time I was like ""Wow DoTs in this game are really amazing"" I'd probably only have one nickel ( Maybe 2 if you consider that time when I lapsed into WoW for 20 levels on a warlock). VB and WB will probably compose a good portion of your damage and you are encouraged to use it because of the River of Blood passive and Bloodletter. Bloodletter is another amazing and good feeling skill that you will be using every time its up( Use an action first to get the GCD spinning so you don't waste any moments). On a side note - River of Blood doesn't feel like it activates all that often.

* **Rain of Death** - The effect on this skill is priceless and only becomes more valuable with the more party members you have. Not only does it make a fight go faster but it makes a mob(s) hit smaller. Meaning you are saving your WHM MP with this skill! the 200 TP cost on it can be rather brutal though : ( .

* **Misery's End** - I love these types of skills, Fights get harder towards the end... So why don't you hit harder? This skill will really spike your damage as a boss gets closer to death.


Ok Now the bad - 

* **Songs** - What , to me, are supposed to be your class defining skills end up becoming nothing more than punishing toggle abilities. All the songs Drain about 80~100 MP per tick and they never bestow their effect to the user. Ballad refreshed roughly 80 mp per tick and Paeon is roughly 40 TP per tick. Both Ballad and Paeon give you a 20% damage reduction while singing. All of them have a 20 yalm radius when most of your skills have a 25 yalm radius attached to them. Requiem seems like the best bet but considering that it only seems to effect BLM's (Who at this current state in Phase 3 Testing seem like the weakest of all the dps classes) makes it a bit of a turn off. You are essentially getting punished for doing what the name of your class implies. Want to give your whm back some mp ( because refresh on BLM is moot) ? Well here goes half your mp pool and a few seconds of dealing less damage. You see where I'm getting with this? Songs seem useless. Period. If anything there best use is when paired with Soul Voice and only for short durations. There is just nothing about them that would make any BRD want to use them in combat. I hope that SE sees how poorly designed the songs are and fixes them.


*If I could change anything to make Bard more like an iconic bard I would probably scrap the MP cost on the songs and extend their range to 25-30 yalms.*


Just in case some people are wondering about how me and my ls mate played our level 50 BRDS :

Essentially you wanna start every fight off with a raw Straight shot to get you that Critical hit rate and then fire off Bloodletter while the GCD is spinning. Next you want to apply both Poisonous Bite and Wind Bite. Then you just use Heavy shot unless you get a combo proc and then use Straight shot. Use Bloodletter/Blunt Shot / Flaming Arrow whenever they are up inbetween GCD skill casts, same goes for buffs ( Never use two buffs within the same GCD spin since it wastes time). Always look out for Bloodletter to come back and keep your DoT's on the boss when they are about to run out! Barrage/ Raging Strike/ Blood for blood/ Invigorate should almost always be on CD. Also feint is good skill to grab from the LNC tree for that extra slow. Barrage is used best with BFB or Raging strikes or both are active.


Overall I'm really happy about BRD. I like how they feel as a DD class and they definitely fit the role nicely but I'm just not to keen on where SE is taking their support aspect.

I feel this edit is in need since I have been a bit harsh on the songs, and I apologize.

* My use of the term ""useless"" may be exaggerated. Paeon is indeed useful and Ballad may have some small use somewhere. But I feel the songs are definitely lackluster and where as they should define the class as bard they really don't. In long fights you are maybe only restricted to about 1-2 minutes worth of song time and that will probably be towards the end when TP levels have all gone to nil.

* This isn't a hit on the support side of BRD, if anything this is informing people with the way things are. If you disagree with me and have actually used the songs and seen/felt their effects then we are entitled to opinions. But I personally feel that SE needs to do something to boost the effects of songs.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1372639772.0,,gridania,True,t3_1he0xk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1he0xk/bard_phase_3_things_you_should_know_and_look/,

1372025564.0,57,self.ffxiv,1gxjh0,Tanking Impressions in ARR: comparisons of the PLD/GLA and WAR/MRD playstyle,68,11,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gxjh0/tanking_impressions_in_arr_comparisons_of_the/,"Had a fantastic time in the beta. Really enjoyed the content and a lot of the new dungeon mechanics. Thought I'd give a rundown of my impressions on the two tanking classes available in ARR.


A bit about me: I am a Legacy player on Hyperion that has Lvl 50 PLD and WAR. Tanking is my preferred party role, and over the last beta test I was able to give both job/classes a spin to see how they each performed respectively. 


The primary difference between the two classes that I have felt thus far, both from doing lvl 15, 20, and 30 dungeon runs and going out on my own to tackle level 45-50 monsters, seems to be that WAR is a much more ""active"" tank than PLD is. 


I say that with a bit of resignation, because honestly I like the aesthetics of PLD better than that of WAR, and prefer to think of my character as a PLD first and foremost. However, I have thus far found the play-style of WAR much more attractive.


The reason I say that WAR is more active is that it has a much more diverse spread of combos that allow for a wider range of decision making in the midst of battle. The bulk of its abilities are on the same Global Cooldown, and choosing which path to take is very important. In addition, the layering of your skills causes for some very interesting effects when used in conjunction effectively, forcing you to really consider when and where you want to activate your abilities. 


For example: During a lvl 30 dungeon run (Brayflox's Longstop) as WAR, my teammates accidentally pulled several additional monsters while we were already engaged with a few. I had to quickly get enmity on all of them with a flash, and switch into using Overpower (frontal cone aoe) instead of my standard 3 skill single target combo (Heavy swing &gt; Skull sunder &gt; Chopping block) in order to establish hate. However, since I was now the center of attention for 8 monsters, our healer had to go into spam healing on me to keep me alive. Simultaneously, I used my Foresight (20% defense increase for 20 seconds), activated Bloodbath (convert 25% of skill damage to hp for 15 seconds), and activated Berserk (20 second 30% attack increase, unable to use weapon skills for 5 seconds after effect fades) . This let me hit 8 monsters at the same time for increased damage and heal back some hp for all 8 hits on every Overpower, locking hate on me and allowing my teammates to focus down the targets one at a time, while keeping myself alive from the healing on Overpower + Bloodbath. As soon as the first enemy was about to die, I hit Mercy Stroke (If delivered as the killing blow, up to 20% of your maximum HP will be restored) to heal a significant portion of my HP. Berserk wears off, but after healing has stabilized, and I switch back to my standard 3 skill enmity combo. 


The number of chains and combos for Maurauder only increases further as you level up and change to Warrior (Heavy Swing &gt; Maim &gt; Storm's Path for healing OR Storm's Eye for additional damage), in addition to adding a ""Wrath"" mechanic that stacks through the use of specific skills for additional critical hit rate, which will then allow you to use even more powerful skills in exchange for expending accumulated ""Wrath"".


As a PLD, you have pretty much only one skill rotation in battle: Fast Blade &gt; Savage Blade &gt; Rage of Halone. This is both your highest DPS chain and your highest Enmity generating chain. Fast Blade &gt; Riot Blade does grant you MP back, but is not used very often because of several reasons: 1. Less dps than Rage of Halone chain. 2. Unless you are spam curing yourself or using flash excessively, mp is not a huge priority. 3. The presence of a BRD in your party or Ethers in your inventory will significantly alleviate MP issues. 


Most of PLD's other skills are not on the Global Cooldown, but are basically activated passives. You turn them on when you feel the need to mitigate damage/increase defense/block more/heal more. They do not need to be worked into your rotation, and are enabled and left until they wear off. The PLD-specific abilities are two additional toggle on/off passives (shield and sword oath), cover (useful primary in situations when enmity spread is bad), and Spirits Within (An additional attack not on GDC that should be used every 30 seconds for additional dps, though could be saved for the 1 second silence effect?)


What this essentially boils down to is a class that is relatively passive, and uses the same combo chain regardless of situation. Their skills just do not seem to have the same synergy/adaptability that Warrior skills do. And there is no additional mechanic to keep track of in the higher levels (such as Wrath) or any drawbacks to consider on skills (such as Berserk). The depth is less than that of WAR, and while good for newer players, may become somewhat stagnant in the hands of experienced players. 


In addition, I personally feel that the spread of Global Cooldown (GDC) to non-GDC abilities is better for WAR than it is for PLD. For example: both classes/jobs get a Stun :Brutal Swing (WAR) vs Shield Bash (PLD) and a Damage over Time (DOT) skill: Fracture (WAR) vs Circle of Scorn (PLD). In the case of the stun, WAR's is not on GCD while PLD's is. In the case of the DOT, it is the opposite, with WAR's on GDC and PLD's not. 


DoTs are easy to work into a skill rotation, and is ideal to have on GDC. You use it once, and if the effect wears, simply fit it into the middle of two combo chains to refresh the effect. Circle of Scorn, while Area of Effect and costing no TP, has a recast longer than the effect duration, and really does not benefit well from not being on the GDC (since PLD has only one other Area of Effect move: Flash). Seeing as how PLD is already considered a ""Single target tank"", Circle of Scorn loses a lot of functionality in the very fights that PLDs are supposed to excel in. 


Stun, on the other hand, benefit most from NOT being on GDC. The WAR stun takes no TP to use, and is essentially something that is saved till you see a move that needs to be stunned. The PLD stun takes a hefty TP amount (150) and is on GDC, which means using it will interrupt your DPS chain combo, and cannot be used if you just used another skill. This makes the PLD stun both harder to time for moves that have narrow windows to stun AND unappealing to use from a damage output perspective. In addition, the benefit of being able to ""spam stun"" is heavily mitigated by the enemies' increasing resistance to stun over a short period of time and shield bash's high TP cost. 


All of the factors listed above contributes to a feeling of the WAR ""living in the now"", accessing the flow of battle constantly and adapting on the fly with changes to its combo chains and clever stacking of activated abilities, all while timing appropriate skills for maximum effect (Brutal Swing and Mercy Stroke). Whereas the PLD stays very static, using the same combo pretty much all of the time, and having relatively little synergy between its skills aside from activating them when you simply want to take less damage, and having no drawbacks to think of like in the case of Berserk. Couple this with the naturally higher Damage output from MRD, and PLD begins to look a bit lacking. 

I understand that the two classes are constructed differently, and therefore cater to different play-styles. But I do wish that PLD had at least some variety in its standard rotations other than only 3 skills. One of my favorite mechanics on PLD in 1.0 was how reactionary it was to the flow of battle. A well timed Aegis Boon did wonders. Forcing a Spirits Within from using Aegis Boon or Outmaneuver was great synergy. Stunning a target with Shield bash, quickly spinning behind it, and using a Rage of Halone for increased damage from behind was very satisfying. If PLD is supposed to be the ultimate single target tank, then there should be abilities that really boosts its performance when focused on one target. 

This is not to say that PLD will be ineffective compared to WAR or that WAR is OP or too good. However, WAR at this point is a much more engaging job to play in the tanking role. What I don't want people to think is that somehow PLD is inferior when it comes to tanking content compared to WAR. They both serve their role, however, it seems that WAR is simply more dynamic and engaging to play.


Anyhow, that's just my two cents on the matter. What does everyone else think?

TLDR version: PLD seems somewhat stagnant and lacking in variety/adaptability compared to the WAR playstyle. ",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1372110177.0,,limsa,True,t3_1gxjh0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gxjh0/tanking_impressions_in_arr_comparisons_of_the/,

1372717424.0,58,self.ffxiv,1hgfxw,Monk : Phase 3 - Things to look forward to and my thoughts!,82,24,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hgfxw/monk_phase_3_things_to_look_forward_to_and_my/,"Ok so today I thought I would cover Melee DPS, this is Lavi btw =P. Let me start by saying that growing up in an MMORPG world melee dps was never my forte or even my go to option. It actually wasn't until FFXIV 1.0 that I actually got into melee classes. If you can't tell yet I'm a really versatile player, I leveled everything up to 50 in 1.0 so I could be versatile not for some lame crown (Though its a nice bonus). I found that I really liked Melee DPS, Monk in particular - Something about Using Blindside Howling fist that just got my blood boiling... &gt;_&gt;. Well anyway come 2.0 I was ready to see the big changes that were supposed to be coming to Monk and over all I'm really pleased. Hopefully I won't say anything too controversial this time. =P.

Things to look forward too :

* **Bootshine** - Let's start with this skill, well because you start with it. SE's choice of skill design in 2.0 is more like ""Leave no skill behind"" and this skill isn't an exception. Even at level 50 I'm inclined to say that bootshine will be your strongest upfront DPS skill when you get your combo's rolling. The guaranteed critical hit in Opo-opo form is priceless and definitely outweighs the damage done by your other opo-opo form moves (Dragon Kick, Arm of the Destroyer). A good MNK will be using this skill from level 1 to level 50 and I can't tell you how much I love that design.

* **Dragon Kick / Twin Snakes** - I decided to mention these two skills together because they are both pretty core to a MNKs DPS abilities. Maintaining the Dragon Kick Debuff on heftier targets is pretty important when trying to increase your single target damage. Dragon Kick makes for a great opener on any mobs. One thing I couldn't really confirm, and not like it matters, is when killing trash mobs that you have to tank (Aka a side hit opener is not ideal) if DK would be a better start or just go with a 1-2-3 punch combo with Bootshine. I guess in the end that is such a small matter though. Anyway, Twin Snakes, not only does this skill hit from the flank pretty well it also gives you a pretty big damage increase (10%!) making this another important move in your first combo.

* **Greased Lightning** - How could I not mention this buff? Keeping three stacks of this buff is important and maybe even crucial to increasing your overall DPS(21% Damage and 15% AA speed and GCD reduction). It isn't that hard to maintain in a stand still fight since if you are combo'ing right you will always end up in couerl stance and every couerl stance move gives you the buff. I can see this buff hard to maintain in more active fights, but that will just make Monk all the more fun to play! 

* **Perfect Balance** - This buff has one core role in my opinion - Greased Lightning Stacks. Using this at the start of a fight and quickly using Demolish / Snap Punch / Snap Punch will net you the three GL stacks that you need to start pounding away at an enemy. It can also be used when you lose your GL stacks maybe from having to deal with boss interactions or from having to dodge for a long period of time.

* **Fist of Fire/Wind/Earth** - There isn't much to say about these. Obviously FoF will be your main go-to spell but considering Monks can use Provoke/Flash Earth doesn't seem like a bad option for off tanking and taking hits from primal astral skills. Fist of Wind also seems incredibly useful, if Ifritx is anything like it was in 1.0 I can see myself using FoW on him over FoF just to dodge stuff!

* **One Ilm Punch**  - I could be wrong, but I believe this is the only dispel in the game? Please correct me if I'm wrong. I haven't seen a lot of things that need to be dispelled but I'm sure this skill will play a major role later on. Definitely something to look forward too and be ready to use at all times.

* **Steel Peak** - At level 38 you finally get something comparable to leg sweep, Use this at important times and in between you and your parties DRG a lot of lives can be saved. I love the fact that it is off the GCD : ).

* **Enhanced Mantra** - This also is an important skill to have. When fights get tough the healing needed gets tougher, just one smart use of this ability can save your WHM the bit of mana that the need.


A few things I'm not to keen on :


* **Touch of Death** - Monk gets two DoT's spells that hit relatively hard (Though according to Valkky they aren't effected by damage increases). Demolish is one hitting for a total of 240 Potency and Touch of Death is the other hitting for a potency of 270. Touch of Death is probably the strongest ability that a Monk has in their arsenal but what could my problem be with it? To me it just feels disconnected. Monk thrives off of their Opo-Raptor-Couerl form rotation and their ability to keep Twin Snakes and GL III up and Touch of Death really finds no place anywhere in that rotation. Every skill serves some purpose and is connected but this one. I can definitely see a good use for this ability but I wish either A) It was connected to the combo chain or B) It was off the GCD. Honestly when you are running from the Flank to the back of the mob and trying to maintain everything this skill doesn't really have a place in the GCD and I feel like it goes to waste : (. 

* **Howling Fist** - This skill's animation is awesome! Its damage isn't to bad either and the hit radius is nice. I only have one ""Complaint"" - the 300 second CD. I just don't understand why, I could understand a minute but why 300 seconds? Maybe to compare to DRG's Dragonfire Dive?


Somethings I learned by tinkering with my level 50 Monk:

* Always know how to take advantage of your skills positioning bonus'! And always do it!
* When fighting big Mobs (Like Cancer) don't run a full circle around them, cheat by running under them a bit to get from the flank to the back.
* From my findings the best single target Damage rotation is something like: **Dragon Kick (Flank) &gt; Twin Snakes (Flank) &gt; Demolish &gt; Bootshine ( Back ) &gt; True Strike ( Back ) &gt; Snap Punch (Flank ) &gt; Dragon Kick (Flank)** and repeat from there changing out Snap Punch for Demolish when the DoT needs to be refreshed. Use Blood for Blood when you are on the bootshine part of the combo and Infernal Release before you use True Strike for best results (Imo).
* Adapt your combo, hold priority over GL III and Twin Snakes buffs.
* AoE'ing is easy, just position yourself in front of the mobs( or so that they are all in front of you) and target one then : Arm &gt; Twin Snakes &gt; Rock Breaker. But it also drains your TP pretty fast.
* Set **Invigorate and use it the moment you get below 700 TP!** The more you can use it the less TP problems you will have later.




My Overall thoughts:

Its true that in this game you can probably close your eyes and mash the 1-2-3 buttons and be effective to some extent but if you truly want to meet your potential mastering Monk can take some time but really be fun. I've spent the most time on PBE using my PUG/MNK and I have had a blast. Not only do you have to be aware of your buff timers, what stance you are in, where you in relation the mob but you also have to worry about dodging special attacks ect. SE Did an amazing job redesigning the Monk class and I'm excited about whats to come for it in the future!


I hope this helped people or got them thinking!

Dragoon next!

&gt;The pre-order codes that are being distributed for North America and Europe include instructions that they will be redeemed via a special website:

&gt;NA: http://preorder.na.finalfantasyxiv.com

&gt;EU: http://preorder.eu.finalfantasyxiv.com

&gt;
&gt;This special site is not yet live for users to redeem the codes received from their retailer.

&gt;Once the code redemption for this site is live, scheduled for August 20, 2013, you will be able to enter the code you received that looks like: ABCDEF-###-ABCDEF-###

We are both veteran FFXI players and the other day we were talking about the kind of linkshell/Free company we would want to join or start.

When we were playing FFXI one of things that we enjoyed most was helping both the people we knew and total strangers (who would then become people we knew). In this way we built a linkshell full of ""Pay it forwarders"" and had a great time for nearly 8 years.

I have made this thread to see if anyone in this subreddit is of the same mind as us and would like to selflessly make it their FFXIV mission statement to help as many other players as possible (while of course also progressing on your own character and helping others in the linkshell to do the same).

I am looking to build a true community so if enough people find this sort of activity enjoyable, perhaps we can all play together and maybe even build a reputation on one of the servers as a linkshell or free company that is ready and willing to assist.


***Update***

http://wardensofunity.enjin.com/home is the website I made for our group, we will primarily be using it for its forum and chat room features, so please sign up if wish. This is the best place for new info, by far. 

http://www.facebook.com/altruists.ffxiv is the facebook page, it will remain active for the foreseeable future. The website is better and more active though.

We will be playing on the Gilgamesh server during Phase 4/Official release. This is a NON-legacy server, so new characters for everyone. If SE decides later to allow Legacy players to migrate to other servers, we will welcome them into our group as well.

Players from any time zone are welcome.

We now have more than 210 members.

We currently have a premium Mumble server (your participation in which is not, and never will be, a condition of membership), with 9999 slots and top voice quality to enjoy for raids, free of charge.

There are a number of pictures in the gallery on the website for people to look at.

I purchased the Collectors edition with early access to make sure everything is ready for the people who want to play together, and I should have a free company set up and ready to go before the Official Release.

Overall we had a fun Beta Phase 3. We'll still be recruiting during the downtime between phases, just sign up on the website.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1376632460.0,,,True,t3_1d89mn,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1d89mn/looking_for_dogooders/,

1375691611.0,54,self.ffxiv,1jqaap,Guide to overclocking your video card and stress testing,74,20,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1jqaap/guide_to_overclocking_your_video_card_and_stress/,"Luna had a very good guide on optimizing your computer system and some general ideas on how to overlock your video card. The only thing that wasn't really gone into was how to get to the overclocking values there were supplied for Luna's video card - or if you have another card what you can use.

The first piece of software we are going to need is MSI Kombustor. You can download this for free from [**here**](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm). It comes paired with the MSI Afterburner as well, which we will be using later. Install both of them. 

I like to bring everything up so I can look at it all at once. You should have something like **[this](http://imgur.com/RUq3ZL2.jpg)** on your screen (you can ignore CPUZ in my screenshot, and I also hit the detach button on MSI afterburner so I can make the graphs easier to see). The graphs on Afterburner should be pretty self explanatory. 

The first thing you should do is run a stress test on MSI Kombustor - put **[these](http://imgur.com/IortHJQ.jpg)** settings on (set the resolution to whatever yours is). What we are going to be doing is running a stress test on your base settings to see how much room you have to work with in terms of the temperature your card runs at. I would turn this on and let it run for at least 15 minutes. That being said, don't just turn it on and leave it alone! Monitor your tempature, and makre sure it doesn't get too hot. Generally mid 70's to even mid 80's is an acceptable temp for todays desktop video cards - honestly you are probably even okay in the mid 90's but I personally wouldn't do that to my video card. I recommend looking up what your video card's safe operating ranges are, but those can be fairly hard to find sometime. I am not familiar with laptop video cards, so I really recommend looking up those temp ranges - my safe temps for desktop cards may or may not be valid on a mobile card.

After you figure out you how warm your card runs when being taxed, you can use the slider bars on the MSI Afterburner (Or other application, depending on your card, Nvidia Inspector or AMD Catalyst) to make small increments to your core clock or memory clock - and then stress test again to see what temps you hit, and then adjust accordingly. Make sure you hit apply after you make your changes - the bars are not a real time representation of what speeds you card is at. Also, set the power limit to 20%. All this does is allow your card to draw more power as you slowly increase the clock speeds (Which it will need!).

Another step you can take to get more out of your card is setting up a fan curve. Click the settings button **[here](http://imgur.com/FIkw7Tl)**. From there, go to the Fan tab, and check the boxes that say ""Enable user defined software automatic fan control"" and ""Force fan speed update on each period"".

You can manipulate how fast the GPU fan will run at what tempatures with this, so that as your card starts to get hotter it will amp up the fan speed. My curve looks something like [**this**](http://imgur.com/gEPjnVd), but you will need to experiment with your own setup to see what works best for you. You may have to enable manual fan control in your video card management tool - catalyst or nvidia inspector. In catalyst it's under performance &gt;&gt; AMD Overdrive.

I got fairly lucky as my card was extremely easy to overclock - I have a good case and play in a fairly cold room so I was able to turn everything to max. With a full gpu load for 45 minutes I max out at 77c. [**This**](http://imgur.com/U4H7mOE) is what my final settings look like.

Lastly, these are the changes to my benchmark scores from start to finish. Your mileage may vary based on how much you can push your card, as well as your starting values. 

**Stock Speeds:**

    Score:10205
    Average Framerate:88.645
    Performance:Extremely High
     -Easily capable of running the game on the highest settings.

As some of you may know, we've had some issues with downvotes in the subreddit; small brigades of people downvoting most/all comments.

A couple of months ago, reddit [released a new feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/) that may help tone down this issue. We've received feedback to use this system and we mods think it's a good idea to try it out. It's something a lot of other quality subreddits do (like /r/games).

So starting today, comment scores will be hidden for the first 2 hours of the comment. This should help reduce hivemind voting (especially downvote spirals) as you're voting based on your own opinion and not part of groupthink.

We'll be running this for a week and then after it ends, we will come back and ask for your feedback.

This past weekend, she had finally advanced enough to be able to do dungeon runs.  She had leveled a GLD while I, by complete surprise, found that I really enjoyed CNJ. Thus, we started our party with a tank and healer already in place.  Before firing up the duty finder, I explained to her in detail what Sastasha consisted of, what her role would be, how to do it, what loot was, etc. 

With a healer and tank in place, the duty finder matched us immediately. We'd been paired up with a couple of DDs (or DPS.  FFXI vet here).  I informed them that Mog Soup was on here first dungeon run and asked for patience.  It was clear this wasn't a problem.  As we went through the dungeon, we had very little trouble.  Hate was kept, heals were dealt, and mob faces were punched.  It was amazingly fun to have my tank in the same room as I.  I would keep her updated if someone grabbed hate and she would respond quickly and efficiently.  After about half way through the run, she had matters in hand.  The DDs had a great time doing their jobs without concern of getting hate.  

As we got to the final boss, and I explained how to check the grates to avoid adds, our new found teammates informed us that had we not told them that my fiance had never done a FFXIV dungeon before, they would have never known.

That is when I made it clear:  She hadn't done an MMO raid/dungeon run ever.  That was her initiation.  They we impressed, as was I.  That along with the Loot Gods dropping a piece of gear for each of the party made it an amazing run.  

The game features and the people we met have us hooked.  Two PS3 CE have been pre-ordered in full and we excitedly await our opportunity to play with you all.

First off, ARR lacks the sheer frustration of constant menu lag due to the lacking a hardware mouse cursor, and the general slowness of using any menu at all that you had when 1.0 was first released. But even past those more basic improvements, the whole experience of being a new player is dramatically improved.

You no longer have the ""Welcome to FFXIV! Now go grind Guildleves."" experience from 1.0. ARR actually feels like someone built a ""game"" into the world and not just a bunch of mob respawn points to grind on. Plus, the FATE system is a nice diversion from following through the usual quest chains.

I just find it amazing that they were able to turn around an MMO like this. Here's to hoping the game can be successful going forward.

At the close of 1.0 I was a little worried that they wouldn't be able to pull together such a large revamp of the game in a relatively short period of time, but ARR definitely exceeds my expectations.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1376672166.0,,gridania,True,t3_1khwsm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1khwsm/arr_is_a_pretty_impressive_step_up_from_10/,

First I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to read this post. I am officially announcing to Reddit that the **EDEN** free company will be recruiting casual/hardcore players for FFXIV on the **Gilgamesh** server with events starting around the times of 8/9PM EST.  This is a non-legacy server meaning this server is brand new and everyone will be starting out equally.

Our goal is not to race to the finish line and rack up server firsts, but instead focus on fun and community. Posted below I made a short video to announce EDEN's formation:
[Original Video Annoucement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_781342&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=rf7efN9nwBQ&amp;v=eHunyCu7DS0)


**Our rules are simple and easy, they are as follows:** 

* We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind based on *race*, *creed*, *gender*, or *sexual* orientation. 
* Members of **EDEN** should go out of their way to make others feel welcome.
* We will not tolerate trolling or disruptive behavior on the **Gilgamesh** server from our members to any *outside* players in other Linkshells and Free Companies.

**Our goals are as follows:**

* **Phase 4**

During Phase 4 the officer staff will be actively monitoring all recruits. Once we near the official release; (within a few days), we will announce who has proven themselves worthy of joining the company as a full member. Problem players will be removed immediately as needed. Simply follow the rules listed and you will be fine.

* **First Month**

We will continue to monitor the company, weeding out problem players as needed. We will also be taking note of potential recruits for our raid teams as well as promoting a few Officers.

*  **Second Month**

A stricter application process will be instituted at this time. By this point our first raid team should be assembled or close to. We will also have begun assembling a second raid team for players interested in a more casual experience.

* **Third Month**

By this time we should be raiding two to three times a week. Spots available on raids teams will first be offered to the veteran and more skilled members of the company. Keep in mind that if you earn a spot on a raid team you will not lose it unless you begin to show lack of concentration or commitment to showing up on time.
If you like what you have been reading or are at all interested; come on over to our forum and fill out an applications. Spots are filling up fast so be sure to knock it out!
Thanks everyone who made it through this long post and see you on **Gilgamesh**!

&gt;[NA]Regarding the Price Change of the Square Enix Security Token (Aug. 9)

&gt;We would like to take this opportunity to announce the price increase of the Square Enix Security Token as of Sep. 1, 2013.

&gt;Up until this point, we focused heavily on keeping the cost down despite increased production costs and the cost of implementing counter measures against security breaches. However, we came to a conclusion that it is no longer possible to maintain the existing price of the Square Enix Token.

&gt;Therefore, in order for us to sustain the security level that we have been offering, we will need to slightly increase the price of the Square Enix Security Token.

&gt;We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your understanding.

&gt;Please note that we also offer the Square Enix Software Token app for iOS and Android free of charge.

&gt;Please visit the following URL for more information on the Square Enix Security Token and the Square Enix Software Token app.

&gt;* Before: $9.99 / 980 Crysta

1373978604.0,49,self.ffxiv,1ierax,Enmity Tidbits &amp; Some Flash Testing,58,9,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1ierax/enmity_tidbits_some_flash_testing/,"These are mostly things I haven't seen around elsewhere that I was able to test and confirm. Nothing massively ground-breaking but again, not something I've seen out there. I'm also including PLD/GLA's enmity modifiers since the only thing I saw was for WAR (they're largely the same w/ the exception of no OP/ x4 mod).

&gt;**PLD/GLA Enmity Modifiers**

* **Savage Blade:** 3x DMG
* **Shield Lob:** 3x DMG
* **Rage of Halone:** 5x DMG


&gt;**Abilities**


* **Quelling Strikes:** -50% Enmity Generated
* **Elusive Jump:** -50% Current/Total Enmity (Elusive Jump will lower the enmity generated by Quelling Strikes @ -75%)


&gt;**Enmity Tidbits**


* First hit / aggro does not generate extra enmity. The misconception likely stems from people hitting the same enmity as the first attacker, but the mob doesn't turn. Which is normal, one needs an additional point of enmity to gain attention.

* Critical hits *do not* generate additional enmity besides their higher damage. 

&gt;I saw this a few times, it's pretty easy to test. Have somebody force several crits by going on a job w/ a broken weathered weapon. Use Internal Release &amp; Straight Shot on another mob, then attack one mob. Once the buffs wear, turn and let a low level job w/ broken weapon hit it until it turns. If their damage equals yours +1 when it turns, you can be also be sure crits don't generate hate. Keep in mind that activating abilities while engaged grants enmity and this can skew results. So be sure to activate internal release then use straight shot on a different mob to get a total of 30% buff on a non-MNK. Otherwise you risk skewing the results, which is where I think the belief started. I did the above test and it showed no difference.

* Missed attacks generate 0.5 points of Enmity.

* As a follow-up, Enmity is calculated in decimal value, but then floored. What this means is that two misses will equal a single point of enmity, while three misses (1.5E) will still equal 1 point of enmity unless there happens to be another action that garnered a 0.5E or greater.

* Damage from DOT ticks **are** affected by Shield Oath. I did not test Defiance, but one would assume it would also benefit.


&gt; **On Flash**

* I could not find any conclusive proof that Flash's blind proc gives additional enmity. I adjusted my stats vs another PLD's stats of the same level so that we had completely equal stats save for one point of STR off. We knew that at 289STR Flash's enmity ticked up (my 288 vs his 289 made the mob turn to him when he flashed after mine). So I took 287STR and he took 288 assuming the blind proc would push him over. I flashed first which landed a blind proc, he flashed second after waiting for blind to wear so it would proc. And hate did not shift. We tried again with both at 288STR, waiting and not waiting for blind to wear off. As it did not refresh itself and there was no notice of blind proc going off when blind was already on it. If another class/job gets less enmity from the same exact stats on Flash then perhaps the game simply isn't showing that the enmity from the additional effect (despite the Enfeeble not sticking or notifying in the log) is taking effect. Or that GLA somehow derives more enmity from Flash. 

* Additionally, Flash's Enmity from STR appears to be on a bell curve (or if you prefer Normal/Gaussian Distribution) at a particular point the Enmity garnered from STR is at a high point, and the further we move away from that, the less Enmity appears affected by STR. I did minimal testing with 5D and 10D weapons and plotted the enmity by changing STR 10pts up or down from 203 to 283, and the enmity value from STR ranged from a low of 0.2E per STR (from 213-223 Enmity changed from 151E @203STR to 153E @213STR).

Here are the values I was able to find with a bit of testing. I plan on going back and revisiting this when there's more time to try and determine exactly what's going on. But it looks a bit more complicated than the original formula gave it credit for. Either that or I'm incredibly terrible at math, which I will not rule out without sufficient testing to prove my assumptions are correct / sufficient peer review.


The values are as follows Weapon Damage/STR/DTR = Enmity (Enmity per STR since the last enmity value)

* 10/283/202 = 185E (0.2E/STR)
* 10/273/202 = 183E (0.2E/STR)
* 10/263/202 = 181E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/253/202 = 176E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/243/202 = 171E (0.8E/STR)
* 10/233/202 = 163E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/223/202 = 158E (0.5E/STR)
* 10/213/202 = 156E (0.2E/STR)
* 10/203/202 = 154E (0.2E/STR)


[This is what it looks like if you plot them based on the Enmity gained per point of Strength.](http://i.imgur.com/h3qff3K.jpg)


[This is what it looks like if you plot Strength and Enmity out](http://i.imgur.com/RAwlyMG.jpg)


As you can see the returns from STR widely vary, farthest from 233-243 range the return of Enmity per Strength is incredibly weak ~0.2E per point of Strength. The closer we get to the 233-243 range, the higher it gets going from 0.2E up to 0.5E then up to the peak of 0.8E per strength. Then it tapers down exactly as it had started.

I will confess it has been a very long time since I took statistics so perhaps somebody who has more recently taken a course or is more inclined to this sort of analysis can help shed some light on this.  


I would like to thank Malachi Chival of Aegis for helping me with all this testing. As it was a very long and arduous process of finding the right mobs and then breaking tools/weapons to be able to have a low enough damage that we could get enmity values. And then of course the average 3-5 minutes of watching a 2-3 damage pop up and slowly turn the mob around. Only to have a crit screw it up and obfuscate the actual value (knowing the Enmity lies between 135-137, but then hitting 134, and doing a 4dmg crit. Which means another reset/test. This happend **a lot**.) for anybody who might be interested, get a broken weathered gladius and a low lvl GLA to do testing with. We should have done that, because a gladius is 2s swing speed and is by far the fastest low level weapon.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1373979257.0,,gridania,True,t3_1ierax,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1ierax/enmity_tidbits_some_flash_testing/,

Rested XP seems to just be a percentage of a level that's relative to your current one. Rested XP that's 80% of a level on your 34 class will still only be 80% of a level to a level 1. While it would last a long time on your level 34, you can use up the whole bonus almost instantly on a lower level class. 

I decided to take up a new crafting skill and used up my bonus in 3 or 4 synths to ease that difficult transition from level one to level 2!

If you want to get the most out of your rested XP. Play your highest level classes only until it's all gone.

If any of you are considering playing on the Leviathan server (NA/new) upon or after launch, then please consider joining the Free Company Vanguard! We have milk and cookies.

Some more information:

---

**Vanguard is a newly established Free Company solely dedicated to bringing together like-minded players in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.**

You can check out our new guild page (still under development) at: http://vanguardfc.enjin.com/

*Server:* Tentatively Leviathan (New/NA), 
*Time Zone/Locale:* We welcome players from all around the world, 
*Classification:* End-Game/Casual or ""casual-core""

---

We are set out to be a tight-knit family of dedicated, friendly players from all walks of life. Our goal is focused on progression and end-game content, although the definitive difference between Vanguard and other Free Companies with the same aforementioned goal is that we keep our humanity in check every step of the way. What this means is that we focus our efforts on retaining members who are kind, helpful, and selfless while demonstrating a degree of skill and determination in regard to the game's content - we are not interested in elitists, those who habitually exploit our kindness, and others who derive a sense of entitlement from always being first or having the best gear.


It is inevitable that we will all individually move on with our lives to other games or other responsibilities after committing what will hopefully be many years to Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn... but in the end, the friendships forged within this Free Company will continue to flourish even when our gear and our in-game achievements have all but been left behind. This is the reality that we strive to always remember and call upon when making important decisions that drive Vanguard's recruitment and continual growth.

---

**The requirements to applying for membership into Vanguard are as follows:**

- Must be 18+ years old: many of our members are college graduates, young professionals, and those with families or other major responsibilities. While age should never be construed as an accurate indicator of maturity, we would generally like to avoid influencing or ostracizing those much younger than ourselves when discussing more mature topics ranging from careers to relationships.

- Must be friendly, sociable, and always willing to put the interests of other members before yourself: As mentioned in this recruitment post's introduction, we are looking to create a tight-knit group of like-minded players that share the same values and etiquette across all modes of social interaction.

- Must be willing to explore and push the end-game content of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (although it can be at your own pace), and it is preferable (but optional) if you command previous MMORPG experience/skill sets.

---

**Other Important Notes:**

- We will have weekly events and do things together from time to time that really have no purpose in terms of progression once we reach end-game content but do help build our sense of family: FATEs, item hunts, trivia, naked runs, and anything else fun that is possible in FFXIV: ARR. If you are the type of player that is always wanting to raid to stay ahead of the curve and that is all you want to do all the time, then this Free Company might not be the best fit for you. Vanguard will always strive to be ahead of the curve, but we won't sacrifice our sense of family in order to do so.

- Loot distribution will simply be on a one-person need-click basis, meaning that if a THM gets a great THM item but there are two THMs in a raid party, then the other THM gets the next great THM item by default on the next run. Anything that no one needs will be taken into the FC treasury to be sold so that we can make a nice home to house our members. We don't keep complex spreadsheets detailing raid participation, log time, or anything like that to determine any sort of advantage in loots or hierarchy, and we never will.

- Vanguard will be capped at a specific number of players at a later date to reflect our desire to incubate a tight-knit, family-oriented Free Company. We are not aiming to be the largest Free Company in all of Eorzea, but we are seeking to be the most exclusive in regard to retaining those who can effectively balance drive and personality in their game-play experience.

- Those who enjoy crafting on a high level, regardless if you are a Disciple of the Hand or Land, are all also welcome to apply. 

- Any Lalafell deemed too cute will be forced to become our Free Company Mascot.

If interested, please apply directly through our site link posted above, or just drop by to say hi. :)

Thanks!

- Seraph

Having just finished up the show on Gamebreaker TV and coming to read the forums, I see a lot of wonder to everyone as to why I seem to ""team up with the bad guys"" as some people make it seem. I understand that this is the internet, and making everyone happy is an impossibility. However, I'd like to clarify a few things about why I do what I do.

First off is Curse. People seem very upset that I have my YouTube partnership with Curse when their website, FFXIVCore, had some less than favorable antics (to say the least). I want to just outline what my partnership actually means and you can see these details @ www.unionforgamers.com. Curse in no way has any sort of creative control over me or gives me a schedule or anything like that. Being a part of their network allows me access to their resources, prevents a lot of gameplay videos from being flagged on YouTube, and helps me grow. Basically, it helps me make a better YouTube channel for those who enjoy it. I did get offers from other YouTube networks and simply put, this one by FAR had the best resources. TGN didn't even come close.

Second is my appearance on GameBreaker TV, who also had a FFXIV show that was cancelled at some point. From a business perspective, if you were doing something that was costing more to produce than you were bringing in, would you continue to do it? In terms of business shutting down the original show was likely the best move.

As for their demeanor towards people who defend 1.0, I digress. 1.0 had its positives worth defending for sure, such as the story and (at least after a few patches) solid gameplay that was really only hampered by a sluggish UI and bad MS. But overall in the MMO world, the game was definitely considered a flop and when portraying personal opinion that should be perfectly okay.

Now that those points are out of the way, one final note. I've always wanted to do SOMETHING in gaming to make a living. Anything at all. But I never had the drive or the talents in the right places to make it anywhere, until I discovered that I really like talking....a lot. And I like teaching people new things. So I started making a few YouTube videos going ""People like these, wouldn't it be cool if this led to me doing what I love? Probably won't but it'd be cool"". After about a month and a half ago though it started blowing up (at least in terms of my expectations. I'm no PewDiePie).

I want keep making good content and expanding outwards to reach other types of gamers and I am a gamer at heart. However, if I want to make a living doing this I need to make important decisions. Reaching out to new networks and opportunities is part of this process. I can't stop someone for disliking my decisions, but at least hopefully people can understand why I make the ones I make.

Thank you,
Mrhappy

Things that suck: character creation, if you don't have the knack for it, find it boring, or just can't figure out where the good options are.

Solution: share the appearance data for the characters you've been making for shits and giggles, for others to use or build on to create their own characters.

To share a character, post a screenshot. If anyone wants to use them, check which character creator save slot they are saved to, then head to My Games &gt; FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn (Benchmark), and upload the relevant FFXIV_CHARA_BENCH##.dat file.

To use someone else's appearance data, save the file to that same folder (renumbering if necessary), fire up the character creator, and then check 'Load appearance data' when you go to create a new character.

After four long weeks of tinkering and a bunch of late nights, I'd like to present the ARRstatus app for android.

The app enables folks to keep close tabs on the status of the FFXIV servers in a few ways by including:

- A refresh'able list of all the FFXIV servers and their statuses.
- A Ping utility that allows users to see the latency between their network and FFXIV servers.
- Individual homescreen widgets for each server that allows users to get the current status upon tapping.
- A push notification system that allows folks to be notified any time their chosen server changes status.

You can check out the app via the Google Play store here: [ARRstatus App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arrstatus.app1)

When those sweet sweet classes artworks were released by SE, I thought: ""Hey, I really need to make those into wallpapers."" When I woke up this morning with the intention of making them, I noticed that [donoftheslum](http://www.reddit.com/user/donoftheslum) kinda [beat me to the punch](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1i7zt9/collection_of_1920x1080_wallpapers_made_from_the/) :P

Edit: Thanks Donoftheslum for linking here from your post. I appreciate it!

Well, no matter! I like Right aligned wallpapers. PLUS, I liked the textured background on those pictures, and I wanted to preserve that in mine. To make things a bit more official looking, I also added a modified ARR logo in there. More options for you redditors, never a bad thing.

If anyone wants any one of these in different sizes, let me know :)

Note: The chocobo one was not made by me. I just liked it so I included it in the album.

I find the idea of community events to be very exciting, and I think they really help the community feel like just that: a community.

I plan on trying to organize as many events as possible on Gilgamesh and already have various ideas. I thought I might ask you all what sort of events you'd like to see. Who would know better what sort of events they'd like to participate in than the community itself? 

I understand that events are generally based on content, much of what we haven't seen, but that's why you can tell me what *type* rather than being very specific. Maybe you've seen a community event in another MMO that you'd like to see here?

My vision is that we have enough types of events to where we can hold frequent events, such as every Saturday night (or every other). I imagine many of the events may hold rewards at the end, depending on the type of event. Of course, this is all up for discussion and change, as it is very early. That being said, this will be a process that might take awhile to get in full gear. I understand that for awhile, many people will probably be more interested in dev content rather than community content. This is simply to start a pool of ideas. As for ideas I already have:

* Races with specific checkpoints to alleviate insta-teleport wins.
* Group/FC bracket tournaments in the Colosseum. 
* Organized named mob FATE hunts
* Themed Marches (we've already seen some of these.)
* Dance parties. (They're fun get togethers where you can meet new people.)
* Scavenger hunts (Can also be information scavenger hunts from specific NPCs or people, an extension of races)
* Time Attack Dungeon runs monitored by a judge viewing a party streaming the dungeon
* Fashion shows after the vanity system is implemented. This is where crafting and dyes will shine!
* Personal/FC house event (Maybe along the same lines of fashion, except for interior of the personal/FC houses.)

What would you like to see? Do you have any suggestions to improve upon the current ideas?

Edit: Wow, while I wanted a large response from the community, I really did not expect so many comments when I woke back up! Thank you all for your suggestions, they will surely be put to use. That being said, someone said that a Gilgamesh subreddit should be made. I am very new to reddit... Is that something we should do?

I will be using a website to help organize schedule information once I get down how timing will work. I have had two people offer their help as far as that goes. I will also post the announcements to reddit, or the Gilgamesh subreddit if one is made. I hope word of mouth makes this go far!

Below is a translation from an Italian website about three different types of applications: communications tools, database tools, and premium services.


You said earlier that you plan a release of smartphone applications for A Realm Reborn. Can you tell us more about your programs about?

""Yes, we plan to deploy applications when they kick off the official service of the game. These applications are of three kinds: communication tools, database tools, and premium services for a fee.

Communication tools will allow you to control all kinds of detailed information about the player for both you and for friends, such as equipment, levels and free companies, etc.. Using this application you can exchange information with your mates, even when you are not connected to the game, and share e-mail about what kind of adventures you might encounter that evening, on the basis of the available data. The database tools are perfectly suited for the search for information about the items, quests, dungeons and monsters in the game. Provide a search function offline where you can search for the items you want and then find out which of these allow you to get those items, such as PNG and offer these missions, or if the item is a dungeon then dungeon in which you is the monster that has it, and so on.

Finally there are the premium services. The services offered by these applications will be expanded and updated, when the game will grow, and offer you the opportunity to participate in the game and perform certain tasks in the world ARR while you are not connected, say from school or work. Services include things like sell items at the market, buying items, transfer characters, etc.. We would like users to pay a small fee to be able to play when they are ahead of the game. ""

2.Depending on latency you can move or queue up another spell before you finish casting. start casting a spell then move around 90% full to test if it fires off, and adjust accordingly.

(Performance Tweaks),55,9,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/190bqi/optimizing_your_ffxiv_20_experience_performance/,"With the great scenarios that were included within the benchmark today, it provides us with a fantastic tool to gauge real world performance.

I just wanted to remind performance enthusiasts and players who don't want to sacrifice too much image quality for performance that there are subtle options that don't greatly affect the image quality too much  (or aren't that noticeable) but provide a phenomenal performance boost.

Sure it's nice to run stuff at maximum settings, but honestly there are graphical options in most games that aren't even noticeable when when lowered but provide a huge performance boost.  I personally hate any sort of slow down, even if I can run the game at max settings.

In my opinion, the options to generally look for when trying to optimize/tweak any game while maintaining image quality is Ambient Occlusion, Shadows, and Anti-Aliasing.

**With Maximum Graphics Presets @1080p I score 7039 using 1920x1080 resolution with an average of 58.3 fps**

- **Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)**

With SSAO set to Low, I score ~7500 with an average of 63.2 fps (8.5% performance increase)

With SSAO set Off I score ~7850 with an average of 66.8 fps. (14.6% performance increase)

**SSAO is a huge performance hog.**
 
*Reset back to maximum preset, now to test for shadows performance*

- **Shadows**

Check marked Use low-detail models on shadows (LOD)

Shadows Resolution set to Mid

Shadow Cascading set to Normal

Shadow Softening set to Low


I score ~7300 with an average of 60 fps (3% performance increase)

**Surprisingly, adjusting shadows from highest settings to mid don't really affect performance much.  In most other games they're usually a huge performance hog.  They seem to be well optimized in FFXIV 2.0**

*Reset back to maximum preset, now to test for anti-aliasing performance*

- **Anti-Aliasing**

With anti-aliasing off I score ~7204 with an average of 59.9fps (2.8% performance increase)

**The anti-aliasing in this game is not really adjustable and the description is vague, so I'm not quite sure what level it is set at but 2x would be my assumption considering the performance wasn't much better with it off**

*Reset back to maximum preset, now to test for other options*

- **Other options**

With Occlusion Culling, LOD, LOD Streaming all check marked, I score ~7759 with an average of 63.47 fps (8.9% performance increase)

**These options give a pretty fair performance increase.  It lowers the detail on distant objects to provide performance boost.  Everything around you is still of same quality**

*Now I will try with all of the aforementioned settings applied*

- **All tweak settings applied**

SSAO set to Off

Check marked Use low-detail models on shadows (LOD)

Shadows Resolution set to Mid

Shadow Cascading set to Normal

Shadow Softening set to Low

Anti-Aliasing set to Off

Occlusion Culling, LOD, LOD Streaming all check marked.


I score ~9724 with an average of 82.1fps (41% performance increase)

**As you can see this is a huge performance increase and in my opinion the image isn't sacrificed too much.**

*If worse comes to worst and these tweaks still don't help you enough, the only thing left for you to really do is to lower the texture/environmental quality/anisotropic filtering which would quite obviously take away from the image quality.  Another option is to lower the resolution (hurts image quality a lot but helps performance a ton).  Lowering from 1920x1080 to 1280x720 on Maximum preset yielded me a score of 10592 with an average of 96 fps (65% performance increase).*

Hopefully this post helps anyone who is looking to optimize their performance.  I went through this benchmark a ton just to see how much of a performance cost some of these options were.  For me personally, I can run the game quite well with my system at max settings, so I will probably just lower the SSAO and possibly turn on some of those extra options such as Occlusion Culling and LOD.  It should give me a very solid 17~18% increase in performance.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1361518936.0,,,True,t3_190bqi,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/190bqi/optimizing_your_ffxiv_20_experience_performance/,

## Terminology

I use an Xbox controller. The buttons are different to that of a Sony PS controller.

MS Xbox|Sony PS
:--:|:--:
Back|Select
Start|Start
A|X (Cross)
X|□ (Square)
Y|△ (Triangle)
B|○ (Circle)
LB (Left Bumper)|L1
LT (Left Trigger)|L2
RB|R1
RT|R2
L3 (Push in L-Stick)|L3
R3 (Push in R-Stick)|R3

This article will refer to the Xbox controller only.

In addition, the hotbar where your skills are placed have been changed to a cross bar. It's basically 4 skills placed in a plus sign for the D-Pad and the AXYB/X□△○ for both the Left Trigger and the Right Trigger (Total of 16 skills available on screen at a time, which can be further enhanced.) Basically, when you read ""crossbar"" I mean the controller's version of ""hotbar"".

## Intro

Using the controller in this game is ridiculously fun. It's a refreshing change from using the keyboard in most typical mmo's. As a quick highlight, some of the best things you can do with the controller intuitively and easily:

* Hand in quests. No longer do you use your mouse to drag or right click or double click for each item you need to turn in. On a controller it's as easy as hitting A three times. Done.
* Locking on targets. I don't know if there's a keybind or what for the keyboard players, but positioning yourself with lock targeting on the controller is effortless. Simple as A (get target), Push left stick (lock target), and then left stick forward/backwards will move you like the keyboard W and S and the left/right will *circle* you around the target. It's a joke, really.
* Jumping around. If you like to take shortcuts, e.g. by jumping rocks in an L-shape, it's much easier on a legacy-mode controller in my opinion because your jump speed is of two variables basically (fast and slow). The mouse/keyboard will lock you into a strafe mode which makes this slightly more restrictive.
* Targeting. Both a positive and serious negative on the controller. On the positive if you don't like having to move your mouse over to click a person, on the controller you can target something by facing it and hitting A. Done. It's like the F/Interact key in Guild Wars 2. So addicting. So easy.
* If you haven't seen the pattern yet, a lot of things are easier on the controller cuz you have a magic A key. It interacts, it progresses stories, it hands in items, and it even starts auto-attacking creatures. A, A, A, A, A. Welcome to simplicity.

A minor convenience/inconvenience is that in ""direct chat"" mode typing any keys will go directly to the chat box. Personally I like that I can skip hitting ""enter"" to begin typing. But at times I'm annoyed that I can't hit the corresponding key for inventory or character sheet. I've overcome that annoyance by learning what all the icons in the bottom right corner mean or by using the controller to open it up. [You can also disable it entirely!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1i130m/a_beginners_guide_to_using_the_controller_for_ff/cazxgom)

### Negatives :(

Obviously there are some things that are sadly annoying with the controller.

* Targeting.

That's basically all I've got so far. During FATEs or in crowded areas targeting can be a real bi*** early on. I think it's gotten easier as I've learned it's not my camera that chooses the target but the direction my character is facing with the left stick.

Beyond the targeting issues I find I can do things at the speed and with the convenience I'd prefer to. Using the skills I need during a tough time is no biggie. Especially with the global cooldown in this game giving you time to think and react to your next move, the controller is very much do-able. And for me, targeting is not a big enough con to let go of this thing.

I can go over some basic fixes for targeting later in this article. My friend says she has found the ultimate targeting fixes and that she will never use the keyboard except for typing / making macros etc.

## Basics

### Legacy vs. Standard Type

This is found in System Menu &gt; Character Configuration &gt; Control Settings (Default Menu) &gt; General (Default Tab) &gt; Movement Settings. I think the description is misleading in game. It says standard type is character-based and that legacy type is camera based, but I think the standard type is more connected to your camera and the legacy type is more character oriented. I can see what they're saying, but if you're confused, here's the quick rundown:

#### Legacy type (Default?)

* Left stick moves your character *forward* in whichever direction you choose
* Right stick moves your camera

#### Standard

* Left stick moves your character like a normal QWES keyboard would in relation to the camera
* Right stick moves your camera

#### Quick comparison

##### Legacy Pros

* The legacy option always moves your character at fullspeed (Means you can run away faster, can jump better in multiple directions, etc)
* The right stick let's you see your face

##### Legacy Cons

* The camera is slow to turn in the direction your left stick has chosen to move the character (This can be remedied by using first person mode, or not being lazy and using the right stick to move the camera, or learning to be patient)
* Thus, auto-running is not as easy as it is on Standard

##### Standard Pros

* Familiar to keyboard users
* Easier to auto-run

##### Standard Cons

* When navigating a fight, it is not as simple. The right stick has to be utilized a lot more in this mode.
* You cannot seem to see yourself from any angle but behind. Either the left stick walks backwards or the right stick constantly moves the character.

#### Winner?

In my opinion the Legacy mode is miles better than standard. However, if you can't seem to get a hang of it, you may want to try the standard mode. Just feels very limiting for the small gains you receive.

### Crossbar vs. Hotbar

If you read the intro you know this is basically the controller's representation of the hotbar of skills/actions the keyboard 1-0,-,= does. Instead of adding more hotbars to your screen, the controller lets you toggle which ""Set"" of skills/actions you have in front of you. As I understand the game so far, Set switching will not be required for casual players. For hardcore players it is easily do-able via macros/quick reactions. And I don't mean you need super quick. Each set of the controller's crossbar comes with 16 empty slots. You can place whatever you want on those. You can even swap the ""quick set swap"" set with another 16. So you can have 32 skills available with a combination of tapping RB (Right Bumper) to swap between one set of 16 skills or the next and then pulling the LT or the RT to choose one of 8 within that 16. It may sound complicated in writing, but in practice it should take no longer than a few minutes to figure out and less than an hour to ""train"" this into muscle memory. I actually quite like the crossbar and have yet felt ""stress"" when having to switch Sets.

### Sticks and Buttons -- What's the controller do?!

It's actually quite easy. For the most part the left stick is your character (The WASD on the keyboard) and the right stick is the camera (Right click and drag on the mouse). Beyond that here's what I got:

#### Roaming in the open game world (AKA - not in a menu, not targeting anything)

Controller|Output/Result
:--:|:--:
D-Pad Left/Right | Targets items left and right of you (Enemies, if in battle)
D-Pad Up/Down | Targets party-members; If alone, then just yourself (Thanks to /u/bohemia &amp; /u/wubsieonline)
Back | Will target menus/windows on the screen (next table)
Start | Will target ""start""/system menu in the bottom right corner
A | Target what your character is facing (*)
X | Open Map/Close Map
Y | Jump
B | Nothing
LB | Nothing
LB (While moving with L) | Auto-Run (**)
LB + Right Stick Up/Down | Zoom in and out
LB + R3 | Use the mouse with the controller
RB | Swap crossbar to Set-8 (***)
RB (Hold) | Use the D-Pad or AXYB to swap to Sets 1 through 8
LT/RT | Activate the LT or RT Crossbar menus
LT+RT+Start | Take a screenshot!
L3 | Sit down (loll! Yay!)
R3 | First-Person Mode

Notes:

* * Targeting is interesting in this game. As a quick intro it prioritizes what is on your screen. (I believe it's Enemy &gt; NPC &gt; Other Players). After it's prioritization it tries to click the one closest to what you character is facing/standing. For instance if you're facing another player but there is an NPC on the screen it will target that first. You can offset this by hitting D-Pad Up/Down to target yourself (Party members) before hitting D-Pad Left/Right for players or by not having NPCs in sight when trying to click a player.
* ** Auto-running in legacy can be annoying at first. Refer to Legacy vs Standard to see how to offset it/learn it.
* *** It actually rotationally switches crossbars to any that are filled. Thanks to /u/idrumgood for the clarification!

#### Controller while targeting

The controller will soft target (circle with three breaks spinning in clockwise fashion) when hitting A or D-Pad Left/Up/Right/Down. It basically means you can engage/interact/hard-target what the circle is on or drop target with B/Esc. This table is for what the circle does

Controller|Output/Result
:--:|:--:
A (on NPC/Item) | Interact/Pick-Up
A (on other PC) | Lock
X (on NPC) | Nothing
X (on other PC) | Open menu for that player to Send Tell, Trade, Party, Friend, Examine, &amp; Follow
D-Pad Up/Down | Targets Party Members
D-Pad Left/Right | Targets others (*)

Notes:

* * If in battle, this should only target enemies. If roaming around this should target prioritized Enemies, NPCs, Players. If there is no Enemy on screen, it'll target the next NPC, if no NPCs on the screen, it'll target the next Player.

#### Controller for Menus

Use Back to cycle through menus/windows on the screen. Use the D Pad and A to figure out the rest ;)

Note: You can change the default chat by selecting that menu with Back, then hitting D-Pad Left to hover on the chat bubble icon. Clicking A and then selecting the channel with the D-Pad and A will default the chat to that channel.

## Conclusion

I have greatly enjoyed the controller in this game. I know that I haven't covered nearly enough in this guide, but it's getting long enough as is. What you have here is a healthy start to getting into the game. You'll have to learn the small things like using the right stick to move the Map or hitting RB to enter another zone on the map on your own.

If I could say one thing to try and convince you to play with a controller it'd be that it's easier. Plain and simple. I keep going back to the keyboard/mouse to see if it's better/worse and each time it's just more immersive/fun/easier to use the controller for me.

You'll just have to try it for yourself and see :)

I don't like the responsibility of holding everyone's lives in my hands, and I don't like being the target of blame when things go wrong. Most other games I've tried it in [TOR, GW2], it just hasn't really seemed... fun to me. 

FFXIV seems different to me, in that aspect. It might be partially because of the community, but I legitimately enjoyed playing a Conjuror during beta and hanging around outside of Duty, Honor, Country or the Ifrit fight and tossing out raises and cures for hours on end. When B4/Pre-release comes around, I'm definitely going to roll a Conjuror to start off, at least until level 10.

See you all back when the fun starts again!

&gt;We know a lot of you have been asking when the voices will be implemented, and we can finally say that voice overs will be added in phase 4! We can't wait for you guys to check them out and be sure to let us know what you think.

&gt;In Beta phase 4, it will be possible to control the first person camera while you /sit.

&gt;Mouse control mode: Left-mouse drag

&gt;Gamepad mode: While in virtual mouse mode, move the right stick while holding the LT/L2 buttons.

&gt;For the gamepad mode, the development team is also looking into whether they can make it so the camera can be controlled by only using the right stick, as there have been a lot of suggestions mentioning that this is more intuitive. 

[PS3 Materia Melding](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/74665-Windows-opening-off-screen-PS3?p=1064910#post1064910)

1372019654.0,43,self.ffxiv,1gxctr,So i tried out the Beta this weekend finally. If you played in 1.0 days and are on the fence definitely revisit the game.,53,10,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gxctr/so_i_tried_out_the_beta_this_weekend_finally_if/,"I bought 1.0 back in the day.  A friend of mine told me it was a great game and i would love it.  So i got the game; excited to finally play a FF MMO.  Suffice it to say it nearly ruined our friendship.  Bright side is through all of that i'm a legacy account now.  Some good came out of it i guess.

But i heard great things about ARR, mostly from this subreddit and from some friends who got into the beta the old fashioned way.  After a bit of reluctance i downloaded the client and decided to give it another try.

I just wanted to say the game is ALOT better.  It plays so much better and feels more interactive.  The world is so rich and engaging.  The quests no longer feel as grindy and the dungeons i feel are pretty awesome as far as time commitment is required.

A couple things i want to point out to people having reservations about coming back that i initially held in the back of my mind.


**Combat:**  During legacy days the combat felt clunky and unrefined.    That's not so much the case now.  Each class has it's own style of combat mechanics that you'll pick up on rather quickly and the UI is alot crisper.  The combat feels much more rewarding.  This is definitely one of the biggest improvements over the original.  And by improvements i mean completely different and awesome.


**Crafting:**  Crafting has been simplified.  It's no longer the red light, green light mini game it was before.  It's straightforward and easy to understand but still has more depth to it than other MMO's.  **EDIT: as /u/yodaum pointed out, it still has the volatility mechanic but it's more intuitive and the UI warns is much more clearer on what's going on.  either way, the crafting mechanic, is what i feel the original tried desperately to be.  It's alot more engaging than your standard one click craft you're use to in other MMO's**
Make use of the armory inventory to make gear sets for different professions.


**Leveling:**  The quests are more streamlined and direct.  There's a fair mix of Postal Service quests, Gather, and Kill quests but they never feel too much of each (with the exception of the initial quests at your starting city, when they have you explore the whole place.)  Leve system is roughly the same with ""allowances.""  Use them wisely as their XP rewards are great for their level.  You might find yourselves a bit shy for certain storyline quests here and there.  you can get extra gil for killing mobs in the hunters journal.  Do a few of those and you'll find yourself at the appropriate level.

**Game World:**  the environment is beautiful as you would expect from a FF.  All three starting areas are unique and worth exploring on there own.  Venture out a bit and you'll see the landscape was well designed, thought out, and has varied types of monsters to keep you entertained.  Movement, navigation, and basic UI is great and intuitive (though using the map initially is a bit tricky.)

**Dungeons:** So far i think are great.  the balance between requirements and rewards are solid with minimal time commitments.  They don't take too much time and are fun and challenging.  The first one is roughly tank and spank but after that you can expect varying levels of boss mechanics.  Hint -  If something has the word ""inconspicuous"" in its name it probably needs to die or be switched on.

With that said here are a few cons.

~~* Cut scenes can get a bit long after a while.  For a game that's not voice acted with this many cut scenes i feel is a bit annoying, but i would imagine this was realized at design due to consoles.  Not a big deal, not really a con.  But it does get annoying every now and then.~~

**Edit:  was just informed the main game is voice acted, in which case this point is completely moot and now belongs as a definite plus. Thanks /u/bnerd for the correction**

* Debuff indicator is a bit hard to see.  Kind of nitpicking here but it took me 4 deaths to realize i was dying to poison because i never saw the damn icon.  and by ""to realize"" i mean i spent 20 minutes googling how to kill the thing.

* A bit sparse on quests at a few places.  I think i'm just use to having a plethora of quests at my disposal vs having a very few well thought out quests. 

* Chat system could use some refinement.  I.e. being able to use keyboard shortcuts and better optimization.  **It got annoying to right click send tell to and then have to click in the chat box again.  The implication is if i want to send a tell the next things i type are going to be the message.**

**edit for bold, i generalized a bit too much in my opening line, my bad, but my main complaint was just some extra clicking involved, it's just inelegant design and an easy fix.  or you can mention alt-r, without bothering to read any of the other 25 comments who only mentioned that.**

That's all i can think of right now after playing non stop over the weekend.

It's a much better game and definitely worthy of a 2nd look if you were like me and decided to uninstall during the 1.0 days.
My complaints are mostly small and cosmetic, the game has been reworked and the issues that made the first game HORRIBLE are now some of its most satisfying and fun mechanics.  The new dev team really listened to the community and made a very fun and modern western MMO without losing it's Final Fantasy identity.  I'll be re subbing at ""launch"" without a doubt.  

Also, music is **fucking amazing.**

Why?,73,28,205,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1ii0s9/binary_mmo_attitudes_why/,"After seeing the post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1igvra/hate_towards_hardcore_players_free_companies/) that /u/Elvinelol made about hatred towards ""hardcore"" players by casuals, and many of the responses claiming that the opposite was true, it got me thinking about the way players of MMO's act. Why is it that the community seems to divide players into ""hardcore"" and ""casual,"" with no middle ground? 

If you don't have a progression guild behind you and you don't run a 4x4 raiding schedule and spend your time theorycrafting the class you play while making guides on MMOChampion and submitting your videos to YouTube, does that mean you must be a casual player?

If you like to PvP, and you spend a few hours a week grinding materials to craft gear and you work from home so you get to play longer stretches than many, does that mean you're exiled from the ""casual"" community and obviously have no life? [Insert comments about living in a mothers basement, cheetos, mountain dew, etc...]

Most of the time in real world political circles there's displayed a ""with us or against us"" mentality, and you see parties represented by the far extreme reaches of the ideology because the dialogue is so toxic, people have to ask for the moon in order to negotiate back down to asking for someone to pass the salt. Is this what we're doing in MMO's?

Is the landscape really this polarized, or do the majority of players, much like in real life, tend to drift toward the middle? I'm genuinely curious what everyone thinks. MMO's are often times a sample of the population, but a very select one that pays to belong, so it's not a true analog of society.

TL;DR - Is there more than just Hardcore and Casual segments of MMO's, or do we just create factions for no reason.

1366652812.0,44,self.ffxiv,1cvjbb,Just a story of my hope for this game.,60,16,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1cvjbb/just_a_story_of_my_hope_for_this_game/,"I'm not sure if I should put this in FFXI, here or gaming - but I just wanted to get my thoughts down on paper.. er... text? Yeah! Let's go with that.

This is just a wall of text of what ARR (or at least my hopes) mean to me and my life.

I started FFXI when I was 9 years old on the ps2 after reading about it in a magazine - it was the first time I was ever allowed or had the opportunity to play a game online. The idea of magic, swords and adventure was exciting. I didn't have any friends back then (Or really to this day, at least offline). After many painstaking hours of getting everything set up (typing in information on a controller wasn't the most practical of situations.) I finally got to making my character. I made a Tarutaru because I felt like I could relate to them. Smart and small. The little guys with big hearts. 

After that came picking a class. My brain danced with the possibilities. A thief? I didn't like the idea of stealing (I WAS 9!) - so I looked to the others. I wasn't a fan of using my fists, so monk was out. That left Warrior, White Mage, Black mage and Red mage. I loved the idea of one handed swords, but Warrior seemed bland. I could be a white mage and heal myself, or a Black mage and rain terror down on my enemy's with magic (maybe I was a little bit of an evil 9 year old).

After a long consideration - I went with Red Mage. Why choose just one when I could do them all?

After many hours of fumbling around, dieing a few times here and there. I managed to reach the dunes. 

It scared the crap out of me. Worse than Buburimu. After joining several parties, I kept getting yelled at for trying to melee and use my Black magic. Everyone just wanted me to heal. This continued on until I met another Taru. A White Mage named Shadowkiller (bad ass right?). He talked for a while and grouped up. He healed the group and let me do my thing - supporting my decisions even if they were a little silly.

This carried on through the rest of our time on FFXI. Trying to pull off the idea of a melee mage that could do it all. 

We explored this vast world together. 

The more we partied together, and explored. The more I realized - I finally had a friend.

It was this friend that, without knowing it got me through middle school, got me through moving to a new state. Got me through depression and - though I'd never admit it to him, the idea of ending my life.

FFXI was my childhood: Where my friends where, where my comfort was. A place where It didn't matter if I was picked on and beaten in real life - where I could protect my friends, defeat my enemy's and go anywhere in a vast world of magic and possibilities.

Though it came a time where I moved on from FFXI, I never forgot what I experienced in Vana'diel - but to this day I still talk to Shadowkiller.

When I heard of FFXIV being released I was excited to play, to go back to a world like that with Shadowkiller (he was the one that told me about it). Upon it's release it was.. frustrating to say the least. I couldn't feel immersed, and I also had my expectations set way beyond reachable measures.

I gave up on the game not long after I started.

Fast forward to ARR - I feel that hope being sparked up again. This time I've learned my lesson though.

All I hope for in this game, is a world to explore an experience with Shadowkiller, as well as my other friends. The ones I have met, and the ones I will meet.


Because when it's all said and done - after all the end game is devoured, and we have done all we cared to in ARR. We we always have one thing afterwards.

The friends and experiences we met and made in this world - and that is my only expectation and hope for ARR.

1. Gut them, losing the fish in the process, for a chance at a special bait.

http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/58626-MAKE-THE-GAME-HARDER-NOT-EASIER

It's essentially a hardcore vs. casual discussion that I'm sure most of us have seen covered elsewhere.  What's interesting (and a little annoying) to me is the use of the word ""grinding"".  It's become a buzzword.  A curse word people throw around about games off the cuff to show their distaste for one part or another of just about any new title.  I'm guilty.  My friends are guilty.  As recent as last night, my friends spoke about MMOs...

""Korean MMOs? Ugh, they're always so grindey.""
""JRPG?  Ew, no.  Just a massive grind.""

More concerning to me is that it is totally affecting game developers now.  I notice this more with American developers.  I think the jury's still out whether this is a good thing or not--- I don't mean to say it's necessarily a bad change, but it has my concerned.

With good reason.  What is grinding?

Most would say it's anything that requires a lot of repetition.  If that's the case, every game features something of a grind.  And not all games are bad by any means.  Which goes to show ""grinding"" isn't necessarily a bad thing at all!

But let me explain, before someone stones me.

It really does come down to a matter of personal opinion.  For me, I need a certain complexity and challenge in a game's battle system to enjoy it.  It also needs to be a social experience, and it needs to advance my character in someway--- I need a way of getting better, or at least get recognized for it.  If a system possesses those things and does them well, then for me personally, going through battle after battle (i.e. leveling) does not feel like a chore.

I believe this is true of any gamer.  The requirements might change from person to person, but certain games of activities you'll be willing to do over and over and over, and it won't feel like a grind.  Most of us who have played MMOs for any length of time have had that one game (perhaps the first MMO you played?) that did it best for us.

For me, XI was my first MMO and I played the heck out of that for 3 or 4 years.  And it was outstanding.  From the outside, it looks like a major grind--- even to me now, years later, it does.  But at the time, it was a great time that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Months to hit max level? Over a year to max crafting? A couple of years to obtain a relic weapon?  Social, challenging, complex, advancement.  It hit all of those things in symphony for me, and I loved it.  Except the relic weapon.  Screw that.

WoW was different, but still had the traits I wanted out of a game, just in a different way.  And I played that for years, too.

Since leaving WoW (due to the falling off of those specific requirements of mine for enjoying a game), I've tried a bunch of other MMOs.  None of them have come close to meeting my standard, which I feel is a pretty basic one.  Aion was fun, but destroyed their battle system with stats on endgame gear, and there was little to no advancement past a certain point.  Tera had a great combat system, with little to no social aspect or again, advancement.  GW2 was a little more social, but I felt the combat system was incredibly underwhelming and unrewarding.

It's common place to hear developers now talk about their coming games as ""not requiring a grind"", ""we don't want players to have to go out and kill the same things over and over again"", and ""we'll have tons of options for the player, you'll have so many choices of what to do in our game!""

When the reality seems to be that coming games will have a huge variety of (mediocre might be the word) things to keep us busy for a short amount of time, most or all of which leaving zero desire to repeat the performance.  It's a trade off.  It's definitely not a grind, 'cause I'm not doing it again.  And in the end, those games won't hold major interest very long.

Games that succeed and are memorable do a handful of things, but do them very, very well.  Repeat performances are demanded.  Not all will agree on what's enjoyable, and portions of the market will be lost, but these are the ones that stand up for a long time.  It's the difference between entertaining a million for a month or entertaining 20,000 for 10 years.

I'd argue in the end, everyone is better off with the latter.

FFXIV Reborn has a great chance.  If it can do the basics right, it'll succeed in something only a couple of games seem to ever have.  But that's a different conversation for another thread.  This one's about ""grinding"".

1371409735.0,45,self.ffxiv,1ggvdv,Thoughts after hitting level 30 last night...,54,9,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1ggvdv/thoughts_after_hitting_level_30_last_night/,"**Story Missions + Instances:** I rolled up the story missions and instances under one category because a great deal of the instances you will end up doing are a direct result of story missions send you there. While there is a solo aspect to the story arc, I'm mainly going to be discussing the group play.

Without spoiling too much for those that want to start the game fresh, FFXIV has you group up with 3 other individuals to progress through various aspects of the story. I found that often, you are forced to continue the story missions in order to keep leveling (quest hubs are disabled until certain story missions have been completed.) This could be perceived as a positive or negative thing but for me, I found it to be a positive because I felt the 4 man content was beautifully executed. Unlike most low level content in modern MMO's, simply ignoring the boss mechanics and healing through them is not an option and gone are the days of mindlessly pressing 1112223333 while browsing reddit on your 2nd monitor as tank and spank boss #34 dies.  You're quickly put into situations in which you have to think on your feet to dodge certain boss mechanics or even figure out how to kill certain bosses (DAT SLIME BOSS.) 

The last instance we managed to do was Haukke Manor and a notable step up in difficulty was noted. Typically my group and I were able to pull several packs of mobs and systematically AOE them down. This, however, was definitely not a possibility in Haukke Manor. We had to begin pulling solo groups of mobs and incorporating the use of extended CC and kiting mechanics to clear certain groups. Overall, the difficultly of the instances and bosses was pretty low (at least from my perspective) but I would liken the difficulty to WoW pre-raid level cap content ie heroics and definitely not the mindless zerg that is pre-level cap instances. However, what makes me so satisfied with this content is that they are introducing raiding mechanics so early! I really feel that the design team has a firm grip of interesting raiding mechanics and will be able to deliver challenging endgame content for us to sink our teeth into.

**FATE / Guildhest / Leve / Questing / General Pacing:** While leves, fates, and the standard questing systems are nothing new, the variation is absolutely refreshing. I always felt that there was something to look forward to or something new to experience throughout the leveling process. This is compounded by the fact that for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, a game has made exploration exciting. The game is drop dead gorgeous and really does its job making you feel like you want to take a few moments to appreciate the scenery. Although I'm not too sure about the previous betas as I haven't played the other phases, but getting to level 30 in two days was very easy to do despite having never played the game before. In general, I felt the levels were not scaled exponentially but more akin to the guild wars 2 system (each level takes approximately the same amount of time to get -- barring the early levels.)

The guildhests re awesome and well worth doing. Again, like the story missions these guildhests introduce raid level mechanics and teach you the ins and outs of end gaming raiding. The idea of teaching  the community about endgame is absolutely fantastic. I always felt that it was somewhat daunting to go from something you could literally faceroll ala GW2, WoW, Tera, Rift, etc... to something that penalizes you heavily if you make a mistake. I feel that guildhests will prepare all players to be able to tackle endgame with much more ease and more importantly, confidence. Better yet, they reward a metric !@#! ton of experience once completed and DEFINITELY part of the min/max for leveling. 

I feel that the best part of FFXIV leveling's scheme is the pacing. Whenever you feel you're getting bored of questing, you can hop into a FATE and when you're bored of fates, you're able to pick up leves which will demand that you do them in the most efficient manner to receive the highest bonus experience. All the while, you're able to take on well done story quests that send you to instances, encounter epic bosses, and become enthralled in the epic storyline. Did I forget to mention that there are class quests that reward new abilities and mission quests that reward you your own personal chocobo that acts as a mount and a COMBAT ready pet that can DPS, Heal, and Tank? 

**Combat:** I felt the combat was standard. However, I'm really excited about the potential. There is a very interesting stat that increases skill speed. What this actually does is lower the ability GCD. While at low levels, its nothing to be impressed by (2 skill speed is ~0.014 of the GCD) the level 50 gear *green vendor gear* has +19 on just ONE piece. This has the potential to turn the game's combat into something quite interesting. I cannot give an in-depth view because you simply cannot dictate the specifics of combat based on the lower levels of a MMO. I believe that the people complaining about the combat are really out of their depth. You only need to look at any MMO to note that the combat at max level and low level are not to be compared.

I wrote this all of this last night after finishing up for the night, so I'm sorry if some of it doesn't read well or doesn't make sense. Obviously it wasn't a comprehensive review, because I never thought that graphics / music / interface etc... is universal it all comes down to taste so I just left them out. Feel free to ask me anything about the leveling process or anything I left out.

- Please wait a little more for the details on how Arcanist works (perhaps revealed in the upcoming Niconico Live Event?)
- Event Bosses implemented in Phase 4
- SLI support implemented in Phase 4
- Male Miqotes (and other races?) will have unique motions when entering baths
- When leveling a second class, you will have bonus exp
- Addressed a bug where the cursor goes funny in some instances
- Adjustments to how (slow/fast) a Gatherer levels
- Adjustments (maybe) to the ease of making HQs from NQ materials in crafting
- An in-game event will be implemented right away after Launch (Bomb Event?)
- The dev team has designed endgame events to outright kill players
- (The Labyrinth of) Bahamut is so long, it pretty much requires players to 'save progress' as they proceed through the dungeon
- No plans to implement a 'your server only' option for the Duty Finder as for now


As per why he came to that decision for the last point, Yoshi-P made a long post about the Duty Finder in which he explains why, so wait till the offical translated response for that.

first, get your combat job (whether that be conjurer, gladiator, or one of the other, lesser jobs) - i chose lancer - to level 15 and do the story quests to get you airship access to the other cities.  

second, no matter what crafting job you enjoy, PICK UP BLACKSMITHING.  more tools and secondary tools are made by blacksmithing than by any other crafting profession.  9 control sounds like a great deal on a pair of boots that a leatherworker will make you, but it's nothing to the 30 craftsmanship that you can make with blacksmithing.

third:  if you're crafting, pick up weaver.  if you're gathering, pick up weaver.  as a crafter, before you even hit level 5 you can be rocking +20 control and +18 craftsmanship, and +25 craftsmanship at level 6.  that gear makes a huge difference.

fourth:  if you're gathering, pick up weaver.  the numbers are a little bit different, but the bonuses are just as valuable.  before you even do your level 5 guild quest, you can sit on 19 gathering, 13 perception from weaver alone. 

fifth:  leatherworker is no punk bitch either.  for crafters, you're looking at +12 control (compared to not having leatherworker gear at all) pre-10, and +11 after 10.  for gatherers, it's a 10 gathering, 9 perception difference at 1; or a 2 gathering, 8 perception, 12 GP difference at 5.  at 11 it's +3 gathering, +15 perception.  

sixth:  always, ALWAYS use your quality increasing skill.  even if you only get +4% HQ chance, you get a significant bonus xp modifier from the HQ chance.  this applies whether you get a HQ item or not.  i hadn't the time nor the intelligence to figure exact formulas, but it looks like about 5% bonus experience per %chance of high quality result - to a maximum.  when making maple lumber i was getting +226% experience for the craft at +14% hq chance.  getting a HQ result did not seem to award extra experience, but raising the HQ chance always did.

finally, IMO the gathering classes are the most tedious to level, even if it's kind of fun, so save your leve allowances for botanist and miner.

i made a small, crappy spreadsheet of the craftable leatherworker and weaver equipment that has crafting bonuses, that i will share if there is any interest.

i can't wait for the open beta/release!  

TL;DR:  blacksmith makes lots of tools and secondary tools; leatherworker and weaver make gathering and crafging gear; always go for as high a HQ chance as possible without failing synthesis.

edited to add two more things.  first [my tiny spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgksjrsWHORCdHBQbENxTWpoV09ZV3JqMUtWbm9DNUE#gid=0) of the craftable gear frmo leatherworking and weaving.  i didn't have enough time to add the tools from goldsmithing because i only thought of doing this with about an hour to spare in the beta last night.

second was the GP regen while gathering.  it seemed to me that GP regenerated at 5 points about every 10 seconds while not gathering, while successful gathers and more importantly, chains, restored them while gathering.

successfully gathering an item - any item, regardless of difficulty - restores 1 GP.
additionally, you get extra GP back based on the chain.  ex:  
chain 2 gives back 2 gp  
chain 3 gives back 3 gp  
chain 4 gives back 4 gp  
chain 5 gives back 5 gp  
so if you're lucky or farming crystals, you could regenerate GP faster by gathering than you could by standing around, just farming crystals.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1373214786.0,,,True,t3_1hsosy,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hsosy/some_things_that_i_learned_about_crafting_and/,

Some good points were made (including the fact that we're limited to 128 members in a LS and 512 in a FC, compare that to our 14k subreddit users) and so **we will not have a central LS/FC** but **we'll instead have a list of subreddit-sanctioned LS/FC's**. If you are a regular user of reddit/subreddit and you run (one of the leaders) a LS or FC, you can modmail us if you're looking to make it a sanctioned LS/FC. That LS/FC must be allowing new members and have some sort of involvement with reddit. We will add your LS/FC to a special list on the wiki that will promote those specific LS/FC's for the subreddit.

I've been hard at work on creating an embed feature for ARRstatus.com that will allow folks to display countdowns and individual server status on their own LS/FC/personal websites, and I think it's just about finished. Super big thanks to Luna Mana of http://erals.guildwork.com/ for letting me use their site for testing.

The embeds will automatically refresh just like the main page, and on my end I am feeding the embeds updated status once every minute.

I've created the embed so that they will work on several popular guild hosting websites. Here are some examples I threw together real quick that have the embeds on them:

- Guildlaunch - http://arrstatus.guildlaunch.com/
- Guildwork - http://arrstatus.guildwork.com/
- Enjin - http://arrstatus.enjin.com/home
- Shivtr - http://arrstatus.shivtr.com/
- Static page - http://arrstatus.com/embed_test.html

For sites that don't support embedding scripts using &lt;script&gt; tags (Guildwork and Shivtr), I've made an &lt;iframe&gt; version of the embeds.

You can get the embed code here:

**For those who own (or work with) a website, blog, social media account** or anything similar and submits it to this subreddit, **please read the following**. I've left excerpts to highlight the important bits.

What constitutes spam: ([link](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F))

The worst offenders are blogspam; an example being a site that is submitted to the subreddit where the linked page is nothing but a re-hosted video of an official FFXIV video from Youtube (the same applies to say copy-pastes of articles or write-ups, such as copied patch notes). These are instantly removed and if you see any, please report them.

Remember, **these are the rules of reddit.com** and not just this specific subreddit. Violating these rules can lead to getting shadowbanned by an admin (I am just a mod) and at that point, there is nothing we (mods) can do.

I made this post in the EDEN forums (http://edenfc.enjin.com/forum) and thought I'd share this with y'all. I have had a terrible time picking a race/class to main for FFXIV:ARR. In light of this past weekend's beta, I spent the entire weekend getting my LNC to 20 so I can have level 15s to test out. Please excuse the wall of text, and I hope you all find this helpful if you're on the fence about deciding on which classes to play. I will be breaking it down by the holy trinity of tank/dd/healer.

Note: These are my opinions and are for a group/dungeon perspective. I will not be going into the skill combos/rotations or strategy. Instead I'll just be summarizing my experiences with the classes through these entry level dungeons. I mostly ran Sastasha, Tam-tara Deepcroft and Copperbell Mines. I managed to squeeze in a few runs in Halatali on my LNC as well. At the end of the day, they're only ~level 15 so I didn't have ALL the abilities to play with, but I think the overall gist of each class is apparent.


Tanks: Really fun, very involving. It is very easy to differentiate a good tank from a bad tank especially when the group dynamic from duty finder is pretty much fixed. While there are posts out there that say the tanks don't have to worry about adds on trash mobs, it certainly makes it easier on the group and clear speed if you actually do tank up the trash well. Both GLD and MRD do this job very well. However, SE has made both classes unique in their tanking experience.

**Gladiator - GLA**: Tank in it's truest form with heavy armor and shield. The involvement associated with this class comes from managing mana and TP together to keep enmity at its highest. There are moves that help you get back some mana, but with the GLDs small mana pool, the challenge/fun comes from resource management (Flash is really mana intensive) so you can tank EVERYTHING at the same time. You don't do a lot of damage, but you don't take a lot either. As an analogy, GLD feels like a military personnel and requires his training to do his job properly. Each move is thought out.

**Marauder - MRD**: A different perspective to tanking. Straight up, you're just a brute. You get into their face and you start mauling. Enmity seems to be a little hard to maintain on packs if DPS is split, but that's where the fun/challenge of MRD comes in. There is not as much resource management required comparatively to the GLD, but my experience is limited. As an analogy, the MRD is essentially the big guy that comes in and tries to get as many people to fight him at once because he knows what he can do.

Summary: In the end, they're tanks. GLD requires more attention to yourself and resources i.e. mana/TP management. MRD requires more attention to the rest of the fight itself. The focus is different in either class, but the role is the same.


Damage dealers: I'll cover the 4 dps classes in beta currently: Archer, Lancer, Pugilist, Thaumaturge. All fun in their own respects, so let's get to it.

**Archer - ARC**: Exactly as the name suggests. You have a bow and you shoot arrows with it. Effective DD with not much movement requirements in dungeons. Future boss fights may have mechanics that require you to do so, but other than that, you keep your range, and fire away. Looking further into the BRD class, you end up getting songs which are buffs/debuffs so there's some depth to the class. For the most part, Archers are DD with some support skills. At the end of the day, the involvement comes from managing the buffs/debuffs and GCDs for your skills so you maintain optimal DPS.

**Lancer - LNC**: The class that I started with in beta. Have always wanted to play a dragoon in FFXI but never got close to it. Lancers are a different take on melee DDs, requiring constant repositioning and movement to maintain optimal DPS. The moves on the LNC require you to flank, or be behind the monster for extra damage potential. There are some nuances to the positioning when you're fighting physically smaller mobs as it may be harder to tell which way the enemy is facing. Looking into the DRG job, you end up getting skills with jumps, which is just plain cool. All in all, Lancers are high mobility melee DPS.

**Pugilist - PGL**: Pugilists are the other melee DD in the beta. They're super fun, and they pack a punch *snicker*. The mid-fight mobility requirement isn't as high as the Lancer, but the involvement from a pugilist comes from managing the stances for optimal damage output. You're punching and kicking the entire time, it's almost like a kung-fu movie without the cheesy dubs. The animations on the pugilist moves are pretty slick and fluid to be honest.

**Thaumaturge - THM**: Ever wanted to be a walking nuke? Look no further, Thaumaturges are the only spell-caster DD in the game thus far. Sit at max range and just be casting spells. Unlike mages in other games, the Astral Fire and Umbral Ice auras add a little twist into being a spellcaster. Fire spells do more damage, cost more mana, and reduces mana regen. Ice spells do less damage, cost less mana, but increases mana regen. Oh you also have a sleep spell which is great for CC and managing adds or large packs. As a THM, you're basically managing the auras and spell rotations for maximum damage output. If you're not casting something, you're slacking.

Summary: The damage dealer classes are all unique in their own way. The differences between each class come from the style of play, which hopefully I've summarized well. It pretty much boils down to what archetype of damage dealing do you identify with the best.



Healers: Only 1 class right now which is the Conjurer.

**Conjurer - CNJ**: There is currently only 1 healing class, the conjurer. Not sure what all I can say other than you are responsible for the lives of 3 other people in your party. You buff, you heal, and you cast the occasional damage spell. I've played healers in other MMOs, and have always enjoyed the role tremendously.

Summary: Do you really need one? Really?


There you have it. I hope this helps you in making your decision for your first main class in FFXIV:ARR. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, feel free to post!

I've outlined those below based on *your status* and *desired platform*. Please let me know if any of this information is inaccurate or unclear and I'll do my best to fix it!

----

### PC

## Legacy Subscribers
You're in this category if you *paid* for 90 days of sub time for 1.0. You should have received an email and can check your status by following [these instructions](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/45205-How-to-Check-for-Legacy).

**You Get:** Access to all phases of beta without even applying.

## FFXIV Owners / Non-Legacy Subscribers
You've bought FFXIV at some point and have registered it to your Square-Enix account. I don't think they're accepting new registrations any more, so you'll have to wait until ARR releases to register your game if you haven't.

**You Get:** Access to phases 3 and 4 without even applying. You can apply for a chance at phases 1 and 2. Your alpha application counts for beta.

## Other Fans
This is everyone else, including those who have FFXIV but never registered their copy.

**You Get:** Access to phase 4, which is open beta. Some will certainly be selected for beta access earlier, as was the case with alpha, so do apply!

----

### PS3

## Holders of a code from FFXIII
First-run copies of FFXIII for PS3 contained a code for priority access to the FFXIV beta. Since this is the first time the PS3 version will have a beta, it counts!

**You Get:** Priority access to the PS3 beta in phase 3 *if* you provide your code with your application.

## Everyone Else (Legacy, Non-Legacy, Whatever)
Everyone else has to submit an app for the PS3 beta. Doesn't matter what your status was.  
**You Get:** Nothing! Apply if you want to be in the PS3 beta.

&gt;By arranging and organizing, you should be able to make extremely customizable hot bars. 

&gt;Additionally, we will be adding a setting in Beta phase 4 for both the PS3 version and the Windows version so that when you are not pressing the L1/L2 and R1/R2 buttons the cross hot bar will be hidden.

edit 1 for further clarification: 

""I thought the full game key could already be found in the games -&gt; others tab. I registered the code to the SE members site."" 

A lot of people were confused with this too. You can ""register"" your code  at http://eu.square-enix.com/en but this IS NOT registering the game. The website previously stated is actually like a facebook kinda thing and by registering your code there, all your doing is basically saying ""Hey guys I own FFXIV"". THe real website that you would register the code in is https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/login?cont=account. Under the services tab it states that code registration is unavailable. http://entry.ffxiv.com/beta/eu. Register here in order to get an email about when the registration is available. (Change the EU in the links to NA for NA region) 

TLDR;
Code you got from GMG is early access code. If you think you already registered the game; you didn't. Product keys will be sent at the release of the game. (27th August)

Timeline: (My prediction )
During the period of phase 4 into Early access. People will be able to enter their early access codes giving them early access to FFXIV ARR. (As a lot of people will probably pre-order after phase 4)

At the end of Early Access OR during- We will receive another email from our distributors with the product key giving us access to the launch of FFXIV ARR with 1 month subscription.

DoW  
- ARC to lv 4, 10% crit no cooldown and a 20% dmg CD...yes please  
- PGL to lv 12, 15% self heal CD, 20% crit CD, 15% evasion CD, good CDs that can be used situationally for optimal results
- CNJ to lv 8 or 12, cure, protect and raise, all good, primarily solo or if needed to raise at some point.


some others are good, bloodbath on MRD is ok but i imagine Second wind to be better since its more consistant, but it does have a longer CD but bloodbath it is highly dependent on how much dmg you can do in a short amount of time.  LNC Impulse drive has high potency when attacking from behind but i dont know if it would outshine standard class abilities and a CD slot from a shared ability.  

Im also not sure how well 20% defense (MRD lv 2) and 20% Parry (LNC lv 4) scale, but for leveling purposes i always lean towards a more offensive approach.

DoM
- CNJ to 12.  pretty much same as above.  

its still unknown what Arcanist will bring to the table but DoM is a little lacking currently but its bias to DoW because of sheer numbers.  

I know personally, i am gonna do CNJ to 12 first, ARC to 4 and then level PGL as my main, but the synergy these classes bring at such an early level make them very strong in my mind.  I understand you cant equip all of them, but situationally, they can be swapped.

(For the skeptical returnees and newcomers),52,12,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/16rb8a/why_ffxivarr_will_be_amazing_its_one_of_the_most/,"Quick background.  I'm an ooooooold FFXI player (launch to present), I played WoW for a short time (got bored with MMOonRails), have played a number of other Grindfests (looking at you MapleStory), and have kept a solid eye on other MMO's (despite them not interesting me, I would at least learn what they had to offer).  


I played FFXIV 1.x on and off for about 8-9 months (starting at launch, ending mid-last year).  Suffice to say, I enjoyed the game, but eventually 2 things killed it for me, and one of them drove me absolutely insane.

* The game was not fun/enjoyable/practical/anything else you can think of to interact with.  Known gripe.
* They reimplemented what made FFXI so immersive, but so inaccessible: ""Here's a thing, figure it out"".


The second bullet makes me want to punt flaming kittens into the nutsack of whoever decided to be fucking lazy.  One can argue the values of a system that doesn't feed you all the information you think you ~~need~~ deserve up front (I am a long-term FFXI player, before you forget), but that's not what I'm talking about.  I shouldn't have to rely on wiki's for *basic functions of the game*.


Now before we start arguing about ""All that has changed, blah blah jumping blah blah mouse!"", that's not the point of this thread. Every 3-4 months i would log back in to FFXIV, and check out the changes.  Every time I logged in, I was floored because:

* I enjoyed the experience and interactions more than the previous time I returned and, 
* I felt overwhelmed as a returning player by the number of things I **couldn't find information on**. 


In comes ARR Alpha.  At the start, I was still skeptical.  Very very skeptical.  I was aware of how much feedback SE was considering, and the number of changes they were really trying to work, but from what I had seen, the game was just going to be FFXI HD: Ra/Ex Grindfest &amp; WikiReading Expansion XVIII.


When they finally started releasing videos of gameplay, and more and more people started breaking their ~~NDAs~~ Gag Orders, there wasn't a SINGLE thing I could see that made me say ""Oh look more of the same"".  Every aspect of gameplay I saw/heard about looked/sounded polished, and every gripe I had about lack of information was dissappearing before my eyes (I'm looking at you, crafting &amp; gathering system).  


Edit: I'm glad this is actually getting some solid talk going.  :] thank you


I don't think I've been this excited for a video game (in general) in *years*, let alone an MMO.  (Read: The last time i was excited for a game was Assassins Creed III, but given the way that turned out, I just choose to retcon my memory to pretend AC never existed.)


And then it clicked.  This game is going to be good because of the thousands of players who played through the garbage, and a developer who *seems* to feel morally obligated to correct their mistakes and recognize the words of Shigeru Miyamoto:  ""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.""


I've never seen a game so heavily scrutinized by players AND non-players, to the point that a developer has said ""Hey you know what, lets have a chat.""

I can't find the original post to give credit where credit is due, but if someone has the link I'll edit this post and include it.

I'm offering my services to anyone who doesn't own a copy of photoshop but wants desktop wallpapers with this same effect applied. The screenshots need to be in your native resolution or bigger for best results. If the screenshot was taken using the FFXIV client screenshot functionality, I'll do my best to remove the bottom text without cropping too much of the image. If you can, include your resolution or resolution aspect ratio.

i wonder if the devs have spent the whole time overhauling the complete 1-50 experience, which is great for us new players,we get to directly benefit from the game being remade. but at  the same time, what about everyone who already completed 1-50, is there something a long the lines of a expansion worth of content for players who've been playing 1.0 for years? will they have to wait a few months for us new players to experience the game and reach 50 before content designed for them  starts rolling out? if so, is ARR for new players specifically? 

maybe they have a bunch of all new stuff, they just haven't talked about yet. is this a legitimate concern for 1.0 players?

I've been playing MMOs since 2004 and I'm now moving into my 10th year as a MMO gamer. I've pretty much played them ALL (no need to name names). I have to say, this game is the ONLY modern MMO (made within the past 5 years) that has truly made me feel connected with my character.    




I think the **CONNECTION** is what most MMOs I've played are missing. Even my beta character I feel a connection to. I've been in the alpha/beta since November 2012 and I'm still not tired of logging in.

After a quick shout in my LS I was told that you can put materia into your gear once you get your DoH (crafter) class to 19.

Well ok then, so I picked up Weaver hoping to put some materia into my sexy blue Battlemages set I had gotten out of Brayflox's Longstop.  After a number of hours of crafting I had reached 19.  (It actually really didn't take all that long, maybe 5 hours.)  So once 19 I headed to the goblin that the Minfiliawhatever blonde chick sends you to as part of the main story quest.  I get there and an npc has a new quest for me which explains how to affix materia and whatnot.  Ok great! Ready to put some materia in my gear.  

**Nope!**

Turns out there are two (maybe three) things that many people don't seem to know about materia.  The first is that you need to be equal to or higher than the required level of the gear you are trying to affix materia to.  So I wanted to put materia in my lvl 30ish gear, but because I was only a level 19 Weaver, I wasn't able to.  The second is that there is a reagent needed to affix materia to your gear.  It is called Carbonized Matter and is gotten from mining ~20 nodes.  Lastly, you need the correct DoH class to affix materia to specific armor types.  For example a Weaver can affix materia to cloth gear, but not to armor.

Hopefully no one else will have to be as disappointed as I was.

It was a sad moment and I still regret dropping the money on the collectors edition, but Square Enix has really come around with ARR.

I was thinking about how the game feels so alive and vibrant in comparison to other games like WoW, or Guild Wars, and I wanted to see what Reddit thought.  Clearly the beginning of the game is important because if it doesn't capture the player it's not going to hold their attention in the long run.

I would say that FF XIV:ARR took the ""Hero"" aspect from FF XI and cranked it up. While this is clearly because an evolution of MMORPG gaming mechanics and technology, there's no way to not feel awesome when Fighting the Masked Man, or when you're doing your instance to learn your class dynamic (Conjurer having to heal the NPCs was neat and different).

I don't pretend to not have a payment model I prefer, I do - I would rather it be monthly sub with no cash shop. I would rather the dev's give us creative ways to get unique appearance gear rather than force us to pay for it.

However, I see from the casuals point of view. You might only have a few hours to play the game, and instead of having to bust your ass to get that awesome looking mount or helm, you can just buy it with real money.

On the topic of amount of time to play. Why do those who only have a few hours a week/month to play feel the need to buy the game in the first place? Seriously though, when you walk into an MMO you KNOW damn well that its time consuming. So, why buy a game you don't have time to play?

Even if you're a fan of one payment model or another it doesn't matter. Quite frankly the devs have been VERY clear that they don't plan to change it. If you PLAN to play the game, make the arrangements to pay 15 a month.

Some helpful advice (I hope)",54,20,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gzr5s/for_those_having_trouble_with_tanking_as_a_glad/,"A little background, I was Gilgamesh's first level 35 Gladiator and I was the main tank for the first Cancer kill on Gilgamesh during beta. I also have been a main tank in successful guilds in many MMOs throughout the years.

As I leveled other classes this past weekend, I noticed that a lot of Gladiators seemed to be having trouble maintaining threat in instances. In addition to helping those in my party, I would like to help those with questions on how to tank in 4 man situations to the best of their ability as a GLD.

Firstly, the most common mistake I saw while watching other people play Gladiator is the spamming of Flash. This led to people using Riot Blade over Savage Blade. More often than not I would pull aggro off of these tanks. Flash is a very good utility for AoE threat, however it should not be considered your main utility. Fast Blade into Savage Blade offers a very large increase in threat as opposed to Flash alone. In the worst case scenario where your 2 dps are splitting damage, alternating savage blade between the 2 while observing the built in threat meter is the best course of action. I've found that the best rotation for this is 1-2-1 on your main target, followed by 2-1 on the alternate target. This alternates between the 2 targets until they are both dead with an occasional flash thrown in.

Once you get Rage of Halone it becomes much more easy as both Rage of Halone and Fast Blade to Savage Blade increase threat on the target they are used on.

Secondly, as a tank, you have to pay attention to the things you are tanking while keeping them as stationary as possible. Too often did I see tanks get hit by an avoidable cast that they could dodge, while making positioning a nightmare for the dps. Keep in mind, in this game, dps positioning is huge. There are abilities that do more damage at a flank, or from the back, and your job is to keep the mob stationary so the dps can do their thing, while also keeping everything on you.

Sometimes it is unavoidable to have to move to pick something up, but most of the time you should be staying still and moving only to avoid incoming damage to help your healer.

Lastly, don't be afraid to push forward. There are a lot of players who don't have patience and will pull for you, and this can be quite annoying. DPS should never do it, but keep in mind you as a tank set the pace. The most important skill for a tank to have in my opinion, is the ability to know when to rush and when to stop.

1362075105.0,38,self.ffxiv,19epgj,[Meta] Draft of small rule change for NDA/beta topics.,42,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/19epgj/meta_draft_of_small_rule_change_for_ndabeta_topics/,"Hello /r/ffxiv! Thank you for your time in the last day, [we had a lengthy discussion about how to handle NDA/beta posts and the sort](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/19c395/meta_discussion_on_the_nda/); we just had a brief internal discussion to make sure us moderators are also on board.

I understand there are conflicting viewpoints and we're not looking to divide the community here. One possibility we as a community discussed was to remove all posts that violated the NDA and I would like to first say we will not be doing this. I want to make it clear that we mods are part of the community, not above it. Generally upvoting/downvoting is how reddit controls content (although in our NDA discussion, I ignored vote counts and focused on opinions) and would like to leave it to the community to decide the fate of leaked beta content (via upvotes/downvotes).

----

Based on your community feedback, I'd like to propose 3 small changes in the subreddit to help keep the quality up as well as meet in a middle ground for both viewpoints:

1. **Spoiler tag all topics containing leaked beta details.**
2. **Remove unconstructive question/inquiry topics (submissions) about beta.**
3. **Remove beta bug reports or suggestions.**

----

1. An example of a topic needing to be spoiler tagged would be a submission of an Imgur.com picture from a player showing a leaked beta screenshot. A press-released picture of beta (or something in the news) would not need to be spoiler tagged.

2. An example of an unconstructive question/inquiry would be something like ""Is Red Mage in the ARR beta?"" or ""How much Gil do you get from quest rewards in ARR beta?"" or ""What is the death penalty for dying in ARR beta?"". Not only are these not constructive, but ways beta is setup can possibly change for launch.

3. An example of a bug report or suggestion is something like ""My game crashes when playing ARR beta"" or ""SE should up the XP rate in ARR beta"". These kind of topics are meant for the official ARR beta forums so SE can actually review them.

----

I'm also implementing some more feature for the subreddit (under construction):

* Done: Mobile-friendly spoiler comment formatting:   
[FFXIV ARR is](#s ""currently in closed beta"")   
\[FFXIV ARR is\](#s ""currently in closed beta"")

* Done: Popup CSS box on downvotes (on comments) to indicate downvotes [are not used because you disagree](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

* More text boxes to indicate things like violating the NDA may cause SE to take action against a user, etc.

----

Let me know what you think and if there are no qualms against all of this we can start working this up in a day or two. I understand this may not meet the specifics of every specific viewpoint; but don't leave out your feedback if you think of a way to improve this.

In the meantime, don't forget it would be much appreciated [if you contributed to our wiki/FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/19cqxf/please_contribute_to_our_wikifaq/).",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1362079192.0,,limsa,True,t3_19epgj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/19epgj/meta_draft_of_small_rule_change_for_ndabeta_topics/,moderator

for a current demo of the new reporting. Things are constantly changing in the beta folder, so don't be worried if it's bugged out.

**The things I need from P4 OB/ER Beta are:**

*NOTE: I'm not looking for data from P3; I have all of that I need. I'm looking specifically for concrete phase 4 data. &lt;3*

**Formula for Accuracy**
-From current testing, we know that difference in level makes a difference, so calculating the hit rate over alot of iterations at -2/-1/-0/+1/+2 levels without acc buffs (using base accuracy) can really help. Then also test in the change of accuracy (+10, +20); These data points will be enough to get a running formula working to get a better idea of ACC values.
If someone plans to start a spreadsheet on this, let me know. If not, i'll try to do it on Saturday when all of my level grinding is complete.

**The effects of Dots**
Particularly MNKs dots since they were broken in relation to primary stat increases. They were all kinds of a mess, and I'm going to need testing for all classes and jobs to get a better idea how they interact with damage increases. I'd also like to recheck the ticks in relation to server time if it still works like that.

**BLM priority interactions**
According to the datamined leaked info, the astral 3 to umbral 3 bug was intended. I want to see if they space it out now so you lose astral before gaining umbral. Just general changes needing clarification.

**Materia caps**
I might not need this specifically (if the lodestone api is any good), but having a formula or schema to determine materia caps would be helpful just in case.

**Arcanist Spells/Pet interaction**
I need a lot of data on arcanist to compile a summoner module.
Key things are:
Abilities/TP/Potency/Dot interations with stats
Pet interactions including autoattack (if it scales off of player weapon damage or a set interval), pet ability usage and timing, pet gcd (and if it scales off of player).
Basically everything. If you have any information on this, please feel free to share. I have a feeling they will scale off of the player in some way, Just need to know how.

**Tons of other stuff!**
Let us nerds help eachother while helping ourselves. Math geeks engage!

Thanks for any help! I'm trying my best to get everything in working order before official launch; Enjoy!

**Post a screenshot of your character, and I'll draw a doodle of him/her in the above style. **

Since I have not done this before, there are a few provisos, a couple of quid-pro-quos:

* 1. No backgrounds (keepin' things quick guys!)
* 2. Simple poses: I'll take requests but nothing too crazy please!
* 3. Regarding Armor: I will default to Race specific gear to save time. I can do AF, but you'll have to tell me the job.
* 4. Availability of coloring subject to number of requests I get. I'll try my best.
* 5. If I get tons of requests, I may have to issue a cutoff till I get caught up. 

That's it. Thanks /r/ffxiv!

*P.S. Is this how you post links ""karma free""? I'm still kinda new to reddit. It seems like you're not supposed to try to get it? What does it do?*

EDIT 1: I will go ahead and stop the first round of requests at midnight (CST) tonight. I need to install a new card in my PC, which should allow me to get workin' on current requests starting tomorrow. If you didn't get a request in, don't worry, I'll get another round going once I finish some up. 

EDIT 2: Request closed for the time being. Looks like I have my work cut out for me :P

FFXIV is a team based game, and he won't get far on his own.  My rules would be that he doesn't get to speak to anyone unless I say so, he cannot make a girl character (so guys don't hit on him... gross), and he can only play in a party if I'm in it.

I would like to know your thoughts and rules on letting your kids play.  This isn't a topic to argue parenting ideologies and what's wrong and what's right.  I just wanna know.

I have almost always played a healer (or a ranger if the herbalism stat allowed them todo damage *and* heal like in D&amp;D). Always liked the class and whenever I move onto a new game, I generally stick to that class. And I'd like to say that after almost 25 years of it, I'm pretty good. I've picked up other classes, I like tanking too and am decent, but I always go back to healing. 

When I made my FFXIV char, I naturally chose CNJ and look forward to healing mainly throughout my playtime. I generally get the ""of course you're a healer, you're a girl"" reaction. My choice comes from more years of game playing than most of these players have been alive. Don't belittle my choice and turn it into some sexist gender role.

Does anyone else get irritated/angered by this statement? It's similar I think to being a geeky person and being called a Fake Geek Girl. [Mary Sue did a great article on the psychology of that.](http://www.themarysue.com/psychology-of-the-fake-geek-girl/)

I just want some god damn respect. It's like being good at cooking and someone going ""of course you do, a woman's place is in the kitchen.""

I am talking about the Skill Speed stat listed on weapons and armor.

The amount of reduction on GCD from applying skill speed is really low as of right now. You are literally getting a return of around .1 second of reduction for every 100 skill speed you have from gear. As of this moment, wearing the entire set of warrior af (which has skill speed on every piece) is only getting you 81 skill speed (which is less than .1 seconds reduction)

Human error will typically negate the effect of a .1 second cooldown reduction. If you are a robot, maybe you can really make use of it. But typically, if you move/hesitate at all during any point, even for 1 SECOND, you are essentially negating 10 GCD rotation's worth of reduction from 100 points of skill speed. 

Skill speed as a stat feels like it needs a boost. Why even have this stat on gear if the return is practically negligible? In fact, why is this stat competing with other stats for a spot on gear? Look at WAR and PLD Artifact/Job armor. The stat bonuses are practically identical, except WAR has 81 skill speed and PLD has 81 acc. Which would a player want more? Less than .1 second cooldown reduction or 81 accuracy? It feels highly unbalanced.

What do the people here think?

This might sound meaningless, and I'm not really sure how it was in 1.0 or beta phase 1 or 2, but this simple mechanic made it that even killing random trash was always keeping us on our feet instead of having the content losing all challenge when making larger group like any other mmo.

Unfortunately it sounds like most you guys and girls are vets to ff14 and where I'm 100% new and I have a lot of questions if anyone is kind enough to help me out on the info :)

1. Is there an easy way to search and look up clans/guilds and also what is the term for it? Is that Linkshell?
2. I noticed not a loot has been dropping off mobs. Is this game heavily quest based for rewards and making pure mob grinding not as worth it?
3. I can't seem to find much if any armor/weapons from quests / mobs. Is this game HEAVY craft/vendor?
4. Is the crafted gear more superior then vendor gear?
5. I feel a bit alone. I do love there is no world chat but I also miss there is no one sort of to chat to. I notice even local chat is 100% dead at least for now. Is there better methods of finding people to communicate?
6. Chocobo's I hear in FF11 you had to breed them and such and it was a long long process.. Is this the case again? If so how long how much effort?
7. If above is true or even not is there long epic quests or mechanics that are not in most MMORPG's where takes a long time to unlock something and I don't mean leveling to max level but more like special quest that you work on for a long long time to get a special reward or something around them lines?
8. How does one activate these kill bonuses or they just random where you have I think 60 seconds to kill as many mobs for extra exp?
9. Is there any kind of form of auction house/ trading post?
10. Being an archer / range class and first time actually playing such. I find they seem to be VERY overpowered with their kitting abilities. Is this normal and is this kind of power still exist at higher levels? If so are melee classes like rocks or do insane damage or is there just a major unbalance? 
11. When equipping some items I noticed a black and red dot at the top right of the item. What do they represent? 
12. So I hear you can have more then 1 class on a character. Can I do every single one and not re-roll or is there a limitation?
13. Following the question above is there something called a sub-class? Like mixing 2 classes up or is that just switching weapons into a new class?
14. I hear there is housing in the game. Is there any kind of info on how this works? What kind housing etc etc. Like Rift, EQ2, such.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,False,,,True,t3_1gebfa,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1gebfa/i_have_a_few_questions_about_arr_after_playing_it/,

- How is/will the endgame PvE and PvP set up? I.e Raiding/Dungeons/Group questing (how many people) and rated PvP? How are parties set up? 1 Tank, 1 Healer

- I am under the impression you can technically have one character maxed in every job, is this accurate? 

- How do professions work? I see jargon about it around ""DoL?"" But know little. The beta so far for me has been mostly avoiding it.

- The job system is confusing to me, so if my account had a CON leveled to 5 another character on it can use Cure?
I am accustomed to the WoW style of ""I am a Mage, I only do Mage stuff"" classes. 

- how do link shells work? This is totally lost on me? Is this a guild? Then what are free companies?

Can you best it?

Off to a promising start!  Many great points were brought up to consider such as a lack of need for excessive cores in a processor, a safe bet of 8GB for memory, relative playability at high as opposed to max settings, considerations for the future DirectX11 update and more!  May the debate rage on and a new champion rig take tomorrow's crown!

**Edit 2**: With the new [Character Creator Benchmark](http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark/en/index.html) and the [jaw dropping scores](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao70YcZoNX_zdHpER085M1hXOW0yeFF5a3ZtQmI0TkE) out, the recent optimizations imply room for a leaner design!

  .  

All basic craft materials tend to be available from that your vendor; if it's not there, chances are the guild that makes it (Animal Hide/LWR) sells it.  
  .  

All non-HQ versions are sold by a vendor somewhere; in short it's a waste of time selling the lower level regular items. The upside is even beta players were buying HQ items from AH.  
  .  
  
Get your retainer ASAP. Having all that work done only to end up vendoring it is heartbreaking. As someone who feels like he's going to craft alot, theres nothing more awesome than examining someone to find they are wearing something you made. Also gives you 100+ storage slots for mats.  
  .  
If you are making your own gear, make two or more HQ versions of it. With materia going to high demand, bond to 100%, convert, and switch to the spare you made. This will build your stock up at a reasonable rate.  
  .  
Go for HQ no matter what you are making. It increases your exp thus saving on mats for what you really want to make.  
  .
Do not trust the counter when you are doing ""Make x of y"" quests. HQ items count towards this, but you cannot trade them to accomplish total.  You can see how much you have of something in the item description as you are crafting.  
  .
Either buy or spend time making your basic mats, i.e. bars/ingots/lumber/etc. If you are crafting for HQ you will want the HQ mats, but if you are just trying to push through all your recipes and save shards, buying a stack of them is fine also.  Later on, someone will likely do the math for how much of each mat you will need to level. 
  .  
You will go through crystals fast; grinding 400+ shards when you start your Disciple of the Land is not a bad idea considering they give reasonable exp when you start out. It's very inefficient to run out of shards in the middle of a long crafting session (I lost track of a couple of hours, sooo fun) only to run off to another country to gather shards.  
  .
Touch during rainbow if possible, rainbow is fkin pro =). Red is also great but if you need to touch, but using cp/""doubles effeciany of next touch"" trumps touch on red.  
  .
They have crafting food with +3% exp; helps greatly if you're off by x cp to finish touching something.  
  .  
I do not know if on purpose of if they will fix it, but as a 25 GSM I was easily HQ'ing any recipe belows ~12 at hmm 3/4? or higher. If they maintain this, prices may drop onlower level HQ items after a few weeks.  
  .  
Repairing gives you exp, try to repair it yourself if you have the correct DoH.  
  .  
As tempting as it is to use leves for you main, I recommend you use them for your gatherer if you want to craft hardcore. Since your profit margin/chance of success rely solely on level, and leveling on DoH is a bit slow, using a leve can easily assist you to get that one level to access silver or etc, instead of grinding something you'll have to vendor. Your main will quests and dungeon leveling for exp.  
  .
Lastly, for multi-crafters; your DoHs and DoLs will all share gear respectively. Building two 1-20 sets (DoH vs DoL) that you switch out piece by piece as each item becomes bonded/converted for materia is key. I kept having to go back and remake stuff, wasting time. I recommend no matter what your main craft is to level whichever craft makes your tools alongside it so you'll always have access to an HQ pickaxe or hammer etc. Comparing the stats, HQ tools are only one point lower than your next upgrade, meaning you can keep working or just get much better results.

1362778066.0,34,self.ffxiv,19xnzy,Seems to be a lot of confusion about the Job System and Classes. I'd like to clarify some things.,36,2,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/19xnzy/seems_to_be_a_lot_of_confusion_about_the_job/,"I see a lot of people asking why they are not getting rid of the classes and just sticking to the jobs. I think this is from a misunderstanding of the relation of Jobs and Classes.  
  
First of all, you do not need to level your job separately. Your job is more of an extension of your class. They share experience and gear.  
Secondly, Classes are intended to function well while soloing, while jobs function better in parties. Solo as your Class, but party as your Job. The stats change slightly to enhance your Jobs role in the party. As a trade off, you lose the well rounded-ness of your class and have a limited source of classes to equip abilities from.  
  
A good example  of how this works would be if I was leveling my Gladiator. Lets say it was 35GLD and I get a group invite, I would then equip the ""soul of paladin"" item and become a 35PLD. I can only use abilities coming from PLD's base class GLD, or the two other ability sets PLD is limited to (conjurer and marauder). The two levels are linked. Any experience earned with one, effects the other.  
  
The secondary requirement is not linked. For instance, Paladin requires 15 conjurer. Leveling conjurer further will just give you a few more abilities to equip, but not affect levels.   
  
I hope this clears up some things. If you need a source [here it is](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/39024?p=580990#post580990).

1342181406.0,33,self.ffxiv,whugd,"After playing FFXIV - I feel comfortable in saying ""WoW has ruined me as a gamer"" ... what I mean by that inside",40,7,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/whugd/after_playing_ffxiv_i_feel_comfortable_in_saying/,"Hello, everyone, my name is Porkchop.  I'm a recovering World of Warcrafter, just not in the way it sounds.  My brain has turned to mush by a game called WoW and it has made me a lazy gamer.  I'm working hard to return to my roots, and FFXIV seems to be the game to change that for me!

I've been playing games, like most of you, since I was old enough to push the buttons and watch a TV screen.  My first MMO experience was Ultima Online, and that engrossed me very early on for many years to come...in fact, it kept me busy right up until the point I quit to play a new game I had heard was going to be awesome:  Final Fantasy 11.

I had played other MMOs here and there along the way, just trying them out, but nothing occupied for of my time than UO and then later, FFXI.  I have amazingly fond memories of these games, shared with friends (IRL and over seas alike) that will put a smile on my face until my deathbed.

But after a while, I noticed a shift start to change in my LS on FFXI, and lots of people were leaving to go play this new game called ""World of Warcraft"" ... I wasn't ready for a change, but nearly everyone I knew and played with converted over, and i'm a social guy, so, naturally, my friends jumped off a bridge so I did too!

Fast forward to just a few days ago, when I tried to go back to FFXI, and the reason for my post begins.  World of Warcraft has dumbed me down.  I'm glad that I recognize it, and am working diligently to resolve it, but WoW, for the 7 or so years I played it, has made me a sloppy, lazy, entitled ""gamer"", and it pisses me off.

I realized this when I first tried to play FFXI and, after so many years of being away, I couldn't even remember how to exit the game...I just did an alt+f4 after about an hour of messing around (eventually I googled a keyboard map) but the game required much more detail and concentration that I had become accustomed to, the graphics were hard to muster (i'm NOT a graphics whore, but things just seemed so ""off"" to me) and when adding that to the fact that I was unsuccessful in retaining my old FFXI account via SE customer support (apparently several years is too long of a wait)...and it scared me off.

After a day of thinking on this, realizing I was having a problem because I wasn't enjoying any games out there, they were all too much like WoW...so, I started reading about FFXIV.  I had heard it was a massive disappointment at launch, so I did not buy it when it came out...but decided at this point to look into it again, and see if changes were being made.

My jaw could literally have hit the floor if it weren't attached to the rest of my head.  I could not believe what I was reading:  Square Enix, a company who have left very negative impressions in my memories of horrible customer service had actually said to the Final Fantasy community ""We're sorry.  We screwed up!!!""  And they're actually rebuilding the game, almost entirely from the ground up.

This amazed me.  I had never seen this type of apology from a huge game company, I was used to the people at Blizzard, a company I used to love and adore with titles like Starcraft and Diablo...I was used to being told ""This is what you like, deal with it"" instead of ""We're sorry you didn't like your entree, here, let us redo it for you""

So that, added to the fact that the game is only $20.00, I decided to give it a shot.  So far, i'm not disappointed...and it's only reminded me that much more what WOW has done to me.

I'm finding myself getting actually excited at the idea of a real grind.  I'm finding myself getting actually excited that something is probably going to take a long time to accomplish, but that i'm going to be rewarded for it in a big way again.

I love that the game doesn't do all of the foot work for me.  World of Warcraft was essentially a game on rails and the only control I *REALLY* had was clicking the mouse to say ""Go here, go there"".  

In games like FFXI/XIV The minimap doesn't show me exactly where to go, there is no quest helper.  There is no mini map ping with an arrow holding my hand saying ""head on over there and get your cookies &amp;  milk"" and I love it all the more because FFXIV doesn't have those things!

I got so dumbed down that I actually relied on an addon called *Deadly Boss Mods* to tell me what to do, when to do it, holding my hand the entire way with virtually no reward what so ever...and to top it off, i'm no longer playing World of Warcraft...i'm now playing Simon Says, and as long as I hit the green button THEN the red button, then I win and the loot drops...after running so many instances, over and over and over, you begin to realize that the item you're after hasn't dropped, and you've got nothing else to do but run some lagged as hell Battlegrounds and collect welfare PVP epics.

I don't know why i'm posting this- I guess i'm just excited to be excited over a game again.  I'm looking forward to in depth crafting that does not involve a simple ""click fail, click fail, click SUCCESS!"" and 10+ minute Griffon rides just to get somewhere.

It's time to get started on planning out the FFXIV Reddit Linkshell.

Give details of what race/class/city you'll start off with (if you have decided).

Second, we need to find out what city each of us will start in. You can get a basic idea of the cities at http://finalfantasyxiv.com but basically:

* [Limsa Lominsa](http://www.eorzeapedia.com/wiki/en/Limsa_Lominsa): city from alpha gameplay &amp; [trailers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-vjy97RuoA)
* [Gridania](http://www.eorzeapedia.com/wiki/en/Gridania): Windurst-esque
* [Ul'dah](http://www.eorzeapedia.com/wiki/en/Ul'dah): Bastok-esque

If your weapon reaches 0% durability, your effectiveness is reduced to an alarming degree. Having a backup weapon is a nice safety. If anyone has played Etrian Odyssey, it's somewhat like making sure you've got a warp wire backup (damn you squirrels!) just in case of some misfortune.

On a long, multiple dungeon run binge on CNJ with a group of friends, I didn't really check my durability beforehand. Mid fight, durability hit 0 on my wand and cures went from around 90-100 down to the teens/low 20's. Needless to say I couldn't keep up with the damage. Bad idea on my part, as I really should have hit up the repair NPC, but in my defense, we were in a nice groove.

Unless you're 100% confident in your ability to gauge when to repair, it might be a good idea to have a backup weapon on hand just in case this sort of situation may arise.

Here's the rest of the Dev posts from today.

[Getting more Feng Shui with the UI.](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/64100-Interface-Windows-Character-Item-Overview?p=1029402#post1029402)

&gt;In phase 4, we'll be adding an option to set the location of items as well as action help text. You should be able to adjust the default position so that the info is always easy to read. 

[FATE difficulty](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/78965-Most-FATES-are-far-too-easy?p=1029393#post1029393)

&gt;Between Phase 3 and 4 we're not planning any adjustments to the difficulty curve for FATE battles. Once Phase 4 begins, please continue to try out each available FATE and give us your feedback. 

[Casting buffs on non-party members](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/76498-Buffing-party-exclusive-Eugh.?p=1028894#post1028894)

&gt;Sorry, currently we don't have any plans for players to buff non-party members, but with offensive spells and potent cure spells, there's still plenty you can do to help other players, especially during FATE battles. 

[Racial combat animations](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/74194-Suggestions-regarding-animations?p=1028827#post1028827)

&gt;Every race should have different combat animations.

&gt;Although removing enhancement effects after level syncing is by design, the development team is also aware of the trouble this causes when participating in FATE battles. This is especially true for FATEs that trigger immediately after the previous one ends, like the one on Highbridge.

&gt;In such cases, we're planning to adjust the level sync function so that players remain synced when FATEs are triggered one after another in the immediate area.

1372712410.0,30,self.ffxiv,1hg97j,a rough outline on what to do when you first step foot back in Eorzea as a legacy player with multiple level 50s [bulleted list] [from beta3],36,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hg97j/a_rough_outline_on_what_to_do_when_you_first_step/,"hopefully this will help you know how the beginning of the game will flow for a legacy player with multiple lv50s. it's a big world you're being thrown into and if you're anything like me, you hadn't played the game for over a year. lets just be honest, it can feel overwhelming and even a little frustrating, since you may not know much about the new eorzea, yet you have all these level 50s!

the key thing to know is that the game technically thinks you are a lv1 in everything, except you're not. you are like a debugger level 50 and you know only the LEARNABLE skills up to level 50 (and you have all your gear as well). but the catch is that there are skills you only get from quests (so far a 15 and a 30 are confirmed and in the beta). so for example, as a 50whm you will have cure 1 and cure 3, but you wont have cure 2 because it's from a class quest... to be specific it's from a lv30 class quest, and you need to start from 1.

i write this from my own perspective as someone who wants to prioritize BLM&gt;WHM&gt;WAR&gt;MNK in that order, and someone who likes LL city the most. it's written more as me saying what i would do, rather than me telling you what to do. so here's the agenda:



• select character, choose MARAUDER. thus, beginning in limsa.

• unlock limsa aethers (touch all aethers like a mad man from this point on. you dont have any waypoints anymore)

• visit the Calamity Salvager. he will be holding a bunch of random items of yours. you can take them all off hi or take a few off him for now and let him hold them. but mainly, you will want to grab your chocobo whistle and your goobbue horn off him. he will definitely have these because these mounts are now initiated by items. you also may wish to take inventory on how much cracked materia you have from your 1.0 days. stockpile them and keep track. you'll be able to trade them for materia as currency! but first, you need to continue your boot camp of the fresh learning curve so you can make moar educated decisions.
**another thing you'll want to grab at this point is your 1.0 collectors items. hermes shoes, asuran armgaurds, and onion helm. hermes shoes are basically always valuable now, but these low level synced areas coming up are going to be your prime chance to get some use out of the other items as well.

• do MRD class quest to 15 (this will unlock hunting logs, the ability to make and save gearsets, the level 15 MRD ability, and the ability to begin other class quests).

• do main Story to 15 (this first 15 levels of the story take place in your starting city, unlocking inn rooms, levequests, airships, and ultimately the instance raids portion of the plot). this is the full extent of the commitment you have to your starter city. main story quests carry you all over the place. you will want to learn to utilize RETURN and FAVORED locations as best you can to prevent spending excessive money on teleporting all over the place.

• fly to uldah, unlock its aethers. unlock crafting/gathering jobs in uldah.

• do THM class to 15 to obtain the lv 15 quest ability

• do PGL class quests to 15 to obtain the lv 15 quest ability

• fly to grid, unlock its aethers. unlock crafting/gathering jobs in grid.

• do CON class quests to 15 to obtain the lv 15 quest ability

• THEN with those 4 jobs as my base options, do the 3 instances of the main story plot, up through ifrit. (level synced instances at lv17-22). note the reason i wait til now to do this is because you need to go get those lv15 abilities on the classes you want to play or else youre a total scrub who is lacking abilities in an instanced raid. cmon. dont be like that. 

• sometime around this now, i think it would be wise for you, as a legacy member, to set aside some time, maybe pick up a six pack of beer... and re-organize your nasty old inventory, full of a ton of shit you can barely remember. get your retainers back, get all the random items. make one retainer a crafting item holder. one an equipment holder. whatever. everyone has their thing. you can start selling items you dont want at this point, but play the market at your own risk since it will be so early on.

• more story, further along, joining Limsa grand company (unlocking personal chocobo, the ability to use your chocobo as a pet in battle, the ability to recieve and spend GC seals, and alllllll the extensive content that comes with it).

• materia unlock.

• armor dyeing unlock.

• speaking to any remaining crafting guilds and joining them (this unlocks additional slots for saving gear sets)

• do THM class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• do CON class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• do PGL class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• do MRD class to 30 to obtain the lv 30 quest ability

• from there on, it's a big big world full of possibilites. and im not sure whats next because this is about where the phase3 beta ended. from here you might continue the main quest into the higher levels, you might want to pick a level 1 job and experience ARR from the ground level, you also will want to continue class quests past 30 and into job quests, which is something that wasnt in the beta.",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1372774815.0,,,True,t3_1hg97j,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hg97j/a_rough_outline_on_what_to_do_when_you_first_step/,

* Early levels go fast and the ""punch a rat"" levels are basically used as a quick tutorial. There are plenty of easy quests to get to level 5-10 in only a couple hours.

* The storyline makes the early game grind much more bearable and interesting. While it's padded out with ""Punch 4 rats"", just like any other MMO, I actually sort of care what the main NPCs say to me and I watch the cutscenes. The storyline missions are enough to keep me punching random animals.

* Combat is very interesting. In the first couple levels this does not show, and feels like standard MMO combat, but as you move through the quests the enemies get tough, and not in ways that are simply stat buffs. The slugs that spawn near Tam Tara in a quest for instance have a very powerful AOE spell that if you do not dodge will fuck your day up. Then there is another quest with a considerable amount of low level casting enemies. These require you to learn, adapt and think. The classes also have position based skills, so I've found myself stunning enemies and then running behind them for a high-damage backstab. This is pretty cool.

* Shared enemies you can help random strangers with CONSIDERABLY enhances the game world. It basically allows de facto grouping in quests. It also allows other players to come save your dumb ass which happens a lot.

* But most of all: The early level content is actually interesting and engaging. The monsters are starting to feel unique and not just as if they are healthbars I have to mindlessly whittle away.

1376346890.0,26,self.ffxiv,1k8kzj,We're almost there: Saving your gil vs spending it.,50,24,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1k8kzj/were_almost_there_saving_your_gil_vs_spending_it/,"The post below is a comprehensive analysis based on beta Phase 3 values alone, and are only meant to guide an interested player. One way of playing is not better then another, please take this into account when commenting on someone else's posts about this topic. 

For many people, saving gil seems like the best option. When you spend it on the early game, in theory, you will have less for the late game right?

Though at first that seems like the most reasonable conclusion, some will argue that spending gil correctly early game, will definitely benefit the late game. The real answer both statements is, ""it depends.""

**Lets take a look at things there are to spend gil in early game on first:**

 * Travel costs. (Chocobo, airship, and teleporting)
 * Equiped Items (gear upgrades and weapons)
 * New classes (A new weapon, maybe new gear)
 * Crafting (buying mats, and speed leveling)
 * Auctions (buff items like food, trades, mats for cheap, blah blah blah...)
 * (insert misc. gil sink here, *i.e. repairs*)


**And end game (that we know so far):**

 * Travel costs. (Chocobo, airship, and teleporting)
 * New classes (A new weapon, maybe new gear)
 * Crafting (buying mats, and speed leveling)
 * Auctions (buff items like food, trades, mats for cheap, blah blah blah...)
 * **Housing**
 * **Guild Halls**
 * **More expensive gear upgrades**
 * (insert misc. gil sink here, *i.e. repairs*)

At first glance it seems there is almost the same amount of gil sinks in end game as there are mid and early. This time, lets take a look at overall costs, however, in all aspects of the game:

(% Values based on gil granted by questing with one class from level 1 to 50 and the time spent to get to 50 on only one class)

 * Travel costs: **5% ~ 70% (*depending on what type of transportation and how often it is used [teleporting costs +/-100x more expensive than other forms of transportation depending on distance from point]*)**
 * Crafting: **&lt;1% ~ 15%**
 * Early game gear: **&lt;1%**
 * Repairs: **~5% (*depending on how often you die mostly, as everyone takes slight gear damage, but death is the biggest factor.*)**
 * Mid game gear: **10%**
 * End game auctioned gear: **~60%**
 * Housing: **100% ~1000% (*100% is a small plot. 1000% is a mansion plot.*)**
 * FC Halls: **(*unconfirmed estimate based on housing costs*) 3000%?**
 * Other gil sinks: **(*infinite value*)**

1. *Due to the low cost of crafting mats, especially pre-level 15, crafting seems like a very viable option for making a portion of the money needed to make that FC hall or that mansion, but you must take into account the time spent on crafting. (***This option is attractive for those who have goals in mind for their gil.***)*

2. *In my personal beta experience, I have found fast travel to be a very appealing option...at first. Soon, however, I found myself out of money, just going from one story quest, to another. Though I was able to finish quests like they were nothing, this is definitely something to think about when deciding to use the teleport to crystals system in the game. (***This option is attractive for speeding into the end-game.***)*

3. *Finally, saving all of your gil, still has it's own benefits. Unlike the options above, you will have the gil to spend on either the gear you need at end game, or things you want like housing, immediately. (***This option is attractive for giving yourself time to think about the best options possible to spend gil on.***)*

In no way are any of these options more ""correct"" then the others. This is the point in which you ask yourself a personal question. ""How do I want to play?""

The seldomly updated threads where crafters beg for mats they rarely receive, the huge long lists of the massively overstocked gatherers that never get perused. It's clunky, hard to navigate, and frustrating.

Well, I've created a site that should hopefully help with that. Blackjack Tools is a database-driven site that was designed to meet the needs of a crafting heavy FC. It allows for crafters to make requests for materials (that clear automatically when they're fulfilled), which helps provide needed direction for the efforts of the FC's gatherers.

Blackjack Tools was designed with large groups in mind. Smaller LS/FC's and individuals may not get as much out of this tool as they'd like.

Please play with the site and share with your FC if you feel it's worthy!

1373443107.0,30,self.ffxiv,1hzukk,Hello FFXIV. Some things about Marauder. That I have found from here to 30.,37,7,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hzukk/hello_ffxiv_some_things_about_marauder_that_i/,"As a side note: This was made for my FC's forums. None of our FC played to legacy though many of us played in 1.0, so if there are contradictions from Legacy until now then I apologize. 

Preface:

On the old forums I gave a general difference between the Marauder, and Gladiator jobs based on my experiences with both classes up to level 22. Since then, I have continued on my quest for knowledge on the Marauder and taken up to level 30 now, and would like to share some of my findings, and also outline the benefit of this tanking class. Here is a summary of my findings, and with it I will also add a little bit of anecdotal evidence that I have gotten from some of the healers that I have played with.

I. The Marauder/Warrior breakdown: As a tank there are many ways to judge your viability, and usefulness to your group. The four most important though are: Communication, Mitigation, Threat, and Effective Health. All four are extremely important, but only three are measureable.

A. Mitigation - How to stop worrying, and love the Barrier.

1. One of the main differences between a dps class and a tank is their defensive capabilities. These capabilities can be both active or passive. Fortunately for us, the Warrior has both, and some more that may be often over looked. For a starting point let us remember one thing, a shield does not add at all to the Paladins flat mitigation (when i say this I mean that if a Paladin does not block an attack, then they are taking a similar amount of damage to a Warrior outside of abilities at 30. The Paladin will bloom at 40, and we will have a different topic to speak of then). Instead of just focusing on the difference between the two though, I feel that we should just go headlong into what a Warrior brings to the table.

2 . The Warrior is a plate wearing class, meaning that its armor bonuses to defense will be the highest it can possibly be barring any additional effects.

3. The warrior has the ability to parry attacks and reduce damage even further on a % basis. This is controlled by the strength and dexterity stats that both increase damage reduced, and increases the chance to perform a parry.

4. Warriors have a 20% to defense cooldown. This is very effective in reducing overall damage.

5. Warriors receive passive mitigation through abilities that give bonuses based on health. As the warrior has the largest health pool in the game, both the Conjurers Stone skin which provides an 18% of total health barrier, and Storms path which is a 10% self health barrier that can be re-applied every 15 seconds per rotation will have much greater effects on the Warrior to help mitigate damage in a secondary way.

6. Warrior has access to the Gladiators Awareness ability. This will reduce our chance of being hit critically.

7. Finally, the Warrior has the Bloodbath CD (30 seconds for us) and a flat Damage absorb to also help with mitigating damage through recovery, while still not having to let your foot off the threat pedal.

B. Threat - Or the non-issue with Warriors.

1. Warriors have a superior advantage currently with AOE threat. The ability to spam Overpower gives us a 120 potency attack that hits all mobs in a frontal cone. Because of this tanking with a Warrior can feel a little mindless as compared to a Paladin. The enmity of a single Overpower is higher than a cast of flash, and also deals damage, making the mobs die faster.

2. The single target threat for a Warrior gets a small hit until they hit level 30. The third enmity attack in our rotation comes 4 levels later then an equivalent Paladin. When we get Butchers Block though, it is a game changer. Not only is it a enmity ability, but it is also a 260 potency attack while used in combo. Receiving this at 30 single handedly took my single target threat meters from getting near half for my groups, to moving them down to 1/4 of my threat. This is really important as it allows you to be more diverse in your rotation.

3. Warriors are able to use the 22 Gladiator skill Provoke. This means that the Warriors greatest weakness can easier be managed, (casters that are outside of your cone of threat).

4. The level 30 Warrior stance provides 25% health, double enmity per action, and -35% damage. This is still a net gain in threat, and there are many job specific abilities that warriors have that bypass the 35% damage reduction on top of that. In this regard, from a pure threat standpoint, the Warrior should have the highest single target threat generation of any class in the game.

C. Effective health. - The true gem of the Warrior.

1. Vitality is the most important statistic to a Warrior. It gives you the single highest stat value of any other Job/stat combination in the game. Our level 30 Warrior stance provides us with 25% more health, which means that every point of vitality gives us a value of 1.25 compared to any other classes flat 1.0 value.

2. Effective health is determined by 2 factors, the total health of your character, and the additional abilities that act as barriers to make your health pool larger. In this regard the Warrior has 1 main ability in Storms path, which will allow you to absorb up to 10% (hard to obtain) of your health pool from both magical or physical attacks every 15 seconds. The fact that barriers do not care whether or not it is magical or physical damage give us a great advantage, as magical mitigation is useless when the Paladin raises his shield.

3. A larger health pool also increases the effects of abilities like stoneskin, which is a mana intensive spell, but provides a great effect on the Warrior. A 1200 point barrier on top of their personal 600 hp barriers every 15 seconds is the equivalent of raising effective health by an additional 25% just between themselves and the conjurers.

4. A more controversial statement is in the mana efficiency of the Warrior in a group. Since the Warrior innately takes more damage than its rivals in combat, that means they will receive less over healing as well. Also as none of its damage mitigation is random, you have a good idea of what to expect from the damage intake on a Warrior. Pre 36, which is prior to storm's path you will most likely see a drop in overall effectiveness, but it will come full circle by that point.

Conclusion:

The immediate effects between the Warrior and Paladin switch is going to look very bleak for Paladins in the beginning. The fact that Paladins do not receive their DMG reduction, and threat stance until 40 is going to make the Warrior a go to tank earlier in the mid game. At the point that Paladins come into power at 40, you will also have Storm's path, and this will even things out more then make things unbalanced. In the end it may come down to playstyle, but Warriors really have everything in their toolset that they need to both off-tank and main tank. I am sure we will get into this further when Ry chimes in on the Gladiator more in depth!",,False,self,t5_2rgs7,1373481790.0,,limsa,True,t3_1hzukk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1hzukk/hello_ffxiv_some_things_about_marauder_that_i/,

[We previously mentioned we would not be enforcing it](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/197hsb/nda_specifics/c8lht2g) but I think we should have a community discussion on the matter; allowing posts (as we currently do) that violate the NDA may impact the quality of this subreddit.

How should posts/comments violating the NDA be handled? I see 3 ways we could handle it:

* Remove all posts/comments violating the NDA.
* Don't remove any post/comments violating the NDA (as we do now).
* Create a new subreddit for ""beta"" discussions.

[EDIT] 2 other possible options:

* Remove all questions about beta, keep topics showing beta ""content"".
* Spoiler-tag all beta posts.

If we were to remove posts, this would also include posts that request an answer that violates the NDA. Please let us know what you think we should do **and most importantly why you think that**.

[EDIT 2] Please be aware this discussion is not about legal matters; we are not bringing up this topic because of NDA and ""legal"" involvements. Only because of ethical reasons and concerns brought up regarding the subreddit quality affected by beta posts.

[EDIT 3] Another topic will be created tomorrow evening regarding a draft of the decision.

[Spell naming conventions in FFXIV, English vs Japanese](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/91643-Why-are-the-classic-spell-names-in-the-JP-version-but-not-in-the-EN-version?p=1076518#post1076518)

&gt;Greetings, everyone!

&gt;I was extremely lucky to catch the Localization Team's resident ahriman, Fernehalwes, in the brief 40 second period of free time he has while his work PC boots up.

&gt;He explained the following reasons that the team decided to go with the numerical numbering, versus the current Japanese style of -ga, -ra, etc.

&gt;First off, having a numbered spell makes it instantly recognizable and understandable. If you're a healer in the heat of battle and your party is dying, and you're looking over your cure spells and see ""Curaja"" - are you able to recognize what level that is? Is it before cura? After? Where does it fall next to curaga?

&gt;Secondly, there are a lot of new spells that are being introduced in FFXIV, that just would not make sense with suffixes like ""ra"" and ""ja"" added (Medica, for example). In a self-contained game, where you're sure ""this is the full spell list"" it's easy to branch out, and finalize the names in specific styles. But when it comes to the ever-evolving MMORPG, you never know when a new spell will be added after a level cap increase. What comes after ""za""? Is it really possible that those will work with every spell name?

&gt;Thirdly, this is something that was done early on the previous FINAL FANTASY MMO, FFXI.

&gt;Hopefully the above makes it a bit clearer on the reasoning for the decision! 

[Hair shadows](http://forum.square-enix.com/ARR-Test/threads/91677-Shadow-Effects-on-Hair)

&gt;Recently a player commented that the shadows created by hair look a bit unnatural. The team has noted this and is planning to fix this in Beta phase 4.

This post was created for the speculation of the Arcanist (ACN) class mechanics. I know not a lot of information is available about this class, but I'm really looking forward to it. It couldn't hurt to speculate with others who are in the same boat, right?

Here is a brief list of information we have regarding the ACN.

•	[Data-mined skill list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1a40tf/arcanist_summoner_skills_breaksown/)

•	[Interview translation stating Arcanist will be a healing class](http://rainyautumnskies.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/05-07-2011-interview-with-naoki-yoshida-at-the-japan-expo-paris/)


First I’d like to point out that the skill list is very old, and was discovered before Scholar was announced as a Job. That being said, it appears to be a damage over time (DoT) class; current speculation is that Scholar will be a heal over time (HoT) job. The article above states that Limsa Lominsa has been lacking a healing class, but that Arcanist will solve the problem.

My current speculation is that Arcanist will receive a conversion ability for their skills, similar to that of Conjuror/White Mage’s [Cleric Stance](http://xivdb.com/?skill/122/Cleric-Stance). This would allow ACN to switch between HoT and DoT abilities using a different book, summon stance, etc. Ultimately, this kind of utility would give Arcanists the ability to swap back and forth between Healer or DPS (again, similar to Conjuror/White Mage), but would allow them to queue for both roles.

What are your thoughts?

**EDIT (thanks angrae): 

&gt; Chuki (JOL): At the very beginning of the game, the starting class &gt;decides the city you will appear in. That creates problems because &gt;there’s a city with tanks, there’s a city with healers and there’s also a &gt;city with nothing at all. Will you allow the players to choose their &gt;starting city?

After level 15 maybe yes. I do realise that Limsa &gt;Lominsa has been lacking a healer because the Arcanist hasn’t been &gt;released yet, but that should be solved anyway.**

Time to get on and try out more things and just play around more xD but I want to take some time and post about the last class BLM. In 1.0 I hated BLM to me it was the equivalent of whole grain toast with nothing on it. Plain and boring. Thats my opinion of course and I still  played a bit of BLM (Coiiiinnnnnncounterrrrrrrrrrr). Anyway in 2.0 they are a completely different class. BLM was made with a lot of depth and a lot of mechanics to them and while they are mechanically deep they are fairly simple to play. This class has definitely been one of the more fun classes that I've been tinkering with.


So What is so great about BLM:

* **Astral Fire**: Where do I start? Well first the numbers AS Fire III gives you roughly a 2x damage increase and doubles the cost of your Fire spells. This was putting my Fire III at roughly 600-650 damage and gave it a cost of 1k Mana (3k Mana total). You can jump right into AF III using Fire III or Flare (Not recommended to get in AF III lol) or you can build it up by casting Fire I three times. Blizzard spells are also fairly cheap my Blizzard 3 goes from a 319(?) cost to a 79 mp cost while I'm under AF III but it will do about ~35% less damage when cast. As you can see this buff alone has a lot of depth to it.

* **Umbral Ice**: Mana isn't an issue with Umbral Ice III, it regens so fast while under its effect I can't even get a clear number (Maybe 1.5k-2k mana per tick?). Unfortunately a computer crash lost all the data I had collected on UI III but it also makes Fire faster to cast, making the transition from UI III &gt; AF III pretty simple. This skill is probably best used by using Blizzard III or using Transpose.

* **Transpose** : You get it really early and its a really great skill. Not only does it let you push your mana to the limits with Fire but it gives you a great mp recovery option after Flare. It only turns AF III into UI I though so the mana regen isn't as fast as it could be.

* **Swiftcast** : Best with Flare or Sleep in my opinion. Regardless a cool ""Chainspell"" skill.

* **Sleep / Lethargy/ Freeze** : This is where blm shines - crowd control. If you have done a dungeon in FFXIV then you probably know how useful sleep is so I probably don't need to touch on that. Lethargy is a really unique spell since its not on the gcd and its effect is really useful. Not only does it slow the monsters attacking down but it makes them slower to move. This can be used in kiting/soloing and in group play. Freeze is an interesting spell and while I can't think of a good use for it now I'm sure there will be a time when you want a large group of mobs bound together and I feel that the effect it has will be priceless to later end game content (Ofc I don't know for sure).


Abilities with Niche Roles:


* **Aetherial Manipulation** : I was honestly disapointed in this skill, not because of what it does but because of how it looks. What I had hoped would be some sort of Goku Instant transmission turned out to be me barefoot skiing on ground. Aside from its looks this spell is actually interesting and I can see a few roles where this may be useful. Now I can't foresee the terrain in upcoming dungeons but I can see this as a good way to cliff hop. Also I can see this as being a good excuse for a PLD to use cover. I'm sure we will find a niche role for it come end game ;O

* **Apocatastasis** - That name... lol. Anyway, this will become invaluable in primal fights. Especially if Astral Flow will be elemental. Again I don't know about end game dungeons but there could be a lot of elemental abilities later on.


* **Manawall/ Manaward** - Manaward will definitely be a primal spell (Imagine if their astrals are elemental you can protect yourself and the whm!) and may have some uses else where. Manawall seems like a panic button and since I'm sure that mobs later on will have the ability to near one shot a squishy this will be invaluable too.

* **Convert** - While this may seem a bit useless it can be used to pull off two flares in a row while under the effects of raging strikes... I think that its best use unless you mess up your AF/UI.


Tips for playing BLM

* Accuracy is important! If you miss a spell you don't get the AF / UI effect and the spell will do less damage. Even on level 50 normal mobs I was having trouble hitting spells.

* As a BLM you can really play with your skill order in whichever way you want but imo the best rotation will probably be: **Open Thunder III &gt; Fire III &gt; Fire Starter combo &gt; Flare when low on mana &gt; Transpose &gt; Thunder III &gt; Blizzard III &gt; Fire III &gt; Firestarter combo ect.**

* In the combo above if Thundercloud procs cast it with Thunder II and if it some how procs twice cast Thunder I!

* Convert can get you a second flare! And like I said before pair it with Raging strikes for massive damage numbers!

* Sleep, sleep , sleep! Sleeping makes things so much easier and I'm sure when end game rolls around it will be a must!

* Pair up Surecast and sleep/freeze when you get unwanted aggro.

* Swiftcast is probably best used with Flare if using the rotation I gave you up there but I'm sure you can find a good use for it else where (AKA emergency sleeping). While I wanna say ""Keep it on CD"" end game content may make me say ""Save it for emergencies"".

* **Be wary of Thundercloud** - I feel its a n00btrap. Don't get me wrong the trait is amazing but if you waste all your time using Thunder III, II, I and TC procs and you use it on a Thunder spell you are wasting a lot of potential damage (Because the DoT most likely won't finish) and thats why in the above combo I only start with Thunder III. Also it has a decent duration so wait it out if you want to reapply Thunder III with it.


Overview:

If big numbers are your thing BLM is what you want and while a few parse runs I did had BLM dragging behind a lot of other classes their utility and burst damage is amazing so don't be discouraged by me or anyone else saying ""BLM doesn't do as much damage"". The class is made well, feels good to play and will be invaluable to any party later on (At least I'm pretty sure).

Anyway that is every class, I hope you guys enjoyed reading my Phase 3 Synopsis's. I'd also like to thank everyone for being nice about everything because even when I'm wrong people approach in a way that is very educated and that is much appreciated. I have maybe about 3 things that I'd really like to see changed and I may make a post about it later and I was wondering if you guys could contribute to the discussion =p.

I hope this helped someone!

In FFXI, it was kind of dull to just sit there and wait for TP gain, just so you could use one ability that *may* do some damage. What this game has going for it, are abilities you can use frequently on a global cooldown. However, I miss the (albeit small) amount of excitement you would have when you were ready to fire off your most powerful ability. Better yet, timing it right after someone else's to see the monster explode into a ball of fire.

On my Archer I wound up hitting the Guard the Guardian quest and sailing through it with no issues, and didn't really see anybody else having issues either. This weekend, on my Conjurer, it was a *massacre*.

First up, I tried to beat it on my (level 15 with no water spell) Conj. It did not go well. As I arrived outside the quest, dead, I tossed out a ""Anyone spare a Raise for me?"" and, expecting no responses, was received with a wave of ""I would, but we're all dead too.""

It turns out dozens of people, Conjurers and other classes, were having serious difficulty with the mission. So after throwing myself at it and failing again, I decided to plant myself down on the big rock there and spend some time Raising everybody who popped out.

And I underestimated how many people that would be. I wound up being joined by a few other Conjurers, as we Raised and Raised the bodies. It got to the point where people would throw themselves at the mission, die, get picked back up, and become part of a larger group.

The FATE that spawns right beside there was routinely picked off, due to the overwhelming numbers of players congregating there.

Eventually I did manage to beat it, and was received with a chorus of /cheers from the other, still trying players.

I have hit a bit of a snag when it comes to the individual world server IP addresses though, and wanted to ask if anyone here had looked into this. I've been able to monitor the network traffic while playing, but I wound up seeing duplicate IPs for individual world servers, which made it impossible for me to pin the right addresses down.

Greetings guys,

Several of you have chimed in stating that the EN help text for Blizzard/Fire II and III are incorrect. This doesn't surprise me considering how many times the battle team tweaks the effects of each action in the span of even a week. Excuses aside, the EN was incorrect for these four spells, and will be fixed for phase 4 and release.

The tweak in question (straight from the master data files) -&gt;

Blizzard II

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies.
- Additional Effect: Bind Duration: 4s
- Additional Effect: *Grants Umbral Ice II* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s

↓

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies.
- Additional Effect: Bind Duration: 4s
- Additional Effect: *Grants Umbral Ice* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s


Blizzard III

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 220 ~~to all nearby enemies.~~
- Additional Effect: *Grants Umbral Ice III* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s

↓

- Deals ice damage with a potency of 220 ~~to all nearby enemies.~~
- Additional Effect: *Grants full stack of Umbral Ice* or removes Astral Fire
- Duration: 10s

(The same issue was occurring with Fire II &amp; III and will be addressed in a similar manner)

I want to thank again the posters who noticed this and brought it up here in the forums. While we have an awesome QA team, the sheer amount of text in the game and the rate at which it is constantly updated can sometimes allow for mistakes to slip through the cracks (30 days straight of 15-hour work days don't help much, either). This is why we appreciate you guys so much for taking the time out of your busy schedules to get on the forums and let us know when something's off kilter.

But you're dodging the REAL issue! What of the Ras and Gas and Jas! (oh my!)

No, we're not dodging the issue. We're simply waiting to see what the battle team decides. LOC has little control over that and, until then, are bound by the rules of progression set in the JP.

As if being hardcore has this stigma of not being friendly, have fun or be ""elitist."" 

Comments like 

* Nice to see a FC ad that uses the words ""Friendly"" and ""Fun"" instead of ""Mandatory"" and have 20 hour work week schedule attached.

* I am deeply saddened that this has become the norm. How playing an MMO has become our job away from job. I hate that. Judging from the 60 members who joined my guild today saying that they appreciate a fresh take on leading a guild that focuses on quality players and having fun over having the largest roster of drones who get world firsts, I'd say your idea of the norm needs some readjusting.

* Just what I want; another job!

* If you are new to MMOs, do not be intimidated into feeling like you need a strict and elitist guild. FFXIV is a modern MMO and there is little to no reason to join a guild that demands so much from you and your real life. 

People complaining about not wanting to make FFXIV a ""job,"" it doesn't have to be. Let me remind you what Yoshi P said....

* 4) As your character level progresses, it is realistic to assume the difficulty will rise with more spells and combos that you can use and experiment with. Would you say the game is more catered to the “hardcore” scene, or is it more dedicated to the casual gamer in regards to the overall difficulty of the game? Does it equally cater to both?


Naoki Yoshida: Actually, we worked hard to develop a game that equally caters to **both** style of players. If Final Fantasy fans, or non-MMORPG players, want to play the game to experience the high-quality graphics or stories, we have ensured that they won’t be uncomfortable with the online gaming aspects by implementing **very casual-friendly content until the level cap is reached**. Specifically, users can progress up to the branching portion of the main story at level 15 while playing solo.
For content that requires a party, users can utilize the “duty finder” function, which is an automatic party matching system that allows users to conveniently and casually participate in party content without the stress of forming a party. However, the game design will be different for end-game content, which begins once the main story has been completed.
**The difficulty for end-game content will be geared toward the extremely hardcore player base. The end-game content introduced midway through FFXIV version 1.0 was received very well by MMORPG gamers, so we would like to use this as a foundation for highly challenging end-game content.**

* That being said, **YOU** decide how much time and effort **YOU** want to put into a game. Don't hate on others that want / can put more / less time than you. Please, we do not want to make FFXIV into LFR raiding of WoW. 

* Hardcore players that push themselves and dedicate the time... that **IS THEIR FUN** - Players that think that they aren't having fun are clearly misreading them.

* Hardcore doesn't always mean the amount of time either, which most people think it does. Usually, it means shit gets done when it's time to raid. They have little room for constant errors on the players part. Players know their class inside out, they are keeping up with the changes of their class and new content coming out. I've known guilds that raided only 3 nights a week  3-4 hours each night and considered themselves hardcore.

* Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.
* Search for duplicates before posting.

Excuse the crap MSpaint effort.

But I see a lot of tanks standing way too far back and trying to dodge Bubble Shower by moving sideways - or straight up taking the damage.

Here is what you should do, stand as close to the actual center point of Cancer as possible, when he casts Bubble Shower, move THROUGH the center point, as he plays the Shower animation, run back to your original spot. Cancer will NOT move if you do it properly. Saves healer from having to cure bomb you, and DPS will thank you for not having to eat Crab Dribbles.

I am planning on posting again on Monday or Tuesday with all of the guides in 1 post but since I have done goldsmithing I thought I would post this and look for any feedback and if people are interested in just level 1 - 15 or if I should do less crafting classes but have it extend to level 20 (when you need resources other than what the guild provides).

Gold Smithing is the crafting class that makes Disciple of Magic weapons, weaving tools, jewery, and Disciple of Magic head peices. Their primary element shard is Wind, secondary shard is fire.

There aren't any of the songs that i really don't like from the different zones. The Ul'dah theme song that plays when you are in the carriage right before entering the zone, i literally have made 3 characters just so i can listen to that because it doesn't play very often in Ul'dah itself. The battle music is just outrageously awesome. Guaranteed it plays a lot in dungeons which can be sometimes annoying, it is still really really nice to listen to. 
Especially the fate music, with the strings that come in. I believe there is a song that plays when you take out a boss too that has strings in it. They just sound so amazing compared to 1.0. It is one thing i can't get enough of. The songs just stick in your head, almost like most of the songs from XI did. They are well done.

1. After installing the client, run FF and let it start updating. Then cancel the update.

2. Go here: My Documents -&gt; My Games\FINAL FANTASY XIV Beta Version\downloads\ffxiv-beta\d96437e6
(That is the directory for Windows 7. I'm not sure if it's the same on XP. just start a search for the code d96437e6 if you can't find it)

3. In the ""MetaInfo"" folder. You'll find 4 torrents. Download them all using your favorite Torrent downloading software. (Approx. 4.8GB). You should get a more decent speed. (0-5kb/s on the official downloader., 100-400kb/s on uTorrent. )

4. When done, Copy the 4 .patch files to the Patch folder (Located right next to the Metainfo Folder.) Run the launcher, it will verify the files (checksum and stuff...) and then proceed to install the patch.

I'm actually pretty obsessed with it, I haven't been able to touch another MMO since.

This being said, there are things in the game that I feel could be improved, and as beta testers we should really bring our concerns to the dev's attention.

If you're unsure whether you should post on the beta forums, get some opinions here first from other redditors.

For myself:

* **Limit Breaks:** (they're not very satisfying to use, and I know this is coming from only having experienced level 1 &amp; 2 of the limit breaks)  I was reading one of Yoshida's interviews and it really struck a chord with me that they don't intend to rework them at all.  On my Conjurer I found that by the time I used my limit break, I could have healed them manually.  (MP willing)

* **The Global Cooldown:** I didn't mind it at first, but while playing Conjurer it was a little frustrating the delay after using Aero.  I took to using Thunder instead to avoid it.  While playing Pugilist it really took away from the fluidity of the combat, although using Haymaker was really satisfying.  Then I learned that there would be a stat in the future that would reduce the GCD and I felt relief, but then after looking at the actual reduction, it's minimal.  Even with Greased Lightning at 3 stacks, it doesn't look like it will make the combat any more fast paced.  

* **The Number of Skills:** They've clearly put a lot of thought into the skills, and they're very satisfying to use, but..   I feel as though some of the classes have painfully few.  Conjurer- the animation for Stone is beautiful, but after using it 1000 times to kill mobs it loses it's allure.  I know that I'm used to having a million abilities thrown at me in other MMOs but it feels a bit lacking here.  

* **FATES scaling:** I feel as though FATES should scale down based on the level of participation to some degree.  (especially when it comes to the BAMs) Sometimes I have only two people helping me and it takes a very long time to kill it, sometimes we simply fail which is very disappointing with the time running out.

Please share your thoughts!  

(P.S: has anyone seen a post on Conjurer not being able to cast Cure on a recently raised party member/other?  They're targetted but it won't cast on them for a degree of time)
