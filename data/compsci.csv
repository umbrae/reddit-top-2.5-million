I interview a candidate a week, and seeing a meaningless list of buzzwords tells me nothing of what to expect.  If I see a URL on a resume, I'll click on it (we get the PDFs), and read.

1375897218.0,367,self.compsci,1jwa5b,Computer Science: A Guide for Undergrads,426,59,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1jwa5b/computer_science_a_guide_for_undergrads/,"It's the summer,  I'm now waiting to start my Ph.D., and I've recently graduated at the top of my year. Needless to say, I have a lot of time on my hands. I'm writing this guide for CS undergrads to offer a bit of advice that I feel would have been helpful when I was doing my degree.

[Edit: I'm British so this guide will reflect that. Also, you may notice my bad teeth and love of bangers and mash.]

This guide uses a UK CS degree for examples but I'm sure most of it will be relevant wherever you are. It is probably more catered to those who are doing a CS degree because they actually want to work with computers, as opposed to people who are doing it as a continuation of school.

Also, if I make any bold statements you can assume it's because I'm British and I have an ego the size of my penis.

**Working on campus and Dolly Parton**
Go to uni (campus) to get work done. It may seem obvious, but I think it's so important to work somewhere other than where you live. The problem with working at home is that it's the place where you'll play xbox, get drunk, and relax. And because of this, when you take a procrasti-break you're more likely to get distracted. At uni you have little other choice than to do work. 

Try to work 9—5 (10—4) five days a week. Getting into a routine really helps and is important around crunch time. You'll probably find you have more free time, and all of your work will get done. Then you can relax and go partying in the evenings and weekends, and most importantly you won't have that niggling feeling that you aren't getting any work done.

**Prioritise your workload**
Prioritise how long you spend doing certain bits of work, i.e. remember to do the boring stuff. A bunch of my mates love doing games programming, and in the second year they devoted a massive amount of time to completing a game (coursework) during the exam period. The problem with this was that they'd concentrated so much on the game (worth 40% of one module) that they'd almost entirely neglected to revise for their exams (a number of 60% exams for different modules). Of course, it is a lot easier, and possibly more rewarding, to do something you really enjoy, but it's worth bearing in mind that you need to focus on other modules as well.

**Chose another programming language**
The uni I went to taught Java as the main programming language. Now, I don't personally understand the animosity towards using Java as a teaching language, but I do think it's prudent to pick another language and learn that. Personally, I'd say something like C++ (or C) and Python. Not only will it give you more general programming experience, it also looks good to employers. Have a read around online, try a few out, and pick the one that you feel you want to use.

It is also likely that for your final year project you'll be able to use any programming language you want, and this is a good time to really learn whatever it is you have chosen.

And remember, certain languages are better at certain things. If you're doing a piece of work that requires a lot of string manipulation (parsing logs), don't use MATLAB, and maybe not C++ either. I saw far too many people do this in my final year, and it's excruciating to watch when what has taken them two hours to get working can be done in five minutes in Python.

**Do projects in your spare time**
For those of you who know what you want to do after your degree, do projects in your spare time. For example, if you want to do games programming then make a few games in your spare time, record some videos, and put them on youtube. If you want to do web development then make some websites for a few friends and get them online. The reason I suggest this is that when it comes to applying for jobs you'll easily stand out. If an employer is looking at 10 applications from recent CS grads and one of them has shown to be putting in effort outside of their degree, then they're going to be at the top of the pile.

If you don't know what you want to do after, but you like computers, then pick something. I'd suggest learning Prolog as it's super easy.

**Your first year**
The first year is for having fun. Go out and party, meet as many new people as you can, join clubs and generally experience living as more of an adult. You're going to be meeting lots of people who love computers as much as you (presumably) do. This means lots of gaming, drinking beer, and whatnot.

However, you may still want to consider doing well. Although you may only need 40% to pass, that's probably not the best way of looking at things. If you're applying for a year in industry, or you want to look for jobs in the summer, then being able to prove your academic performance is important.

I thought I'd mention this as an aside. If, like me, you have problems, or are worrying about, conversing with “normal” people, i.e. those who do humanities degrees, you needn't worry. I found that people who do CS are a far more accepting bunch than most, and you will meet plenty of people who don't care that you're a little “weird”.

**Commenting code**
When it comes to code-based coursework, you need to comment. I wouldn't say there's a limit to how much you should comment when you're at uni, but don't go for the “this is a variable called 'x' that I add one to every now and then”. Also, consider following code guidelines and documenting standards. If you're wanting to get a job where software will be your main thing, then getting into best habits will really bode well.

**Technical Reports**
Reports seem to confuse a lot of people who do CS. Although many of us are happy writing code for hours on end, the thought of stringing some words together seems like a horrific waste of time. The thing about reports is that they are a way for the lecturer to know that you have undertsood what you did. This may appear obvious, but if you can explain what it is that you've done then they, and you, can be sure you've understood it properly. Plus, they'll catch out a few people who have used Freelancer for their coursework.

As for general tips. Don't use 'I', 'We', etc., and don't bitch and whine about using LaTeX. No, people who write normal software in normal CS jobs don't use LaTeX to write reports, but that's not the point. It's something you have to do and it really does look better than Word. 

Also, reading up on how to write technical reports is a wise idea. 

**Exams: everything, not just the past papers**
You need to know everything for exams. A degree is not the same as GCSEs or A-levels. You can't just learn what has been in the past papers and expect to do well. You may know people who had revised using past papers and they did extremely well, but I can guarantee that those same people will be the ones who complain after they do bad because an exam doesn't cover topics from the previous years. Having said that, make sure you do use past papers for revision to get a general idea as to how the questions are asked and how the marks are distributed.

**Look at jobs early**
Start job hunting in the summer before your final year. I say this because it gives you enough time to get further experience and to do stuff that will greatly help you in getting a job. You don't have to actually be applying for jobs (although you will for graduate schemes), but get a general idea of what's out there and what you need to do to make yourself just that little bit better.

**Final thoughts**
Try and use all of Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Despite the fact that you may hate Apple, put your prejudices aside and use it. It's all experience, and as a CS person you *really* should know how to use each.

Learn about how computers actually work. As in the CPU, hard drive, assembly language, memory, scheduling, et cetera. I found this has not only given me a better understanding of computing in general, but it's another vast area of CS that can be explored.

Use the library and electronic resources. My uni spent £1000 per student per year on subscriptions for journals and new books. Before you buy that £60 book that you may only read twice, see if the library has it.

And for a small minority of you: make sure you wash. Seriously. Also, foist (think week old moist swimming towel that has been kept in a bag in a warm cupboard) is much worst than BO. With BO you may have just been for a run in the morning, but foist means you don't wash either yourself, or your clothes.

The editor/browser is preserved on many sites, like [here](http://browsers.evolt.org/?worldwideweb/NeXT), but the very first webserver is nowhere to be found, which I feel is a _real_ tragedy. From snooping countless ftps with anonymous access, I can conclude that v 2.08b and upwards are widespread and easy to be found (both apache and w3.org have copies on their public ftp), but I have yet to find anything that predates that.

I hope those with appropriate resources would help mirror the contents, but please co-ordinate with MIT admins (like user **ldpreload**), so they don't get hit by hundreds of simultaneous ""wget --mirror""s. ldpreload also suggested using OpenAFS to directly browse the contents which I support, but just a word of caution: OpenAFS Win64bit borked one of my laptops for a few hours.

My wife is a 3rd grade teacher and I have a computer science degree... this day was inevitable.  She asked me to speak to her classroom.

Looking for some help with ideas of things to talk about.

This is what I have floating around my head so far....

Basically, I want to tell them that computers are dumb machines but very good at following directions.  Computer scientists compose those directions in the form of programs which end users interact with.
When the users interact with the program by moving a mouse, clicking a button, pressing the keyboard or touchscreen, shaking or tilting their phone.... someone with a degree like mine wrote the instructions behind it that make your computer do what it does.

Then as an example of a programming task I was thinking about introducing them to the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Obviously I'd make the algorithms / recipes analogy so the word algorithm doesn't throw them off.
I'd also explain the many reasons why you'd want things sorted in a computer... for obvious reasons, and for parts of bigger problems.
Surely they could understand finding song they want to play from a sorted list, or knowing who has the highest score, etc.
I would start by explaining the algorithm in English (possibly side by side with pseudocode or Python).
Then I would act it out with pieces of cardboard...re-arranging them on the blackboard.

Perhaps afterwards I'll have 10 kids stand in line facing the class each holding up a number.
I could then have another kid act as the CPU telling the other kids what to do.
I'm not sure about them acting it out... I'll have to ask the wife if she thinks they'd be able to handle it.

I'd finish it off showing them the youtube video of the hungarian folk dancers performing Bubble Sort.

Do you guys think this is a good idea?
Any suggestions or comments are welcome.

Thanks,

I'm in the computer security field, and, while there seems to be some good research (see: CMU), there also seems to be mountains and mountains of fraudulent garbage. A bit of background, I'm in a course right now focusing on securing social media (privacy, etc.) and the professor is extremely dishonest. She has has attached her name to many papers without knowing what they were about. So of course she doesn't know anything about the actual course materials and has turned it into an impromptu seminar course.

So I'm sitting here reading papers to review for her exam (that will somehow cover a couple dozen of them) and getting angrier with every paper I read.

The acceptance rate for a lot of these conferences is 15-25% and yet all I'm seeing is complete garbage. Examples:

[Faking results (via their ""no community"" data exception)](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221273566_Local_Community_Identification_in_Social_Networks/file/d912f507db68a6d76d.pdf)

[Complete garbage (uses 14/15 citations in a paragraph or so, evaluation consists of ""trust us we made it"")](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5562745&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5562745)

There has been 1 paper out of about 15 or so that is even remotely acceptable. 

Is this a bubble? Are we going to see another [AI Winter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_winter) with this kind of research? What can we do about academic frauds and grant money guzzlers? It seems like most of them are just mediocre mathematicians who are restating graph theory problems as OSN research and collecting the easy security grant money.

I'm enraged that the professor of this course is not only riding coattails through academia but also *the highest paid professor at my school*, and so I thought I would ask you all what I should do. Because at this point I feel dirty and want to get out. It's like an academic crisis of faith.

1369075471.0,166,self.compsci,1epk8w,Obfuscating my proprietary code to appear independently-written so as to publish open source? (thought experiment),212,46,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1epk8w/obfuscating_my_proprietary_code_to_appear/,"*This isn't an ethical question (though ethics are important to think about). This is a technical question to get people thinking about 1) computational stylometry of code, and 2) legal issues in gray areas which will become more important once such obfuscators exist.*

Hypothetical situation: I am a programmer working on proprietary algorithms for a big software company. I love my code so much, I want it to be free and open source, so that the world can benefit from it and so that other hackers may freely develop upon it. But, I am contractually obligated never to share anything I've written for my company. Many programmers are in a position like this. Many programmers also independently discover algorithms similar to proprietary ones, to which they are free to attach GPL licenses. 

I am looking for a way to publish my code without getting in contractual or legal trouble. I wish to obfuscate code such that it raises reasonable doubt that code came from me and not some other hacker working on the same problem. I could re-write it from scratch. OR (my main point here) I could write an algorithm which mutates code, retains the same basic functionality on the outside, and obfuscates any tell-tale signs of my authorship. How could we do that? It needs to appear as if it were written independently from scratch.

There are algorithms for determining (to a degree of confidence) the authorship of pieces of writing using n-gram maximum entropy models. A similar approach could be used to figure out the author of code. If we all have unique styles of coding, it could work decently.  First question: how do we write the best code-authorship algorithms, so we can detect breach of contract? Second question: how do we fool them? Third question: how do you compensate for that fooling? etc

Where are the legal boundaries here? When does my code become so different that I can publish it with a different license? **When am I no longer plagiarizing myself?** Do I even need to obfuscate my authorship? Is it fine so long as it looks like I wrote it from scratch? 

How does one fake a clean room design? How confidently can one test a clean room design for authenticity?

**TLDR; How do we write an algorithm which can mutate code to look like it was written independently from scratch?**

[edit]
*This hypothetical has nothing to do with me personally, I work for a non-profit education platform making javascript games for teaching kids music theory. This isn't an ethical question. We assume the hypothetical programmer has already made up his mind. This is a technical question, which both asks 1) how do you pull it off, and 2) how do you defend against it (know thy enemy)*",,False,,t5_2qhmr,1369088771.0,,,True,t3_1epk8w,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1epk8w/obfuscating_my_proprietary_code_to_appear/,

CS degree three years ago. There seems to be a disconnect between what CS is and what industry and society want it to be. I learned a lot of abstract mathematical concepts while getting my degree. Yet when I'm looking at jobs, everybody wants to know how proficiant a programmer I am: Can I write in C#? Can I do ajax? Do I know how to use the MVC paradigm? My friends and family ask me if I can help them with their website. Most don't seem as interested in my understanding of the theoretical complexity of a problem, or what class of formal language can express a problem.

Most of the jobs I see that require a CS degree appear to actually be asking for a Software Engineer. I'm concerned that this hurts everybody involved. SEs may be missing out on job opportunities that they actually are perfectly qualified for. Companies/customers/clients aren't getting software that is written by an engineer, and thus might not include the fault-tolerance/safety measures/production-quality that would be the result of a product of an engineer. Finally, Computer Scientists aren't being trained for what they think industry wants, but are being pushed by markets and their departments into software development jobs that don't match their training. And I'm worried that it is becoming a perpetuating problem, thanks to the pressure placed by parents on college programs to pump out marketable students. 

I understand that by its nature, CS is in part about engineering. There are the commonly cited two branches of CS: theory and engineering. And as a formal science, building proof of concepts via our principle tool - programming - will be a major aspect of what Computer Scientists do. But isn't there a line between the implementation of proofs of concept and the building of production software systems? Wouldn't everybody be better served if industry and academia identified that line? Of am I just imagining a disciplinary divide and ranting about a problem that doesn't actually exist?

It's been six years since I've taught the class and I have lots of ideas for improvements.  When the students finish the course, they should be comfortable building a compiler (or interpreter) from scratch, but the course material should be as broadly useful as possible.  Here are my specific questions:

**What source and target languages should the compiler translate between?**

The three options I'm currently considering are:

* A simple source language (probably a C++ subset) compiled into x86 assembler code.  This is the classic approach and would allow more class time spent focused on the details of the lexer and parser.
* A slightly more complex source language compiled into a simple virtual assembly language.  I've used this approach before, having the students compile to an assembly language that controls onscreen robots in an arena.  It's fun and keeps the students engaged, but other options might be more practical.
* A source language (with proper typing, etc.) focused on GUI-development, compiled into HTML 5 Canvas/Javascript.  While many languages compile into Javascript, I haven't seen any that handle the canvas well.  Plus the students would learn more javascript and produce a compiler that I can imagine them (or me!) using again.

Other ideas would be appreciated. I am especially interested in the students implementing compilers that they might want to use again such as in #3.

**Which languages and packages should we use to implement the compiler?**

All of the students should know both Python and C++.  In the past I've used C++ along with flex and bison, but am open to change; given a good justification, I can even have them learn a different language.

I've also considered using the website HackerRank.com for the projects to allow the students to use a language of their choice with near-instant feedback and easy grading.  It would also allow anyone else to step through these challenges on the web.  The downside is that the students would be limited to a single file with no external tools or libraries, which is probably a deal breaker.

**How can group projects be done well?**

Most students hate group work, but I'm partial to it for a handful of reasons.  First, I think small-group discussion about course material is the best way to really understand it.  When I've argued over concepts, I find that I either crystallize my ideas or I realize why I'm wrong (or both!)  Second, having ~15 projects to grade rather than ~45 means that the TA and I can spend a lot more time per project to give useful feedback.  Finally, my experience is that groups allow me to give slightly bigger projects (I typically aim for ~1.5 times as big for groups with 3 people) and still get higher quality results in the end.

The downside to groups is, of course, that students often end up putting in dramatically uneven amounts of time into the projects, which is difficult to grade fairly.  I can require them to maintain a repository, but that still only tells me who committed code, not how much paired programming was going on, who put in the efforts to design different sections, etc.

So, what's the best way to form and manage groups on a class project?

**A few final notes:**

* There will be 45-50 students in the class.
* All students will have access to linux machines, but their personal machines could be anything.
* I am going to try a ""semi-flipped"" model of instruction where a large portion of class time is spent coding, with the TA and I coming around to help.  This will probably need to be done in pairs since not everyone will have a laptop (but most will).
* I'll e-mail those students planning to take the class to tell them about this post, thus any sneaky ideas should be PM'd to me.  ;-)
* Both the TA and I will independently do all of the assignments before they go out to the students.  Ideally I want to try to do them all before the semester begins to make sure they fit together optimally.

Thanks!!

**Update 1:** Yes, this is Charles Ofria; it didn't even occur to me that I didn't give that info!  Also, I'm working through many of the great links below - thanks for them!

**Update 2:** Thanks for all the ideas.  I think my next step is to do a bit of coding and get a better feel for the options.  It's been a while since I've worked with x86, and never x86_64.  I'll give that a try, along with LLVM and JavaScript (to see if I can get a proper learning experience there as well).  I will use C++, probably with flex and bison for the sample code, but I'll also try coding up a recursive descent parser myself before locking that in.  As for groups, I'm tempted to build a flexible system where larger groups have slightly more work, but I suspect that's going to be more complicated than I'll have time for.  We'll see how putting such projects together works out.  Either way, I will expect groups to produce (brief) weekly progress reports that make it clear how everyone is contributing.",,False,,t5_2qhmr,1374277726.0,,,True,t3_1ikrv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1ikrv7/im_redesigning_a_compilers_course_and_would_love/,

Now, any of these questions would be fine in isolation, but (1) they're very repetitive and (2) I'm concerned that the growing volume will drown out any actual computer science content. It's a numbers game: perplexed undergrads are much more numerous online than novel interesting content about research. What's worse-- the average perplexed undergrad stays away from the more advanced posts (which are to me more interesting) but upvotes the sorts of posts I don't want to see much of. 

So, what should be done? I don't want to disable self-posts, since this subreddit is a great place to ask on-topic questions.

I am an undergraduate computer science student with not very much actual 'computer science' under my belt and I am looking for suggestions on papers that you, computer scientists and budding computer scientists of reddit, would recommend that cs-youngsters read.

EDIT: arnar suggested that I perhaps supply an area of computer science that I am interested in. Really, I had no specific area in mind when I decided to make this post, but if I had to supply one as a jumping off point I would say that I find computer algebra systems, their data structures, and underlying algorithms interesting - but I also find most of the math and concepts to be way out of my league. Complexity is another area I'm interested in, especially after all the talk of a P != NP proof lately. 

To give you a little background on my competence level, the most 'real' CS I've been exposed to so far as been an Algorithms class, and a Data Structures class, and then some disrete math and a little combinatorics.

But how hard would it be?  We can build the circuits, but could we build them as small and efficiently as current chips?

                Learning Python 4th Edition

And then from there there's usually a Level 2 folder inside the Level 1 folder. 

Now I want to know what book would be best to start out with for learning the theory side of CS, I've gotten my language path set-up. Now I just want to grow in terms of understanding.

Books I've already acquired that I intend to work through
Math for Computer Science
Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition)
Compilers - Principles, Techniques and Tools (2nd edition)
Discrete Mathematics and its Applications

I just want some help finding where to start and what order to take these books in, I understand that some of these are far beyond my understanding (currently) and so I want to just structure out my reading. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Also before anyone asks, I only shared the hierarchy I have to help illustrate how I'm going about reading these books so that suggestions could be made better.

**Edit**
As a final note, I'm doing all this as a self-guided attempt at learning. So I would prefer books over courses such as MIT OCW (I'm currently sans internet with the exception of tethering my phone so books are conducive to my lack of 'nets.)

Article related, but my question is a bit more of the ""in between"" case. I'm currently a Computer Science major and I do love the field, but early in my college career I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I am now going to be a Junior in my CS degree in my 5th year of college.

The loans are stacking up, and I have held a development job at a local networking lab for the last two years. I've gotten quite a bit of experience dealing with bug tracking tools like redmine, SVN version control and SQL database handling to name a few things.

I've gotten far enough in my degree that I ""get it"" enough that I believe I could pick up other concepts as I go, and the remaining classes I have are stuff like algorithms, compilers and assembly. I spend a lot of time on Stack Overflow and have essentially taught myself PHP and TCL on the fly.

I guess my question to you fellow compsi redditors is what is your opinion on my situation? I'm not going to base such a big life question solely on the opinions found in here, but hopefully some of you have experienced a similar thing in the past or have some kind of industry experience.

Do I keep taking the loan hits (The way I've figured it I'll have $75,000) in loans by the time I graduate, at least) or do you think I could get away with landing a job without the degree. The issue about finding reading online is that there are so many articles saying that both ways are the best.

&gt;(or:  How to Design and Implement Programming Languages)
&gt;
&gt;Today's programming languages give programmers unprecedented power and
&gt;flexibility, and yet sometimes they are still not enough.  There are
&gt;many occasions when it is possible to encode the solution to a
&gt;programming problem in an existing language, but at the cost of
&gt;significant effort, loss of elegance and clarity, and reduced
&gt;maintainability.  In these cases, often the best way to solve a
&gt;problem is to develop a new language that makes the solution easy to
&gt;express correctly, succinctly, and maintainably.  Examples of such
&gt;languages range from ""little"" ones like Make, XML, JSON, YAML, Wiki,
&gt;bash, Windows .ini files, autoconf, etc., to ""big"" ones like Perl,
&gt;Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, R, MATLAB, etc.  All of these languages
&gt;were invented because existing languages just weren't good enough, and
&gt;in the course of your career, you may also find yourself needing to
&gt;invent a new programming language!
&gt;
&gt;CMSC 430 is being revised in Spring 2012 with this context in mind.
&gt;The goal of the redesigned CMSC 430 is to arm students with the
&gt;ability to design, implement, and extend a programming language, to
&gt;help solve programming problems.  Throughout the course, students will
&gt;design and implement several related languages, and will explore
&gt;parsing, syntax querying, dataflow analysis, compilation to bytecode,
&gt;type systems, language interoperation, and language design.
&gt;
&gt;Students who wish to take CMSC 430 must have received a grade of C or
&gt;better in CMSC 330 and have permission of department, or be a CMSC
&gt;graduate student.  The course work will consist of 5-6 challenging
&gt;programming projects, several homework assignments, a midterm, and a
&gt;final exam.  Students should expect the programming projects to
&gt;require significant effort (but to do cool stuff!).
&gt;
&gt;Topics (exact topics TBD):
&gt;- GLR parsing
&gt;- Abstract syntax trees, intermediate representations, basic blocks,
&gt;  control-flow graphs
&gt;- Syntax-directed translation, closures, objects, bytecode languages
&gt;- Dataflow analysis
&gt;- Type systems, type soundness, type inference
&gt;- Memory management, calling conventions, low-level representations
&gt;- Optimization
&gt;- Register allocation, instruction scheduling
&gt;- Advanced topics

I've made a toy language before as part of the lower-level class (CMSC 330) but this is on a completely different level.

My math training is a huge advantage when it comes to internalizing algorithms and abstract ideas like classes and boolean algebra and so on (not to mention exciting new concepts like hypergraph databases: just seeing those two words together gives me a massive mind-boner).

But that's all abstract stuff. **I've no idea what my computer -- that physical, tangible hunk of metal that sits on my desk -- is actually doing.**

Pretty much everything that happens up until we have an assembly language is magic to me. I'm a hardware dunce. 

How can a physical object tell itself to manipulate ""data""? How does me pressing a bunch of plastic buttons right now make that big glowing box in front of me assume patterns that resemble letters and words? Where and how are those patterns stored and transmitted in the physical world? *Is the internet actually a series of tubes??* 

If anyone can recommend a few books that explain how a computer turns electrically charged matter into streaming videos of naked ladies and apps that make fart noises, I'd be eternally grateful.

My name is Matthew Kaminski, currently a Masters Student in the History Graduate Program at UMass Boston.  I'm an expert in pre-Revolutionary Boston history, and my Masters Thesis is a biography of the Grand Master Freemason John Rowe and his connection to James Otis Jr, William Molineux, and Solomon Davies.  While doing some standard archive work, I came across a letter written by Bostonian, Preacher and Freemason William Gordon.  Hidden in the bottom of the letter and the lining of the envelope was a complex cypher, easily the most complex I've ever seen the Masons use.  I sent a copy to Tufts History Professor Benjamin Carp, who expressed interest but was unable to help me crack it.  This code is interesting because, according to the Mass. Historical Society, in later years, Gordon claimed to be connected to some kind of intelligence network that involved both General George Washington and British General Gage.  Again, I am not a random conspiracy theorist.  I've given lectures to groups of masons from the New England lodges, and although I'm not yet a world renowned expert on Masonic history, I know more about Boston masonry than most Post-graduate historians.  William Gordon was a loudmouth, a liar, and a braggart, but this letter could contain valuable information.  The original is located in the Mass. Historical Society's Bound folio archive for the year 1772.  I figured the computer group might be able to point me toward a program that can isolate and compare the symbols to create a single set I can analyze and decipher.  Here's the link, in case the first one didn't work:

“The theory was in excellent shape, except that he needed a good name for “missing information”. “Why don’t you call it entropy”, Von Neumann suggested. “In the first place, a mathematical development very much like yours already exists in Boltzmann’s statistical mechanics, and in the second place, no one understands entropy very well, so in any discussion you will be in a position of advantage"" 

So I am totally confused now, cause I just wasted a whole evening arguing over the meaning of the word 'entropy'  in information theory. 
From my understanding, the more the entropy, the more the randomness, and so the less information you have about the system. which means entropy = anti-information. 

But some people say more entropy means more information, or that entropy and information are exactly the same thing. How is this consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.. since if the entropy of a closed system always increases, we would then always need more information to describe it.. which does not seem intuitive.

I'm a Junior at a University very well known for its CS program, and each day as summer draws closer and I still have yet to hear back from any prospective internship employers (wasn't excellent at applying, did poorly in some interviews due to nerves).  I have a 3.4 technical GPA (freshman year was bad for me, but this isn't absolutely awful considering the school average) and I'm wondering how difficult it is to find work after graduating given that you have no work experience whatsoever.  

Even if I do secure an internship this late (school ends in a month) I would be sacrificing a family vacation to various parts of Asia like Taiwan/Japan, which is an experience that I would love to have.

Essentially I'm asking for stories and advice: Assuming I do get an offer, would you say the internship experience is more valuable than a trip with my family to the other side of the world? Assuming I don't get an internship, would you recommend summer courses to remove a humanities requirement so I can focus more on my academia, trying to get Research with a professor (unlikely grad school, but always a possibility), or trying to find some sort of open source project which I hear is also good to do (though I wouldn't even have any idea where to begin or what to do)?

I'm an A-student so far but I'm probably a bit slower in getting my work done than others, and I realize that the assignments I have right now are extremely easy. 

It's usually just a matter of me having to get my logic unscrambled, so sometimes I can finish a project pretty quickly, but other times my brain decides it's not going to play along and I'm having to slow way down, trace simple things out, etc.

I'm hoping it's just an issue of practice, but I'd appreciate to know honest opinions - if you're not somewhat lightning fast like some of these students coming into it fresh out of AP computer science, would upper-level courses be exponentially more difficult to manage?  

Is this something I can adapt to with more experience or may I not be mentally fast enough in the sense of living up to the standards of a software development career?

However, I've done horrible on them.

I got A+ in my classes. I could implement and use data structures efficiently. I understood the algorithms presented to me. But I feel this wasn't/isn't an accurate measurement of my problem solving skills.


When presented with *new* algorithms or problems I have never encountered before, my brain stops working. I can rarely figure out the solutions all by myself. I always have to consult online references or other people's code, and I feel this doesn't make me better. I'm simply memorizing how other people got to it.


I've even bought books (Cracking the coding interview). I can't solve many of the problems they present. I have to read the solutions, then I get it (who wouldn't /eyeroll). But this is not helping me become better.



I've also worked on several projects related to web programming (creating user systems, forums) and game programming (simple 2D games with networking capabilities). I've learned a lot from these projects. But most of what I've learned concerns APIs and technologies (DirectX, MySQL, Winsock) and how they work. I rarely ran into having to implement or solve a puzzle type algorithms (maybe it's because I never got into doing advanced AI?) It's all been about understanding how a specific technology works. And if I had to use something complicated, I just used libraries which already implementing what I had to do.

**tl;dr - got good grades and understood all concepts in comp.sci. courses. Have had plenty of non-academic programming/project experience. Have read books on algorithms. BUT I still suck at them if presented with one I haven't previously seen the solution to.**

So does anyone have any tips on improving my algorithm skills that doesn't include trying to solve them and looking up a solution when I fail? 

*****
Thanks for all the advice. I really appreciate it. I'll start working on ""easy"" problems and go at them until I get at least a brute force solution. From there I'll try and clean up my code/solution. I'll try not to resort to looking at solutions in the same 48 hours of having started a problem at least.

Again, thanks for the advice. And for those of you who also struggle, it's good to know I'm not alone ;)

I'm a Sophomore CS major at UIUC.  I do not have a stellar GPA(2.96 University, 3.10 technical), I have had one job since I was a Senior in High School and I've been going back and working there every summer.  It's not really tech related, and it pays barely above minimum wage(considering I've worked there for almost 3 years, is crap).  I spent all of this year giving out my resume at job fairs and applying to places online.  So far I've had one actual interview two weeks ago for All State, and a bunch of back and forth between other companies.  

I'm open to almost any sort of internship in CS.  I have no declared specialty because I would like some sort of experience before I dive right in and choose something.  I wouldn't mind moving somewhere for the summer provided they provide housing of some sort(or if it's in a place where I can sublet for a reasonable amount).

Here's some of my technical experience:
Coding experience C/C++/Java/MIPS
I am A+ certified for computer repair
I have had experience with setting up networks and CISCO related products

I would post my resume, but I'm not really comfortable giving out my personal information.  Any ideas where to look or what I should say when I'm applying to places?  I do not expect to get one this summer, as school is over in less than a week.

Earlier today I asked my teacher in Database design why we haven't used any auto incremented integer primary keys(surrogate keys) in the course. I have done a decent amount of development and this is my first course in databases so I am naturally influenced by less than optimal design choices from being self taught. 

His response was that he thinks surrogate keys are harmful and should be avoided as much as possible, now this came as a pretty big shock to me seing as every framework/example/tutorial/code I didn't write have always used surrogate keys. 

His selling point for using natural keys, keys that are attributes in the business logic, was in part that adding surrogate introduces more data and increases the numbers of joins required to find data. We didn't have time to talk for long so some of his arguments might have not been brought up.

This sparked my interest and I started reading some more about it on the internet. Overall the general opinion seems to advocate using surrogate keys while a smaller number of people argue that PKs should be natural if the attribute chosen is already some kind of identifier e.g part number, social security number. I didn't find any material advocating the usage of only natural keys. 

The requirements for a primary key are:

* It should be non NULL, unique and apply to all rows
* It should be minimal 
* It should be stable over time

As you might have guessed my teacher did not succeed in convincing me that natural keys are the way to go, I wouldn't even say I think it's a good idea to use natural keys in cases were it might seem to make sense like with social security numbers and part numbers. 

I see several problems with natural keys that far outweigh the pros. A natural key is duplicated in many places and since it involves business logic there is a very real chance that it will change value over time which means it has to be updated in every single place it's used as a reference, cascading updates does take care of this problem. I don't like relying on the user for my keys even though the database will validate uniqueness and constraints for me.

My main point how ever is that I really cannot think of any natural keys that are stable enough to be used safely. 


So /r/compsci  what is your opinion?  Do you know of any material advocating natural keys ?

TL;DR
Surrogate or Natural keys?

For a couple years this kind of stuff has really intrigued me. When I first learned about theoretical ideas such as the Turing machine, P vs. NP, and Graph Coloring, Traveling Salesman, etc. (to name a few) I was immediately fascinated. So much that it spurred me to take every theoretically-driven CS course I could manage. But now that I have gotten pretty deep into the material, it feels... how do I put this? Pedantic.

Lectures and assignments are an exercise in deciphering obfuscated notation. It takes what seems like hours upon hours upon hours to prove or state something, that - if explained face-to-face - would probably be simple. I feel like I'm ranting a bit, so sorry, but is this all there is?

Computer science is *not* just programming. Programming is an application of computer science. I get that. But what is computer science really made up of then? Oodles of formal notation?

So I guess what it boils down to is this: something that has been a longtime interest of mine is starting to feel flat, and I want to get that spark back. It is quite possible I gave myself a glorified view of Theoretical CS. In that case I would like to quit while I'm ahead, and move on to studying some other things that interest me (Networks is one). I don't want to study this for years to come if this is all there is. But at the same time, if I am still laying the bedrock for a greater understanding of a really thought-provoking field, I'd hate to jump ship when I'm almost there.

Aside: As a bit of background, here are a couple of topics in the course I am taking that have given me second thoughts:

* [Primitive Recursive Functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function)

* [Arithmetical hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy)

* [Course-of-Value Recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course-of-values_recursion)

* Function Encoding (Couldn't find a link)

Imagine, for the purposes of our discussion, person A decides to punch person B out anger, frustration, or a host of other deep-seated psychological issues. While through the act of punching person B, person A might find the release of pent-up aggression cathartic, he would surely regret it in the end.

""One potential benefit person A might hope to derive from punching a man in the face is the increase of social status that it might confer onto him by demonstrating his dominance and place in the social hierarchy. However, word would likely spread among the agressor's social networks that he is an unsavory character prone to unwarranted acts of aggression. This resultant widespread loss of trust and respect could damage relationships and cause him to lose employment opportunies. For instance, a potential employer, which we shall dub person D, might decide that person A is unsuited for work at company C' because his dubious reputation and doubts about his personal integrity. See figure 1.8(a) for a graphical depiction of the potential deterioration of person A's social ties.

""More important, though, are the legal repercussions; while many individuals may be concerned with protecting an image as a ""tough guy"" who does not need to resort to seeking help of authorities, person B most likely he would be of a passive, compliant nature and would need to draw upon outside help.

I am working on an application where I have the user say a phrase, I record it as a wav file, then I compare it to a reference audio sample they were trying to repeat. I would love to get some advice on algorithms better algorithms I can use to do this, I'm sure this is at least a somewhat solved problem and so I can ""stand on the shoulders of giants"" rather than try and reinvent the wheel. 

Below is my current primitive scheme that in practice has shown a weak, often times random correlation between the sample and reference speech signals.

---

The wav file is sampled at some kHz rate in 16-bit PCM data format. So I take the FFT of both the reference and the sample. Then I try and find out how ""similar"" the shapes of the FFTs are by splitting up the sample and reference into some fixed number of regions and comparing the total power (i.e. x[n]^2) per region b/w sample and reference. The differences in power per region give me an error vector, and I take its magnitude and do appropriate scaling to give a score out of 100. 

I should note that for the signals I scale them appropriately by doing x[n] = x[n]/max(x[n]) and I make sure the FFTs are of the same length (if one sample is longer, I make the longer length the official length and pad the shorter one with zeros).

The reason I split the x[n] signals (with N samples) into a number of regions (say, 32) is because I notice that while the shapes of the FFT graphs are similar, their exact spacing is not. People speak in different ""octaves"" or whatever it's called when they hit the correct pitch but up or down the scale than the reference signal. I don't want that to be an error, so I allow for some shifting in frequency to not affect the score - the leeway created by the 32 regions. Also, when comparing the differences, I allow region i to compare to region i-1 and i+1 and pick the lowest possible difference score. 

---

Like I said, my current algorithm kind of sucks, but does show weak correlation between saying the phrase similar to the reference. I know there must be some good way to do this because when I open the audio samples in Matlab there is always a good similarity in FFT waveform shapes between the reference and the sample.

I'm a female (not sure if it matters, but laying it out there anyway) first year Computer Science major at UC Irvine. I'm extremely new to the Computer Science world, as I didn't discover the field until my freshman year in high school and didn't even begin to learn programming until my junior year in high school.

I decided to pursue CS for a few reasons. When I first discovered the field after taking a career test in high school I asked my sister's boyfriend at the time, who was a programmer and CS major at Cal Poly SLO, who explained the idea to me and had me yearning to learn to code. On a deeper level, though, and ultimately why I chose to pursue it is because of my father. He wasn't a programmer, so I never had the good fortune of learning from an early age, but he did work with computers a lot, and showed me everything he knew about them, and even taught me how to build one from scratch when I was 10 years old. I completely lost contact with him after my parents divorced and in a way I feel like I'm preserving his memory by learning something we were both so invested in.

Now, I'm a first year CS student. I have absolutely no intent of changing my major. I love the subject and each and every time I attend a lecture it gets more and more fascinating. From the beginning, though, I've felt like I was far behind some of the other students (namely, those who have been programming for years). 

I started college in the second ICS introductory course because I received credit from AP Comp Sci in high school, so it's not like I didn't expect to encounter some brilliant people, but lately it's been weighing on me. I remember struggling last quarter to write a Linked List in Java and other students were having in-depth discussions about SQL. I feel like I am incredibly behind some other students and feel rather helpless in the potential intern/job markets only knowing a very limited amount of Java. 

I'm hesitant to run to the bookstore and grab language books by the handful then sit down for a nice read, but if that's what I have to do I'll do it, I just need some guidance. What should I do to to get myself out there?

Edit: Wow! Thanks for the responses guys, I feel a little less panicked now. 
To answer a few questions, I am doing okay in my classes. I received a B in my ICS course last quarter, and I felt pretty confident, this quarter I hit the ground running and I fell a little behind because I was sick for the majority of the first week, but still feel okay. 

I had considered learning XNA C# from some online sites and screwing around by writing my own game or something. Good/Bad idea?

Edit:

Thank you so much you guys! You are all a great help, one huge upvote for all =).

I keep hearing about and seeing 'scripting' all over the place. Can someone tell me exactly what a scripting language is or does? What could I build with it?

I started getting spammy emails from ResearchGate a year back; [see this post](http://redd.it/vqzel) for details. It stopped after some time, and now they have started again; I started getting emails ""from"" co-authors:

1. The name in the ""from"" field would be ""John Doe"" where John Doe is someone with whom I have written a paper. But the ""from"" address would be no-reply@researchgate.net.

2. The subject would be something like: ""John Doe and 4 others invited you to join ResearchGate"".

And in the body of the email would be text like: ""John Doe invited you to join ResearchGate and confirm authorship of: (Name of joint paper)"". And then a ""Confirm Authorship"" button.

While I guessed that John Doe had no clue that such an email had gone out on their behalf, I asked two of them just for the heck of it. Sure enough, neither had no knowledge of such a thing. 

And when I don't click on the ""Confirm"" button, ResearchGate helpfully sends out reminders: ""Reminder: John Doe and 3 others invited you ..."". 

ResearchGate, this is bad on at least two counts:

1. You could be jeopardizing the career of some innocent researcher. In case you didn't know, careers (and grants) are made or broken on the strength of recommendations. Some senior person's first feeling at seeing such an invite from me might be of irritation, and then perhaps anger that I am wasting her time. She may also not be net-savvy enough to realize that I didn't do this. And she probably won't bother checking with me---we all have more interesting things to do, really---but would likely keep this in mind, and make a not-so-positive mental note about me.

2. It looks pathetic on you. Seriously, is sending spammy (and potentially harmful) email pretending to be someone else the way you want to go forward? I am not a lawyer, but this may be illegal in and actionable in some applicable jurisdiction. 

I am writing this post as a PSA, for others to be careful before they commit to an account with ResearchGate. ",,False,,t5_2qhmr,False,,,True,t3_1i5hpm,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1i5hpm/researchgate_please_stop_spamming_me_again/,

I figured by my third year of studying Computer Science and Engineering, I would know a lot more about computers especially considering the fact that I have a 3.9 cumulative GPA and 4.0 major GPA. So far, all I have been taught is some Java development, basic assembly language (with SPARC and HC11), some SQL and normalization, and the basics of the electrical engineering behind computer hardware. I guess I really only started programming two years ago after I completed my first year of school, but I still feel like I am not learning at the rate I need to be learning at. I only have two more years of school left (five years in all) and I feel like at the rate my classes are introducing me to new concepts, I will never be ready to get a job in the industry. Can I really learn that much in two years?

I mostly just sit around doing nothing waiting for a new assignment.

I realize that this is a very newby question, but so be it. I would appreciate any insight you could share with me!

I don't currently find any of these skills useful as no one is looking to pay me to create a program they can run in a console... 

I also noticed that most employers of interns are looking for either Python/Django experience or Java/Javscript experience... So what the hell am I doing with C++??

Furthermore, what can I work on this Summer, and which courses should I sign up for (this coming school year) so that next Summer I will be able to actually flex my CS muscles and get a powerful internship?

Some other ideas I have thought about was diving into Android App development. Where do I even start with this? I know it doesn't use C++ (I believe its Java based?), so would I need to start learning Java? What else? How long will learning this take? 

Also any other idea on how I can make money with my major before I graduate?

My question to you, compsci, is what types of arguments should I be presenting, and what types of arguments should I be looking out for? My current plan:

- argue that we should have a source of power, so bringing a computer is not a bad idea
- argue that we should be out of the range of EMP, so the computer will still work
- argue that everything depends on computers, so a CS prof will be useful in helping out everyone in the group when things begin to get back to normal (i.e., get computer systems working for factories, get communications systems back working, etc). 
- I've downloaded a copy of Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, Ubuntu/Gentoo/Debian/Chrome OS

I feel that the main reason for this decline was the inability to maintain the students' interest at the beginning of the year, as well as general disorganization, which we hope to change next semester.

The new leaders of the Computer Science club all have fairly strong Java backgrounds (for High Schoolers, at least), in addition to enthusiasm about Computer Science and Programming. We have a computer lab with ~30 computers, which, though old, are still functional, available for use.

So what are some ways we can make the club have an impacting interest to newcomers?

Some of our current ideas include:


- Teaching / Helping people with Java and other languages and topics they may be interested in learning such as C, C++, Python, and Web Design

- Discussions about CS related topics, like certain algorythms, etc

- Small projects such as coding a basic game

- Projects that combine not only CS interests, but also other fields of interests.

- Robotics (Arduino / Vex kits)

Version Notes

Then there was a long series of notes regarding incremental improvements of the program. She leaned back in her chair and stared at the pixels on her screen. There were three developers. The first had to be Minus. The second two used long, alpha-numeric, case-sensitive ciphers that included nonstandard glyphs: the equal signs. That amounted to a character set with ninety-four possibilities. She counted how many characters were in the first encrypted name: sixteen. She did the math.

3.7 x 10^31

There were more combinations than there were grains of sand in the Sahara desert. Her estimate assumed that there was a one-to-one relationship between these characters and the characters in the name – which would require that the name also used a ninety-four letter alphabet. Either there were numbers and symbols in the name, or the one-to-one relationship didn’t exist. Some letters could be garbage. Some could represent more than one letter. The capital “T” could translate to a common pairing, “th” or “sa.”

Further, the meaning of each repeated character could be different at each instant, based on its position.

“Well,fine,” she said. She called a friend and downloaded government-strength code-breaking software within a few minutes. She fed the names into the program and watched the console brute-force its way downward. The program made more guesses per second than her eyes could follow. A few minutes passed, she did more math.

She found that it could take several years at the speed that her processor moved.

She made another call. A shadow at the other end blew her a kiss and then mobilized a botnet. Computers all over the world quietly dedicated a fraction of their processing power to breaking the code. Faceless users noticed slight dips in frame-rates and browsing speeds.

**Update:** After trying to rework this a couple times, I've decided to take a slightly different approach. Per one of the suggestions on this thread, I've ordered ""The Code Book.""

I'm going to encrypt the names with something that a human can solve with old-fashioned pen, paper, and smarts. This will be more in line with the secret developer's intention. Also, the process will probably be more engaging for my readers, as I can give hints for how they can solve it themselves.

I want to say thanks again to all of you super smart and helpful people. I hope I haven't wasted anybody's time. The response I got from this community was overwhelming in its positivity, intelligence, and helpfulness. I like you folks.

If you try to enter in an invalid word, like ""AXYXY"" then it seems to immediately know that you've entered a word that doesn't exist. Any ideas on how it does this so quickly? I had some ideas about how the algorithm might work:

Step 1: A preliminary check: The algorithm parses the string to see if it violates any required word rules or contains any known, invalid text strings. (Like having no vowels, or having ""xxxx"" or ""qqqq"" in a row - since no word has 4 x's in a row, it can be considered invalid). If it passes this step, proceed to step 2.

Step 2. Here's the rough, simplified idea. I excluded optimization tweaks.

The game's ""list of valid words"" is stored in the form of 26 TREES with 26 NODES FOR EVERY PARENT: one NODE per letter.

As you go down from the ROOT node, each child node would be an OBJECT that stores:

- 26 child nodes of its own

- a list of the valid words that start with the letters of the nodes visited so far. For example, the parent node ""C"" will have a child node ""A"" which would have a child node ""T."" The T node will store its own child nodes, as well as a list of valid words that start with ""CAT,"" : [category, catharsis, catfish, etc.]. 

Basic node structure:

		A			B			C
	[A	B	C]	[A	B	C]	[A	B	C]

For example: 

If we were trying to play the word, ""Cat.""


1. Perform the preliminary check for the word ""cat."" Cat is a valid word (has a vowel, no invalid substrings), so it passes and proceeds to step two. 
2. Find length of word. Length of cat is 3, so we know we must descend to the third layer: C -&gt; A -&gt; T
3. Descend from C to A
4. Descend from A to T
5. Look at node object for 'T': check the list of valid words that start with 'CAT'. If 'CAT' is found in the list (which it obviously would be), then the word is successfully played on the board. Otherwise, throw error.
//Just to continue the example: if the word was ""CATX"" instead of ""CAT"" the algorithm would continue on here:
6. Descend from C to A to T to X
7. Look in X's valid words list. 'CATX' is not found in the list of valid words for words that start with 'catx.' Error is thrown. (In an optimized structure, this node probably wouldn't even exist, but you get the idea.).

Does this look like it might be right? This tree-structure to store the words and perform the check? Any other ideas?

TL;DR: I propose that the game ""Words With Friends"" quickly checks word validity by comparing the entered word against a tree-like structure. What do you think?

Can computers deal with data in chunks or in bulk in some way without breaking everything down? Is there a shortcut? I'm I missing the point?

I mean the history of Computer Science, covering important events like Shannon's formalization of Information Theory, the AI Winter, the evolution of the Linux Operating System... a very broad category of events, but all focused on the history of topics of interest to this subreddit.

I'm interested in resources on this subject. **In particular, I'd love to see courses, whether collegiate or online, that intend to cover the history of CS**. I'd also be interested in finding good books (printed is okay, but preferably online) and articles.

I'm doing what would be called a major in Applied Math with a minor in Statistics over in America. I decided to self study algorithms just for the fun of it. I got *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen for cheap and started going through it. Whenever randomised algorithms were discussed however they only presented results on the expected value of the running time. Googling seems to suggest that this is the case in general.

My point is that wouldn't it be very useful to know the variance? I can think of the following reasons to know it:

* It gives you a measure of how much variation there is in the running time (obviously)
* You can estimate the total running time for running the algorithm many times by using the central limit theorem. For example this could be useful if a non-randomised algorithm calls a randomised one many times (more formally Ω(1) times with a large enough constant) inside a for loop, and you want to estimate the running time of the ""outer"" algorithm.
* If you are trying to do an experiment  to find the constants hidden by the Big-O notation, it will be easier to do inference statistically if you have an idea what the variance looks like (a little contrived, but still)

I am curious, is it just that its too hard to derive results or is it a cultural thing in CS? By cultural I mean would CS a tendency  to care less about this like engineers care less about real analysis, or pure mathematicians care less about fluid mechanics (I know I'm in danger of over generalising, but you get my drift).

You can post your own notebook online for free at [nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).

An additional advantage of using a language that runs in a browser is that it is easy collaborate with others by using sites like [wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/).

Is this just because I might have missed something (i.e., would the answer be different in a different mahematical universe)? Or is the solution of the halting problem truly universal, fundamental and independent of axioms?  

Edit: I hope the following is a better explanation of my question.  

I see the connection between CS results and mathematical theorems, but most CS results (the ones I've seen) rely on the undecidability of the halting problem (which to me didn't seem to depend on an axiom), whereas mathematical theorems rely on set axioms, as a result of which, I didn't consider them universal truths. Please do note that I'm only a beginner and my definition of 'universal' might greatly differ from yours.

It can be stored in a (doubly, singly) linked list or a vector (like in, array). Theoretically it could also be inside a number of different containers like trees etc.

They always contain an even number of elements. Those elements have an numeral type with a strict weak ordering. The elements are sorted, they cannot contain an element twice. In case of integral types, they can be considered something like a runlength compressed set. Like, if the data structure contains the elements [2,5,6,8], they represent the set [2,3,4,6,7]. Of each pair, the first is kind of an ""on"" value, and the second is an ""off"" value: the first one defines the first that is in the set, the second one is the first that is not in the set anymore. The principle can be (and is often) extended to non-integral types.

Typical operations run on them are boolean operation between two of them, including special cases that ""add"" or ""substract"" certain ranges of them, as well as a function that checks if a given number is inside the set. In case of an array as base structure, this query can be done in logarithmic time, in a list it takes linear time. Other operations that change the structure can be done ""in place"" if it's a list, but not (efficiently) if it's a vector in the general case.

There are variations (like allowing an odd number of elements to denote that infinity is inside the set and adding a bool that ""inverts"" the set, so that -inf can be inside, too). Another variation is that the ""on"" and ""off"" values that denote a range are sometimes crammed together into a ""pair"".

Those data structures can be found with a lot of different names. Just to name a few different ones, I came accross:

- interval list
- disjoint sorted interval list
- multi range
- range set
- multi nail

Since this kind of data structure can be helpful in a number of problem domains, it is quite strange that I never found a ""generally approved"" name for this kind of data structure.

Now two questions:

- Is there a generally accepted name for it, that I just never came accross?
- If not, or you don't know: what would you call it?

The problem is that saying you want to learn assembly is like saying i want to learn to fix cars, it needs to be way more specific.

What sort of assembly language instructions would by ""regular"" windows pc run, would it be based on the processor architecture?

I'm shortly going to need to do some C++ stuff after many years for work, and I'd like to read a clean code base that is a good example of today's best C++ practices. Ideally the code should be largish but not so large that reading it would take the best of us months. I'm thinking a week or so of study.

I'm not much of a C++ fan, I generally prefer C. But when one is going to need to write C++, one might as well do it right. Any other resources of course are welcome.

EDIT: To all the folks bashing C++: unfortunately, we are sometimes forced to program in languages we don't like. To me, this includes C++, C#, Java, VB, and a whole host of other mainstream programming languages that suck but nonetheless pay the bills. But if you're going to do something, you should do it right, within the constraints of what management dictates. It could be worse; it could be 8080 assembly language or Ada or COBOL. I'd much rather hack on a Haskell code base. And if you have one of those and need someone to hack on it in the Paris area and will pay me a living wage, please PM me.

I just had a paper come back from a big name CS conference. It was, unfortunately, rejected. Reading the reviewer responses however it's clear that my paper wasn't even read.

The argument is analogous to saying ""I think all shoes should be soccer boots because soccer boots are awesome"".

Another gripe: what is the point of having scores across 5 criteria when the overall score is completely independent? If I average the scores from one reviewer I get a total of 8. His overall score? 5. What the hell?!?! Where did this 5 come from? Why isn't it reflected in the other criteria?

Basically I would like to detect if video is on ""replay"" and if it is, from which part of the video.

How would you go on implementing this? Assumption is that you can not mark the frames of the video with a time code or similar. Obviously you get some ambiquities of there are still scenes on the video, but that is allright.

**Edit**: Thanks for the great answers. Did not expect such an amount of informative and friendly replies. My current though is to reduce the image akin to TinEye first, and then handling the collisions with movement detection, so I guess my ""hash"" will be expanding, e.g if there are no collisions using the first method, the problem is solved. 

If there are collisions using the first TinEye way, expand the hashes for the collided frames (""collision set"") with more fine grained methods, perhaps using (amplified) difference images to the image of the collision set, and then again using some TinEye like reduction. 

I believe the second step can be repeated (making the hash longer) if needed to handle large number of collisions. If the amount of iterations is limited, this gives the worst case for the algorithm.

I'm a soon to be college graduate with a math major, comp sci minor, and statistics minor. I am looking for something interesting and related to comp sci to learn this summer.  I hope whatever I study to be very interesting, and also improve my programming ability and problem solving ability.

Here are my ideas so far

1. Learn Haskell. I've never done anything functional, and I hear Haskell is interesting and makes you a better programmer.

2. Learn C. Haven't really done any low-level stuff.

3. Algorithms. I took an algorithms class, but it wasn't too rigorous.

4. Machine learning 5. Natural language processing. (These seem interesting)

6. Set theory and databases (My job next year will be working with databases)

I'd appreciate any input on what seems like the most interesting or what other suggestions you have. (Don't suggest Project Euler, I do that already). 

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you everybody! I think I'm going to learn a functional language, and that functional language will be Scheme (or Racket), as I found sicp to be more awesome than the Haskell resources.

Computer science is the study of the theoretical foundations of [information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) and [computation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation), and of practical techniques for their application in computer systems.

[Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) is largely focused on conceptual constructs that make it essentially a subset of Mathematics. In contrast, the application of Computer Science for practice purpose is essentially [Software Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering). Another related field, [Information Technology (IT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology), is the managing of production computer systems.


Theoretical Computer Science is the fundamental basis for Computer Science, overlapping somewhat with Mathematics and Philosophical Logic. 

* Computer Science Foundations includes areas that often overlap with Mathematics. Fields include [Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic), [Automata Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), [Number Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), [Graph Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), [Type Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), and [Category Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).
* [Computational Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation) deals with [Computability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory_(computer_science)) (Undecidability, Turing Machines, Lambda Calculus) and Computational Complexity (Intractability, Complexity Classes, including P and NP). This where Computer Science really starts - answering the questions of what can be computed and what can be effectively computed.
* [Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) and [Data Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structures) and their [analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) (Big O Notation) builds on top of Computational Theory, concerning itself with effectively representing solutions to computable problems in terms of Algorithms (using Recursion and other techniques) and Data Structures (examples).

Applied Computer Science is concerned with higher-level fundamental computational system constructs.

* [Compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers) and [Programming Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages) Design concerns itself with a special type of computational system, essentially the foundation for human/computer interface for expressing algorithms and data structures.
* [Operating Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems) topics include aspects like Memory Management, Kernel Design and IO Processing.
* [Computer Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics) is a large field, at one end is 3D Modeling and Rendering. One the other end is 2D Image Processing.
* [Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) topics include various models (relational, object-oriented) and underlying theory (relational-algebra)
* [Cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) is the study of hiding and protecting information, as well as subverting that protection (cryptanalysis). Important areas are Symmetric-Key Cryptography and Public Key Cryptography.

Consider C, Java and C# for example, which I think are pretty strict languages (compared to Python, Go, etc). Since array indices and sizes cannot possibly go negative, why do they still used signed integers to represent these? It strikes me as plain wrong and possibly dangerous in the light of things like integer overflows (even though bounds checking should keep the consequences of these low). I think in C++ it is common now to use size_t, which is unsigned.

Actually, thinking about this further, IMHO ""int"" should default to being an ""unsigned int"", because that is used much more frequently than signed integers.",,False,,t5_2qhmr,False,,,True,t3_1bcpst,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1bcpst/why_do_so_many_strict_programming_languages/,

For example, take Linux: you use the command 'ssh-keygen' and create keys using the RSA algorithm. The key values are just stored in text in files, ie the 'id_rsa' file for the private key, but obviously there were some operations performed on very large numbers to generate these keys. How does Linux work with these incredibly large numbers when it generates the keys and also when it encrypts/decrypts using the keys? I mean, raising some arbitrary number to the power of say 65537 for encryption or raising some cipher-text to the power of some 1024-bit number is obviously more than say a 64-bit integer value can store. 

The only other examples I can think of would be a scientific calculator and a programming language like Java (the java.math.BigInteger class).

I was just wondering what course(s) you guys regretted not taking in your degree. I have two more semesters, and I'm trying to take courses that I think I would really enjoy, and that would make me a better software engineer. This summer, I am taking Parallel Computing, which I think should really help. I am also taking Compilers in my last semester, which from what I hear, is an essential course to take with your CS degree.

Now, there are a few courses that I have thought about taking, but I just don't think I would be that interested in. AI is a big one - sounds like it would be a good course to take, but I have plenty of friends who say its quite useless. I don't particularly think I will program any sort of AI in the future, but at the same time you never know, I don't want to handicap myself from doing something because I didn't take a certain class. Graphics is another course that I would like to take, but don't have room for in my next two semesters. Just a bit of background on me... I really like working with large scale systems, I like web programming, and I like mobile app development as well. There are actually a lot of different CS applications I really enjoy learning about - I am more the type of guy who plans on doing the whole start-up gig eventually, but before I finish my degree, I just want to make sure I am getting everything that I should get out of it.

Please, if you know of a thread more relevant to this topic send me a link so this one can die or be deleted.

My mother is currently considering getting a PhD in Computer Science/EE, after just having completed her Master's.  I am a rising 3rd-year undergraduate CS major, considering more education after I graduate.  I am truly interested in computer science and study, and would like to pursue more.  However, I (would) intend to move into a career in industry directly after this, rather than academia.  This leads me to my question:

**In a purely economic sense (interest in research aside), is it worth it to pursue any sort of graduate education in computer science?  That is, as far as you know, do you think I would come out ahead financially in better wage/promotion opportunities in industry with that MS on my CV?  Does it depend mainly on the ranking of the graduate program, the field of research, etc?**

Thanks for your time!


**Edit:** Thanks for the input, everyone!  I definitely have a lot to think about.  I hope someone in the future finds this post useful.

You are reading data records off a stream. You don't know how long the stream is or when it will terminate. You should treat it as a stream of infinite length with elements in random order. Your job is to maintain a current list of maximum top k records as elements are read off the stream, processed, and discarded. How can you do this in O(n) time?

I remember the solution required a buffer where:

    buffer length = 2 * k

I believe it was a variation of a divide and conquer algorithm but only goes 1 level deep, thus giving it O(n) complexity.  The result after reading 2 * k records is the right side (above k) will contain an unordered list of top k records.

You could also do this with a type of min/max heap but that would be O(n log **k**). That's not good enough. We want O(n).
 
Does anyone know the name of this algorithm and its details? I don't remember the optimal solution and it's been driving me nuts.

edit 1: Forgot, the heap method would be O(n log k). derp.  
edit 2: n is the number of elements read so far

1. Why is it so common to use O() notation instead of Θ()? For instance, looking at the wikipedia page for heapsort, it shows [this](http://i.imgur.com/2RfAi.png). If we're talking about the worst-case running performance of heapsort, we know what the worst-case is, don't we? So we should be able to use a tight bound on it (Θ notation), shouldn't we? Why, then do we use O notation instead? Also, how is the best-case upper-bounded by nlogn and lower-bounded by n? There's something I must not be getting, because I thought if you knew the best-case running time, you would be able to put a tight bound on that as well. Please help me.

2. When people say ""the asymptotic running time of this algorithm is [blank]"", what is the ""asymptotic"" part referring to? In the definition of O notation (for instance), we have f(n) = O(g(n)) means that there is some positive n0 and c such that for all n &gt; n0, f(n) ≤ cg(n). Is the ""asymptotic"" part referring to the part where it says ""for all n &gt; n0""? Or is it referring to the fact that f(n) is upper-bounded by cg(n)? Or something else?

Neither are in a hard science, although the latter was heavily economics based.  I love computers and technology and find myself learning about it more and more.  I even managed to put together a tech start up that went down in flames because another company was developing the same thing in parallel and managed to get a bunch of money.  Basically, I got locked out from my potential customer base.  However, I learned that I am happiest when I'm working on tech and computer stuff.  

Unfortunately, I don't have the money to throw around to go back and get a BS in comp sci right now.  I also have an odd schedule where sometimes I have tons of time and others none.  What I do have is an ability to teach myself things at a very rapid pace and with little to no outside instruction.  I would like to build the equivalent knowledge of a BS in computer science.  I'm interested in more than just programming.  I would really like a well-rounded knowledge of computer science topics and then focus on specific languages and technologies.

I might be able to actually take some classes eventually, but I want the basics out of the way.  

Can anyone provide me with some guidance and/or advice on where to start, what to study, what to read, etc? 

For me, this is an intellectual pursuit.  If it turns into something I can make a living out, great.  However, right now, I just want to learn because I like learning.

I come to you today asking for some algorithm development or pre-coding advice. I'm a second semester sophmore studying Computer Science at a local state college. 

I've always considered myself to be an above average programmer (in comparison to most of the other sophmores studying Comp Sci at my college). One of my current computer science courses is ""Algorithms / Data Structures"". The big change to this from my previous courses, is that we used to be given similar code examples for the programming assignments and then asked to create and complete the assignment. In this class, the professor tells us what the program should accomplish and we have to develop the algorithm for the problem and implement it in the program. We are no longer being taught any code or programming. In fact, we are able to use whatever programming language we choose to complete the assignments.

My real question is do you have any advice for conceptually setting up an algorithm and program? Tips or ways of approaching that work for you? To be honest, I have in the past thought about the programming assignment beforehand, and then pretty much jumped right into creating the code. I don't mean to say that I haven't had to develop algorithms...but these seem to be a lot more complex. 

Hope I didn't make that confusing. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

Edit: An example of one of our programming assignments (that I already finished after much trouble) is followed...



""A circular array-based implementation of a queue was discussed in the class. In this implementation a variable count was used to count number of items present in the queue and the condition for both queue-empty and queue-full was FRONT IS ONE SLOT AHEAD OF BACK. A faster implementation declares ""MAX + 1"" locations for the array items, but use only MAX of them for queue items. One array location is sacrificed and makes FRONT the index of the location before the front of the queue. The conditions for queue-full and queue-empty are ""Front==(Back+1)%(max+1) ---- Queue-full""
""Front==Back ------ Queue-empty""
Now, no COUNT variable is require anymore. Write a program implementing this circular array-based approach, which is more efficient and faster.""",,False,,t5_2qhmr,1361729714.0,,,True,t3_195375,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/195375/algorithm_development_precoding_advice/,

Just want to post this in case anyone is looking to take on a big, worthwhile coding project. Nothing groundbreaking by itself, but we fused ideas from other places in a combination we haven't seen proposed elsewhere.

------------------------------------------------

The academic publishing industry is archaic at best, unethical at worst. Read commentary [here](http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Journal_publishing_reform)

Below is our solution to this problem. It would be a huge undertaking to create it and we don’t have the requisite skills/time to do so. We just want to float it on the web so someone else might pick it up and start the process of making it a reality.

Crowd-sourced ratings systems, on a large enough scale, can be very effective (you're on reddit). We envision a publishing system where scientists upload novel research to a cloud-based platform in somewhat traditional manuscript form, including introduction, methods, results, conclusions, limitations, etc. Peers will evaluate these manuscripts by the same criteria that are used today. Diverging from today, manuscripts will be linked to underlying data supporting said manuscripts. The value of the manuscript will be decided by the peer community, rather than by 3-5 anonymous “experts” requested by the manuscript’s author or selected by the journal’s editor. Non-anonymous researchers will evaluate the manuscript for quality/importance, leaving a “score” and supporting discussion for posterity (comments that will also be given a score by reviewers). Manuscript, based on an algorithm, will be given a comprehensive score that will be dynamic (more about algorithm below). Good manuscripts will make the “front page”, their visibility will increase as they’re targeted to “high value” lists, and poor quality manuscripts will fall to the bottom. However, all manuscripts will remain visible/searchable, allowing an idea ahead of its time to receive proper recognition with age. Authors will be listed as now, and each author will be linked to a historical research profile. Each manuscript/comment score is factored into a historical user score, which will serve to weight the importance of comments left on other manuscripts/comments. 

In the end, manuscript submission is completely transparent, has supporting data, includes relevant critical commentary traditionally seen only by authors, eliminates the “third reviewer” phenomenon, rewards authors with novel ideas without regard to institution/financial/ backing/geography, and overcomes problems documented at the polymath project. It would have completely open access. It would eliminate submitter/reader fees, freeing information to all. It would have other perks, but you get the idea.

We envision this system laid out in a three-tier system with a “dashboard” type user interface. The “bottom” level of this system would include all data sets. Datasets would include relevant epidemiological characteristics. Datasets would be linked to citations of data within articles that’d identify which pieces of data, equations, and interpretations were used therein. Checking for accurate interpretation of data by peers would be simple and limits could be built into citation software prohibiting inaccurate data utilization. All new manuscripts would be tied to data in a dataset, though the dataset used might not be new. An independent user might identify something novel in a dataset not identified by the original dataset poster, and he/she could create a separate manuscript from it, giving full credit to the original submitter with data-links. Original posters would be rewarded each time a dataset was used successfully via historical user scores mentioned throughout this article (encouraging submission of data for community processing). This system would reward transparency and thoroughness at original submission.

The “middle” level of the system would include manuscripts and their associated comments. We envision this level being a split screen, allowing users to read the new manuscript, while older manuscripts cited in the new manuscript would come directly into view on the second screen (this could be customizable to allow several manuscripts and data, multiple manuscripts, and outside sources to be viewed simultaneously for cross-referencing). Users could read new manuscripts, give them a rating, and leave comments with citations in the form of discussion here. Comments could address issues with new manuscripts, or the data underlying new manuscripts, directly. Consequently, rather than discrete manuscripts, new information would be disseminated as a novel dialogue, allowing important commentary on new ideas to be included in the historical record (ensuring accountability for new information, providing context, and facilitating quicker synthesis of new ideas with older ideas). As above, good manuscripts/comments would float to the top via a strong score, rewarding the submitter and the scientific community.

The “top” level of this system would be an information synthesis similar to Wikipedia. This level would allow users to cite and synthesize information from manuscripts and comments (as well as, initially, from outside sources) in discrete articles “about” scientific topics. This level eliminates the need for independent external publishing sources, as all discrete information at this level could be linked directly to relevant manuscripts/comments discussing it, making “truth” easily linked to primary sources. Again, users would be credited by the user algorithm for their contributions here.

Underlying this process is an algorithm accounting for the spectrum of user contributions. A user’s individual score would account for all of his historical contributions to the project, including scores for manuscripts provided, when/where/how often each manuscript is cited by other users, constructive comments left, and datasets submitted. Credentials (appointments, higher education, etc), similarly, could be accounted for in the individual user score. Value associated with comments he/she leaves on other manuscripts would take historical user score into account, weighting his/her comments fairly for historical contributions. Similarly, new manuscripts submitted by a user would receive higher/lower baseline ratings based on historical contribution. We envision this score being included on academic curricula vitae, replacing absurdly long lists of publications/abstracts that give no indication of the quality of individual manuscripts.

The beauty of this system is that it allows complete transparency while offering each user a historical rating assigned by his peers. It would include translation software, eliminating linguistic barriers. It would allow new literature to be targeted directly to user preferences, allowing users to customize lists of manuscripts they would like to read and review by key words, discipline, user score underlying a new manuscript, “hot’ manuscripts receiving a lot of attention from readers/commenters, country/state/neighborhood of origin, etc. It would facilitate streamlined and effective literature searches, allowing users to search for key words across the entire body of scientific knowledge, including comments and datasets. It would force improvement of data quality by making data subject to inspection along with commentary on that data. It would facilitate high quality meta-analyses by allowing users to compile original data for processing, rather than processed data from ""peer-reviewed"" articles. It would eliminate siloed departmental research by opening commentary to all disciplines and encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations. And much, much more...

This system could be supported financially by grants, government funding or other charitable contributions. Alternatively, we envision this system having the potential to support itself (and be quite lucrative) through advertising revenue. Because a user’s entire historical research archive would be posted, his/her search and review history would be available, his biographical sketch posted, his discipline noted, advertisers would have a wealth of information for targeting. For example, a device manufacturer selling pipette tips would know that user X recently posted a dataset in which 30,000 pipette tips were used. That company would also know that user X searched for manuscripts from users completing similar research. Consequently, it would be clear that user X purchased many, many pipette tips and advertising could reflect this.

As I said, this is not a comprehensive characterization of the project. However, it offers a good place for someone to start.

I went in knowing almost nothing about web development and learned more than I ever imagined in that small time frame. 

However, I think my interest is starting to wane. I blame my disinterest as being the cause for wanted change because everyone I work with is incredibly intelligent, the company is one of the best, and I've worked through several different projects on multiple platforms.

My favorite classes in college were the ones that involved a lot of math and theory. I would love to actually get to use and work with some of that stuff, but it seems like a graduate degree is required for most of these positions. I don't mind the idea of returning to school, but I still don't exactly know what I would want to research (machine learning, bioinformatics, and computational theory all sound good). 

Another route that I thought might be cool is applying computer science to another field like programming for chemistry, biology, or physics research or something. This may require extra schooling as well, but I think it would be faster to get into and maybe even more interesting. I've been reading a lot of physics books lately, which has kind of sparked in an interest in that area.

Basically, I'm looking for some insight from someone who has been in this position or done something like this.

I'm doing my PhD in the philosophy of mind, more specifically in an area of cognitive science interested in modularity (more commonly known as the Massive Modularity Thesis). In cognitive science, a 'module' is most famously characterised by informational encapsulation (this originally comes from Jerry Fodor's book 'The Modularity of Mind'); that is, a module only has access to information within itself, it cannot access information contained in another module (or anywhere else, for that matter). For various reasons which I won't bore you with, this characterization, although highly influential, is really quite awful. I've read the odd paper or two which mention that computer scientists tend to think of modules very differently, but I haven't had much luck in finding any sources or papers that go into any detail about how modules are defined by computer scientists (closest I got was a computer science text book which used it almost synonymously with 'process', yet mentioned they were technically different without really saying in what way). Does anyone know of any academic papers, articles, or books where a computer scientist discusses/defines what is meant by a 'module'? Any help would be much appreciated.

Repost from /r/PhilosophyofScience.",48,12,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/akof1/gödels_incompleteness_theorems_a_very_readable/,"[*Originally posted at* */r/PhilosophyofScience*](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).

I was impressed when I came across this and wanted to share. In so far as you choose to trust my assessment of such matters, this is the most readable, best supported and comprehensive summary of Godel's theorems I have read (on the internet). A sparkling endorsement of internet learning in my humble view.

**The link [is here at a blog](http://rationalargumentator.com/issue195/godel.html) called the Rational Argumentator.**  The author appears to be a [mathematically trained independent scholar](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/apstolyarov.htm) now working as an actuary and philosophizing in his spare time.  

(For an even more readable, but less mathematically detailed read about Godel's contributions to logic and his personal life, [try here](http://plus.maths.org/issue39/features/dawson/).)

**TL;DR**  : A few memorable quotes from the article that might help put Godel in perspective for some people :

1. *The concepts of consistency and completeness are purely syntactical concepts, meaning that they are all about formal rules and formulas, and don't involve any notion of truth or falsity*


2. *Gödel's incompleteness theorems do not pertain to systems which are not framed in the language of mathematics – such as political, religious, esthetic, economic, biological, and literary systems and bodies of thought. Virtually every such system is incomplete in the formal mathematical sense*


3. *Theories to which Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem applies cannot be described via a finite body of axioms*


4. *Gödel’s proof of the existence of true but unprovable statements can be applied not only to Peano arithmetic itself but to any system which gives one the capacity to assign Gödel numbers to statements. Such a system must be “expressive enough to define the set of natural numbers or develop basic properties of the natural numbers,”*


5. *Gödel himself did not initially view his incompleteness theorems as defeating any of Hilbert’s program.... However, a few years of exchanges with John von Neumann (1903 – 1957), who held the view that “Peano Arithmetic already encompasses all that can be done finitistically,” eventually led Gödel to change his mind.*

6. *If von Neumann was right, then no finitistic proof of the consistency of the arithmetical axioms can be found – because the only such consistency proofs can be done outside the system of arithmetic itself. According to Feferman, most mathematicians today agree with von Neumann. Instead of pursuing a finitistic proof for the arithmetical axioms’ consistency, “much work has gone into extended (or relativized) forms of Hilbert’s program using constructive though non-finitistic means for consistency proofs.*


7. *Gödel’s second theorem showed that the consistency of a system cannot be proved within that system. It is a common mistake, however, to suppose that the system within which such consistency can be proved must be stronger than the original system.*


8. *In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945) proved the consistency of the arithmetical axioms from within a system that is not stronger than Peano arithmetic in all respects. Gentzen combined primitive recursive arithmetic, the “quantifier-free formalization of the natural numbers,”with quantifier-free transfinite induction, “an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets,”up to the ordinal ε0.*  My note: Primitive recursive arithmetic is any many respects *weaker* than Peano arithmetic.


9. *Gödel’s last published paper in the journal Dialectica gave another proof of the consistency of the arithmetical axioms in 1958*


10. *Gödel’s theorems do not pertain to the issue of the existence of an objective reality*


11. *Gödel… saw his incompleteness theorems not as demonstrating the inadequacy of the axiomatic method but as showing that the derivation of theorems cannot be completely mechanized. He believed they justified the role of intuition in mathematical research.*


12. *By showing some fundamental limitations to how the consistency of mathematical systems can be proved, Gödel opened up an entirely new field of human endeavor [theoretical computer science] which has brought unprecedented benefits to billions of people.*",,False,,t5_2qhmr,False,,,True,t3_akof1,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/akof1/gödels_incompleteness_theorems_a_very_readable/,

If enough people commit to participate --- visit, ask and answer --- in the site, then StackExchange will launch a beta of the site, which could in turn become a full site like the two mentioned above.

If you commit at this point, you will get to participate in the seven-day private beta that will start as soon as the commitment reaches a 100% (which should happen anytime soon now). This phase will be a lot of fun, and will decide the general direction that the site will take. 

A few of the sample questions at the site, to give a flavor of what it is all about: 

""Given a language L defined by a Turing Machine that decides it, is it possible to determine algorithmically whether L lies in NP?""

""In [ACM citation] I'm confused how the authors arrived at [assertion] from equation 2?""

""Is there a way to solve [this particular computing problem] in O(n) or O(log n)?""

""How hard is it to unshuffle a string? (See comments for details.)""

I think there could be tremendous value to the community in building a new resource: a spreadsheet/wiki of computer science faculty, and information about them. For example, [I did the one for University of Washington](http://sdrv.ms/WmYZgW) and their subfield, hiring year, title, and schools they went to earn their prior degrees.

Why is this useful?

* Graduate applications: Students who want to apply to grad schools in Networking can immediately look up the active faculty in that area and their seniority (untenured vs tenured). It's also easy to see which universities have a presence in less-ubiquitous subfields like HCI or Information Retrieval.
* We can find out academic hiring trends for different subfields in computer science: which subfields have top computer science departments hired in the past 5 years? How was academic hiring affected by the economy?
* Department rankings: When DepartmentA hires a faculty from DepartmentB, it indicates that DepartmentA recognizes the quality of this student from DepartmentB. We can compute the PageRank for CS departments treating DepartmentA-&gt;DepartmentB as a link, giving us an objective ranking of CS departments. The current gold standard, US News, is [controversial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_college_and_university_rankings_(North_America\)) because of it's based on subjective department chair surveys with poor response rates; this could be a USNews Killer, and include universities outside the United States.
* Tons of other stuff on CS trends, correlation findings like: ""on average phd students will get a faculty job at a department 10 ranks below their phd department, but doing a postdoc will bump that up by 15 ranks.""

If we had complete listings for the top 100 computer science departments, this would be amazingly useful already. I imagine it takes an hour or two to fill out the information for each department (which have 10-50 professors). The information is already out there on department websites, on faculty personal homepages, or in faculty CVs and bios. This means if a couple dozen people contributed a few departments each, we'd have a complete listing by the end of the year.

Is this something people in this subreddit would be willing to contribute some time for? This could be a useful resource for the community, but I need your help.

I have and old musical keyboard that doesn't have MIDI output. So I was wondering about connecting its line out to a sound card and analysing the notes it makes and converting them to MIDI and redirect them to a program that uses MIDI data.

So, the questions are:
Is it possible to make a program that takes notes (well defined with no noise [or maybe very little], one frequency signals) played in sequence and find out their names (their frequency)?
Is it possible to make a program that takes a chord (which are a set of notes played at the same time) and find out its notes?

I'm a student of philosophy specialising in analytic philosophy - especially logic and ontology. Recently, I've been looking into the overlaps between philosophy (of the analytic kind, concerned with logic and math) and computer science, which I have always found to be interesting but daunting. I love logic, and have an affinity for math as well. I have worked with, among other stuff, developing my own systems of modal logic for different concepts. So I guess my basic questions are: Is hardcore theoretical logic of use to computer science, and what are some ways to get to use my skills in logic within computer science? In other words - where do I start? As I said, I'm more interested in the theoretical aspects than in programming. Is it worth looking into computer science from such a viewpoint at all?

I'll use PHP as an example since that's the language I'm using most these days.

    $two = 2;
    $addFromTwo = function ($number) use ($two) {
        return $two + $number;
    };

In the case of the closure, you have access to a variable, in this case $two, in the scope outside of the closure. It's mutable. After the closure is created, I could alter it's behavior by doing something like...

    $two = 3;

With a class, I can do

    class Number {
        public $number;
        public function __construct($number) {
            $this-&gt;number = $number;
        }
        public function add($otherNumber) {
           return $this-&gt;number + $otherNumber;
        }
    }
    $number = new Number(2);
    
In the class instance, I can do the following to change the behavior of the add method...

    $number-&gt;number = 3;

Classes add the benefit of letting me group functional mutations to a set of data, and letting me create several interfaces to a set of data. I can do the same thing with closures, but not in a way that expresses the enclosed data quite as well. Closures, in the meantime, require less written code than a class.

Could someone help me understand which structure is better for different scenarios and why?",,False,,t5_2qhmr,False,,,True,t3_11rg83,http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/11rg83/closures_vs_classes/,

&gt;When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

&gt; * **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with

&gt; * **means of combiniation**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and

&gt; * **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

It seems to me that this can apply to a lot more than just programming languages. For instance, I'm beginning to learn about music. It seems to be that the fundamental elements of music are timing and tone. Therefore a language that is meant to communicate music would need to have primitive expressions for those elements. In fact that is exactly what written music provides. Notes provide primitive expressions, Chords provide combinations of notes while Chord names (D#) provide a means of abstraction.

It seems like this idea can be very useful for more areas than just programming language design and music which makes me think that the mechanisms described are the product of an academic discipline like linguistics.
