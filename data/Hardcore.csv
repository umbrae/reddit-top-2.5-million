1348735278.0,107,self.Hardcore,10k00k,"So i went to a ""hardcore"" show tonight...",135,28,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/10k00k/so_i_went_to_a_hardcore_show_tonight/,"First off, I'm a fan of metal. More accurately I'm a fan of music in general. My taste runs the gambit from classical, bluegrass, to metal and even some pop and hip-hop. I tend to like anything that is talented and showcases that talent and uniqueness. 

I got a call from a friend of mine tonight saying he had tickets to see Hatebreed in Portland at the Wonderball Room. I'm not about to turn down a free show so yeah I'm there. I'm not a huge fan of Hatebreed but I can dig it. I was there to see All Shall Perish. 

The first three sets were good. Deez Nuts, All Shall Perish and Whitechapel. But I'm not here to talk about the bands. They were fine. Music was loud, just how I like it, and i was having a good time. 

During the White Chapel set I started to notice the crowd. Very diverse group of people, young, old, male, female, Hispanics, stoner metal heads, Black dudes and white dudes. I always dig the crowds at shows. Very cool. 

I also noticed that there were the usual couple of guys that were trying to be more hardcore than everyone else and throwing punches and kicking people and just basically begging for people to fight them. 

Ive been going to metal shows and cruising the pit for a long time. I'm 35 and my first real show was Sepultura at the Roseland when i was 15. Over the years the crowds on the floor in the pit have become more and more ridiculously stupid and overly violent in my opinion. It seems that what was once the slam dance or the mosh pit has turned into and arena for people looking for a fight and tonight was the worst instance of  a lack of pit etiquette and disregard for the safety of fellow music lovers I have ever seen.

There was specifically a group of guys (I counted 6) that were blindly running and throwing punches and hitting young women and every one they could. This mentality always gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Every has the opportunity to enjoy the show, women included, without having to fear that they might be beaten in the process. 

I'm aware of what the pit is like, I've been to dozens of metal shows in my life. But watching a 250 lb. guy blinding flailing his fists at anyone near him, in the pit or not really fucking pisses me off. 

I watched this group of 6 guys take the place over. the headliner hadnt even taken the stage yet and there were half a dozen fights and people being kicked out. Every one of these altercations was initiated by this group of guys. I watched them single out a guy that was buy himself not in the pit but on the fringes and pick a fight. They were throwing gang signs and acting ridiculous. No one did anything. Security stepped in for a second and it seemed to stop. The lone guy then left the floor and made his way for the door, he was clearly outnumbered and had decided to concede the concert and leave early. The gang of dudes followed and openly assaulted him before he could get outside. The little dude gave his best but was clearly on the losing end of what appeared to me to be a group of Harcore douche bags picking on a guy for no reason. 

I see this every time i go to a ""Hardcore"" show. Im disappointed in the bands for not saying something.  I'm disappointed at the fans for no doing something. And im just disgusted with the whole scene. It's not Hardcore, its fucking retarded. I see the same thing at ""Rockfest"" type shows where a huge part of the crowd is drunk, picking fights and groping underage girls. It's a fucking shame. 

I really dont know what else to say i just needed to rant.

Call me a pussy and downvote me all you want. True fans will understand what I'm saying. The music isnt about reckless disregard for the safety of others. its not about who's the biggest dick in the yard or who can inflict the most pain on people. 

If this is you, then FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU AND YOUR WHOLE CREW! 

WE ALL paid to see the show. 

And if you're at the show and you see this shit go down, fuckin stand up for your fellow man/woman and don't turn a blind eye to someone else being victimized. fuck....

That girl must have been no older than 17 years old. The ""men"" doing the bullshit were all big grown ass dudes at mid to late 20's and the guy they piled on was smaller than all of them.

I'm finding that the majority of people in my area are really unfriendly and clique-ish.. to the point where if you're not wearing ____ band or ____ band on your shirt then you're not really accepted. This is hardcore punk, what ever happened to unity? 

It is like everyone seems to look the same, has the same haircut (everyone in my area seems to sport the ""50s greaser"" haircut), etc. I miss when hardcore did not have a uniform but I guess as time goes on I suppose things change. The music seems to remain the same with newer bands like Backtrack and Swamps absolutely killing it but now it feels like the amount of elitism and general ""hipster"" (I guess you could say) douchbaggery runs rampant. The other day at a show I saw some guy with cassette tapes in his jacket pocket, showing them off to others. It feels just like everyone wants to 1-up eachother! ""I went to this basement show, I have this album on vinyl"" or what have you

I am probably looking too much into this, but I just thought I would give my two cents. This is what it is like in my area, anyway. I won't reveal my area because I don't want outliers saying ""I am from there, I'm not like that"", I realize you might not be but when I go to shows this is what the general vibe feels like. Again just my two cents, take it or leave it I welcome all opinions.

1357049981.0,26,self.Hardcore,15rso5,Patrick Flynn's note in the 10/17/09 CD,36,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/15rso5/patrick_flynns_note_in_the_101709_cd/,"I was looking at this today, it is my favourite thing about this cd and I thought I would share it with you lot.

""'As the spirit wanes, the form appears.' The singer doesn't sing on the mic half the time. The video looks too foggy. The guitarists play some sour notes. The sound quality is off...These, in my humble opinion, are the complaints of this little document from someone who either doesn't fully relate to the true essence of hardcore, or was not present at the Club Lido, on the 17th of October in 2009. I ensure you this isn't some trumped-up shithead excuse for HH's lack of professionality. This is more of an explanation of why I would like to consider this document of our funeral as a band, fully equipped with blemishes and flaws, is my personal favorite recording of anything we ever did.

Hardcore, to me, is live music. I'm not saying I don't get siked when I listen to the Turning Point 7"" or anything like that on my record player in my room. Nor am I saying it doesn't belong in a recording studio. I just feel it more in it's raw state of the present moment. Say, at a show, around my peers, executedly with just the necessary amount of skill and intensity, that's when it has more of a punch and a deeper cut into the soul. At the show, it's in the moment. Get it right or get it wrong. Doesn't matter to me. Just as long as the heart is there. Thinking back, one of the best live bands I ever saw was Stop &amp; Think. Too busy jumping/skanking to play their instruments looked sick. You ask your average rando' on the street what he thinks of a live performance like that and they'll tell you someone needs a guitar lesson or two. You ask any genuine hardcore kid, they'll tell you that's whats up.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the most awful sounding bands are the prized beacons of hardcore. It's the heart, the moxie, the punch, the spirit of youth they bring forth. Hyper-active doesn't necessarily means it's golden. You can find any of that pre-packaged rage shit at Warped Tour all damn day and night. But it's that ability to look beyond that materialistic fools-gold standard and find the remarkable momentous flare of life that allows one to connect with the comfort of identifying your life and your real interior make-up, with hardcore. It's also that sight that could have a 15-year-old from Massachusetts realistically think driving to Virginia on a Wednesday night to see Count Me Out's last show is a perfectly good idea[didn't get to go. no car]. It's certainly an esoteric culture only the chosen few are happy to belong to.

From the '2003 Demo' to 'Songs To Scream At the Sun', I was always satisfied with our recordings. Being young and new to the whole recording process, I can look back and wish we did a few things differently. We always came in with everything we had. And it was fun and enjoyable. Applying yourself, creatively and immortalizing it on vinyl. A good experience. But, nothing could match the feeling of stepping on the stage and putting it all out there on the floor. 10 people, 10000. We didn't care. The 30-40 minutes we had each night was a chance to let it all go. Something I realize now, a year later, is so incredibly rare and soothing to the soul. I can only hope that in those 30-40 minutes each night, some kid was able to recognize our understanding of that moment the way we did when we were young and watching Bane in Worchester or old Youth Of Today videos in our basements.

I think that's why beyond any professional standard frowning-upon sour notes, lack of singing blah blah doesn;t change my opinion that this recording of Have Heart is my personal favorite recording of anything we ever did. It's not polished like TTWC or without a missed chord like so many other studio recordings. It's a raw one take of just about everything we did together. If someone were to ask me to show them what my band sounded like, I'd give em this. It shows us as we were. not as we would have hoped to be. Everything from the mic passes during parts that belonged to the crowd, to the way we transitioned from song to song, to hearing our friends in the HHCrew goofing around in the background, to the pic slides, etc, etc. If you saw HH between 2002 and 2009, then you'd know that this audio and video was us even more so than our records themselves. We weren't perfect. We fucked up here and there. But I know for sure the heart was there.

So, if you're the type that can't stand something that doesn't measure up to the standards your average major label/mainstream culture puts forth, by all means, return this. Bitch about it to your friends, starts a pro-core band. Whatever you'd like. We're fine with that. We just feel a little sorry for you probably missing out on some classic hardcore bands over the years who never gave a shit about impressing anyone but themselves.""

Here's a more thorough idea of what's going on, taken from the FB page of Hostage Calm...

""EQUALITY UNDER ATTACK: A CALL TO ACTION
Today, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a longtime supporter of Hostage Calm and marriage equality was fired from his job at the Nashville music venue, Rocketown, for wearing his “I Support Same-Sex Marriage” shirt to work. A friend from Nashville contacted me about the situation and told me of Wes Breedwell, this seven-year employee of Rocketown who now finds himself the victim of discrimination. We called this brave man to hear his story, demonstrate our support, and figure out how we can help.

What I heard from him was a long pattern of discrimination against him for not being Christian and for supporting marriage equality. Rocketown is a Christian-owned non-profit community center and venue: not a church. And yet, over the seven years he has worked there, he’s been denied opportunities for advancement and salary based on his non-Christian beliefs. Today, Rocketown fired him for wearing this shirt commemorating equality (along with his non-Christian activity on social media pages). Wes emphasized that employees routinely wear band shirts at Rocketown. So why did this shirt cause such a problem?

It’s important to note that they didn’t fire him for wearing A SHIRT. They fired him because of what that shirt stands for. For what that shirt threatens. 

This shirt represents an idea that all people have the right to live their lives without being told who to love and whose love is more valuable. It represents equality under the law. It represents the freedom to choose.

So how could a youth center not support such a vital, foundational understanding of human freedom and equality as part of their social mission? Hostage Calm has played Rocketown multiple times. In my prior visits, I was under the impression that Rocketown was a positive force in this Nashville community: they had a music venue, skatepark, and other outlets for Nashville youth. But a youth center and music venue cannot be a positive force in the community if it degrades and belittles the value of some of our people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That is the force that tears communities apart, not that enriches them.

I originally planned to make a post today about Dr. King, the status of his Dream, and how we can all work together to realize equality in modern America. This unfortunate event demonstrates that Dr. King’s Dream is still under threat, and that the struggle of the LGBT community for equal standing under the law is a Civil Rights issue of our time. 

Hostage Calm promises to do everything in its power to raise awareness and challenge this injustice in Nashville. We will certainly never play Rocketown again. We’ll continue to post more information as Wes and H.C. take further action. For now, you can help by reposting his story to shine a light on this injustice, and by boycotting the venue. Most of all, please send all your support to Wes Breedwell and his fight for justice.

May Love Prevail,
Cmar, Hostage Calm""


This place has sucked for years but I think now is the tipping point. If you see a show coming there that you want to go to, just go to another city.

There was a huge variety of people there, ranging from their old fans many whom were probably older than my dad, to their younger fans who were my age and many who were younger. To sum up the experience, I nearly lost one of my favorite hats there, one with a Corrupted patch on it, after getting knocked on my ass a few times, only to find it afterwards crushed into a corner of the foot of the stage drenched in beer and sweat, I wore it regardless.

We were completely different people and she had no connections to the scene, and I loved her with all I had. Only problem was that she wasn't very accepting of the hardcore scene and how our mindset is with family and music.

I have found the greatest brothers and sisters that I never had growing up as a child. I have booked and met so many bands that end up becoming family. This scene is one big family. It doesn't matter if we are edge, atheist, vegan, drunk, high, or whatever. We are in this scene for a reason. This scene is family. 

I made a sacrifice. It was either her, or the life I've made for myself. She didn't want me to book or go to shows anymore and basically abandon all of my friends within the hardcore scene. 

I chose the scene. Some of you may find it fucked up, but I am, like the rest of you, some sort of fucked up. It's hard losing someone I cared so much about, but I cannot abandon a family I have had for a very long portion of my life. All of you, even if I don't know you any of you on Reddit, are my family for our passion we have for the music and this scene. 

I am thankful for this scene for getting me through my most fucked up low moments in my life and will continue to do so.

Because I think that some Belgian bands really deserve more attention.

I live in Belgium and the hardcore/post-hardcore scene is pretty awesome here, very much talented bands! And I'm starting a band myself.

Some of my hometown heroes are : [Sparkle of Hope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvQEMbh6kAQ), [Campus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4ggbCrBo48), [When Hope Escapes (live)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ec2oVjopzo), [Grey Like Masquerade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgTvYInxyHQ), [Midnight Souls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLx3ICI2j0), ... Really good bands! And if  anyone would like to check my band out, we're writing songs at the moment, and could need some awesome support! Here it is: [Timekeeper](http://www.facebook.com/timekeeperBE)

I still get the chills if I watch this video's, I saw all bands live more than once, expect for Sparkle Of Hope 'cause they split up when I got to know them. I'm really proud of the Belgian hardcore scene and I hope that I can become a part of it with my band some day. Please everyone that has a little time take a look at the bands! Thank you.

**EDIT**: Okay I get it, I shouldn't have called it hardcore right away. The genre isn't so important to me, I just love these bands and that's the most important. Thank you for having this discussion with me and for the most of you for being kind. It's nice to talk about music and everyone's opinion about it.

1369790251.0,16,self.Hardcore,1f8m4v,Metalcore and Deathcore with ACTUAL Hardcore Influence?,23,7,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/1f8m4v/metalcore_and_deathcore_with_actual_hardcore/,"Okay, so I've always viewed metalcore as hardcore bands from the late-80s through the 90s with metal influence, like Inside Out, Integrity, Snapcase, Mean Season, Unbroken, Unashamed, Strongarm, Despair, Slugfest, Buried Alive, and others of that sort. This style, in my opinon sort of continues today with bands like Burial Year and much of the Deathwish roster like Cursed (RIP; there's a big sludge and crust element there), Pulling Teeth (also RIP; basically sound like intense death-influenced thrash metal with some hardcore vocals), and Nails (plenty of grindcore in that sound).

Mathcore was the more discordant, technical style associated with metalcore that arose in the mid-90s, like Starkweather, Coalesce, Deadguy, Cave-In, Botch, Dillinger Escape Plan, and Converge-- still very much a part of the hardcore scene.

Melodic metalcore was like metalcore, but with the hardcore part replaced with post-hardcore: Eighteen Visions, Vision of Disorder, Atreyu, Norma Jean, Bleeding Through, Scarlet, Training for Utopia, etc. This sort of continues today with bands like the Ghost Inside.

I think there are a lot of people who would probably agree with me up to this point, but here is probably where opinions will diverge.

Deathcore is hardcore with death metal influence, obviously. So I would say that this is stuff like Earth Crisis, All Out War, Merauder, Overcast, and Bloodlet. Hatebreed, down in Connecticut, saw the NYHC and NYDM scenes mixing, added a dollop of Obituary, and made tough guy beatdown moshcore or whatever you want to call it-- the kind of thing that bands like Terror later trafficked in. When it comes to what most people consider deathcore now, I would probably only extend this to maybe early Despised Icon or the Red Chord, but as for my ""hardcore-with-death-metal-influence"" definition, I think only bands like Bury Your Dead, early Liferuiner, the Acacia Strain and Xibalba (not the black metal band, of course) would qualify; maybe Animosity and Dead to Fall.

Now, up where I was defining melodic metalcore, some people might have added Darkest Hour, Shadows Fall, Unearth, etc. but I never heard any hardcore influence in those bands whatsoever. They're basically American melodeath to me-- can anyone point out the hardcore influence? Maybe there's a little in the vocals of Darkest Hour and Shadows Fall.

Now, about modern deathcore, like Suicide Silence, Whitechapel, Emmure, Winds of Plague, and that ilk, I fail to see the hardcore influence. Remember, the modern breakdown came from Suffocation and Dying Fetus, and later Internal Bleeding and Pyrexia. Those early bands basically just sound like either generic death metal, death mixed with some nu-metal, or symphonic death metal.

A lot of the modern bands being labeled metalcore (A Day to Remember, Asking Alexandria, Enter Shikari) are pretty much just post-hardcore or easycore, while the modern label of deathcore is nearly meaningless.

Any thoughts on this? Does anyone have recommendations based on my definitions?",,False,self,t5_2qilj,False,,,True,t3_1f8m4v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/1f8m4v/metalcore_and_deathcore_with_actual_hardcore/,

What about your first show?  I was always into punk bands like Bad Religion and The Virus when I was younger but had never been to a hardcore show nor really knew what hardcore was.  So when an opportunity arose in 2003 to go to a show, I went to a hardcore show headlined by Frostbite. The other bands were Blacklisted, Desperate Measures, Drug X Test, and some other band that I believe turned into what is now called Title Fight.  I was hooked on hardcore immediately. Anyway I came across this video from Frostbite's last show which was a fucking blast for my at the time 15 year old self. Hard to believe that was all 10 years ago.

I'm looking for a guitarist, drummer, and a bassist. More info inside.",19,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/1hby7y/im_trying_to_form_a_hardcore_band_in_queens_nyand/,"[The original Craigslist ad I put out](http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/tlg/3900733018.html)

Like the ad says, I'm looking for a guitarist, one may be possibly in already I'm not sure, a drummer, and a bassist. I do vocals, or yelling really, but play all those instruments, drums and guitar being the main two. 

So preferably I'm looking for people around my age (19), so I would say 18-23 would be ideal, but mid 20s is alright. The sound is fairly straightforward hardcore in the vein of Minor Threat, Reagan Youth, Black Flag, Dead Kennedy's, The Ramones, Fugazi, Discharge, Circle Jerks, Government Issues, etc, with influence from 80s thrash metal and classic metal like Slayer, Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Death, Venom, etc. 

If you're interested, and willing to commit fully, you can contact me  at lobo718hc@gmail.com or just PM me here on Reddit.

For the some who don't know of Hate5six's work here's his about: 

""This project stands for the redistribution of high-quality live music videos in as much of an anti-capitalist framework as realistically allowable. At its crux, music is the communication of ideas through rhythm and sound. The introduction of money into the equation invariably obscures that connection. In an era when the turnover rate in the community is staggeringly high, this site serves as a vehicle for preservation and posterity. Institutional memory is key in any setting, and hardcore is no exception. A band's live performance tells a story about a particular moment in time relative to a particular audience. The intention here is to share that story with people who could not be there to experience it, both physically and temporally, or with those who have no conception of what hardcore is. 

Without an audience, a band is just sending acoustic vibrations into an empty room. Without a band, bodies are just standing catatonically in a room waiting for inspiration or some other activation of the senses. This interface between the two defines an impassable gap between seeing a live show in the flesh and watching a two dimensional projection of said show on a screen. They can never be equivalent, but there are ways to construct a bridge that attempts to close that gap. The retelling of these narratives in this manner is the sole mission of hate5six.com.""

1364211053.0,14,self.Hardcore,1ayuwd,[MODPOST] A proposal to cut down on the amount of recommend threads.,16,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/1ayuwd/modpost_a_proposal_to_cut_down_on_the_amount_of/,"So to cut to the chase, we've all seen these threads. They pop up at least once a week, sometimes more, and the same bands get posted each and every time. There's not much we can do to physically stop these threads, as they don't break any rules or whatnot, but I do believe I have some sort of a solution that will, in time, evolve into something beautiful.

What I'd like to do, with everyone's support, is to create one huge thread purely for bands. Be it big bands, local bands, your own band, any hardcore band that you guys think we should all check out. There's no way to stick a thread on reddit (as far as I can find out) so similar to the guys over at /r/mecoop, I thought about putting a link to this thread in the top bar so you simply can't miss it.

Obviously this can't happen without everyone mucking in. By all means, continue posting songs/bands onto the main page as well, but also add those bands to the thread so that people that have just found the sub, or regulars who just fancy something new, can browse and pick out bands that sound interesting to them.

I thought I'd gauge the community reaction before we go ahead, if like three people think this is a good idea than obviously it's not going to take off and the idea will be dead in the water, but if it's a roaring success it'll be nice to then go on and make some sort of 'database' using the Wiki that each subreddit can have of bands sorted by stuff like sound, area/country they come from, that sort of thing.

So what do you guys think? It goes without saying that we're open to suggestions on how to improve the idea further (if the general consensus is good). Please could you upvote so more people see, this is a self post so I don't get any karma. Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing your comments and ideas!

We have a pretty fun scene down here; but for the love of god, no one plays the drums. I have been playing guitar for a few years and have been recording and mastering random riffs of mine for quite a while. I would love to practice my riffing and what not, but my creativity is stumped because I can't ever find drum tracks that aren't too fuckin' metal.

Anyway, I'm looking for someone with the ability to record and send me basic drumtracks (you don't have to be a savant, I just want some 2 minute tracks to jam the fuck out to). I ain't trying to become the next big thing in hardcore, I just genuinely enjoy playing the shit.

If anyone sends me some drum tracks or whatever, I will record some riffs on it, drop a bass line on it, and master it (okay, I know how to use FLstudio and Audacity, so that's as much mastering as I can do). If by some odd chance one of you redditors is cool as fuck and sends me some good beats and I want to publish it on youtube or facebook, you'll of course be given credit!
