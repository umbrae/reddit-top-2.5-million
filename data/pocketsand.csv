1363526401.0,1672,self.pocketsand,1agnnd,Had to actually use my pocket sand on someone. ,1806,134,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/pocketsand/comments/1agnnd/had_to_actually_use_my_pocket_sand_on_someone/,"It was 8 PM. I was walking through a small forest in the middle of town since it was a shortcut from the track I was practicing at. A large man in a dark jacket and black beanie came up to me and asked for directions. Without hesitating, I told him where he needed to be.

He then opens his jacket and shows me his pocketknife. ""You know the drill"" he said, with a slight, creepy smile.  

As I'm reaching for my wallet, I realized, *I just came back from longjumping,* and there was a load of sand in my pockets from the pit we jump into. Also, I always reload there. 

""Yeah just a second...""

As I pretend to take out my wallet, I scoop up the leftover longjump sand. I withdraw it, pushing into his face and yell **""BAM! POCKET SAND MUTHAFUCKA!""** He shouts ""Ahhh!!! My eyes! What the fuck man!"" then I took off sprinting in the bushes.

We had a lovely time.  We sat on the beach on a blanket having a picnic, it was beautiful weather, I was wearing a new pair of awesome shorts.  Rode the train back and got home super late, threw my shorts on the floor, didn't think anything of it.  

Now this time last week I got a phone call from my mom.  My dad had a stroke; he was doing okay, he was out of life-threatening danger, but they weren't sure of his immediate future.  I freaked out, needless to say.  I had just gotten back from the gym, just gotten out of the shower, and without even getting dressed I booked a plane ticket.  I threw together some clothes and got dressed and jumped on the subway to get to La Guardia.  (Side note:  If you're ever flying out of NYC, go to JFK.  Hell go to Newark, La Guardia *sucks*.)

I get to the airport, get to the terminal, print my boarding pass and shove it in my back pocket.  I get in the stupid godforsaken security line and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Finally it's my turn; ID in hand I step up to the kiosk: ""Sir, may I see your boarding pass?""  I reach in my back pocket and grab it, kinda throw it at him...  And it's full of sand.  I pocket-sanded the TSA.  I didn't know how to react.  He asked what it was and I kinda weakly said ""Uh...  Pocket sand?"" and he just shrugged and waved me through.

1364199672.0,268,self.pocketsand,1aypkq,Pocketsand: A Personal Journey of Enlightenment,304,36,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/pocketsand/comments/1aypkq/pocketsand_a_personal_journey_of_enlightenment/,"I see many posts in this subreddit discussing types of sand, techniques, adulterants, etc., but very few, if any, actually discussing the philosophy behind what we do. So, if you fellow pocketsanders will indulge me, I'd like to talk about the philosophy behind pocketsand and my personal journey toward pocketsand enlightenment.

My story begins back in my teen years (I'm middle-aged now). I was an unruly, undisciplined youth, not caring much about myself or if trouble found me. One day, while being obnoxious in public, I was set upon by an angry group of ruffians whose ancestry and personal hygeine I had questioned. Granted, I probably did deserve a beatdown for what had come out of my mouth, but it was five against one, me being the one. I tried to extricate myself from the situation, but I was quickly grabbed from behind by one person while the other four lined up to use me as a punching bag. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my assailants started dropping to their knees, screaming ""My eyes!"". Four attackers were incapcitated, but I was still being held by the fifth. Before me stood a small, middle-eastern man, slight of build and calm of demeanor. He looked past me, straight into the eyes of the person holding me and said, ""Let him go."" The guy holding me let loose a string of expletives, challenging the man to make him do his bidding. The small man muttered ""So be it"", and suddenly his hand flashed into his pocket. The next thing I knew sand was flying past my head straight into the eyes of the man holding me without a single grain touching me. My attacker dropped, and I stood there stunned. The small man looked at me and said ""Come with me, now!"" I snapped back into reality and followed him as we ran down the block. 

After a few minutes of cutting thru alleys and side-streets, we stopped when we were sure we were not being pursued. I turned to talk to him, to thank him for his help, but he spoke first. ""You are unruly and undisciplined. I should have let those people pummel you, as you deserved a beating for your words. However, I see within you potential. Your spirit is strong and alive. You show no fear. With proper training, you could become a master."" I was confused, so I asked him a master of what. He smiled, reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of sand. He let some of it flow thru his fingrs into his other hand. Then with movement too quick to be picked up by the human eye, he launched the sand into my face. One batch hit me square in the eyes, the other square in my mouth. I dropped down, sputtering, coughing on the grains, trying to rub the sand out of my eyes at the same time. After I few minutes I recovered, and I looked up at the man who had just saved me, only to incapacitate me, with confused eyes. He looked down at me, smiling, and uttered the word that would change my life forever, ""Pocketsand"".

I became his disciple that moment, thus beginning my journey down the long, sandy road I still travel upon to this day. I never knew his name, referring to him only as ""master"". He had me move into his house so I could become completely immersed in the ways of pocketsand. At first though, I was given no pockets or sand. I wore a pocketless robe, and he kept all sand far away from me. The only sand I ever saw was in the hourglass he gave me. He would have me meditate in front of the hourglass. I would watch the sand flow thru the narrow neck, draining from top to bottom. He told me to focus on the grains, observe how they fell, how, like snowflakes, no two grains were alike. I did this twice a day, in the morning after I woke and at night before I slept. I thought it silly at first, completely impractical. Being such an impetuous youth, I wanted some pockets and sand to fill them with. However, after several weeks and several pocketsandings he administered to me when I would become disrespectful, his wisdom began to make an impression on me. I began to take things more seriously. I studied the sand as it fell thru the hourglass to the point I could identify individual grains from memory. I watched the interactions of the sand, how each grain affected the others as they fell. One evening, about three months into my training, he stood behind me during my nightly meditation. As the last grain of sand fell thru the neck, he asked me what I had just witnessed. I told him I saw the sand flow like dry water, guided by glass and gravity, in a similar yet ever-changing dance, falling from one pocket to another. He asked me what that meant. I said it signified an ever-changing universe where nothing stayed the same, that things might stay similar for a time but nothing was permannet. He then asked me what of the pocket. I told him the pocket contained everything and nothing, its contents ever changing, much like the universe. I could see his slight reflection in the curves of the hourglass. He smiled and nodded. ""Sleep well tonight, for tomorrow you take the next step."" 

When I awoke the next morning, I had a new robe laid out waiting for me. It had pockets, but no sand. After breakfast, I followed him thru a set of doors I had never been thru. They opened into a zen garden; a sea of sand with islands of rocks and shrubs scattered throughout. I stood, mouth agape, taking in the peaceful spledor of it all. He handed me a wooden rake saying, ""While you have earned your pockets, you have not yet earned the sand to put in them. You know what to do, now concentrate as you do it."" 

For the next two months, I raked sand. Concentrating on the patterns I made as I raked, studying the movement of the sand. I thought about grabbing a handful of sand, surreptiously slipping it into my pocket, but I knew that was wrong. I also knew I would receive a face full of sand for such a transgression. While my master was quiet and kind, I knew he would tolerate no breaches of discipline and would punish me harshly and sandily. At night, over dinner, he would leture me about sand, invoking memories of his training during his youth. He was Egyptian and had learned the pocketsand ways of the pharaohs. He had studied in the shadows of the great pyramids. He explained how the sphinx, for millenia, had been used as a target for pocketsanders (""You think Mother Nature wore down the stones of the sphinx? Bah! More like thousands of men hurling the grains of the earth at it for thousands of years.""). Over the months, I came to know not only his history, but the history of pocketsand. Stories of the Chinese masters of the Gobi, the sand senseis of Japan, the hurlers of Hawaii, and many others. He spoke of types of sand, grain size, consistency, components. He spoke of the elements, of rain, wind, snow. He spoke of the earth and of rock and stone, and of the nature of the universe itself. I learned so much and was humbled by the knowledge.

As the months rolled by and he began to trust my instincts, he slowly began instructing me in pocketsand techniques. I will never forget the day, that morning in the garden, when he did not hand me the rake, but rather told be to bend down and grab a handful of sand and put it in my pocket. ""Not only do you understand the sand, but the sand understand you."" This was when my training began in earnest. 

The next few years are a bit of a blur. We studied basic techniques for about six months at his house. It took me a while before he told me I no longer threw sand like a spastic, three-legged blind camel. I learned the basics; the ""throw and go"", the ""quick flick"", and the ""hand of sand"". Once I had learned the basics, we began to travel the globe to further my instruction. I learned Bedouin style from the nomads of the Sahara, and Dervish style from the teachers of Timbuktu. I learned from the Navajo, the Greeks, and the aborigines of Australia. I received training from ex-military from the U.S. and Russia, as well as secrets from the CIA and KGB. I became fully immersed in the ways of pocketsand. I swear there were times I could feel the grains flowing thru my blood. 

Finally, after several years of travel, my master and I found ourselves staring out over the sand dunes in the Mojave desert. He looked at me and spoke, ""I have given you all the knowledge I know, as well as introducing you to other masters. You have learned your lessons well. Now it is time for your final test. Walk thru the desert. You know the direction. Meditate then begin your trek in one hour. I shall be waiting for you on the other side."" And so I did. The walk was long, arduous, hot, full of mirages. I used pocketsand to fend of snakes, vultures, scorpions, and even a group of survivalists. Then, as my journey was drawing to an end, the storm hit. The winds welled up, the sand of the desert blowing everywhere. I couldn't see, and I could barely breathe. I struggled to walk, eventually falling to my knees. I had not expected this. I had not trained for such an event. I tried not to panic, but I could feel the sand begin to overwhelm me. I began to weep, the sand blasting the tears from my face, thinking I had lost it all, that all of my training had been for naught. Suddenly though, at my lowest point, a moment of clarity struck me. I realised that this was the final test. I was being pocketsanded by the earth itself. I rose to my feet, stood tall, and stretched out my arms. I captured the flying sand into my hands, and I stared into the storm. I stood there as the storm raged around me, refusing to move or succumb. I could feel the sand pierce my flesh and penetrate into my soul. I gathered my strength, and I performed a kamehameha wave, channeling all my energy into my hands, releasing the sand I held while shouting, ""SH-SH-SHAA!"" The winds parted around me, the sand no longer struck my skin, and I was free to finish my journey. I had persevered.

My master was waiting for me, as promised. As I walked toward him, he began to smile, then laugh. I stood before him and he looked me over with pride in his eyes. ""I taught you well, but, more importantly, you learned well. I was right to have chosen you."" I bowed before him and thanked him for his teachings and wisdom. He smiled more, then reached into his pocket and pulled out a pouch. ""Here,"" he said, handing it to me. ""This was given to me by my master. It is not to be used, but to be passed on to the one you train. It has been passed down for hundreds of generations, and now it is yours to pass on as you see fit."" ""A pouch..."" I began, but he stopped me, ""...is nothing more than a portable pocket."" We looked at each other and laughed. Then he embraced me, kissed me on my cheeks, and said, ""You can learn no more from me. It is time to go down your own path. Never forget your lessons, and always remember that sand, like time, is nothing more than change. We shall not meet again."" And with that he turned and walked away. I stood there and watched him go before finally moving on with my life.

That was many years ago. Though I live a normal life, I live it by his teachings. I still have the pouch, still full of the sand put there by the original master of my school of pocketsand. It, like me, awaits the arrival of a student who is worthy of the lineage it represents. Someday, I'm sure, I will find a pupil who is worthy to teach, though I must continue my sandy journey to make sure I am worthy to teach. Until then, I will continue to live, love, and pocketsand. Thank you for reading my humble story. May you be one with the pocket, and the sand be one with you.

It was a humid summer night as I was riding my razor scooter back to my apartment in downtown. I was very hungry and unfortunately not very alert as my only focus was going home and eating a bowl of Craft Macaroni and Cheese.  Two blocks before I was home I started hearing cat calls from some kids in an alley. I did my best to ignore them as I didn't wasn't any trouble and was very tired from playing Wii tenis at a friends house 30 minutes earlier. Finally, they seemed to disappear, then all of a sudden the three hooligans were directly infront of me. There we stood eye to eye, they inched forward and I felt my heart racing. I was scanning for an escape route, but as they were too close I knew I had no choice. I unzipped my fanny pack, grabbed my hybrid parksand-kitty-litter payload, and threw my sand in a curve motion hitting all three attackers. As they lay on the pavement in pain I made a quick escape to a local CVS pharmacy and hid in the bathroom until the heat died down. To think that I almost left my pocketsand home that very morning.

Update: Yes, I did get my mac and cheese. Craft is a generic brand of box mac and cheese I eat on most Tuesday and Thursday nights. Unfortunately that meal was bitter sweet; in confusion I left my scooter behind.

""It's the story of us, the pieces of pieces of pieces of some once great thing. The indivisible remainder. The lowest common denominator."" He squats by the roadside and drags his fingers through the warm salty sand. He looks up at me, blue eyes squinting in the sun, piercing me. He sighs, resigning himself to another repetition of the same lecture he has been giving me for the past three weeks.


""Your wrist is strong, child, your fingers nimble and you have a keen eye, but you will progress no further untill you understand the grains with your mind. Know the sand.""


I take some sand in my hands, letting the grains slowly sift through my fingers untill there is a single thin layer of sand crystals covering my palm. I hold my palm to the light, choosing first one grain, then another to focus on.


""A Hindu cow could learn a thing or two about humility from a grain of sand,"" the old one continues, ""this one used to be a mountain, a continent, a star. Patience, too. This one has seen things you and I could not even imagine, yet here it sits, apparently placid. Apparently content.""


The palm of my hand becomes dry from the sand but I continue to stare, my gaze being pulled from grain to grain.


The old one goes on, ""what man ever lost as much as any grain of sand? What in this universe could be so utterly abandoned. So completely alone? Every grain of sand has a story to tell and every one of those stories is a tragedy."" I expect to see pity in the old one's eyes, but there is none.


I break my silence. ""How does the tragedy of a grain of sand help me fight? Does it help me calculate terminal velocity? Wind sheer?"" I look across towards the old one but his eyes and thoughts are with the grains. 


I look back to my still-sandy palm, tracing the crystals along the creases in my skin. A continent, a mountain, a star. Some once great thing. The incalculable loss. Something occurs to me.


""Each story is a tragedy,"" I say out loud, eyes focused on a single white grain, ""but none of their stories are over."" 


""Go on.""


""Each grain has had everything taken from it, but all retain something, not despite, but because of this enormous, profound trauma."" I look up and the old one is staring at me. ""Hope,"" I say, ""powerless as they are they still hope, all of them. Completely alone completely together.""

Only after recently marathoning KOTH and having a friend point out this subreddit did I realize what had happened to me.

Back when I was about 14, I went to a park with my younger brother and my older sister. My brother and I were swinging while my sister read a book, when a young kid, maybe 6 or 7, came up and asked us to come see something.

We obliged because why not, and followed him to the top of a jungle gym. He kept telling us to follow and was getting really giggly, but I think we figured he had a dead frog or something. 

We get to where he's been leading us and the little fuck turns around, gets the look of Satan in his eyes, and screams, HOW ABOUT SOME *SANDY EYES*!?

He reaches in his pocket, grabs the weapons, and flings them right at my brother's face. He goes down, wailing, and I laugh for second (big brother of the year) until I realize this monster probably has more sand. He did. He screams the same thing, holding out the 's' at the ends of 'eyes' as he sends more at my eyes.

I luckily had the foresight (and aftersight, as a result) to close my eyes because I knew what was coming, but the beauty of pocketsand is that it doesn't discriminate with the pain. It stings your skin, pocketsand. A bit got in my eyes, and that sucked, but more of it got in my mouth/throat because I was yelling as he threw it. Sand tastes awful, guys. It tastes like sand.

He jumped into a tube-slide and ran off, probably late for his Taliban meeting. My brother and I were stunned for a bit, and he'd gotten a lot in his eyes so I had wait for a bit and make sure he was ok, but eventually we went back to my sister and told her we didn't like this park.

It was jingling around in my pocket and making a lot of noise.  Now, normally I wouldn't have noticed it, but there was an eerie calm in the parking lot at that moment.  Everything was quiet, there was no wind or sound from other cars, just me and my loud pocket.

Anyway, it was getting dark and the fact that I seemed to be the only thing around making noise made me a little paranoid.  I was drawing attention to myself, and anybody could jump out at any time and mug me for my phone or car keys.  

I used to think this whole pocket sand thing was just a joke, that it was all a bunch of bullshit, and the only reason I came here was to get a laugh or two.  I mean, sand in my pocket? What if I accidentally put my phone in there or something?  What would all the girls I sleep with think if sand started falling onto their bed sheets?

Well, now I know it's worth the risk.  Sure enough, there was a stranger approaching me from the darkness.  He'd been sitting there, in his car, just waiting for an unsuspecting victim and his time to strike.  My pocket change must have alerted him to my presence.  My heart started beating faster and faster, my pupils shrank, and everything seemed to go in slow motion.

He said ""Excuse me, do you have any spare change? I just need to make a phone call.""

I instantly froze with fear, staring at him with the widest eyes I've ever had.  There was nothing I could do.  He obviously KNEW I had change in my pocket due to all the racket I was making.  I started to blurt out my usual excuse ""Sorry man, I only have plastic"" but luckily I was too paralyzed to speak.  In a wave of panic, I reached into my pocket, and accidentally pulled it inside-out upon retraction of my hand.  A handful of change fell to the asphalt around my feet, and the noise it created echoed throughout the entire parking lot.

I looked up, the stranger and I made eye contact.  We stared at each other in silence for what felt like hours.  My senses were heightened to everything else around me, the dog barking in the distance, the lone penny from my pocket rolling into the gutter, and suddenly the parking lot seemed to be teaming with life.  How long had I been with the stranger? I did not know, but all attention from the recent parking lot denizens was now upon me.  This was the most frightening moment of my life.

I finally willed myself to move, sprinting for my car.  I had forgotten where it was and fell three or four times, dislocating my shoulder, until I finally found it.  In agonizing pain, I fumbled for my keys and started the engine.  One of them was there, knocking on my window, asking me if I was alright.  

Oh God why?  In my haste, I shifted into the wrong gear and floored it, causing smoke to waft up from the hood of my car.  Luckily I was able to make it to safety, but I think I caused serious harm to my transmission.  Now I have medical bills, car repair bills, and am left with a traumatic experience that will scar me for life.  ...Not to mention I ruined my favorite pair of pants due to a certain detail from the incident that I choose not to share.

I can't help but think all of this could have been avoided had I just filled my pocket with sand.  The sand would have prevented the change from rattling, and I would have been allowed to walk to my car in peace, with my arm, engine, dignity, pants, AND change intact.

I only have one word of caution, however, with regards to this technique.  It should only be used for stealth as throwing pocket sand + change at someone to escape may increase the likelihood of said individual charging you with assault.  When using pocket sand for stealth, make sure you have a backup pocket filled with sand (and sand only) if you feel you need that extra layer of security.  I recommend wearing either some type of pocketed coat, or (if it's warm out) a pair of these: http://i.imgur.com/VSu8viJ.jpg Just note that said pants may also increase the likelihood that a perpetrator may anticipate that one (or more) of your pockets my be filled with sand, giving him the foresight to approach wearing safety goggles.

Deploying my PocketSand quickly subdued my attacker, however, there was another man. Seeing that I had exhausted my supply of PocketSand, my friend reached for whatever he had in his pocket. He deployed a handful of change straight into the attackers face (with excellent form I might add). While it wasn't quite as effective as PocketSand, it subdued his attacker long enough to get into the car and escape. 

We were very lucky to have escaped our attackers unscathed, so use this as a lesson. When travelling with companions ensure that you carry extra PocketSand, and explain to them the clear benefits of carrying PocketSand and maybe even supply them with the first pocketfull. 

While other methods such as PocketChange may have worked well enough in this situation, there is always the chance that you may not be so lucky. We all hope never to have to deploy our PocketSand, but it is always best to be on the side of safety!",,False,self,t5_2unq9,False,,,True,t3_1j2yus,http://www.reddit.com/r/pocketsand/comments/1j2yus/a_story_about_pocket_change/,

* **Most Dedicated Pocket Sander:** /u/duisnipe
* **Most Dale-like Pocket sander:** /u/swa17 for [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pocketsand/comments/15krco/best_way_to_quickly_collect_pocket_sand/c7nckn4)

* **Best Pocket Sand GIF:** [My Favorite Dale Moment](http://i.imgur.com/o78MV.gif) submitted by /u/bout_mah_altrock.

A few notes before I continue. All winners should have already received their month of Reddit Gold. To avoid a conflict of interest I have awarded my Reddit Gold to my nominator, /u/dyktmm. I have disqualified /u/skindeepofmad for nominating himself, leaving the **Pocket Sander with most Creative use of Pocket Sand** award without a winner. The mod team of /r/pocketsand will hold an emergency meeting at a later date to decide what to do with this extra gold, for /r/pocketsand is a non-profit organization. We will likely make a separate post once we have decided how to award this gold.

We moderators here at /r/pocketsand would like to thank all of you pocket sanders for a great year. This has been the best year for pocket sand since 2001 because of all the fine folks, like yourselves, that make this community a helpful, intriguing, and informative place for pocket sand. While sand and it's related adjectives have gotten a bad name in the past few months, pocket sand is stronger than ever. The future of the 2nd amendment is uncertain but so long as we have our pockets and a wisely-chosen environment we pocket sanders will stay strong. Stay prepared. Stay safe.

After much debate we mods have decided that the most beneficial way to use this Reddit Gold is to give it to the Redditor with the best demonstrative pocket sand original content. This could include a video showing proper pocket sand throwing technique, a video showing proper pocket sand safety, an illustration showing different pocket sanding techniques, an info graph showing the benefits of different pocket defense material, or any informative thing your brilliant minds can think of.

To submit an entry simply press either of the two links directly below the search bar on the right side of the page. The most upvoted post will be declared the winner and granted a month of Reddit Gold and their work will be featured on our sidebar to teach future pocket sanders. If we mods find any other submissions worthy of going in the sidebar the submitter may receive an as yet undetermined consolation prize in return for allowing us to use their link.

The so-called ""boss"" in the post is me. I have to tell my own side of this story. As a young child I had a traumatizing experience in the pre-school classroom. I was minding my own business playing with tonka trucks at the classroom sandbox. Out of no where Joey, who I thought my best friend, threw a shovel full of silica into my face. It got in my eyes, nose and ears. Not only was I left physically in pain, but I was emotionally scared for a long time.  

A few years past and for a long time I was scared to come near any fine to course grain materials.  I feared sand boxes, avoided beaches, and had to leave a high school lecture about the Sahara desert.  Finally after therapy I was able to face my fears and begin work in an area with many silica like materials.  At first I was a simple labourer, but my skill was quickly noticed and I became a manager.  Everything well until that day.

My idiot, ignorant employee threw a mitful of base gravel at me.  Base gravel being a mixture of sand weekend only by a few small pebbles.  I yelled in fear and dodged the blow as my life flashed before my eyes. After a minute to calm down I realized the joke my employee pulled.  I sat him down and had a serious discussion about the dangers of pocket sand.  He needed to know, then I gave my employees the many hazards of short range, light weight weaponry.  We were behind a day on our job, but I think this safety discussion is necessary to everyone. I hope no other person has to go through an experience like this.

I am an amateur historian, so if there are any archaeologists that can add to this I would welcome any additional information.  

Pocket sand has been speculated to have begun amongst early man.  Obviously early man had no pockets but instead evidence suggests that men wove reeds into baskets that hung on loin clothes. These ""loin baskets"" are believed to initially contain not sand, but foraged food. 

With the encroaching ice age, early man had to make technological advances, including sewing animal pelts together into pants.  With food becoming scarce in the harsh climates, our ancestors had little food to fill their pants baskets, so to satiate their appetites they often ground sand into a paste with snow.  In the ice, sand was a hard commodity to come by, so early mans basket was often filled with sand.  

From the Dauterive cave painting, we can see that sand was initially used as a defense against predators.  It was soon realized that sand was a powerful weapon. Once the climate stabilized men sought not to overcome nature, but to conquer.  It was soon that the tribes were warring with each other. With no rules on the use of sand it quickly became apparent that humanity could not survive such brutal conflicts. 

In a defensive strategy used by weaker tribes a basket was concealed under another pelt. This gave them an advantage in that attackers could not tell if they carried sand or not.  The resulting stability in tribal politics created a never before seen peace among the tribes and humanity flourished.

I compiled these stories from various sources who I shall not name to protect then from our big government attempting to control our rights to carry particulate defensive materials.

Let me enlighten you, friends.

(Some tips)
If you do not use pocket sand humbly, you must commit sand-seppuku. You must throw sand in your own eyes repeatedly for 1 day, waiting 5 minutes in between.

The SHASHASHA comes from the way it sounds in your pocket when you run, and is only used in success and as a distraction.

It is highly reccomended to not use all of your sand in one throw so that if you miss, you may attempt to throw some more.

It is mandatory as of 2010 that you listen to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTAXUYLbFYk video at least 15 minutes a day, or watched it for 5.

Anyone who is a master of the sand must be reffered to as a ""Sandman"", or, as a multiple, ""Sandmen"".

Becoming a Sandman is not easy, it takes many years and is very hard work to become a Sandman.

It all started around 1270 A.D. in Asia. There was a small city-state that was barely heard of near Mongolia called ""Pocknsad"", which is where the term originates from. Little is known, but here it is:

1270 - 1390
There were a few people who carried around sand in their pockets because they filled their clay pots with them to ensure it was hard for thieves to get away. One day some ruffians attacked. They didn't have anything to defend themselves, and, being in sandstorms often, simple threw them in their eyes. They fell to the ground and screamed.
The group of men who had the sand ran away and yelled to cause a distraction. They used this alot, up until 1390 when some rules were established.

1390 - 1680
It was then established as mandatory to yell Sh-Sha-Shaaa when having success pocketsanding someone, or otherwise it would be unhumble(see Tips). Some people simply used it to distract people, some used to for self defense, and other used it simply to cruelly hurt people. Sand-seppuku was created.
People then discovered proof of a man made of sand who was wise: they called him ""The Sand Man"". Some say he was the first user of pocket sand, others say he was just wise. Either way, it was found out that he taught 15 legendary ""Sandmen""(See Tips). Many people seeked those men for training. They, however, could not live as long as The Sandman himself and only taught 5 people each. There were now, as of the year 1664, 75 Sandmen alive. The next year, one of the originial 15 Sandmen died, lowering it to 74. At this point it was much required you spend lots of time focusing your life on pocket sand, and, if a Sandman, collect at least 3 disciples to teach until you die. If your Sandman dies before he can teach 3, the other two (or one) disciple(s) must commit sand-seppuku and must go through training again.

1680 - 1970
From then on they are used as such before; However, here are a few tales regarding an espionage agent who used Pocket Sand.
Richard Conway: US Agent
One day, he was lurking looking to sneak past a guard to an executive area to some extremely important documents. The guard was patrolling in a very short radius. Conway then tried to sneak through; the guard had caught him. The guard was pulling his gun out of its holster when his face was bombarded with a large amount of sand. He heard Sh-Sha-Shaaa. He fell to the ground and clutched his eyes, not being able to see. Conway had used pocketsand. He grabbed the documents and got out of there safely.
That is only one of many accounts of pocket sand being involved in espionage.

1970 - Present
It is still used much the same way, but it is often considered unhumble or disrespectful when you do not listen to the following video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTAXUYLbFYk
for at least 15 minutes a day, as of 2010.

There is only one known account of a Sandman on this website: belfegore. He was taught by a Sandman and is now one. I too, am a Sandman, taught by Sandman Lucius Neran III. It is unknown who taught belfegore. You can see his story here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pocketsand/comments/1aypkq/pocketsand_a_personal_journey_of_enlightenment/
There are currently accounts of 276 living Sandmen. This religion has much died away. Good luck friends, and feel free to ask questions.

May your pockets be filled with sand,
