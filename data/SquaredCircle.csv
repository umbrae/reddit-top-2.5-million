1371615131.0,678,self.SquaredCircle,1gmugo,"Just watched Bryan and Orton again, in light of the news, and this is what I picked up: a long read, but it's really fascinating how it went down, and what Orton did to protect his opponent.",765,87,195,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1gmugo/just_watched_bryan_and_orton_again_in_light_of/,"Like most of you, I read what was reported from PWInsider earlier about Bryan's injury being legitimate, and when it happened. Now, I believe what I read from them, but I wanted to go back and see what I could pick up. 

It seemed like a work to me last night (although the finish seemed odd to me, considering how Orton was acting heelish and calling Bryan the weak link in an interview from earlier). After watching it again, it's pretty obvious what happened. 

Bryan was clearly injured after the missile dropkick, not the suicide dive into the wall. Several minutes pass between the two, including Orton hitting Bryan with the kendo stick, a commercial break, and Bryan continuing to act normal. Lawler is talking about how the dive looked like it hurt Bryan, but it's just the normal selling of a big move. 

After the commercial, Bryan pushes Orton off the turnbuckle, and hits a missile dropkick. It's hard to tell from the angle, but it doesn't look like Bryan lands in a weird way. Although when you look at how he always lands from one of those--flat on his back, instead of rotating and landing on his front--it is a pretty big bump to take. 

Bryan's laying there, and the ref doesn't seem to think anything's up. After a bit, he's leaning over Bryan and talking to him.  Orton now realizes something's wrong, as you see him very clearly reach over and squeeze Bryan's leg. I guess this was a ""You ok?"" gesture. 

Bryan eventually gets up, and knowing what we know now, it's very obvious that there's something wrong with him, and he's trying to work through it. He seems to be okay mentally, but his left arm is just hanging at his side. For those who don't know what a stinger is, his nervous system is basically shocked, and he's presumably lost feeling in his arm. 

He starts kicking Orton, his arm still dangling, and Orton hits him with a suplex. Orton then looks at the ref--it's tough to hear what he says, since the sound gets muted, but I think it was ""What the fuck?""

Bryan ends up on the apron for the ""Vintage Orton"" DDT, and Orton is leaning over and burying his face in the back of Bryan's head. I'm guessing he's checking on him, and Bryan's trying to say he'll be fine. It gets reversed, and they go through a ""No Lock"" sequence. 

Orton slingshots Bryan to the apron, where he tries to skin the cat, but is having trouble with his arm.  He eventually gets up there, and Orton kicks him to the floor. This is where Lawler really starts talking about how it looks like Bryan has ""lost some feeling in his upper body.""  I'm assuming everyone now knows Bryan has a stinger, and they're telling Lawler in his headset to sell it, because they're either going to call the match, or will need some time to sort things out.  

The ref blocks Orton from coming outside, and the doctor crouches over Bryan. The doctor makes a ""call it off"" motion with his hand to the ref, who gets back in the ring. Bryan sees all of this, and is noticeably angry. He yells something at the doctor I can't hear, and you see the doctor nodding his head, like ""Too bad, I'm stopping it.""  Bryan then gets up and runs past him. 

The doctor is very obviously surprised by this...he's kind of reaching out towards Bryan, like he wants to stop him, but it's happening too fast. It's actually pretty funny the way you see his hands flailing around. He looks at the ref and makes another motion like ""No, I'm definitely calling it.""

Bryan immediately starts wailing on Orton, who's kind of clubbing him on the back. I'm guessing that Orton either saw what happened, or the ref yelled it to him while they were tied up. Orton immediately throws Bryan back to the outside, follows him out, and does a belly to back suplex on the barricade...which you'd think would be a tough move to take, but it looks like Orton is the one taking all the impact.  Mind you, this all happens *very* fast.  

Orton then puts his hands up in a ""What was I supposed to do"" gesture. The ref and the doctor both lean over Bryan, and the doctor makes a much bigger ""It's over"" gesture than before, and the ref calls for the bell. The camera stays tight on Bryan, who looks angry. They cut back and forth between Bryan and Orton, and when the camera zooms out, there's several referees standing nearby. I'm guessing they ran out to stop Bryan if he tried to start up again. 

Sorry for the wall of text--maybe I'm the only one who's interested in this sort of thing, but I find it fascinating when things don't go according to plan in professional wrestling. And let's face it: this kind of thing definitely doesn't happen every day. 

What I found most interesting is the role Orton played.  I've never been a big Orton fan, but what he did in this match was nothing short of amazing.  He seemed far more concerned with making sure Bryan was okay than he did with hiding things or continuing the match. He blatantly squeezed Bryan's leg, was obviously talking to him before the DDT spot, and after the doctor tried to call it off, he immediately improvised a move that was totally safe for Bryan, and also looked painful enough on camera that would give the ref and doctor another opportunity to stop the match. Orton then went over and hugged Bryan, talking to him quietly at the same time.  He really acted like a professional here, and a guy who knew exactly what to do in order to protect the guy he was in the ring with. 

As for Bryan, I don't blame the doctor or anyone else for stopping the match. While I respect the hell out of Bryan, and he certainly has the right to say that he knows when he's legitimately hurt and when he's not, we're still talking about a guy who continued to wrestle after he detached his own retina. At any rate, I'm glad he's okay, and I hope no one backstage was angry with him for trying to keep going, or for going off on HHH. Right or wrong, you've got to admire his commitment.

EDIT: Thanks for the positive comments. I wasn't sure if anyone else was as interested in what happened as I was. I'd encourage everyone to go back and take another look at the later parts of the match--it really is a fascinating look at the passion some guys have, and the brotherhood of being in the ring with someone.

Which matches are you excited for? Are you predicting on Dolph Ziggler's cash in? Cena's/Orton's heel turn? Let's discuss in the comments! ",,False,,t5_2sljg,1365368694.0,,straightedgesoc c0,True,t3_1bv2zd,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1bv2zd/official_pre_wrestlemania_29_thread/,

- Pretty much all of this info comes from Wikipedia or some form of wrestling wiki. Take this with a grain of salt.

- For the clips of each maneuver, I tried to use footage of the wrestler who innovated the move using it, though this wasn't possible in some cases.

- Some of these origins are particularly debatable, and I will try to point these out.

- I will be updating this list for as long as it takes. If you have a suggestion, notice a link is broken, that I got something wrong, etc. please leave a comment or message me.

Hello folks!

This will be the last email you'll get from me, but I'd like to thank you for all of your support since last June.

I started Wrestling with Subtitles to get subtitles on wrestling DVDs in North America.

In January, we hit our goal of 1500 signatures. In February, I sent the petition to WWE, TNA, and ROH.

In late February, TNA contacted me to let me know they will now begin putting subtitles on their DVDs for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing wrestling fans.

And today, May 23rd, I gained knowledge that WWE will now include subtitles on their new releases effective June 2013.

I want to thank you for all your support!

WrestlingWithSubtitles.com will now become a blog / opinion site for all things wrestling. We hope to see you there!

Sincerely,

Max Zaleski 
Wrestling With Subtitles

edit: Hot damn, a post of mine got to the front page and became top post. That's a first. Not sure if people are confused or not but I'm not Max, I'm just a guy who supported Wrestling with Subtitles and got the email earlier this morning. And yeah, the title was written to swerve you guys.

I don't believe there's a single show in the world that can compete with the look of a WWE broadcast. Concerts, touring shows, shows in Vegas...you name it. 

The sets, the lights, the pyro: everything from top to bottom is world class. I mean, look at Wrestlemania last night: that setup was as much of the star of the show as anyone who performed. 

And let's not forget that these guys do so on a brutal schedule. Setting up, tearing down, loading everything into cases, packing semis, going on to the next town to do it all over again. Everyone from the people who design the sets and entrances to the guys who do the heavy lifting deserve credit.

At the height of its existence, the group consisted of Triple H, Ric Flair, Randy Orton and Batista. Each of the members represented the best in ""the past"" (Ric Flair), ""the present"" (Triple H), and ""the future"" (Randy Orton and Batista) of professional wrestling.

[Evolution's spine-tingling entrance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrS8vXwcQ9k)

So Evolution -

* The 16 time Heavyweight Champion of the World, the Nature Boy:  **Ric Flair** (WOOOO!)
* The Animal: **Batista**
* The Legend Killer: **Randy Orton**
* The Cerebral Assassin, the Game: **Triple H**. 

Together they ran Raw for years during the period between the Attitude Era and the PG/Cena era today.

----------------------------------------------

Let's take a quick look back at the history of one of the greatest factions of all time:

* [The debut of Evolution on Monday Night Raw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZLPaT2z05w)

* [Triple H, Randy Orton, Goldberg, Y2J, HBK and Nash - Summerslam 03 for the World Heavyweight Title Part 1](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9g51l_elimination-chamber-summerslam-2003_sport#.URl9Y2e1SlJ). [Part 2](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xizwga_elimination-chamber-match-summerslam-2003-2-2_sport#.URl8-2e1SlI)

* [Triple H wins back the WHC title in a Triple Threat vs. Goldberg and Kane - Armageddon 2003](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDk8I7xL18)

* Following Armageddon, Ric Flair and Batista held the Tag Team titles, Randy Orton beat Rob Van Dam to become the new Intercontinental champion, and Triple H pinned Goldberg to become the World Champion. Evolution had conquered Raw.

* Triple H was feuding with Benoit \(the 2004 Rumble winner\) and HBK for the WHC on the Road to Wrestlemania XX. [This left Evolution to feud with...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l7OB_KecAAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l7OB_KecAA). 

*  [ The subsequent WM XX tag match](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xwvccf_the-rock-mick-foley-vs-evolution_sport#.URl-DGe1SlI)

[Ending](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1zosr_chris-benoit-wins-the-title_sport#.URldFWe1SlI)

---------------------------

* For the next few months in 2004, Evolution feuded with Shelton Benjamin, Shawn Michaels, Benoit, Edge, and Cactus Jack. [Randy Orton vs. Cactus Jack in an INCREDIBLY brutal Hardcore match - Backlash 2004](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xx4hue_randy-orton-vs-mick-foley-pt-1#.URlfKGe1SlI). [Part 2](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xpaujc_randy-orton-vs-mick-foley-pt-2_sport#.URlfO2e1SlI)

* Triple H received one final shot at the World Heavyweight Championship, on the July 26, 2004 episode of Raw in an Iron Man match. Earlier that night, Orton won a number-one contender battle royal for the World Heavyweight Championship. Benoit retained the WHC and faced Orton at Summerslam...

[Part 2](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9l8tr_summerslam-2004-randy-orton-vs-chri_sport#.URlfn2e1SlI)

* So Randy Orton had done it! The youngest WHC of all time! [Here's Evolution's reaction to the result of the Summerslam match from Raw...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU74Mi8F1Ps)

-----------------------------

* [It was around this time this classic Raw moment happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoupKozQ2Sk)

* On December in Raw, Triple H, Edge and Benoit had a match that ended in a double result. Therefore the title was vacated. [GM of Raw Eric Bischoff decided that the title would be decided inside the Elimination Chamber at New Year's Revolution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0tEmtoGSYg)

--------------------

* On the following night's Raw a number-one contender's match saw Orton pin Batista to gain a title shot at the Royal Rumble. [Triple H vs. Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Title - Royal Rumble 2005](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xqakun_wwe-royal-rumble-2005-triple-h-vs-randy-orton_sport#.URlpAWe1SlI)

* Batista meanwhile had plans of his own. [He made some noise in the Royal Rumble match itself...](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xnm0xp_wwe-royal-rumble-2005-30-man-match-hd_sport#.URljDme1SlI)

* Batista was the Rumble winner and Triple H was the World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H saw a chance for Evolution to run the WWE. He told Batista to jump to Smackdown and challenge JBL for the WWE title at Wrestlemania 21. Let's see what Batista decided...

**KEY MOMENT: In one of my favourite segment endings of all time on Monday Night Raw: [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuNrMkQqQ8). [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFTWFPE7u7s)** PLEASE watch this - at the very least from 5:55 onwards on part 2. It is one of the most memorable moments in Raw history.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


* And with that Evolution in it's original form was on it's way out. Batista and Triple H feuded for a while with Batista ending it with a win at Vengeance inside Hell in a Cell.

Evolution was one of the greatest factions of all time. They were dominant and successful, and kickstarted two monster careers for Orton and Batista. The role Flair took up was perfect for him, and the Game did what he did best - run the show with his viciousness and ruthlessness.

***So if you wake up one day, and you’re lying in a hospital bed, and you’re all beat up and you’re wondering to yourself what in the hell happened, then there's just one answer for you: Evolution has just passed you by.***",WWE,False,,t5_2sljg,1360627111.0,linkflair-WWE,,True,t3_18c0m3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/18c0m3/the_history_of_evolution/,

These nuke promos have been stale for weeks, it's been the same gimmick for years and honestly, does anyone actually buy North Korea as a world champion?

On the subject of Japan, it's hard to take their new face promos seriously when they've got this whole ""tentacle rapist"" gimmick.

Speaking of things that havent been relevant since the ""Artillery era"", its good to see that they're squeezing Germany into this Korea storyline to keep Germany relevant, but honestly, Germany hasn't been getting any noteworthy heat since their tag team storyline with Japan against USA and UK ages ago...

Oh, and when the fuck are they gonna start pushing the UK again?

1365546252.0,360,self.SquaredCircle,1c0rkk,The #1 Thing You Should Take Away From April 8th's RAW,409,49,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1c0rkk/the_1_thing_you_should_take_away_from_april_8ths/,"While the crowd was a delightful hive mind last night doing everything they could to drive the show, the important thing is that the WWE is **celebrating it**. Their Youtube page has multiple [videos](http://youtu.be/FaLJMptvdS4) [posted](http://youtu.be/aFAOMEg2Br0) about the crowd alone and even interviewed Mike Chioda about the [chant he got](http://youtu.be/srzH5TiJehI?t=3m37s) during Sheamus/Orton. This is a huge turnaround from merely a year ago.

Don't forget that last year after 'Mania WWE tried to cover up the fact that the crowd was chanting Daniel Bryan's ""YES"" catchphrase in order to protect his heel integrity. When that didn't work, they tried to pass off that the fans were ""taunting"" Daniel Bryan. No one believed it for a second and, if it wasn't for Team Hell No, Bryan may have lost all the instant appeal those ""YES"" chants were giving him.

Last night, the same thing happened when the crowd hummed Fandango's theme in unison. If this was the WWE mentality last year, the announcers would have either not mentioned it so it could be downplayed later or make claims that the fans were ""trying to take Fandango off his game"" or ""getting in Fandango's head."" This time, however, they just mentioned that the crowd was, in fact, humming Fandango's theme. No spin, no angle, just pointing out that the crowd was having fun.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the #1 thing you should take away from last night. The WWE is not only acknowledging that the crowd had a mind of it's own, it's celebrating it. Instead of protecting the company line, they are allowing the WWE Universe to be the centerpiece of a show when they damn well deserve to be. This mentality may also lead to Fandango *at least* becoming a cult classic in the vein of Val Venis and D-Lo Brown. The WWE loves talking about Wrestlemania moments, but on April 8th's RAW, the New Jersey crowd had their moment etched in stone.",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,wwespin c131,True,t3_1c0rkk,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1c0rkk/the_1_thing_you_should_take_away_from_april_8ths/,

***So who's this John Cena guy I'm always hearing about?*** 

-John Cena (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena) is, plain and simple, this generation's ""HUlk Hogan character"". He debuted on Smackdown in 2002, shortly turned heel and developed a white rapper gimmick, based on Vanilla Ice. In his meteoric rise to the top, Cena ran programs up against industry greats like Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Brock Lesnar, and even the Undertaker. He defeated the Big Show in his first WrestleMania appearance in 2004. By the same time next year, Cena defeated John Bradshaw Layfield (formerly Bradshaw of the APA) in the co-main event of WrestleMania 21 to win his first WWE Championship. After that win, he was drafted to Raw and has since become a 13-time world champion, defeating pretty much every important name in wrestling; Batista, Triple H, Randy Orton, Edge, Shawn Michaels, etc. In 2011, the Rock returned to the WWE and faced off against Cena in a ""Once in a Lifetime"" match at WrestleMania 28, which the Great One won. However, in 2013 at WrestleMania 29, the two faced off yet again with Cena walking away the victor and the WWE champion, solidifying himself as one of the all-time greats. Although statistically John Cena is quite possibly the greatest wrestler on the planet, WWE crowds are generally split in half, with the women and children in favor of his ""Superman-like"" character, and the internet ""smart marks"" hating him for a limited move set, and being relatively the same for the past decade since breaking into the main event. 

***Did WWE have any major factions?*** 

If you watched WWE during the Attitude Era, you know about Degeneration X. They had a small return a couple of times, but never really reached the same success as the original group. This is mostly due to the company's newer direction towards a more family-friendly product. Evolution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(professional_wrestling)) is the greatest of the post-AE factions. The group was put together by Triple H 2002 as a means for him to keep his world heavyweight championship. He brought in the legendary ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair as his manager, and occasional in-ring veteran. Dave ""The Animal"" Batista was brought in as the rookie ""muscle"" of the group, followed by the up-and-coming Randy Orton (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton) as the young blue-chipper seen as the future of the company. During this time, Orton developed his ""Legend Killer"" gimmick, where he would start feuds with WWE Hall of Famers and other legends, in order to defeat or humiliate them, thus ending their legacy and building his own. The group lasted until 2005, when Randy Orton won the world title from Chris Benoit. Originally Triple H was supportive, but when Orton refused to surrender the title to him, Evolution literally dumped him on his head and ostracized him from the faction. Batista was the next to turn, winning the Royal Rumble and facing Triple H at WrestleMania for the title. Eventually, Hunter and Flair would go at it, effectively ended the reign of Evolution. 

***You mentioned Chris Benoit. What's the deal with that guy?*** 

Chris Benoit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit) is one of the greatest pure professional wrestlers in the history of the business. He worked in WCW but came over to WWE and after years of working the mid-card, he rose to the top and won the world heavyweight title from Triple H in the main event of WrestleMania 20. He spent some time on top of the company, but in 2007 after he missed a pay-per-view, police were alerted to his home, where he was found dead along with his wife and son. There's been a lot of speculation over that, but what the official police report is that he murdered his wife, strangled his son and then committed suicide following his actions. His sister-in-law recently came out and said years of concussions did not cause the incident - contrary to popular belief - and that Chris had a serious steroid abuse problem, which caused roid-rage that likely lead to the double murder. His death, and the death of Eddie Guerrero, Andrew ""TEST"" Martin and several others have caused a more strict policy when it comes to violence in the wrestling ring, and WWE has now completely banned head shots with weapons. 

***I know Raw and Smackdown. Were there any other WWE brands?*** 

-WWE brought back the ECW brand in 2006 as a weekly TV series, following a successful ""one time only"" PPV experiment in 2005. The show ran from June of 2006, but was inevitably cancelled in February of 2010 after ratings continued to drop. While it started strong with ECW Originals like Paul Heyman, Rob Van Dam, and Tommy Dreamer, ECW quickly became an obvious developmental program, losing the interest of many mainstream wrestling fans. Many consider WW-ECW a failure - both in ratings and content quality - however, notable stars given their first ""big break"" include The Miz, John Morrison, and CM Punk. 

***OH, TNA WRESTLING! I'VE HEARD OF THEM! WHO DAT?*** 

-TNA Wrestling (http://www.impactwrestling.com/) is a lower end competitor to WWE, although they draw much lower ratings and are generally not a threat to World Wrestling Entertainment in any way. Originally they featured a six-sided ring, which became their signature, but when Hulk Hogan became a partner in the company circa 2010, he did away with the gimmick in favor of a more traditional and polished product. TNA has been criticized for being a haven for ""washed up WWE stars"", as many who hav quit or been released from WWE have landed in the company. This includes such greats as Kurt Angle, the Dudley Boys, Jeff Hardy, Christian, Booker T, Mick Foley, Rob Van Dam and Eric Bischoff. Despite the criticism - and there's a lot of it to go around - TNA consistenly offers great in-ring wrestling and has brought up their own crop of original talents; AJ STyles, Samoa Joe, Bobby Roode, James Storm, Chris Sabin, Austin Aries, Christopher Daniels, Kazarian and Magnus are among some of the best wrestlers in the world today. In 2013, TNA went on the road, taping and performing live episodes of their show, Impact Wrestling, all around the United States. They also cut down to four major PPV events of the year, the biggest among them their annual Bound for Glory pay-per-view in October. Leading up to Bound for Glory, there is a tournament across several months, where the competitors accumulate points, and the top four stars at the end compete for a spot to face the world champion in the main event of their biggest annual show. The company is also famous for taking in ""The Icon"" Sting after the closure of WCW; he has stayed with the company ever since. 

***So who's a big deal in WWE today?*** 

John Cena(see: above). CM Punk is (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM_Punk) the current #2 guy in WWE. He was an upper-midcard star, albeit a damn good one, until 2011 when he sat down on the entrance ramp and cut one of the most iconic promos of our generation (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OS9wZGb_3g). He spoke candidly about hating Vince McMahon, backstage executives like John Laurinaitis, and claimed the company would be better when Vince was dead; although admitted that his ""idiot son-in-law"" wouldn't be much better. That single promo put him on the map, and he defeated John Cena to become WWE Champion (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKD-7LH_PvA), and briefly left the company with the title. He is now a 5-time world champion (6 if you count ECW) and, apart from Cena, is the top player in pro wrestling today. Other top stars include Randy Orton, Sheamus, Alberto del Rio, Mark Henry, Daniel Bryan, Dolph Ziggler and Ryback. 

***So what's going on with the younger guys on the roster?*** 

WWE is in a state of up-and-coming talent right now. It's actually a PERFECT time to get back into wrestling. After years of having a generally stagnant roster, and seeing the same tired feuds and matches with veterans, WWE is focusing on bringing up new talent to rebuild the roster. Currently, the faction known as THe Shield - Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns - hold the tag team and United States titles. They are all WWE rookies, although two have a lot of experience in the independent circuits. Daniel Bryan is one of the most popular guys in wrestling today, and in my opinion (for what it's worth) he's the best wrestler on the planet. He and Kane were an odd-couple tag team for the past year, but have recently broken up, are on relatively decent terms, and Bryan is now in line for a huge main event singles push. Other younger talents to watch out for are Dolph Ziggler, Big E Langston, Bray Wyatt, Wade Barrett, Curtis Axel, and Antonio Cesaro. 

***I recognize Brock Lesnar. What's he got going on?*** 

Brock Lesnar was a WWE Superstar for a sneeze between 2002 and 2004. He did more in that time than most wrestlers will accomplish in a life time. He defeated guys like The Rock, The Undertaker, John Cena, Big Show and Kurt Angle in quick secession. After making a ton of money in WWE, he left to pursue other interests. After failing to make a splash in the NFL, he took up mixed martial arts, and became a dominant UFC Heavyweight Champion. His UFC run was as short as his WWE run however, after he developed diverticulitis and had to pull out of a few fights. He returned to WWE in 2012 with a new part-time contract forcing him to only wrestle a few dates a year, despite making a ridiculous amount of money. He faced John Cena in a brutal match at Extreme Rules on PPV, and entered into a trio of matches with Triple H that started at SummerSlam and carried through into WrestleMania this year. He is tentatively penciled in to return at SummerSlam this year, facing CM Punk; both men are friends of, and formerly managed by Paul Heyman. 

***So what should I watch to get caught up?***

Well...here's the bad news. I'm out of room in this post (max 10,000 characters!) and I don't want to take the time finding hundreds of videos. So I turn things over to this fantastic WReddit community to find awesome things to watch, and post them (WITH LINKS) in the comments section.

It's sad that he really didn't get a ton of title runs (at least with WHC or WWE) but non the less he is one of the most respected guys out there.

**Tonight's card:**

* Tonight, on the pre-show, the newly-loved fan favorite, The Miz, will go one-on-one with the America-Loving, America**n**-hating Swiss Superstar, Antonio Cesaro, for the United States Championship! 

* Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) will finally put their differences behind them, as they must defend their WWE Tag Team Championships against the coordinated Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow.) 

* In a rematch from a few weeks ago, the Mexican Aristocrat, Alberto Del Rio, must defend his newly-earned World Heavyweight Championship against the destructive monster, The Big Show, in a **Last Man Standing** match. 

* The Traditional Royal Rumble match will feature thirty superstars from the past, present, and future, all vying for an opportunity to challenge either the WWE Champion, or World Heavyweight Champion, at Wrestlemania XXIX. [Who win this year's Royal Rumble?](http://imgur.com/cNn1MnQ)

* **FINALLY!** The Rock... **has come back!** to the Royal Rumble! CM Punk, the longest reigning WWE Champion of the Modern Era, must defend we coveted WWE Championship against the People's Champion - the most electrifying man in Sports Entertainment - The Rock. However, if the Shield  is to interfere in the match, CM Punk is to be stripped of his beloved Championship, ending his respect-earning reign.

I’m going! SO FUCKING KEEN!!) and also makes fun of how ‘fake’ wrestling is, even though she’s never seen a match.

Anyway, she was over my place a few days ago when RAW came on. I convinced her to watch a match or two to see how she liked it. 

First up it was Orton vs. Fandango. It was around the time when Orton hit the superplex she admitted wrestling was not as fake as she thought. When Orton then hit the DDT off the ropes she was convinced Fandango had broken his neck... By the RKO she was literally in tears. Like actual tears. I kinda felt bad.

So, after seeing some poor young dancer be absolutely decimated she didn’t want to watch anymore. But I convinced her to just watch one more match… which was Del Rio vs Dolph Ziggler.

After about the fifth time she thought Ziggler had been killed, I had to turn it off.

Yeah, so, my girlfriend hates wrestling now.

Some just don't have video up on the net, sad to say. But this is pretty goddamned comprehensive.

Before anybody complains about a match being missing or how the older matches don't stack up or whatever: wrestling ratings, even from an expert like Meltzer (and Dave Meltzer is as comprehensive a wrestling critic as has ever lived) are still subjective. Plenty of people think that he systematically underrated WWF matches during the 1980s, for example (Savage/Steamboat at WrestleMania 3 only got four and a half stars), and he's never watched enough lucha by his own admission. On top of that we have to take into account that a five-star match in 1988 probably wouldn't be a five-star match today because the sport evolves and changes.

But still: this is a SHIT-TON of awesome wrestling here, people. Do you want to become a fan of All-Japan Strong Style for life? Start clicking on anything with Misawa or Kobashi in it, then work your way out. Want to see some amazing lucha? There's some here, including the absolutely insane Los Gringos Locos match from When Worlds Collide in 1994 where the fans were about ready to MURDER Eddie Guerrero if he won the match. Want to see what women's wrestling REALLY is supposed to look like? Those AJPW women's links will school you on why Manami Toyota is basically the best wrestler who has ever lived ever, male or female (I personally recommend the Toyota/Aja Kong match or the final Toyota/Hokuto).

So, enjoy. This is RASSLIN EDUCATION right here, folks.

THIS WILL AFFECT POLICY!,367,69,296,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/s6t6s/ok_guys_lets_seriously_talk_about_the_direction/,"Upvote this to get it the most visibility please.  I get no karma.  

-----

There's been more and more talk recently about how this place is slowly becoming less about discussion and more just a place to karma whore with funny pictures.  

When I started this place I started it for a place for people to *discuss* wrestling with a community they felt a part of.  And I think we've done an amazing job with that.  But slowly it's becoming less about discussion and more just about karma whoring.  I don't want that.  I've said in another thread I don't want to become [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) but I'm fine being /r/movies.  

I know we've always been about ""hey do whatever!"".  But we've also always been about reflecting the wants of the community and more and more are speaking up against the direction we're going.  So here's where you guys come in....

**What should we do going forward?** There's a few options I can think of, and you're more than welcome to throw in your own and discuss all of them...

* Go self posts only.  This totally takes out karma whoring because self posts dont get any.
* Ban image memes.  Pretty much if it's in [/r/AdviceAnimals](/r/AdviceAnimals) it's not allowed here.  If we go this way should we ban [/r/SquaredCircle](/r/SquaredCircle) created wrestling ones too?
* Ban [Fixed] type posts and other similar ones.  If it should be a reply, make it one.
* All images must be directly related to wrestling.  For example you can't post a picture of a guy dressed a tree with the title ""LOL Nature Boy"". 
* Ban DAE/this guy type posts.
* Hiding/disabling upvote and downvote arrows

Note: the bullet points above are not changes we're making yet.  Just ideas of changes we can make. 

**PLEASE SPEAK UP! This is going to affect this place moving forward so if you want change you need to say so!!**

His thoughts on John Cena:

""I think there's a streak going involving John Cena that both the WWE Universe and the media have failed to pick up on. The glory days of 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin lasted two, maybe two-and-a-half years. That was the peak of his run. He came back as General Manager, but day-to-day, going to every city, main eventing every Pay Per View, the focal point of Monday Night Raw… Steve Austin's peak was two-and-a-half years. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's peak was along the same lines. John Cena has been the focal point of WWE since 2005. For eight and now going on nine years, John Cena has not only main evented all the Pay Per Views, been the major attraction on Raw. John Cena has gone to every city, main events all the live events, and yet he still makes all these media appearances, he's done more Make-A-Wish Foundation visits than anybody in history…and he's a tireless workhorse. And he shows up last Monday with his elbow…looking grotesquely…is that a word? His elbow was so messed up and yet he says, 'Wrap me up, I'm going out there to perform because the people are counting on me.' There is a work ethic to John Cena that is to behold.""",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,,True,t3_1kfxbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1kfxbv/paul_heyman_makes_a_point/,

She's a future HOFer in her own right.",386,111,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1i25pu/vickie_guerrero_arguably_the_most_underrated/,"There's a lot of things I don't like about the current WWE product, but one thing that is right is using Vickie for as long and as much as they have.

All you can ever hope for in a heel valet is that he/she be a good mic worker and get consistent heat. So you can strap a young performer onto them and have them elevated alongside them. Heyman was the best, but he's been gone. The gap between Lesnar and Punk, for example. Cornette, Bischoff, Sherry ... Vickie is better than all of them, IMHO. She's the best.

No one on the entire roster gets as much consistent heat as she has for the past 10 years. No one.  One screech of ""excuse me"" and the whole building erupts in boos. The Cougar nonsense, the Laycool shenanigans, its all wildly absurd and entertaining. More importantly, other talent have benefited from being paired with her. The pairing with Edge and later Ziggler clearly elevated their status as top-level heels and she's put over AJ before her heel turn. AJ went from a barely used new talent to the leading storylines after that.

True, her record has been mixed with establishing other heels i.e. Thwagger and Escobar, but I chalk those two up to poor writing out of creative, poor booking all around. And poor skills. Thwagger is worthless on mic, you can't build up a top heel if the crowd is laughing at how silly he sounds during the whole promo.

The fact that she's so hated by the crowd is all the more remarkable considering she's Ed's widow and everyone loved Ed and his family, it was so much harder for her to establish herself as a universally hated, top heel. People felt sorry for her when she first was on-screen and they were delighted at how obnoxious and evil her character turned out to be. She made it so easy for you to dislike her.

I'm glad that they hinted at Ryback being paired with her. Reeves is probably the most misused talent in the company right now. Putting some of her heat onto him is desperately needed, at this point, if they want to save his character. He just needs to squash people and stay silent, let Vickie do all of the talking. He'll be a respectable heel with that formula.

And I genuinely respect the fact that she's hit the gym, lost over 50 pounds and has done ring work.",,False,,t5_2sljg,1373549966.0,,colt,True,t3_1i25pu,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1i25pu/vickie_guerrero_arguably_the_most_underrated/,

I noticed a picture of Hogan on the wall behind the register. It was surveillance footage of him at the register. I pointed to the picture and asked the man ""Is that Hulk Hogan? What was he doing in this area?"" The man (who was the owner of the place) said ""He bought wine cooler and he is asshole!"" I laughed and said ""I'm a wrestling fan and I hate him for my reasons, why do you not like him?"" The man said ""He owe me money! He walk out and he still owe me money!"" 
I was laughing and asked him to tell me more. He said, in his very thick Korean accent, ""He pay with credit card and it declined. Hogan said 'let me give you an autograph we can call it even, brother.' I told him no, I want money!"" He then went on saying that Hogan took the wine coolers and said ""I'll get you back, brother. Don't worry, brother!"" 
I was almost in tears because he was imitating Hogan with his Korean accent. 

**TL/DR**
Hulk Hogan went to a liquor store and tried to buy WINE COOLER but his card was declined. He then tried paying for it via an autograph but the owner declined. Hogan left the store saying ""I'll pay you back, brother"" 

**Edit 1**  I will try and go back to the store and ask the owner if I can get a video of him saying it.

(PART 1)",299,39,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1eupk6/limited_move_sets_part_1/,"On the Road to WrestleMania this year, I saw a lot of people bitching about the WWE limiting people's move sets. This argument got a lot more heated after the CM Punk / John Cena match which seemingly pulled out all the stops and included not only a piledriver, but a hurricanrana as well.

So starting the Monday night after WrestleMania, I decided to start doing a little research. With my keen powers of DVR, I watched, rewound, and every single move every performer did in the ring through six weeks of RAW and SmackDown events. This had a few downsides, as it started to numb my enjoyment of some matches as I became more familiar with everyone's moves, but I think it gave me a little more insight into how different wrestlers put matches together in their heads. 

A few notes before we begin. **NO PUNCHES, KICKS, OR OTHER STANDARD STRIKES WERE RECORDED**. The list would be way too long. However, if a wrestler pulled out a European uppercut or headbutt or a strike specialized to their arsenal, it was added to the list. **LOCK UPS, REVERSALS, AND CHAIN WRESTLING WAS NOT RECORDED**. There is very little chain wrestling in the WWE, but what there is was not recorded. You'd have to hold a submission for more than five seconds to count. **MORE MOVES DOES NOT MEAN MORE DIVERSE**. Some guys had more TV time than others. Some guys had relatively little TV time and used it very well. Some guys had a lot of TV time and looked good... but did the *same old shit*. Others were on TV but didn't have matches. I only wrote down what happened in the ring during a match from *bell to bell* and only *moves that actually connected.* Say, Dolph Ziggler went for a top rope Blockbuster but Del Rio ducks? Wouldn't count. Good? Grood. Great and Good.

Finally, guys... beside the fact that this is a wall of text coming your way (I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure it's worth it), *I don't know the name of every improvised move*. I'm pretty sure I wrote down different names for the same or similar moves under different wrestlers. Sometimes, I wrote down bullshit just to cover my ass at the moment. If I did and you have no idea what I'm talking about? I'm sorry. If need be, I'll try to find a GIF or JPG or YouTube, but I can't promise anything, 'cause seriously... six weeks.

So lets get Colt Cabana to do it!  Not only is WWE out of the question for getting anyone to do an AMA, but Colt Cabana's would be way more entratining anyways!

Here's how I propose we go about it. **Starting Friday** we  ......

* Bombard twitter with #ColtAMA

* E-mail  coltwrestling@gmail.com respectfully asking him to do one.

* **[Buy some of his merch](http://www.coltmerch.com) or [download some of his stuff](http://www.digitalcolt.com) and in the instructions field ask for an AMA**

I bolded the last point because I think it would be the most effective.  We get upwards of 10,000 unique hits a day here.  If only 10% of us buy something and ask for an AMA thats still 1,000 requests and thousands of dollars for Colt.  

Since this is starting Friday I say we take the next day or two to iron some things out and maybe make some sort of official letter to email.  But we will make this happen!

I'm communicating with Colt right now to set up an AMA some time soon.  In the mean time, still support the guy! Wrestling Road Diaries is awesome, his premium podcast stuff is well worth it, and he's one of the few guys with shirts you wouldnt be embarassed to wear in public.

1375993749.0,248,self.SquaredCircle,1jza61,The virtually unknown story about how the WWF may have purchased WCW so quickly and for such a bargain price...,288,40,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jza61/the_virtually_unknown_story_about_how_the_wwf_may/,"I mentioned the following story a few times in various comments recently and seemingly nobody has heard it before. I knew it wasn't common knowledge but I didn't think this story was virtually unknown to almost every wrestling fan on the internet today. So I decided to write up this summary to give a new perspective on the sale of WCW.

For those that have watched to lots of shoot interviews both by RF Video/Kayfabe commentaries and the various radio shows/podcasts all over the internet, you may remember [Kevin Sullivan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gLXjKthSU) and Jim Cornette (who were on both sides of the exchange of WCW) mentioning on different occasions that there was a 'man on the inside' that sabotaged WCW on behalf of the WWF and that made the deal possible for WWF to purchase the company so quickly and so efficiently.

&gt;WWF's end of fiscal 2001 report (released 7/28) notes that all of the intellectual properties and assets of WCW including the trade name, tape library and other intangible assets were sold by AOL- Time Warner for a staggeringly low $2.5 million.

&gt;This is despite an offer from Bischoff/Fusient Media Group for $48.3 million, just days prior to the sale to WWF.

&gt;The Fusient offer included a $5 million deposit  - so, even if the deal had collapsed, TBS would have picked up double what they've now got from Vince.  Moreover, Fusient had agreed to take over every contract - relieving AOL-Time Warner of more than $15 million in salary payouts.

&gt;Instead, as thing now stand, Time Warner will be paying Goldberg more in one year than all the money they got from the sale of WCW.

Brad Siegel, who was in-charge of WCW and the sale of the company, was friends with Stu Snyder, WWF's President and COO from 2000-2001. They both worked together previously at Turner and Stu Snyder is currently the President of Turner Broadcasting Company after returning to the company years after he left the WWF. Both of them were in-charge of negotiating the sale of WCW to the WWF.

Keep in mind, at the time of WCW's cancellation, WCW Monday Nitro was STILL the highest rated weekly show on TNT (and with that, ANY network owned by the company).

The following quotes are from Bob Ryder (Former WCW Employee and current Director Talent Bookings &amp; Travel for TNA Wrestling) via 1wrestletalk.com on July 30th 2001...

&gt;""While Fusient was still at the negotiating table [and negotiating in good faith], Siegel was contacting his friend Stu Snyder at the WWF to figure out what needed to be done to make sure the WWF got the deal."" According to Ryder, Siegel and  "" Stu Snyder (the top WWF exec who brokered the deal) were friends and co-workers when Snyder worked with Time Warner. It is widely believed that Siegel offered the job of WCW President to Snyder near the end of the Busch era, but that Snyder turned it down and went to work with the WWF.""

&gt;""When it became obvious that the only way the WWF could get back in the hunt to buy WCW would be if the shows were cancelled...that's exactly what Siegel made sure happened.""

&gt;""Siegel sabotaged his own company by convincing Kellner to cancel the shows. He did that AFTER he made a call to Stu Snyder and found out the only way he could make a deal with the WWF was to cancel the shows."" ""Once the shows were cancelled, that narrowed the potential buyers to one.""

&gt;""There were at least four offers from people who were willing to pay much more than the WWF paid..... A group headed by former WCW exec Jay Hassman had tried several times to be included in the bidding, and they were ignored repeatedly.""

Now while all this is shady, it's also illegal. Because AOL Time Warner was a public company, this could be considered sabotage and could have been investigated by the [SEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission). Brad Siegel could have gone to jail if there was an investigation and all this was true.

&gt;The nub of Ryder's argument is that whatever Siegel's reasons for getting rid of WCW to WWF - ""Siegel's actions weren't in the best interest of stockhoders...""

&gt;""How stupid do you have to be not to realize that it's a better business decision to take an offer of say $20 million with $5 million paid upfront in cash as opposed to a deal totalling $2.5 million that leaves you liable for $15 million in salary to people who will be sitting home taking paychecks for three years?""

&gt;""The way Brad Siegel handled the company was at best inept leadership. At worst it was criminal.""

Also keep in mind, AOL Time Warner was in chaos at the time. Time Warner/Turner just completed a 'merger' that had AOL purchase them (though it was branded as a merger) when AOL had less profit and less assets all because Time Warner's CEO Jerry Levin wanted in on the internet boom and was practically tricked into accepting the sale of Time Wanrer (CNBC named him as one of the ""Worst American CEOs of All Time""). That merger [widely ridiculed](http://www.theonion.com/articles/ted-turner-sends-self-back-in-time-to-prevent-aol,141/) as the [worst deal in history](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businesslatestnews/6937916/The-shortlist-for-worst-takeover-of-the-century.html). The merger led to Jamie Kellner being named head of Turner Networks.

So when people blame AOL Time Warner's merger for WCW's desmise, they aren't kidding. Warner Bros merger with Time/Turner was a big deal too because it put new people in-charge that didn't have a relationship with Bischoff, making the entire company bigger with oversight over it's properties, thus the push for them to go more family friendly when the WWF was murdering them with mature programming.

Regardless, one of the interested buyers of WCW was apparently Jerry Jarrett (who eventually started TNA).

&gt;WCW gave Jerry Jarrett all the information he needed to make a bid but Jarrett was stonewalled by WCW. Ryder claims it wasn't Bischoff who did the stone walling.

&gt;""Early in the year, before Busch left...Jarrett was brought in to meet with Siegel. Several things were talked about, and Jarrett let Siegel know that he would be interested in buying the company if it ever ended up being put up for sale. When it became obvious that the company was going to be sold, several groups started trying to put deals together. ....Jarrett received virtually every important financial document needed to put his deal together, and still has those documents. My conversations with Jarrett were always along the lines of his wanting to make sure the company was bought by someone other than Vince McMahon.He [Jarrett] was stonewalled...but ultimately it was in favor of Vince McMahon, not Eric Bischoff. When Siegel pulled the trigger on the deal, he ended up blowing everyone else out of the water so McMahon was the only one who could buy it. Jarrett was being represented by one of the top investment bankers in the country, and Siegel refused to return his calls. (Bob Ryder Tuesday, July 31, 2001 - 07:39 pm)

So you may ask; why this isn't mentioned more often? Well it's because statements like this are pretty heavy accusations. Those in-the-know have moved on. Nothing can be done about it now.

How do we know that this true? We don't but Brad Siegel and Stu Snyder were friends and were in-charge of negotiating the deal with both parties. Most of what is said above is fact. The amount WCW was sold for. The amount Fuscient was offering. It didn't make much sense from AOL Time Warner's perspective to begin with if you just go by the facts.

**TLDR: There is substantial evidence that Brad Siegel, head of WCW in 2001, purposely sabotaged World Championship Wrestling (including getting the time slots cancelled) in order to sell it to his friend (Stu Snyder) on behalf of the WWF and did so in a way to avoid several potential buyers who were willing to offer much more. All this was illegal and Brad Siegel could have gone to jail if the exchange was investigated and he was ruled guilty for it.**",,False,,t5_2sljg,1375994481.0,,,True,t3_1jza61,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jza61/the_virtually_unknown_story_about_how_the_wwf_may/,

- The original idea was to be ""along the lines of the famous Dallas soap opera storyline of who shot JR"".

- Vince's entire family including his real-life brother Rod McMahon (and his own family) were to appear on TV and attend a funeral for Vince.

- According to a former WWE writer, Vince might have wanted to build up an army of stars to reclaim his throne upon returning. Other ideas were to have Vince grow out his hair, beard and fingernails while he was off-screen.

- In the end, there would be a full on investigation about whodunit and Mr. Kennedy would come out about himself being the illegitimate son of Vince (before they brought it back and had it be Hornswoggle) and inherit the company.

- From there, the WWE would do a Kennedy vs. Stephanie/Shane storyline to fight over control of the company with the conclusion at WrestleMania 24 where Vince would return alongside Kennedy.

Don't know about you guys, but while this sounds ""too good"" to be true, I would have at least given the WWE props for the effort &lt;_&lt;

1362155269.0,241,self.SquaredCircle,19gvz4,"So Jake 'The Snake' Roberts called me (again) last night, and I talked to Scott Hall!",278,37,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/19gvz4/so_jake_the_snake_roberts_called_me_again_last/,"So, in a previous post I told you about when I spoke to Jake Roberts a little over a week ago - http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/18wgf2/i_just_spoke_with_jake_roberts/

So, last night, my phone rings and it's a blocked number, so I'm thinking telemarketer or something.  I answer it and low and behold it's Jake Roberts again.  I can only imagine that with all the people he has to call, he simply forgot that he called me already.  While the last phone call was only 3 minutes, this one went on for 10!

Jake was super-awesome to talk with.  He seemed even more positive that a week ago.  I found out that the videos on DDP's YouTube page are a little bit behind and Scott Hall has been sober for 39 days now, which is awesome!  Jake was really selling me on the yoga and talked about his appreciation for everything Dallas has done for him.  He said he hasn;t talked to anyone from WWE about doing anything in the future, but he's still away from that and he told me that he's about a year away from returning to action.  I told him I had my hotel room booked for New Orleans for Wrestlemania 30 and he said he hoped he and Scott could stand side by side and walk that aisle together.  Jake told me that his slogan was 'My History is not My Destiny' and that Scott's was going to be 'The Last Call with Scott Hall'.

Then, out of nowhere, he says 'hold on a minute'.  I thought he was going to wrap things up, but all of a sudden I get a 'Hey yo' on the line.  Scott Hall is talking to me!  Scott immediately asked where I was from and I told him and shared a memory of when I saw him beat Dean Douglas for the IC title here.  Then he told me a story about how he went to an ECW show as Justin Credible's guest and Shane Douglas and Bam Bam Bigelow kicked him out of the locker room and locked him out of the building.

I'm really rambling here, so I'll end by saying both guys sounded great and things are really good in both of their lives right now.  One thing Jake did mention is that because of the success of his Indie-gogo campaign, they are going to do one with Scott Hall because he needs his hip replaced, so stay tuned for that.

If there are any questions I may be able to answer.  Jake told me that he is going to be in my city for an event in the next few months, and that I should stop by and remind him who I was.  I will do my best to sell him on doing an AMA.

Peace.",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,dusty2,True,t3_19gvz4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/19gvz4/so_jake_the_snake_roberts_called_me_again_last/,

This ... is ... amazing. As someone who saw Bryan Danielson in the indies, and watched him transform into a WWE Superstar and then knock ever single thing they asked him to do out of the park, this is comeuppance, man. Daniel Bryan is literally the best and not only that, the guy 'playing the character' is genuine and extremely kind. 

I can't possibly think of a better scenario for WWE right now. We are witnessing the birth of the next Stone Cold, John Cena etc.

Before I get to the changes that are going to be implemented I first want to make it clear that the intention was to never take the fun and humor out of here.  I love this character of this place and the entire community.  Just like wrestling itself, it never takes itself too seriously.  I personally feel like the changes being made keep the spirit of this place alive and help make this a great place for talking about wrestling as we grow larger.  

With that said.....

* No more [FIXED] posts.  If it's should be a reply to an image post it in that thread.  
* All images,video,and other similar content must be directly related to wrestling.  Text added to an image or a wrestling related title don't count.  To use an example I used earlier, post pictures of Ric Flair all you like but images like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jEYj4.png) aren't allowed. 
* DAE or ""This guy/PPV/theme song/etc"" posts will only be allowed as self posts.  If you want to talk about how great someone is then actually talk about it. 

**Edit to expand on ""this guy"" posts meaning.**  We're looking to avoid posts that are links to something that we feel works better as a discussion.  We get that you like Shark Boy.  Tell us why!  Pictures of you and/or your friends meeting wrestlers are ok. 

That's it.  I feel like this is a great balance of everyone's input and will go a long way to stopping this place from becoming a karma whorehouse as it grows.  

Please note that users will not be banned for posting something against these, or the spoiler, rules.  Posts will simply be deleted with a PM sent to the user explaining why.  We haven't banned anyone yet and we never want to.

There's been a bit of concern as of late about the state of our little slice of the internet. The growing concern of the ""rules"" of the subreddit has led to some frustration. While I can certainly understand why people are upset about the changes, the only way any forward progress can be made is through constructive dialogue.

I propose that everyone endeavor to participate in a forum-wide discussion of establishing a better sense of structure to our home. This is where we go to discuss wrestling. Here, we are supposed to be safe from those who would choose to mock us for enjoying professional wrestling. There is no need for us to gang up on one another because of company loyalty, personal beefs, or high school drama that occasionally happens between mods and the rest of us.

I left the old subreddit to come here because someone messaged me and promised me a place where I would be free from people like JohnnyHyperion. We could relax and not have to worry about moderators making changes and acting swiftly with their power. These new changes, positive or negative, occurred under the false sense that this forum needs governing and restricting. With just over 10,000 subscribers, why are we coming up with rules and day-long guidelines on when and where we share our material? There are subreddits that exist with five to ten times the number of people who don't have ""Fan Fridays"" or ""Meme Wednesdays"". We don't need r/WooWooWoo. It can all exist here. If you don't like the content, don't look at it. If you want to post image macros of Dolph Ziggler, do it. This place can be self governing. This is supposed to be a community where we can post wrestling related things and enjoy a laugh or two. Take away the right of the individual to post anything related to wrestling, and this is no longer an open forum. It's something else.

Please don't take my wreddit away. I'd hate to have to leave another subreddit and show up on someone else's turf, brother.

TL;DR: Stop making changes around here. We can self-govern.",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,,True,t3_12va8g,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/12va8g/an_open_letter_to_rsquared_circle/,

After watching Antonio Cesaro put on a stellar match and hearing possibly the most abysmal commentary I've ever heard, I don't think Cole realizes the power he has on that microphone.  He has the potential to single handedly make or bury a wrestler when they're in that ring.  His responses &amp; reactions influence the emotions experienced by the viewers, much in the same way any other sportscaster does.  I'd even argue that, since the finish is scripted in wrestling, Cole's ability to sell the emotion of the match is even more important.  What Cesaro really needed in that match was an angry, frightened Cole dismayed by the Unholy Alliance that is Coulter/Cesaro (in addition to questioning Zeb's motives).  What we got was giggling, sarcastic Cole making a mockery of the situation.

 JR understood what I'm talking about, probably better than anybody.  The reason JR is so quotable is because he knew that every word he said influenced the experience of millions of television viewers.  He knew that it wasn't just the wrestler's job to get himself over.  Most of the major moments where wrestlers became icons/legends in the JR era have a JR quote tied to them.  The man used to blow out his voice calling matches for Christ's sake.

Can Cole say the same thing?  Are there famous moments that have a Cole quote tied to them? A real, heat of the moment, emotional call that has ingrained itself into WWE lexicon? No.  Cole has catchphrases. 

 Sure, Cole can get excited about a match, and when he does we're all better off for it.  He just needs to keep that emotion button on for everyone, not what satisfies his ADD.  And not just for Cesaro; he's still pulling this shit on Ziggler and DBry, who got over in spite of Cole.",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,steiner c89,True,t3_1glmxb,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1glmxb/i_dont_think_michael_cole_truly_understands_the/,

1375231928.0,222,self.SquaredCircle,1je0hd,A point-by-point breakdown of what's going on in TNA behind the scenes and why it's bad news.,259,37,366,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1je0hd/a_pointbypoint_breakdown_of_whats_going_on_in_tna/,"I know a lot of TNA apologists are trying to defend what's going on there, but just in the last few weeks, here's a list of everything going on within the company.

**The big issue at hand**: they lost a good bit of money from one major revenue streams (cutting down significantly on PPVs and buyrates for the remaining ones didn't increase) and started spending more money on taking the show on the road, which costs them a fortune in comparison to the Impact Zone.  I believe that is the root of all their money issues.  Meanwhile, the existing revenue streams (house shows, overseas markets, TV ratings, etc.) haven't really improved at all.  In fact, in some cases, things have gotten worse (in June, an episode of Impact didn't break the top 100 cable shows for adults 25-54, which is the first time that has ever happened.)  Bottom line, you can't lose a big source of money, then start spending more, and be successful.

The results of that have been:

- Significant cut backs on flying in wrestlers for tapings.

- Office staff, vendors, and wrestlers (reportedly even Hogan) began receiving their paychecks late.  Even the OVW developmental guys were getting paid late.

- Rumors of morale sinking, with many wrestlers sending out feelers through WWE friends to see if there was interest there.

- Many staff members deals restructured and asked to take paycuts or to work on per-night appearances.

- Senior VP of Programming and Talent Relations Bruce Prichard released after refusing to take a paycut.

- TNA agent D-Lo Brown agrees to per-night deal, only to be laid off anyway.

- Lindsey Bynum, manager of live events publicity left the company (unsure if quit or laid off)

- Matt Morgan released (reportedly asked for it after seeing the writing on the wall)

- DOC (who was seemingly in the midst of a storyline), Tara, Taelor Hendrix all released from their contracts.  Taelor Hendrix goes on to confirm in interviews that talent are being paid late.

- TNA house show in Missouri is changed because someone dropped the ball and Chris Sabin, Garett Bischoff, Jay Bradley, Wes Brisco, Gail Kim and Miss Tessmacher were all unable to get licensed to wrestle in the state.

- Dixie Carter gives a speech to the locker room, to try and reassure everyone that things are going to be fine...which usually is a sign that they're not.  [Here's a video of the speech.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBKK_a88gjs)

- TNA releases Jesse Sorenson, a guy who literally broke his neck for the company. Although reasons have since come out that make it sound as though TNA was perhaps justified, it's still a PR nightmare.

- Then #AskDixie happens, and well....yeah.  It didn't go well, to say the least.

- Word comes out that Taz tried to jump ship from TNA but was unable to get WWE to sign him.

- The coup de gras: Dixie Carter releases a long statement online to the fans, attempting to once again reassure everyone that things are fine, which...once again, when things get so bad that you feel the need to address the rumors publicly, generally things are the total opposite of ""fine.""  The President of the company being forced to address rumors about their stability is not something that makes employees, networks, or investors feel confident.

- TNA recently cancelled 2 live events in the northwest due to low ticket sales

- TNA OnDemand subscribers have started getting emails stating that the video on demand service will no longer be offered as of Friday, August 2. Refunds will be given to subscribers.  But were reminded that they could still watch videos on TNA's YouTube channel.

Now, to be fair to TNA, some of these things can be written off as legitimate, normal measures, some of these stories may have other sides to them that we haven't heard, and some of them may be entirely wrong and based on speculation and hearsay.

But one thing is true: TNA is pretty much still at the whim of Panda Energy and Spike TV.  If either of those organizations decided to pull their funding and support today, TNA would be out of business by tomorrow.

Furthermore, the constant influx of bad news, whether it's entirely  based in truth or not, doesn't help matters.  Once the snowball of low morale and bad publicity begins to roll, it's hard to stop and only gets worse.  Often questionable booking decisions don't help matters.  This has all happened very quickly, which looks even worse.

In the end, I don't think any true actual wrestling fans want to see TNA fail (other than for the dream matches if some of them ended up in WWE).  For years, people have been predicting TNA's demise and they've stubbornly kept chugging along, but in it's 11+ year history, the writing on the wall for the company has never looked as bad as it does now.

1374566460.0,223,self.SquaredCircle,1ivffu,RAW spoilers - The difference between Daniel Bryan and John Cena.,276,53,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1ivffu/raw_spoilers_the_difference_between_daniel_bryan/,"I attended Monday Night Daniel Bryan tonight, and for the most part, thought it was a solid show. Disappointed in no Wyatt family, but the Bryan matches made up for it.

Now, I know that if John Cena had gone over three dudes in one night, everyone would say he was burying the roster. I think I know why it's totally okay for B. Dazzle to have put on the show that he did.

Back in '99 (I think) unmasked Rey Mysterio went on a run when they called him the Giant Killer. He beat Kevin Nash, The Giant and Bam Bam Bigelo in consecutive weeks. He didn't beat them because he was invincible. He did it because he was faster than they were, and more skilled. Not only is it a classic David vs. Goliath underdog story, but you want to believe that Rey stood a chance because of how hard he worked. Classic babyface shit. And I believed he could win.

The same is true for D-Bry. Even though he's an underdog because he's smaller, he can win because he's good, and for no other reason. He is better. He knows more moves. He knows more counters. He can fly. He never runs out of gas. 

Cena wins because he's Cena. He's never been portrayed as more skillful. The most flattering thing the announce team can call him is unorthodox. His defining characteristic is resilience. Never give up, etc. He's indestructible. And that is fucking annoying, whereas Daniel Bryan putting on a clinic is exhilarating.

We opened our lives and hearts to world to share Mum and the kind of person and inspiration she was as we are so proud of all she had fought and accomplished and if she could inspire just one person it was worth it... the response was simply overwhelming for our family. 

The night before she passed hundreds and thousands of people were thinking and praying for her and that was unbelievable to know that so many people knew Angela Galloway. 

I wish we could thank everyone individually as everyones words have touched us all. From my WWE family, my brothers and sisters and even those we don't know, but we were all connected through the thoughts and prayers for her which were simply unreal. 

We say goodbye tomorrow and its going to one big celebration with Mums request of no black, we re getting colourful. 

She watched and inspired me to live my dream. At Wrestlemania in Atlanta my father Andrew Snr, brother John and Mum all came over for the family trip of a lifetime. I had them stay at the W hotel and made sure my brother and I took Mum and Dad to the W nightclub (if you know the W it tends to be where the over the top American socialites spend their time), the image will always stay with me. We then travelled across 5 states stopping for Raw and Smackdown tv tapings (they also met my boss Vince McMahon backstage at Smackdown who was so warm to them, with my Dad struggling to find words to say being a little bit taken aback, she didn't say anything and just smiled at him as he was allowing me to live my dream) We then travelled over 1000 miles in a seven seater National lampoon style having adventures along the way and at our final stop in New Orleans on the final night we took a horse and carriage around the amazing city. 

Tomorrow befitting of our Queen she takes her final journey in the exact same manner. There will be no moments silence either as we are celebrating a woman who put more energy and achieved more than anyone could in 5 lifetimes, when we say goodbye it will be a round of applause because she had did it, she had overcame and she had succeeded in life. 

Thank you everyone
The Galloway family.

Angela Anne Galloway

1961-2012

She is the heart of our family

A true testament of the human spirit

An inspiration to everyone she ever came in contact with

She was a wife, a friend, a sister, a daughter, an aunt and she was our mother

The hype machine goes for a full year and the anticipation going into this thing is **HUGE**.

So Wrestlemania comes and goes, the match was great. HHH/Taker was great. Punk/Jericho was great. Nice WrestleMania overall.

Flash forward **ONE DAY LATER**, let alone **TWO WEEKS LATER**, which is where we are today, and the only thing out of that entire Wrestlemania that we are still talking about **RIGHT NOW** is the Daniel Bryan/Sheamus match. 

Now, I'm not taking away from the other matches. To the mainstream, those three listed above are clearly the biggest matches of the night. But could the Sheamus/Daniel Bryan match have a greater impact than any other match on the Wrestlemania 28 card in the long term? It appears to have worked in two ways. It solidified Sheamus and the Brogue Kick as one of the top guys/finishers in the WWE and D-Bry is as over as I have ever seen any heel, let alone wrestler, in the WWE as a result of the backlash over the booking of the match and the fans overall respect from him.

In the February edition, Zack Ryder talks about a scar he has on the right side of his chest.*
&gt;
&gt;*Zack Ryder revealed to the magazine that in high school he had cancer. The scar on his chest is where the doctors had to insert ports directly into him so they could pump medicine directly into his lungs, where the cancer was. He said he had no white blood cells at one point and missed an entire year of school.*

**Wow. I already respected him for chasing his dreams and getting himself over by his own means when everyone had given up on him, but to do everything he's done after beating cancer. So much respect for that man.**

**Wonder why this wasn't brought up during the '*Rise Above Cancer*' initiative.**

Other stories from the feature include:
&gt;
&gt;*Wade Barrett has a massive scar under his right arm that goes down from his arm pit half way down his side from what he alluded to but never flat out admitted was from participating in a sort of ""Fight Club"" and he was attacked and presumably stabbed after winning a fight and the losers didn't take too kindly to losing their money.*
&gt;
&gt;*William Regal said he has a scar on his right ear from a match with Dean Ambrose in FCW and that the scar on his lip is from being punched by Boogeyman.*
&gt;
&gt;*Sin Cara has a scar on his left collarbone from surgery after breaking it in Mexico.*
&gt;
&gt;*Kofi Kingston has a scar on the back of his right leg from a BMX bike crash.*
&gt;
&gt;*Jimmy Uso has a scar on the left side of his neck from being smashed with a bottle by a drunk person who he was trying to stop from harassing a girl at a club. Said he was an inch away from being killed, his doctors told him.*
&gt;
&gt;*Jey Uso has a scar on his right shoulder from surgery from a football injury.*
&gt;
&gt;*Johnny Curtis has a scar on his right bicep from a ladder match in FCW against Hunico and Epico.*
&gt;
&gt;*Beth Phoenix has a scar on her left knee from the surgery after blowing out her ACL while Women's Champion.*
&gt;
&gt;*Curt Hawkins has a scar on his right elbow from football injury.*
&gt;
&gt;*Derrick Bateman has a huge scar on his midsection from surgery when he was 3 years old. He had a bleeding ulcer. When he was 6 they had to go back in and correct something.* 
&gt;
&gt;*Cody Rhodes has a scar on his forehead from being elbowed by Daivari at his first ever match at a WWE Live Event. He had busted an artery and his first ever match needed to be stopped by the ref and he needed to get cable stitches. A week later he took the bandage off in Applebee's and his stitches popped and he was gushing blood in the restaurant.* ",,False,,t5_2sljg,1358910447.0,,blank c57,True,t3_173kj7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/173kj7/i_never_knew_zack_ryder_had_cancer/,

I went in not having any connection to any of the performers, and having only seen one wrestle before in a squash. Didn't matter, they did a great job of getting me invested pretty quickly. The crowd was full of kids who wanted to see their hometown heroes triumph over the dastardly heels, and I just fed off that energy. WildKat put on a great show, and I'll be going to as many as possible from here on out. The bonus was seeing Luke Hawx become the new WildKat champion in an unadvertised match. I flew up out of my seat when he got the 3 count. On the drive home I was hoarse from yelling so much.

But there was this group of jackasses in ""hwo"" shirts... Apparently that's [Heel World Order](https://twitter.com/HeelWorldOrder). They spent the whole show trying to get themselves over. Local face comes back after 13 months away, hwo motherfuckers hold up a sign saying ""Blake = Job Squad."" Kids cheer for faces, Mr. Damn-I'm-Cool-In-My-Fedora-And-T-Shirt turns around and yells at the kids. They spent the whole show making sure everyone knew they were in on the joke, and that they were just way too smart to let anyone get anything over on them. I suppose Heel World Order is a good name, though, because I spent the whole show wishing someone would punch them in their fucking faces, which is the same response I had to several of the heels on the card.

I get it. The faces in WWE are almost always boring. It's annoying when we get the John Cena show for years on end. But fucking hell, people. When you go to a show in a middle school gym, and the wrestlers are doing everything they can to get you boo or cheer them accordingly, fucking do it! Doing otherwise means you're not only missing out on part of the experience the wrestlers are trying to give you, you're also just being a jackass. A jackass who apparently feels that 200 people really need to know that you think you're smarter than a 12 year old.

Not even I will know who answered what. With that out of the way, the link is below.  

Edit: Added ""Midwest USA"" and ""Other"" response to location question.

Edit 2: Clarified education question for ""College"" to also be ""University"" for non-Americans.

Edit 3: 850 responses in 3 hours and still going. Keep the responses coming.

Edit 4: Whoever thought they were funny by spamming an entry called ""cumboy"", you are a dumb fuck. This is in a spreadsheet. I can delete all of your entries in 10 seconds.

All of this, and more, at Payback!

**Tonight's Card**

* Opening up [the pre-show on YouTube,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rzFefmiFQw) will the Celtic Warrior and Heelish-Face Sheamus overcome the linguistic prince known as Damien Sandow? Or will Sandow mollify Sheamus with his Silencer finisher?

* After his long absence post-Izod Center Raw, will CM Punk demolish Chris Jericho with a roaring Chicago Crowd cheering him on? 

* Following Fandango's concussion, will Curtis Axel, The Miz or Wade Barrett successfully (re)gain the Intercontinental Championship in the Triple Threat Match?

* Following their first loss as a team on Friday, will The Shield (Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins) succeed in defending their Tag Team titles from the dysfunctional tag-team of Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton? Or is there more to their team than we know?

* With both their partners busy in the previous match, can Kane persevere in his match with The Shield's Dean Ambrose and succeed in winning the United States Championship?

* Will AJ succeed in defeating her past friend Kaitlyn and obtain her Diva's Championship? Or can Kaitlyn overcome the odds and put her back in her place?

* After his absence from the ring after suffering a concussion from Jack Swagger, can Dolph Ziggler successfully defend his World Heavyweight Championship for the first time against Alberto Del Rio?

* Feeding time is over. Will Ryback succeed in the Three Stages of Hell match to obtain the WWE Championship? Or will CENAWINSLOL? If so, one of these men must win a combination of any of these three matches: a Lumberjack match, a Tables match, and an Ambulance match.

Since I already live in Atlanta, DDP invited me out about a month ago for a yoga workshop and dinner at the house where I got to meet everyone and I detailed that experience [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/19k2xj/so_today_was_my_first_day_of_ddpyoga_with_ddp/)


This last weekend was the real deal though, spending two whole days with the master of the diamond cutter, the bad guy, and the snake himself.


I arrived at the house around 7:30 and learned another $1k donater named Jason would be staying the weekend too.  He was a really cool dude, and all night we watched wrestling videos and heard stories from  Scott, DDP and Jake while we watched them.


Scott was still in a lot of pain from his surgery, but the whole weekend he was in good spirits and seems to be one the most genuinely nice guys I've ever met.  He was always willing to talk and tell stories and really made us all feel welcome.


Jake is doing phenomenal and looks great.  Dude was incredibly funny all weekend, always cracking jokes and making everyone laugh.  His shoulder still hurt a lot after the surgery and he said he was going to the doctor on Monday to have it checked out.


In the morning we did DDP Yoga with DDP himself, and he kicked our butts!  I had been doing DDP Yoga since the workshop, and I still puked because I pushed myself too hard :(


In the evening we got a big surprise in that DDP was taking us all to the Fox theater to see Mike Tyson's one man show!  And we got [BACKSTAGE PASSES!](http://i.imgur.com/Px9ed88.jpgg).  Also here's a [picture of us before the show](http://i.imgur.com/TLpT9fZ.jpg).

I didn't know what to expect from a one man Mike Tyson show, but it was really good and surprisingly funny.  About twenty minutes into the show a bunch of people were walking by our row and I didn't really think anything of it until DDP's camera guy nudges me and goes ""Dude, that's Evander Holyfield!"" and sure enough, in our very row, Evander Holyfield and his entourage sit down.


The show continues and Tyson eventually talks about his match with Evander and pauses, and says: ""In fact, is Evander here tonight?"", and Evander stands up and the whole crowd goes wild cheering.


After the show we all went back stage which was a treat in and of itself.  I've grown up in Atlanta, and getting to go back stage at THE Fox Theater was a BIG DEAL for me.


Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Tyson as he was mostly talking to Evander as one would expect and it was getting late so we headed back to DDP's house.


Sunday we did yoga again with DDP, and this time he worked us even harder.  It was seriously the toughest workout I've ever done, I was drenched in sweat.


Sunday was also the day I took the bulk of my pictures with everyone.  Here's a few of my favorites:

* [Stay classy Jake](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z_TEuq6wejw/UXQkXYd7S6I/AAAAAAAADVA/mMMgXwT4gEg/s528/IMAG0145.jpg)

**Note** everyone looks odd in this picture because they were all trying to look taller than one another standing on their toes and generally goofing around.


And my favorite:


* [The Bad Guy](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Hs0YdxQwsSo/UXP9Dfu6vNI/AAAAAAAADUU/JBkJMzb2Rig/s528/IMAG0143.jpg)

He's looking so much better.  

* [Here's the picture I took with him last month for reference.](http://i.imgur.com/GXnTYyM.jpg)


Over all it was an amazing experience totally worth every penny.  I got to spend the weekend with my childhood heroes and see how far both Jake and Scott have come in a very short amount of time, it was goddamn awesome.

Mick Foley wanted to challenge CM Punk to a survivor series match. The Higher ups said this was stupid and it's now Zigglers time to shine. Can he lead his team to Victory? 

After Big Shows domination over Sheamus at Hell in a Cell can the Great White muster up his fortitude and topple the giant? 

With 2 months of backstage assaults and evasion, Kaitlyn has her chance to win the gold. Will Eve be able to roll up the win or will Kaitlyn make an upset happen?

John Cena. CM Punk. The Ryback. These three men will face each other tonight in a match to find out who is hungriest. The Ryback has a vendetta and an appetite for destruction. Can CM Punk hold on to his championship or will the odds be against him?

1350051220.0,198,self.SquaredCircle,11d6j9,JBL gets it. Even his apologies show his mind for the business and ability to put guys over.,240,42,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/11d6j9/jbl_gets_it_even_his_apologies_show_his_mind_for/,"Apparently Carlos Colon got all butthurt about some comment JBL made on Raw, so Layfield issued an apology on his facebook, and reading through it, I can't help but to be impressed by his knowledge for the sport. WWE really needs to try to keep him employed full time. 

The apology:
&gt;Wrestling has always had good guys and bad guys (heels), if there were no heels there would be no heroes.
&gt;
&gt;I remember being in Austin, Texas and cutting a promo on how UT had lost to Oklahoma and mocking the Longhorns (which killed me as I am a lifelong UT fan). Or, being in Dallas with Tony Dorsett (one of my heroes, again a lifelong diehard Cowboy fan) being there and cutting a promo on the Cowboys about why they were losers. Both of those just killed me, but it’s a work-it’s what I do.
&gt;
&gt;This past week I did 5 hours of TV for WWE, I am a heel announcer. I do my best to get over talent, story lines and hopefully entertain.
&gt;
&gt;This past week I said many ‘heel’ things not intended to offend but rather to entertain.
&gt;
&gt;I had said (working with two of best announcers in WWE history) that I was a ‘dollar working with two dimes’ (referring to JR and Cole).
&gt;
&gt;I had said Brodus Clay was a cross between LaToya Jackson and Free Willy or a ‘Justin Timberlake trained sea monster’.
&gt;
&gt;I said Mil Mascaras had a huge ego and glad his nephew ADR did not (when in reality ADR has a huge ego filled character on TV), it was a way to entertain-or at least try.
&gt;
&gt;I went to Primo and Epico and made sure I had their title history as well as their father Carlo Colon’s, so I could try and help them in a very short match with Ryback.
&gt;
&gt;I quoted their history, did my best to put them over and then made a comment with something to the effect of ‘Primo comes from a great heritage his father was a 24 time Puerto Rico champion’. I added, ‘he still owes me money… and many others’. I’m a heel.
&gt;
&gt;However, apparently I have offended Mr Colon and/or the wrestling community/office in Puerto Rico. This was never intended, there was no malice. I was trying to entertain–and put his kids over by listing their histories.
&gt;
&gt;So my apologies to Mr Colon, Primo and Epicco, and any of the other wrestling community in Puerto Rico that are now upset.
&gt;
&gt;I had assumed they would know that I was merely trying my best to do my job and no malice was intended-that is obviously not the case, please understand my only intention was to entertain.",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,,True,t3_11d6j9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/11d6j9/jbl_gets_it_even_his_apologies_show_his_mind_for/,

Surely it can be done, if enough people purchase it on Itunes/Amazon wherever else music is sold.


You don't need more than a few thousand buys to get to like number 40, as long as it makes the top 40 it will be played on Radio 1 on the chart show Sunday and people will be talking about it


Maybe if someone who's good at twitter got the ball rolling and contacted JK (from wrestletalk) whoever's writing the Sun and Mirrors wrestling columns online and anyone else we can think of and tweet all your friends, and tweet the likes of william regal and wade barrett and any other british wrestlers and see if they'll spread the word.

We need a facebook group too.

On one hand you have to watch SuperCena, SuperSheamus and the GD Ryback but its only one match instead of 3. On the other hand, Ambrose, Rollins, Reigns. 

* Paul Heyman is doing some of the realest in-ring work from a manager/non-wrestler we've seen in years. Not only is it believable, he is really pushing the lines of what he is controlling and isn't. 

* Bo Dallas is getting a legitimate title feud within minutes of being in the WWE, Big E is getting quality air time, Cesaro is a dominant champion, the Shield have one match and yet they're one of the best heel stables we've seen in a while.

* Dolph is one of the best wrestlers on the rosters, has MITB, was in the final 4 of the Rumble and looks to be starting a feud with Jericho again. I think the Raw after WM he will have a title.

* Khali/Hornswoggle shit is getting less and less playtime.

* CM Punk has a legitimate claim in his storyline. He wasn't in the video, there's no proof the Shield attacked Rock, Punk already pinned the Rock to win. He should be the champion right now.

* Del Rio's face turn already has more memorable moments than his heel career.

* They're dropping the whole Tensai being this pissed off monster or whatever he was supposed to be for a more comedy side which he seems to be better suited for. He'll never have a major title in WWE, might as well make the most of his time.

* The Hall of Pain is back

* Lesnar is being booked perfectly. An animal who not even Paulie can contain.

* Cena is nowhere near the title scene at this point. Although he has the title match at WM they're keeping him to a minimum, which could be what everyone needs.

Sure, the Rock is champion and Once in a Lifetime 2 will probably happen. But you have to get over it. WWE will always try to please a casual audience at WM. Right now I think they're at their highest point in a long time. At least at a higher point now than anytime last year.",,False,,t5_2sljg,False,,sandow c15,True,t3_17z3xm,http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/17z3xm/can_we_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_what_is/,

Now that summer's almost around the corner for myself (my last exam is tomorrow,) I aim to be putting a lot more effort into the discussion threads than before. That means: 

* **More bullets: So if you're sick of some of the running jokes in the post, maybe you'll enjoy some new content!**

* **More creativity: Some of my running jokes are old - I get it. But I enjoy them. So instead of removing them entirely, I'll be expanding my creative horizons for those who care!**

* **Important thread plugs: are you running a charity and need the help from wredditors? Let me know and I'll plug your cause!**

* **Show cards: Whenever a show's card is leaked (usually for PPV,) I'll write up a nice little synopsis previewing the match in the thread! (I did this last night - feedback is appriciated.)**

* **Show previews: Similar to the weekly Impact Wrestling threads, I aim to write up some small previews regarding the main storylines before the show airs. Look out for that next week!**

Your read that right, all you need to do is just buy a fog machine. Here is how it would work. Have your scheduled match, the opponent comes out first. The Fog's music hits, and the fog fills up the ring, and the opponent is engulfed inside. Once the fog clears, the opponent is knocked out. The Fog wins by count out.

You have him beat everyone, and eventually become WWE Champ. And who beats the fog? John Cena.

**QUICK PLUGS**

Just quickly, This is a [little video hyping this Friday's Fighting Back event](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6U7fJV6Vuw). For those who don't know, every year, we help run a show in honor of Stinky the Homeless Guy/Phrank Morin who was taken from us in 2011 by Cancer. In the past 2 years, we've raised 24 000$ for the Canadian Cancer Society in his honor and we hope to add more to that this year. EVERY SINGLE PENNY earned from this event goes to the Canadian Cancer Society in Phrank's name.


For more information on how you can help, including donations of your own and ticket purchases for the event, you can visit [the website](http://www.fighting-back.ca/). Some of the matches are SSB vs. Paul London &amp; Brian Kendrick and Mike Bailey vs. ""MDOGG"" Matt Cross!
