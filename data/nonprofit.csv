What are you doing now?",26,2,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/ykk6f/so_rnonprofit_lets_talk_careers_what_is_your/,"edit: Come on! Don't be shy! Even if you don't have a niche yet: what would you *like* to do? Maybe someone here can help you out with some advice!  let's get this thread, and ultimately this subreddit moving!
-------------

This post is aimed to look at a few questions that some people may be asking themselves.  One of the things a famous children's rights expert told me once that has stuck with me since is that (almost) everyone needs a niche, a specialisation, if they want to:

a) make an impact and

b) get an actual job where you earn actual money AND do what you actually like

For most large non-profits, this would mean at least a masters and, most important of all, experience (intern or job).  That's why, when looking for internships, you should be very sure you like that sector because it's very likely going to influence the next 3-5 years of your working life - *at least*.

As I'm still studying at the moment, I only have a lowly position with a massive organisation (+/- $1B / year) where I do fairly tiring and uninteresting work.  However, several higher-ups (some of which I would almost call friends by this point) are already making moves to groom me towards their respective departments once I can work full-time. It's very gratifying and most of all, very motivating as in Austria studies can take a long time (you make your own timetable and basically have 5 years to do a bachelor without paying school fees, so people often don't feel pressured to finish. Me included).

Having said that: I'm interested in your niche. What is your specialisation? Are you a social entrepreneur providing innovative solutions to expensive problems?  What does your work entail?

I'd be interested to get a little discussion going in a subreddit that often seems to be merely a platform for bloggers and new nonprofits advertising their sites.

They weren't there, the door was closed, lights off, but people had been shoving grant applications in manila envelopes under the door all day by the looks of it.

When I arrived, there was a lady, probably in her 50's, laying on her stomach on the floor, desperately digging with her fingers under the door. When she noticed me, she told me she'd put the wrong grant under the door, and now she couldn't get it back, because it was lost among all the others.

Understand, this is an incredibly picky funder. They look for typos to disqualify applications. One forgotten period, and you're out of the running. They don't respond to email, they never answer the phone, and rarely return voicemail. Last year, they never even sent us a response on our grant. I've tried to call/email probably 25 times since I started this job, just to get confirmation that we were rejected, and never reached anyone.

So, I politely told her to take her time and try again, I wasn't in a hurry. I knew my big fingers weren't going to do any better than hers. Finally, after ten minutes, red-faced and looking like tears were on the way, she gave up and moved aside. I gently slid mine under the door to one side, hoping not to make her situation worse by pushing hers deeper into the office, and gave her my best advice considering the situation -- slide the correct one under the door, and just try to call them as soon as possible tomorrow. I left then, and when I looked back from down the hall she was still there, back on her hands and knees, with grasping fingers under the door.

I've never seen such desperation in someone's face, such absolute devastation. I don't know her story, where she was from, if she's going to get fired, if this was her last chance. I'll never know any of that. I do know this, though: I'll never forget that lady as long as I live, and that haunted look in her eyes, like she had nothing left.",,False,self,t5_2qlfy,False,,,True,t3_1bjiqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1bjiqe/saw_maybe_the_saddest_thing_ive_seen_in_my_career/,

Any tips?,23,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1c3k0u/made_it_to_the_second_round_of_interviews_for_my/,"Hey all, I have been wanting to break into the nonprofit world for years now -- my background is in marketing -- and I'm now in the second round of interviews for a communications coordinator position at a local educational nonprofit. It's basically youth advocacy and parent advocacy (I live in a very low income/high crime city, which has a predictably shitty school system). Essentially I would be handling the organization's media communications, running the website, doing publication design, updating social media, et cetera. My professional background qualifies me for this, but as I said I've done primarily Internet marketing instead of ""real"" nonprofit jobs.

This is something that I've dreamed of doing for my entire career. I really enjoy this kind of work and am pretty dang good at it, and I'm thrilled at the opportunity to put my skills to work doing something that supports my community and makes the educational experience a better one for kids that need it badly -- not to mention get my foot in the door towards my long-term career path, which is nonprofit marketing.

I have some publications experience in that I ran a magazine that was a purely not-for-profit publication, but it's not exactly the same thing. Could any kind person offer a few words of wisdom about what interviewers would be looking for, particularly in the second round where they will be more discerning with the candidates? 

I assume that as with standard job interviews it's all about promoting myself, my skills and my achievements, but are there some specific things about the educational nonprofit world that I should do some reading on? What about specific skills, cases or systems to be familiar with? Any blogs to recommend that give a good overview of this world? I have about a week until the interview.

Our current pro bono initiative is sponsored by a grant from Miller Coors Urban Entrepreneur Series. We're going to build a new fundraising platform directly from the input/suggestions of the folks in the non-profit world....Ideally, those involved in development/fundraising at their respective organizations. What [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com) is for the creative/artistic world...we're going to build for non-profits. We already have over 60 applicants but can ONLY accept applications until Feb 29th b/c of our capacity. 

As a 'Thank You', each participating organization will get the new fundraising platform for free once it's built to launch their own fundraising campaign(s).  Our program's details can be found [here](http://www.slideshare.net/WeDidIt/building-a-new-fundraising-platform-for-nonprofits-11112500) in this short presentation [7mins]. And the brief application can be found [here via EchoSign](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=3FL9QW32X3237X). Only takes 30 secs to fill out :)

On the other hand I've got no real negatives (criminal record, health problems, etc). 

Any tips on nailing the interview?

If I don't get accepted, are there any alternative organizations I should consider applying for?

Aside from that, what is the language training like? How much do you learn in the training, and how much are you just expected to pick up along the course of your time doing actual work?

Job training? Do they spend time teaching you what you're going to be doing, or send you in with nothing but a pamphlet and your brand new degree?

Any other tips, anecdotes, or advice would be quite welcome

Board members are never in unsupervised situations with children, but one of our board members feels we should have background checks of all board members. That idea was quickly dismissed, but now this person is urging us to check online websites that list sex offenders and other violent offenders. The rationale is that we owe it to the community to determine if any violent or sexual abusers are serving the board.

I'm kind of on the fence on this. I don't like the idea of our board looking into each other's past. There are so many pitfalls and gray areas we could run into. Part of me also feels that if someone committed a crime and served their time, they should be able to go back into the community and do good things.

And then another part of me doesn't want a child molester to serve on a board for an organization that serves children.

Half the year I spend soliciting gifts via phone, and the other half I spend selling theatre subscriptions. The fundraising side is the part I'm best at, and would at least like to think I can translate those skills into the more organized grant writing/major gift solicitation/donor relations side of things, i.e. your standard Development Office of a non-profit.

After being let go from my day job in February, I've been trying like mad to start a development career with a non-profit—primarily in the arts, but I'm willing to work for any good cause—and getting nowhere fast. I've had one interview in the last nine months, and it's been rather disheartening. I really don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I've had a very hard time getting answers. I know I'm qualified for this sort of work—I've got experience in writing, customer service skills, database management, and actual direct gift solicitation—but nobody's even been willing to give me the time of day.

[Here's a copy of my résumé in PDF form.](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/502172/revisedresume.pdf)

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

So here it goes, me and my friends for awhile have been thinking about starting this non-profit group. To put it simple, our cause would be ""free help"". For example, you're moving and you don't have any help at all; call us up and we'll help you free of charge. You're single and broke your leg and cant mow your lawn, call us up and we'll mow your lawn for you...for free. 

I suppose this may classify us as a charity group but I was hoping to get some ideas from fellow Redditors that could help us actually get this in motion. Couple things that I want to outline:

* We are not professionals and will not be liable for any damages (I'm sure there will be some legal hoops to jump through to get that underway)

* At least for now, all supplies/equipment must be provided

* We will not accept any tasks that put us in direct danger. For example, we wont run into a burning building to help put out a fire...we'll leave that to the professionals.

At this point we don't have business cards or a website but again, before we jump into anything; we'd like some advice.

Hello everyone I would love to start a non profit. Last week i had the privilege of meeting David, a mentally challenged 18 year old boy and his step-mother looking for a pet.  He was especially interested in our lizards we have. (i work part time at petsmart) He was set on a leopard gecko. His mother asked me to tell her what she needed to care for one. So i went down the list. At the end she told David she was unable to afford it. He was very upset. After a few minutes of talking i found out she fosters 2 other children. One from Kenya and another mentally challenged boy. At this moment i knew what i had to do. I simply offered her my set up i had at home. 2 geckos the tank lights heating food water dish the whole 9 yards. After a bit of convincing she accepted and told David. As you can guess he was so excited. I then gave them my phone number and packets on how to care for them and talked for almost an hour about how to care for them. I then headed home picked up the geckos and drove back. I explained how to set up and feed them. I gave them a lot of food. We talked for a little while longer and we plugged each others phone numbers in. I gave David a hug and a hand shake and we parted ways. Weve talked on the phone and texted and David loves them. I would like to start a non profit for sick or mentally ill children to supply them easy reptiles or pets to care for ,with their parents help of course. 
If i can get it started id like to call it ""Davids Reptiles"" or ""Davids pets"" I know this might not be a good idea but seeing how happy it made him got me thinking.


Theres the story now the questions. 

How does one start a non profit?

How can i get out there and spread this?

Where is the best place to get a website made?

I had more but writing that made me forget...ill edit if i think of them again.

As you will eventually know my private details I didn't want that linked back to my real Reddit account ;)

I am a web designer who is looking to build my portfolio. I have built websites for as long as I can remember but only recently have I begun working in web design full time. 

I would like to build a charity their website as a way of giving something back to the Reddit community and helping others. 

If you are the charity chosen you will get:

A beautiful, professional, fully functional website based off of the Wordpress platform coded in HTML5 and CSS3. It will be cross browser compatible, W3C compliant and you will have the ability to update it when you like. I will give you a few different designs to choose from once I have understood what you want and other sites you like the feel of.

I will also gift the chosen charity a domain for one year (if they don't already own one) and if they like I can setup all their email accounts, etc.

Ideally I want a charity that knows what they want as I don't have time to go too deep into the conceptualisation stages. If you know what you want on your site and you know what sites you like the look of, I can hammer out a few designs and we will go from there. Please understand that I am a web designer and not a web developer and therefore I don't really build stores or anything like that. You will also need your own hosting! 

List details of your charity here. I will select a winner and I will be biased towards a charity that is aligned with my personal values ;)

Edit: This is for a charity/nonprofit - whatever the difference is ;) And sorry, I won't design for any religious based nonprofits! Sorry in advance.

Edit #2: I'll give this a few days to see if a few more charities request my services. After that I will make a decision! :) Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2qlfy,True,,,True,t3_lyymv,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/lyymv/who_wants_a_free_website_for_their_charity_i_will/,
1313184819.0,12,self.nonprofit,jh5tp,I need to vent:  I don't feel very supported at my job.  ,14,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/jh5tp/i_need_to_vent_i_dont_feel_very_supported_at_my/,"So let me just add a few things in here.  I have worked for a very small non-profit (4 full time employees) for 8+ years.  We work with children and reach the lives of almost 500 kids each year.  I like what I do but sometimes feel unsupported.  

I personally run all of our intramural sports leagues and am ultimately responsible for the success of them.  I do many other things as well for my organization, but I won't get into it here.  

Basically I'm writing this because I am irritated with the rest of the professional staff.  I am constantly one of the only people cleaning up our center at the end of the day (50 or so kids in our building daily and we don't have a custodial budget).  This is not my primary job but I do what I can to help out.  

In the 1.5 years I've been in my position running our sports leagues the rest of the professional staff have come to 3 of my events (I should mention that for 10 months of the year I typically have games Monday through Thursday every week).  One person came to watch a couple of volleyball games.  Another came to watch one volleyball game (we run 3-4 a night) and the only other time any of the professional staff have come to anything I do, was a year ago at our end of the season dance recital.  I know we all work long hours here but I feel like I'm at the end of my rope at this point.  

Reddit am I wrong in feeling a little shafted by the rest of the people I work with?  I am aware this may get downvoted to oblivion because of my bitching.

We provide services to people with disabilities, and we need a way to track our participants as they progress through our system across the country. 

The CRM needs to be able to:

* Track every interaction a client has with our organization (every event attended, every time we follow up, etc). 
* Research what methods of contact are most successful and how best to deliver our services. We've partnered with a research institute, so we need to give our clients anonymous numbers and be able to set permissions so that researchers cannot see their names. (This has proven tricky with free software).
* Remind our program coordinators to follow up with people at regular intervals and prevent them from falling through the cracks.
* Search for participants based on queries (i.e. female with SCI).

We've done a bunch of research, but CRMs like Microsoft Dynamic CRM seem to be too expensive, and free CRMs like Wild Apricot don't seem to meet our needs. 

Any suggestions on potential software we should be exploring? Or advice on setting up a CRM for a nonprofit (finding programmers, etc).

Background: I graduated with a BA in anthropology in 2006, spent three years working in an office starting at a computer, then moved overseas where I taught English in Korea and Thailand, worked on farms in Australia, and am currently volunteering on the Thai/Burma border teaching young adult Karenni refugees about human rights.

I'm moving back to the States in a couple of months and would love love LOVE to find work with a nonprofit.  My favorite field is refugee resettlement, but that stretches to things like nutrition, womens health, empowerment, community development, esl, etc.

So...how do I go about getting a nonprofit career?  Most of the interesting positions I find are volunteering or internships (including some REALLY AMAZING-looking Americorps VISTA positions) and while I understand that that's a great way to gain experience and show dedication, and I can totally commit to six months of unpaid internship (or a year of VISTA) I can't not get paid for longer than that.  

-how easy is it to turn volunteer work/internship into a paying job?
-in my case (2 years of efl, 4 months volunteering with Burmese refugees, some grant writing) would an internship or a masters degree be more valuable?
-what is YOUR nonprofit job, is it paid, and how did you end up there?  What unpaid steps did you take in that direction?

We have some nifty ideas on how to make this work (basically: borrow heavily from the open source process to enable people to contribute smaller amounts of time without getting bogged down in requirements/politics/infrastructure blah blah blah).

I need to hook up with potential nonprofit partners who would like to be recipients of such a scheme to show potential funders concretely what our first few projects will be.

This is an open invitation to any Redditors who are interested in helping Trees non-profit (Weedit.Org) get off the ground. What I mean is I’d like some help personally with getting the basic requirements for filing to incorporate a non-profit in California. I know it needs to be done correctly to avoid liabilities in the future. But the idea of “lawyering up” is it really necessary? I have nothing against lawyers. I just think sometimes it’s better to learn the ins and outs of how something works by gaining insight from those who already have experience. Furthermore, I’m concerned about costs spiraling out of control if we go the lawyer route.

Basically the brainstorming sessions I’ve had with folks so far interested in helping have been productive. A lot of people have described how they envision Weedit.Org operating. Now it’s time to begin the real work developing the bylaws, mission statement, etc. I’m not sure exactly if I should use templates I’ve found on the Internet for these things or simply fill out the paperwork to the best of my ability alone.

I’d like to have something in place for the organization by the end of November. Then later on we can file for tax exempt status with the IRS, etc. I just want the organization bare bones up and running. Then we can start building up the organization using our members help. 

The main goals of the organization will be educating the general public regarding cannabis cultures (non-stereotypical) and the general safety of cannabis. We should spread these ideas using traditional and modern social media organizing into local branches and ‘microbranches’ in a Reddit sort of way. This movement was empowered by the community power of Reddit. I’d like the organization to be spread wide and far yet also be local and accessible. I think we can leverage the power of the Trees community and the Internet to really make a difference for the campaigns to re-legalize cannabis in Washington State in 2011 and California, Colorado, and Oregon in 2012. I started developing the [Weedit.Org](http://www.weedit.org/) web site recently. This is the first step and incorporating the non-profit is the next I believe.

How can I raise money without being under a 501(c)(3) organization? What are some advices to start a successful non profit? 

I am a 21 year old who is taking a year off volunteering in a hospital in Vietnam prior to med school. I have spent the last 2 months working in the local ICU and literally seen patients die every single day or going home to die around loved ones. 

The most shocking part about it is that a good portion of those patients died or went home to die because they did not have enough money to pay for medications. I see their families borrowing money, selling everything they own and starve (this includes children) to pay the bills. I saw a mother who had to decide between taking her husband home to die and starve her children to pay her husband's medical bills.
It cost on average $100/day to be treated in the ICU, and I think the average monthly Vietnamese salary revolves around $100/month. 

Right now, I want to be able to raise money to help them, but I have no idea how to do it. From what I understand, to start a 501(c)(3) non profit organization takes at least a year. How do I raise money until then? How do I show people it is a legitimate cause and not a scam? I am also thinking that I can have my family matching whatever I collect (probably need to figure out what their limit is). I also realize that giving money away might not be as efficient as micro-lending or investing in education, but people are dying because they don't have enough to pay their bills.

In the long run, I would like to manage my own non profit organization. What degrees should I look into in addition to my medical degree? MPH? MBA? Any reads you recommend?

But unlike the atheist group, the christian group, the reddit group, etc. at Kiva, we're a team joined together not by who we are and how we define ourselves, but instead by what we want to accomplish: donating $1,000,000 to entrepreneurs in developing countries.

http://www.kiva.org/team/milliondollarproject


If we get 8000 members, then at $25/member over 5 years with 9 re-loans we will donate $1,000,000 to entrepreneurs in developing countries.


It's simple:

- Go to www.kiva.org/team/milliondollarproject

- Lend any amount.

- Once it is repaid, re-lend it or just recover what you lent.

- Recruit your interested friends to this group, and to the Kiva team.

- Recruit your more interested friends to help recruit their friends.



That's all there is to it. Be a part of it!

I'm in charge of finding corporate funding for a philanthropy, and every year the person in this position has managed to pull in anywhere from 10-13K, which is pretty good. But I'm floundering. We're based just southwest of Chicago so there's a LOT of potential donors near us, but there's almost TOO much potential. I don't know how or where to start, and I've been writing my ass off for the past three or four months and still nothing. I haven't given up or anything, but with every rejection that rolls in it seems more and more impossible to get funding from anyone.

I know that grant writing is all about patience and perseverance, but we need the funding by June and I'm starting to get scared that I'm not going to get anything. Last year we pretty much had two large grants, and I just found out that one isn't renewable until too late next year, and the other was a one-time donation, so now I'm just really scared. On top of that, the holidays are making it hard for me to make headway with the companies. 

I guess it's more that I'm afraid of letting everyone down than us needing it - it'll be a setback but we won't have to close our doors. But this organization is really, really important to me, and by taking this position I was hoping that I could help them grow by doing all the dirty work - not by driving it into the ground. 

So I'm looking to anyone out there that has any experience in the field. I already went through the huge databases and handpicked grants that sounded like they suited us. I've called countless businesses and foundations, most of which just send me to an answering machine and never call back. I feel like I don't have any direction, but every time I try to buckle down and go with one direction, it suddenly seems wildly inefficient and I have second thoughts.

Literally ANY input is helpful at this point. Like I said, we have until June, and I feel like that's right around the corner. I've tried to keep the details of our organization vague because I'm sure my coworkers are on here somewhere, but if you need more specifics just ask.

**TL;DR I'm running out of time for grants, don't seem to be doing as well as everyone else, and desperately need direction.**

I built 5mf with the idea of creating a platform for doing product-based fundraising, specifically physical products, such as t-shirts.

But after talking with several NPs in my area, there's a lot of interest in selling ""virtual"" products.

So instead of t-shirts or coffee mugs, you would be able to create an ecommerce-like experience that allows donors to select how their donations would be designated. For instance, you could offer packages of 3 meals-on-wheels for, say $30. You could add any number of other ""items"" that correlated to your organization, and donors would then pick their items and quantity, and complete the ""checkout"" process.  

So instead of handing over money via a vanilla PayPal donation form, donors can participate, and thus buy-in, to the donation process. 

My big question now is what to call these virtual products. I want to quickly communicate this notion to NP leaders without having to write two paragraphs, and I'm hoping the good folks of this subreddit can provide some feedback to that point, and on the concept in general.

For the donation component, we currently have our donation/payment processing through Paypal because the transaction fees are so low at 2.9% plus $.30 per payment.  The downside is the Paypal payment system looks like it's after thought rather than an integrated solution.  There's also this feeling that we're growing out of the Paypal association; it's almost a stigma of a small nonprofit.  I'm fine with it, but some folks internally are sensitive to this.  We do have the donation processing hooked to donortools, so that's nice.

Our site is a Wordpress site if there's a plugin to that assists, then that's a bonus.  We have someone helping us set this all up, so it's not a requirement.

I ended up keeping my job and enrolling at USF for next year, but now I'm considering just to work for a year and reapply to Columbia. Ultimately, I want to work as a program manager or researcher within an NGO.

I've been trying to get a nonprofit job for a couple of months, I've had a couple interviews but so far nothing has panned out. 

*So, my questions to the denizens of r/nonprofit:*

**what are you looking for from a candidate in an interview? **

**What experiences are you looking for in a candidates past?**

**What are the things that immediately make you think the candidate is not right for the position?**

**What do you love to hear from a candidate?**


*As for what I am looking for: *

I would love working for a politically focused non-profit, but not in a fundraising fashion. I want to connect with people, not solicit  money from them. Preferably I would like to help promote legislation or help build a coalition to get an initiative passed.

My strengths are in logistics, leadership and building group partnerships. I have experience with event planning, gathering supplies and training volunteers. I prefer a strategic approach, with contingency plans and lots of thinking ahead.

I have leadership experience working for nonprofits in the past (Boy Scouts, Homeowners' Association, that sort of thing) and I have some experience canvassing for political campaigns, although my experience is not from the area where I currently live (Seattle, WA). 

The one thing I know I don't have is an overwhelming presence of optimism. I've stopped suicide attempts and prevented assaults, encouraged people to seek counseling and go to rehab but I'm a realist. I have seen family members torn apart by addiction, I've seen people taken advantage of by cults and sociopaths and I have known people that have gone without adequate medical care for years because they can’t afford it. I don’t have boundless faith in the human race, because I recognize the 'monsters' are also human.

I would love to volunteer at a nonprofit, but I can't afford it right now, with the meningeal hours I have at my current work coupled with the cost of gas.

A thing I see time and time again is people having to make tough choices about their grocery orders when they run out of money-- whether food stamps, limited cash for a large family, whatever. These people are frequently buying frozen, pre-made food, no fresh veggies or fruits.

Personally, I am on a moderately tight food budget, and the way I try to stretch my budget is by cooking as much as possible. I eat lots of beans and rice, cook in bulk and freeze it for the future, etc. It seems that this knowledge is something that has been lost in some segments of our society. If it weren't for reddit (/food, /frugal, /cheapfood, etc) and the fact that many of my friends cook, I could very well be eating canned soup for every meal. On the other hand, I definitely see people at the store coming through who clearly DO know how to shop/cook on a budget. I can't stand thinking about people missing out on delicious food because they think frozen food is all they can afford.

So basically, I want to find a way to hold cooking classes, where members of the community can share their knowledge. Not everyone has a grandma to teach them how to cook-- but every block has at least one grandma who is cooking up delicious stuff in her kitchen.

Are there groups that do this kind of thing? I can immediately see tons of problems with organizing this kind of program-- finding a space where students can cook, liability issues, cooking supplies, etc.",,False,self,t5_2qlfy,False,,,True,t3_mc8n6,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/mc8n6/nonprofits_that_teach_cooking/,

Hey everyone,

A few weeks ago I started talking to other indie pubs about putting together a charity pack of RPG stuff to benefit [The Wayne Foundation](http://the-waynefoundation.org).

Well, it happened!  It's live right now and you can [get it at DriveThruRPG](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=94966&amp;affiliate_id=296418).  It will be available only until the 30th of September.  100% of the profits from the sale of this pack go right to the Wayne Foundation.  Public reporting of sales [here](http://trollitc.com/the-wayne-foundation-indie-rpg-bundle/)

Here's the blurb from DTRPG on what you get for your $15:

Full of amazing indie press titles and software, The Wayne Foundation 2011 charity fundraiser pack has over $80 in products available together only here, and only from September 15th through September 30th, 2011.

**The Reason**

Hello, my name is Jamie Walton - founder and president of The Wayne Foundation.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, child prostitution has become an epidemic crime with victim estimates ranging between 300,000 and 800,000 children internationally.

Human trafficking, domestic trafficking, and child prostitution are crimes that can befall any child, anywhere, and at any time. I was once one of these children.  Like so many other victims my abusers were never arrested for their crimes.  I felt as if no one loved me or cared about what happened to me.

It has taken me many years to come to terms with the horrendous abuse I experienced as a child. Now, I am breaking my silence in the hope that I can give a voice to children who are today's victims.

Every day, thousands of children in the United States are bought and sold for the purposes of sex.

With your help, we can give them a way out and a chance to start a new life.

The Wayne Foundation's vision is for a world without child slavery. Our mission is to provide young women who have fallen victim to commercial sexual exploitation and domestic trafficking with a means of leaving the sex industry for good. The Wayne Foundation is committed to fighting human trafficking, child prostitution &amp; child sex exploitation one victim at a time by providing individuals with a safe home environment that will empower them with the tools they will need to stop the cycle of abuse.

It is our intent to stop commercial sex exploitation within the United States through direct victim assistance, public outreach, and by directly working with those who shape the policies and statutes which impact victims and their abusers.

**Where you come in**

Every cent of profit made from this bundle will go directly to The Wayne Foundation to help them accomplish this mission. Not only will you get some great RPG and board game products, but you'll be helping Jamie and her foundation get off the ground and in to action. 

You can listen to an amazing interview with Jamie Walton, hosted by Kevin Smith which will give you a much more detailed idea of what Jamie went through as a child, and why she, with Kevin's help, decided to start the Wayne Foundation. Here's part one and part two.

My mom has been volunteering for Canswerlink for over a year now, and I just started a couple of months ago. They are a non-profit organization that provides free, monthly non-toxic cleaning for cancer patients. Two women co-founded Canswerlink with the belief that having a clean home allows patients to concentrate on themselves and their healing. Many cancer patients are no longer capable of cleaning their homes, so providing this service to them does wonders for their bodies and minds and can be therapeutic.   

Right now, they operate in NJ, and sadly have to turn away patients nearly every week who are too far away. I'd love to see this organization help people nationwide, so if you or someone you know would like to start a chapter in your own area, PLEASE contact the co-founders!
