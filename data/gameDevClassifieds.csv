And, I wanted to take this moment to tell you guys, that you aren't fooling anyone. No legitimate artist is going to be convinced by your logic. At best, it's going to attract those with no experience who don't quite know what they are doing yet.

And, here's the thing. If you can't afford an artist, that's okay. Just say so. We will appreciate that sort of honesty instead of you trying to weasel your way around it, like in the language we see in post like

http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1dl44k/lf_pixel_artist_for_our_3rd_game/

(for the lazy: Payment:

We would rather reward our artists with revenue-share to encourage super polished work instead of per-asset or per-hour compensation. We believe that people tend to do better work when they stand to make more money.)

(Granted, this one is better in that he admits his budget is low, but I have a problem with statements like ""I much prefer to pay artists with revenue-share agreements as I think this encourages more consistent work instead of workunit / hourly payment."" that annoy me.)

We don't need a stake in your project to do our best. No one is in this business to rip anyone off or make loads of cash. It's always a labor of love, and most of us are trying to do it full time, and barely getting by. The truth of the matter isn't that we're being greedy by wanting a fair wage. You're understandably worried that you might spend money on your project, and not get a return. But you want to offload some of that risk onto your work force. This is sleazy. And, not cool.

Rev-share is an investment, and demanding we get in bed with you because you're scared to take risk, or too cheap to pay employees when you have the money to do so is toxic behavior. On par with asking artist to 'do free work for your portfolio, or exposure.' 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with mentioning that rev-share is an option, but do not try and make us feel bad for wanting to be paid for our services.

Thank you for your time. Now go forth, and play nice.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1367636062.0,,,True,t3_1dnqnb,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1dnqnb/about_the_recent_trend_of_revshare_guilt/,

It really breaks my heart to see how many posts completely miss the front page because they are immediately downvoted after being posted, despite being completely relevant and perfectly fine submissions. This has happened to my posts at least 2 times now, and I've been EXTREMELY careful to not spam the subreddit. 

I've made it an established point to UPVOTE other composers, because I want people to be able to find work through this subreddit. My belief is that, if my music is worth anything, people will contact me and ask me to work with them. And if someone else's post attracts them more, then either 1) it's a different style that they wanted, and their game will be better for it, or 2) I need to get better at what I do. That's how competition works, and it only makes the individual artists, and the community as a whole, better.

This subreddit works in a different way than others, and if you don't like my submission or think it's not worth time for your project, downvoting does nothing at all. Because now I have an infinitely less chance of communicating with people who might actually be interested in what I do. 

So please have some dignity here. If you're afraid of competition, write better music... or draw better... or be a better programmer. But don't try to snuff out other people who are working towards the same dreams you are. Encourage those people. Help build up a community where more projects are getting completed, so that more people want to join, and more people get the opportunity to work.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,False,,,True,t3_wtlkh,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/wtlkh/for_the_sake_of_the_community/,

Thank you to everyone who has participated.

**News:**
 
From what I've heard, this subreddit has begun to pick up in popularity among recruiters! So for those of you who are posting personal ads, please include as much information as you can, specifically your terms of employment, such as pay, location, full-time/part-time/contract, on-site/offsite, etc.

Also, try and keep the board clean. If you've found who you're looking for, **don't forget to delete your ad.** I'd like to have this subreddit retain as much relevance as possible, so I'm going to impose a 4 month limit on all ads starting today. Nothing sucks more than searching for a needle in a haystack, and following up on a dead ad is a big let down.

**Updates:**

*NEW CLASSIFIERS:* 

From now on, for employers or teams who are posting a want ad, please use the term [LF] in your titles to let people know that you're LOOKING FOR talent, as opposed to those who are posting their personal portfolios. Examples:

**Employers and teams use the new method.** Remember, don't forget to post your compensation:

* [LFP]rogrammer for work on AI and gameplay programming! ($60k - $70k)
* [LFA]rtist in the Toronto area for 3D modeling and rigging. (Contract)
* [LFM]usician for contract work on indie project. (Rev-share)

**Talent still uses the old way**: 

* [P]rogrammer available for PSN and XBLA work. [ $30/hr; NY, USA ]
* [A]rtist wants a job! 3D modeling and concept art. [ Negotiable; Manchester, UK ]

This helps out everyone, in that someone can just search for ""LFA"" in this subreddit to find all Artist want ads without having to comb through the master list.


*FLAIR:*

If you would like to have your specialization added to your user name, PM me with what you'd like it to say and I'll add it to your ID flair. Keep it concise, please. RECRUITERS: This is a great way for people to find you.

*NOTE: You have to be subscribed to this subreddit in order for it to work.*

Now, I don't have a massive amount of experience in the game industry, so despite having a few years of professional experience as an illustrator, I'm still entry level as a game designer. But, I'm super interested in the indie gaming scene, and I'm a crazy fast learner. I have skill creating backgrounds, tile sets, props, items, etc to match any 2D game's perspective in raster or vector formats. I can also do concept art to help flesh out ideas for your game further.

I'm also generally a game nerd! I love to talk about game play theory and coming up with new or better ways games could be played.

I'm flexible with compensation, which we can always discuss privately [based on project etc.] I will at least say that due to certain living circumstances, I can't accept payment through revenue shares after the work is completed. (Got rent to pay!)

Anyway, if you like the look of my work and want to pursue something together, feel free to email me at **foxorian@gmail.com** and we'll work something out!

1358895870.0,16,self.gameDevClassifieds,1732tj,A suggestion for composers and a consideration for the subreddit.,18,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1732tj/a_suggestion_for_composers_and_a_consideration/,"I've notices over the past month that we've had a very large presence of musicians and composers that are eager to work on new projects. I've been active in this subreddit for a little while, and I've gotten some pretty amazing jobs through postings on here. So I had two considerations to make:

For composers: It's absolutely great to get your information and music out to people. Frequently, gamedevs are looking for pretty specific musical concepts, so it's good to give them options. But as long as I've been active here, I've posted several ""[M]usician LF Project"" posts, and had no results from them. I would get suggestions and comments, but no real work. However, I've gotten at least 5 solid projects to work on from paying attention to people who REQUEST composers. So rather than throw your hat in the ring with 20 other composers all at the same time, I would consider patiently waiting for opportunities to arise. 

**TL;DR - I've gotten NO work from posting a ""[M]usician Looking For Work"" thread, but plenty of work from responding to requests for music. Don't worry so much about posting threads to your music.**

So in response to this, I would like to consider a place where we can have a running list of musicians and artists who are available for work. The system we have in place works very nicely for teams trying to fill in a spot, but it doesn't so easily help those, like myself, who are *always* looking for new projects to work on.

Something like a single thread for musicians or a list over on the sidebar would be great for people to include a name, webpage, short description of what they do. That would eliminate the need to make all these posts of artists looking for work, as any game developer can reference that list to find people they're interested in.

I'm not sure if my suggestion here is the best one, but I think there's a way to have artists and composers show their desire to work without getting lost in a flood of posts. It would give composers/artists a better chance of getting gamedevs to check them out for a project, and it would clean up the front page to more appropriate requests.


**TL;DR - We should make a consolidated list of composers and artists who are always available to work on projects. It would eliminate front page clutter, stop reposts of requests for work, and give reddit's gamedevs a much easier place to find music/art for their games.**

I'd love to continue this discussion if anyone has a consideration to make.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1358906583.0,,,True,t3_1732tj,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1732tj/a_suggestion_for_composers_and_a_consideration/,

____________________________________________________________
[Dual Dimensions](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/dual-dimensions) is a rejected WIP for the game Parallax. Electronic / atmospheric. 

[Dr. Mad Stage 1 (old remix)](http://rokkochan.bandcamp.com/track/dr-mad-stage-1-old-chipped-by-derris-kharlan) is an authorised remix of a Rokko Chan (megaman flash game) track. 
Chiptune / Dance / House

[Syrup Quest](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/folder-quest) (renamed) is a track for a company's mascot to be used for various purposes. 
Chiptune / Orchestra

[The Organic Food Store](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/the-organic-food-store) is Jazzy

[Lazy Morning
](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/lazy-morning) is Funky / Disco

[Luminesce](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/luminesce) - I'm mostly known for my chip music work, and have played numerous shows/festivals around Australia and the United States. This was the promo track for the recent Blip Festival that was held in Melbourne Australia.

[Shop](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/shop) - Final Fantasy Tactics style shop theme. I was going for a lighter fun feel and felt that a busier track is somewhat appropriate in a shop scenario (seeing as all you are usually doing is navigating lists)

[Underwater](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/underwater) - Theme for an underwater city / village or something. 

[Synthy](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/synthy) is ethereal and synthy. Actually the track that I pitched to the Parallax guys to get the job. Very atmospheric.

[Boss](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/boss) is a boss theme for a game. Piano/Strings/Drums

[Running Riot](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/running-riot) is one of the tracks I made at the last TIGjam. It's ridiculous. Chiptune.

[Quack](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/quack) Quack.

[Magnetised](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/magnetised) is a track for the game at theyloveyou.net (with melody though) 80s/Synthy. Nominated for Best Audio at Freeplay 2012!

[Super Levolution](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/super-levolution) is a fairly lulzy track for a game made in [Ludum Dare 24](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=16861). Chiptune/Drum &amp; Bass/Cats/Ukelele

I have WAY MORE. So if you have a request for a certain style let me know and I will post something I have done in that style if I have. Don't want to saturate this first post too much though.

So please- hire a poor dedicated musician to do your sound and music. You wont be disappointed!

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Just a note: I do not work for free. It's my view that if a developer isn't willing to invest money into quality assets / sound, why should I invest my time into their project? I am acutely aware of how difficult it can be for indie developers to fund projects - but that's why I charge so little (and are really flexible... rev share/downpayments depending on circumstances etc) for indie devs. There are mechanisms in place for funding these days (kickstarter, indiegogo... even just good old fashioned sponsoring) so there is really no excuse for not compensating workers. I hope this doesn't come off as dickish - but a man's got to eat!

1374450192.0,14,self.gameDevClassifieds,1is103,Very Unique MMORPG Seeking Various Positions for Eventual Kickstarter,23,9,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1is103/very_unique_mmorpg_seeking_various_positions_for/,"My name is James ""Walsingham"" Weeks previously of Trion Worlds  I am the Creative Director on a new project.

I have worked on the Community Team and directly with the devs and producers on RIFT, End of Nations, and Defiance. We have various team members from an array of games, as such, we have an inner knowledge as to the processes and workflow involved. We also have many contacts within gaming media.

We are seeking various folks to begin work on a new project destined for Kickstarter. We have a 20+ member team with members having worked for the likes of LucasArts, EA, Bioware, Origin, and more.

As no one else is doing an MMO of this nature (and to our knowledge ever has), it's a bit hush hush. It's definitely not your standard fantasy/sci-fi MMORPG that are a dime a dozen. We are refraining from saying anything publicly until we can have something substantial to show.

As we are definitely playing this one close to the vest, all that I can say is that this game will likely touch every aspect of every genre, and therefore, if designed well, will have a good amount of appeal.

We will be starting out small, with one to two zones, working first on the areas themselves, basic functionality (such as the questing system, UI, etc.), animation, and assets. We hope to have one dungeon completed before the crowd funding begins.

The position will eventually be a paying one providing the Kickstarter is successful, with those jumping in early receiving incentives on the back end. In our eyes, this is a partnership.

We plan for the game to be as fan-driven as possible, with no goals whatsoever of being a ""WoW-killer."" We do feel, however, that the premise for the game is very, very unique. If we build it, they will come.

We are currently in need of:

**A few Environment Artists** (with at least one proficient in city building)

**A few Animators** (primarily character and mob animations at this time)

**Character and Creature Designers**

**Scripting Wizards**

**Engineers and those knowledgeable about mmo networking and client-side operations**

**Lead Game Designer**

**Content Designers** (objects and non-operational vehicles, etc.)

**UI Designer** (familiar with Scaleform or the Hero UI system)

**Particle Effects Specialist**

**Engine:**

We are currently looking at / working on Unity 3D and Hero Engine. At the moment we are heavily leaning towards Hero Engine, therefore if you have experience there, it is a plus. The reasoning for this is the functions already in place for a larger scale MMO. 

If we happen to find an engineer this early capable of the network engineering necessary to support an MMORPG of medium magnitude on Unity, we will be utilizing the Unity tools (experience in Photon, Smartfox, or Scalify Badumna). Aside from that, it looks to be Hero Engine.

That being said, if anyone feels their expertise could be of use, we are more than happy to talk with you. The only positions we currently do not need for certain are composers or project managers. When the time comes, we will also need class and systems leads.

Our priority at the moment is a lead designer who can keep things on track, track assets, builds, etc.

Before we can discuss the game with you, please contact us with a description of, or examples of your work, and so that we can send you an NDA. 

If I had to describe our goal for the aesthetics, we are going for semi-realism. We're not talking MW3 here, but we're also not talking stylized graphics that you would find in say, World of Warcraft. We hope to really see what Hero Engine is capable of.

An example of a model we will be using can be found [by clicking here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ0RpgSgkYc).

Being that this is a very indie project, we do not expect you to have years of industry experience, but we also know that there are some of you out there that are currently unemployed due to the economy. We will be sharing percentages.

If anyone would like to put their time into the project, and would like to know more, please feel free to contact me at weeks@outlook.com or you can PM me here.

I guarantee this is unlike **anything** you have worked on before.

Thanks!

**UPDATE**: We've brought a concept artist, animator, and a few engineers on to the team since the post, and have been in contact a good number more.

I wont tell you what graphics I need, instead you will tell me what I need, design the look of the game,
including HUD, menus... and hopefully get involved 100% with the game, come up with new mechanics, ideas, story...

1371323838.0,12,self.gameDevClassifieds,1gew8j,[P]rogrammer w/ casual + arcade game experience looking for full-time or contract work (willing to relocate),13,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1gew8j/programmer_w_casual_arcade_game_experience/,"Hello, my name is Shawn Swift, and I'm a seasoned game developer who's been working in the game industry for years in various positions.  


I started programming from an early age and I began my career as a C/C++ programmer at a hardware company making 3D game controllers.  I then took a position as a level designer and and 2D/3D artist while working on Duke Nukem 3D:Duke it out in DC and Blood: Cryptic Passage.  I then went on to work again as a level designer on System Shock 2.  

From there, I went into business for myself; writing and selling libraries to do particle and sprite animation, making small casual games, and developing an application called Seamless Texture Generator which uses algorithms I invented to remove perspective, smooth out lighting across an image, and blend opposing edges while maintaining contrast.

After that, I began programming games under contract, first writing Lego Builder Bots, then developing a match-3 game similar to Zuma which was never published because the company was bought out by PopCap.

From there I attempted to start my own company, hiring an artist, and licensing some music and sound effects for a game I would design and program called Attack of the Alien Space Beetles, which was published on ArcadeTown, but was ultimately a bit of a flop because shooters don't sell.

I then went on to learn how to design circuits and program microcontrollers, using my talent for making games to make fun costume props with lights and sounds.

And after that I went back into doing contract work, this time working to improve the interface on Jewel Match 4, and hoping to get into doing cellphone games.  But when no contract to do any work on cellphone games materialized I went back into electronics work for the next year.

Now, I am once again looking to get back into game development, perhaps in C# and Unity making cellphone games.  


I am willing to relocate if necessary.  I currently live in New Hampshire but wouldn't mind moving to the west coast.


Here are some videos of games I worked on:

Lego builder bots:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVPmvPW5rA

Attack of the Alien Space Beetles:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x2g59hxklE


Space Beetles uses a sprite system I wrote.  It's fairly sophisticated, using recursion to allow you to create parents and children, with the children moving within the parent's space, scaling with the parent, fading with the parent, etc.  It also features a simple physics engine and an advanced animation system with several types of interpolation / easing, and a path following system that can handle thousands of waypoints using binary search.  This path system was used in Volcano Gods, the unpublished Zuma-like game I mentioned earlier to move 50 spheres along multiple paths.  The spheres also used the easing in the animation system to snap back together and bounce when matches were made.  

The best way to get a feel for the quality of my work is to try out space beetles.  The game itself is a simple shooter, but it's very polished and the physics are fun.  Here is a link to download the full game:

http://www.shawnswift.com/asb/Attack.of.the.Alien.Space.Beetles-v1.1.exe


Enter the name ""Cheater!"" to enable cheat codes, then press 0-9 to spawn powerups, space bar to skip levels, and B and N to skip to the first or final boss levels.  

Note how each enemy bullet affects the ship differently.  Note how you can shoot the powerups to juggle them.  Note how the powerups always bounce when they spawn towards the center of the screen so that they don't simply fly off the screen making them impossible to collect, and how they leave trails so they can be seen.  Note how the ship smoothy follows as you move the mouse, and how it animates tilting from side to side and even the afterburner effect changes as you move front to back.  Also note that the backgrounds are procedurally generated, and all the stars are themselves individual sprites animating.  Also note that the collision box for the ship is much smaller than the ship appears, in order to make things feel more fair to the player.  Finally, note that the game runs in full screen, at your desktop resolution, so the end user need not pick the optimal resolution for their screen in the game.  The game will also add black bars to the top and bottom or sides if need be to keep the aspect ratio square.

1367391537.0,12,self.gameDevClassifieds,1dgw5y,[PFD] Programmer for SIMPLE rush job. All artwork completed. [$50],16,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1dgw5y/pfd_programmer_for_simple_rush_job_all_artwork/,"So, I have a super simple gaming project that I need that's due by May 6.

The game would have a start menu with 2 options Instructions and Play. There is NO player actions at all. It's all animations that are triggered by events.

The first scene is just a lady in an office with a time machine and 3 podiums where 3 treasures would go.

http://i.imgur.com/qWaWkVk.png

The player simply mouse clicks on the time machine, and then an already animated walk cycle has the character walk to the machine, and then a menu pops up with 3 choices.

http://i.imgur.com/fldKS8D.png

The player chooses any of them, and then I can make some sort of static image that looks like time travelling, hold the image for 3 seconds like a loading bar, then the scene changes.

http://i.imgur.com/cmp7aul.png

What it is is just simply a multiple choice trivia game where the player is literally standing in place for each question. There are three separate questions that are multiple choice. Using the dpad, choose the answer, if it's right the player advances to the next position. There are 3 positions total in in each level. If the answer is wrong, a new question pops up.

At the end there is a treasure. The player walks into it and holds it above her head. No animation. Just a static image of her holding it. Afterwards, the player goes back to the office and the item is now there. The character will never walk close to the items or to the podiums so having it as a fixed background would work perfectly. I'm making this as easy as possible for someone.

http://i.imgur.com/tc5tj9S.png

The player can then reclick on the time machine, choose a different location, rinse and repeat. Once the third item is picked up instead of going back to the office, a simple static image will appear which will be the final credit image. By hitting the ESC button it takes the player back to the main menu. THAT'S IT.

I can provide ALL the sounds, ALL the artwork. I just need someone to put it together in Java, or anything easy.

Can someone do this? If so send me a message and we can get together on Teamspeak or Skype and work the details out. I originally had a buddy who was going to do this for me, but it doesn't look like he's going to be able to. Final grade for a course relies on this so it's rather important.

I am a professional 3D Artist who loves developing games. The only problem is I am an artist. I thought I would try asking here whether there are any programmers out there who would be interested in partnering up with an artist to make some sweet games.

I should clarify, that this isn't me asking to join a team, or to help out on an existing project. I want to find someone in my situation and start creating games with them as a two person, programmer/artist team.

Just so you know what you're getting yourself into, here's a little bit about me:

- I am employed as a 3D Artist, so I do my own game development in my spare time.

- I can use tons of different software packages, but the tools i'll be using are Modo, Zbrush and the Adobe Creative Suite (I own licenses)

- I would like to work with Unity, but I am open to other tools.

- I prefer doing work that is heavily stylized and cartoony.

- I am based in Australia, so hopefully our timezones work well together.

I've wanted to be a programmer in the game development field for a long time.  I had attempted to learn C++ a few times before, but never really stuck with it. This time I have and I've made your standard Pong, Breakout and a Plants vs. Zombies type clone (with a friend) in C++ with SFML2.0.  I currently only 'know' C++, and haven't used Java in about 9 years.

What I'm looking for is someone in GameDev who could use an intern-ish coder.  I'm happy to work for/with someone for 20+ hours/week at no charge.  The only problem with me (as a perspective intern) is that my knowledge base is fairly small and I'm severely lacking experience, i.e I'm a bit of a noob.  I do however consider myself a fast learner and a relatively smart guy.

Instead of being paid, I would rather have access to someone who knows a decent amount about GameDev so I can ask questions and learn from them.  If I'm able to do it (skill wise), I'd like to help you on your project with anything I can, in exchange for a bit of your knowledge.  I may need a bit of guidance when working on something I've never done before, but you won't have to hold my hand if it's within my ability.

I also wouldn't mind maybe a couple hours a week watching you code on TeamViewer (screen share program)/Skype as I found doing that with a friend to be fun and full of chances to learn.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.  It may be too early for me to be trying to work with others, but I think there may be someone out there who could use someone like me, although it's a pretty niche situation.

Well, how about some [action and excitement](http://www.thelizardofodd.com/music/TrialbyFireofDOOM.mp3), or perhaps something more [soaring and dramatic](http://www.thelizardofodd.com/music/TakingTheNextStep.mp3)?

We have begun work on a new project destined for Kickstarter. We have Hero Engine seats available for qualified and talented individuals, and currently maintain a roster of 30+ on the team.

We have members on our team that have worked on projects for EA, Bioware, Trion Worlds and LucasArts on such titles as Dragon Age 2, SWTOR, RIFT, and more.

Production has begun on basic functionality (such as the questing system, etc.), animation, and assets.

The position will eventually be a paying one providing the Kickstarter is successful, with those jumping in early receiving incentives  on the back end. In our eyes, this is a partnership.

We plan for the game to be as fan-driven as possible, with no goals whatsoever of being a ""WoW-killer,"" however we do feel that the premise for the game is very, very unique. If we build it, they will come.

Hey everyone, my name's Kahlief Steele.

 I've been a pixel artist for 8 years now, which has led me to pursue a BFA in Graphic Design. That being said, I'm really interested in seeing others' ideas come to life, so I'd love to work on your project with you.

I've been working with game art for seven years and have started doing it commercially for the last three. As of right now, I'm full-time freelance so I have plenty of time to devote to your project.

I'm most comfortable with the pixel variety, but I've also been looking for opportunities to do more high-res assets as well.

My rates vary between project, but I always start with an estimate of either hours or a flat-rate. If it's a flat-rate, I usually ask for 30% up front and then 70% at completion of the batch or milestone. I do transactions through PayPal. *(At this point I'm not too interested in rev-share alone, but that combined with other payment might be an option.)*

 Above all, I want your project to shine. I'm dedicated to making that happen.

For quotes, inquiries, more of my portfolio, etc: email me at kas1092@gmail.com.

Thanks a lot for reading!

Pretty much just though it would be neat to find some people I might get a long with to work on a project. I don't have any game ideas in mind, but I'd like to just implement a bunch of core gameplay ideas and expand on any if necessary.

Ideal partners would be another programmer (who has a little bit of artistic skill) who has similar/more experience.

I'm also open to working with UDK.

I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post an add like this. If there are better please advise and I'll repost.

I am a game dev hobbyist, 2 years professional web and Java developer. I'm fluent in Java, as well as C#, which I have been using for about a year as I've begun developing in Unity (and briefly Blender, just for the experience). Before that, I had flings with JMonkeyEngine 3 and LWJGL. All of the projects I have started have just been too large for me to finish by myself.

That's primarily why I'm looking to dedicate myself to a team, to follow my passion and get some finished work out there. It also wouldn't hurt to make a few like-minded friends along the way!

As far as programming subject areas, I have at least limited experience in just about everything - AI, networking, physics, procedural generation.

In the last year I've shifted my focus from backend web and api development to game development. I've always been very strong in math and logic and the transition hasn't been very difficult.

Because I don't have any games to my name yet it's a bit difficult to get a team so I'm looking for other people, artists or otherwise, that are just starting out as well or are willing to take a chance.

I feel most comfortable working with Unity and C# but I can do java as well (if i have to). 

Also, I'm a full time freelancer, i work from home and set my own schedule. Generally speaking I spend about 20 hours a week working, the rest of the time I have free to pursue whatever projects i want. My point being that unlike a lot of the programmers you might find here, I don't really have a full time job to contend with so I can spend a great deal of time working on your project.

An article I wrote that communicates my gameplay theory and values as an indie developer:

http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/articles/game-design-articles/cubes-vs-space-marines-making-a-great-game-in-your-basement/

To address the main question immediately, yes it would be rev share,  50/50 split to keep things simple.

I'm not great at programming, but i can throw basic things together like you saw in the demo. I'm primarily a 3d artist so I'd prefer working at what I'm good at rather than spreading myself thin trying to make a game all by myself, it's a little frustrating to program gameplay systems knowing ideally someone is going to program them later at a higher level in the future. I've been making the game playable in the hopes of getting a programmer on board by showing the concept is doable and fun. I've only been working on things about a month or so and I'm pretty happy with how it's coming along so I decided to start looking  for a collaborator. I'm not looking for someone to jump on board just for the ride, I want someone discerning who wants to make a quality product and sees value in this idea.

Here's where I've sorta set up shop if you want to read more about the game and its currently envisioned design, it's all subject to change at your  discretion, I'd prefer to work in an open environment where everyone's opinion matters, but where we both have an idea of what's doable and fun as well.

http://www.gamesprout.com/ideas/51a50377782ab085a800004b/design_document

What the programmer would need to be  able to do:
Really expand on the dynamic nature and behaviors of the fish so adventuring in the depths of the ocean feels like a constant sandbox of discovery, create some relatively simple spawn mechanics, possibly procedural terrain, basic action/rpg elements and other general things to make a giant open ocean playable. 

I actually see this project as incredibly doable, that's why i picked fish, why it's a dynamic environment, every decision made was made not  just because it would be cool, but because it would also be easy to do. The game is just a few relatively simple systems that build together to potentially create an incredibly deep and engrossing experience that could reach an incredibly wide user demographic...

I've tried collaborating here before and ended up burned really bad twice, prototype phase went on for months and the collaboration burned out slowly over time, but i don't know anywhere else to try to find collaborators so here we go again! I can honestly say I'm easy to work with, ready to try to keep us both motivated and the other 2 guys just weren't cut out for this deal, don't know what else to say. If you're a committed programmer who can slam out fun games, we could really have a bad ass game on our hands in the near future...

That said, I'm looking for a collaborator with previously shipped games or demos that are up to this quality level! I'm not looking  to do this purely as a hobby, I fully expect this game has lots of potential to make a bit of money one way or another.

While I like to dream this game could one day ship and make money on it's own, I also see it as a portfolio project that might help me get hired somewhere at a place that makes fun innovative games. If anyone thinks I might be a fit in that regard, I would be interested in having that conversation as well! And if anyone else just wants to chime in, talk about the design document or whatever that's cool too.

We are forming a small development team to start production on our upcoming Survival game. Firstly, we require some promotional concept art, and possibly a video (if anyone here does those). The concept art will be used for promotional purposes, on Indiegogo &amp; Kickstarter. The art we require will give prospective players and customers an idea of what we have planned for the game, by highlighting certain content and features. We have a limited budget, as we will be funding the games development through crowdfunding. We would likely require 5-10 concepts done based on the quality, size, and level of detail.

Each art piece will reflect upon game content or a feature we want to highlight and promote. The game will be set around the year 2050, and is a post-apocalyptic survival game. The game will take place in the wasteland of the new world, and prominently feature a huge somewhat futuristic city. The atmosphere will be modern/futuristic but also decayed and dark. 

There will be several types of characters. Human survivors, Half human half machine (cyborg), and full machine humanoids. We'd like to feature both male/female characters and the protagonists/antagonists. 

Compensation
Our budget is between $500 and $1000, although we may increase our budget over time and especially if we raise funds from our campaign. We can pay a deposit up front, but would prefer to only pay for finished concepts so we are guaranteed getting what we want - as in the past we have had issues with not receiving what we've paid for (unfinished work). We would very much appreciate any artist who will charge us indie rates as we are crowdfunding. 

Deadline
1-2 Months. We aren't in a hurry. 

Usage
Promotional art to be put on Kickstarter/Indiegogo to promote the game.

If you are concerned with whether I'm a good investment of your time and faith, please skip past this first section below to the Bold text line **""Where My Work Starts""**

**What I believe in**

I've run a development team before. It's no walk in the park when you start at zero. If you don't have a consistent programmer (even one with little skill) or any other position, things may just never get done. In addition, a lot of people are in a hurry for money money money because their time is a premium. While that's true, haven't most every entity started up not through starting finances, but because they wanted to make a dream real?

I'm hoping that by posting this, I can find some people who believe in truly starting up a great development team that stays independent (never selling out) for the course of its lifetime. People who believe in working together, listening and giving good feedback to each other. Having a fun time, as well as getting the work -done-. A group where listening to player feedback -before- implementing changes isn't thrown out the window. High quality business practices? Anybody?

So here's me reaching out :) And no offense, but fair warning: This is not intended for hobbyist development. This is for people who want to make this their career.

The following two lists are what's generally expected of an applicant, as well as what you'll find in this new team. I -will- enforce it. 

Traits I'm looking for in a developer:

- a passion for game development and execution (dream, but act on it)
- low skill or none but willing to learn? No problem so long as you try; improving over time.
- ability to commit to a project and finish it, before starting a new one (exploring is fine and only natural, but remember it's no good having 4 unfinished games and nothing to show for it)

- Programmers (C++ or Java preferred)
- Artists (digital, concept, storyboarding, 2D, textures)
- Audio (music, sound effects)
- Writers (lesser extent until later down the road)
_______________________________

- zero tolerance for discrimination 
- positive work environment (blunt is fine, but be human)
- consistent communication
- have time to burn
- apply yourself
- communication through Skype preferred
- ability to read and use Google Docs
- Leaves of absence are fine if notice is given (except emergencies of course)

---Let it be clear---

I consider myself someone who works alongside a team, not above it. I'm happy to work like a mule as part of a team - I'm not going to slouch around on the sideline, or ""use you as a tool"" - that's not my thing. Learn for yourself, ask me questions, and for heaven's sake be a little objective before getting all evil or afraid or defensive. Learn me. Then judge. 

**Where I've been in Game Dev** ( The story, in case you want it. Else, scroll down)

This all started for me when I was leading a support group for Legend of Dragoon, a PS1 video game. I was never much of a Youtuber but I posted a video about my interest in the game, and I met over a hundred dedicated fans over the winter of 2007/2008. Anywho, the group lost momentum after awhile and some of them wanted to stay and try Game Design. Nobody knew what to do and we were certainly not ducks in a row. Largely because nobody else offered, I gave leadership a go. I didn't ""dev"" in a dedicated way until round two in 2012.

The game development scene started for me, with a team called [Abysmal Essence](http://i50.tinypic.com/1zocdgp.jpg). Yes, crappy name, but we didn't realize that Abysmal had such a negative connotation at the time. Starting in mid-2008 I in fact did not do much for asset development - mostly just leadership. Being honest, my only ""applied"" work is in Ast-Ore-Oids, a game being created by my longstanding friend Tyler and I. From 2008 till 2010 our single programmer and crew made four unfinished games, unable to stick to one thing. We first produced [Space Vigilantes](http://i49.tinypic.com/t5625f.png), basically a raw ""Space Invaders"" type of game. After getting enemy HP and player bullets done, the programmer got discouraged and wanted to work on something new. We made a game he called Mines, and later Snake Mines and then we renamed it again to [BlockRunner](http://i48.tinypic.com/mm8qy8.png). It was just a white screen with a faint grid 10x10 pixels per ""grid box."" Eventually it grew into a Snake-like, and we got levels and scaling music tracks that sounded more heavy as you leveled up. We hit a roadblock where we had a big white screen that hurt people's eyes, and serious memory leak and RAM issues. 

Sure enough the programmer switched again, and we tried a [Castle Defense](http://i49.tinypic.com/2r2908o.png) game. That one was nearly done. We followed in the tradition of the CD genre, but wanted to make it our own. We had stick figures moving across the screen, and depending on how high you click-dragged them into the air, they took fall damage and/or died. We had a working mud-pool that slowed enemy units, and the castle took damage when the enemies got close. We also had a very rough attacking animation, even if the graphics were poor. And while it didn't match, he added a missile powerup that had a 5-or-10 second cooldown that destroyed all enemies that it landed near. 

However, our programmer lost interest right when he got to the part where you buy upgrades at a cash shop. The Check-out button didn't work. We were so close to the game being functional, at least. That was the third project in a row suspended. By this time we were looking for a new programmer but had no luck. I realize now that I should've done more, directly, but it's in the past. Later, since the files weren't batched, a fellow team member and I re-textured Space Vigilantes and our [castle defense game](http://i46.tinypic.com/1128r9j.png), even if both games couldn't be completed (we never got the source code). At least it looked great in comparison to the old grass/sky/etc. This was around 2010. 

At this point we had a few dedicated people and no solid programming power, so everybody disbanded. I decided to just stop trying to have a cohesive team. I believe I made several mistakes but at the same time, I didn't pressure the programmer. I specifically told everybody that nobody would be forced, and he just didn't show up consistently. Great friend material, but not ideal for sticking to one thing. But it isn't -all- his fault, I'm not here to blame the programmer. I made the mistake of over-doing the leadership thing in 2008 and didn't learn until 2009 via an EVE Online experience.

For two years I was not involved in game development. In September 2012 this changed, as multiple people had been asking me to try again. I specifically said ""I am -not- doing this without a solid programmer, else it'll have to wait until I can program myself."" In response, my long-time friend Tyler was switching from PHP web programming into Java game dev. 

**Where my work starts**

So we started work in September. Tyler wanted to test his abilities by [recreating Block Runner](http://i48.tinypic.com/1264bq9.png) from scratch. By this time we realized there were several other games called Block Runner, so we renamed it to Ast-Ore-Oids a few months ago. Anywho, Tyler spent a lot of time figuring out how to make the game stable, while I focused on art. It was really tough as we still didn't have a theme at the time. Eventually we voted in favor of a Space theme, as square solid-color no-texture blocks on a white background still hurt the eyes, etc. At this point I developed [every art asset](http://i45.tinypic.com/166jbsz.png) except for the [title art](http://i48.tinypic.com/13zd9x3.png), which was done by a wonderful volunteer digital artist. 

We built it from the ground up since September 2012, and all of the art -except- the title art, is mine (also exclude menu buttons). That's really the best work I've done. I have done other things, but due to having a tough time in Blender I am having trouble with 3D modeling. I enjoy terrain editing and 3D modeling, but I only succeeded in those things in a game called Second Life which doesn't allow exporting. It's a virtual-avatar game, but I signed up for the building interface - still love it today, but I hope to learn Blender or something similar. I also liked Level Editing, where I spent months studying the -very- in-depth Unreal Tournament 2004's Unreal Ed 3. I went through so many hours of tutorials and I loved working through it; level design really spoke to me. I like the idea of taking that further, but I have not practiced in a long time. I know you guys want proof and I'm happy to give it, but this was almost ten years ago and I didn't think to make screenshots of my work or save it when switching computers.

Going forward, I'm very happy in Texturing, Terrain editing, level design, storyboarding, and concept art, but I would need to improve in most of these. I believe I'm most valuable right now as a texture artist and a concept artist/storyboard designer. My art was only supposed to be placeholder content in Ast-Ore-Oids but we have no other artists, so I've been re-designing and tweaking the art I made for AOO so it all feels like it's part of the same game. I'm it's main artist going forward, and I'm confident I'll do it justice. 

**You can play the alpha version** of Ast-Ore-Oids in PC or Mac at http://www.blockrunner.artistbeginnings.com for now. Tyler did all the programming, and I did all art except the title page. By the way, [here's a peek](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLHxAPqzoK1HyVwFlbtBD5sK7njfzj6wZLtqSmRsjQo/) at a decently-organized plan Tyler and I wrote up for AOO and have been updating since September up to now. If you need more, ask and advise.


**Leadership experience**

I've had a lot of amateur leadership experience over the last five years; although I don't claim to be a know-it-all or very well-seasoned compared to industry professionals. I like organization and I like making sure everybody's on the same page. I have lead my former game development team from 2008-2010, and the new one with myself and a single friend. I've also been at the center of an EVE Online alliance that's been 400-700 members since 2009. Most of my duties have included running their [forums](http://eve-legio.com/forum/) and [scoreboard](http://www.eve-legio.com/kb/?a=home), as well as helping make key leadership decisions for what we do in-game with a leadership council. As it stands I'm still at the center of it, but I'm not in charge. I generally like to do all the ugly work that nobody else wants to do, such as alliance roster management (making sure people who leave the alliance no longer have access on the forums). I also administrate their voice chat server on Teamspeak, and I issue the bills to all alliance corporations every month that pay for our people's PVP fun and so on. Basically I'm the desk clerk, haha; I stopped playing the game for ""fun"" about two years ago. A lot of people just wanted to play the game and have fun, so when almost no-one offered to help manage these things, I stepped up knowing I'd keep it all in check.

So why? Why do all that? I'll tell you why. I often see entities that, big or small, have obviously bad or underhanded practices. That, or nobody steps up when the help is needed. I really dislike that, and I put myself in the equation -when welcomed-, knowing that I strive for making sure an entity stays healthy. A lot of teams fall apart because Person A doesn't care so long as he gets paid, and Person B is a huge slacker, and Person C is never around. I do leadership/management because I know I'll catch things like this, and politely notify people so we can get a replacement when somebody goes sour or simply has to leave for real-life stuff for awhile. As my superior says ""I keep the machine well-oiled and well-maintained."" I know management in itself is not as vital as the people providing art/audio/programming, but without healthy management a team's potential can go so awry it's saddening and disheartening. I don't ""need"" to be the leader, but I'll be darned if I let a group I'm a part of die just because nobody wants to save the team when the ship is ready to get a hull breach and sink. So that's why I offer to lead - because I know I'll *take care* of something to the best of my ""amateur"" ability. It's not much in the real world, but it's a pretty good start. 

So that's a bit about me, my work, and where I've been. If you want unrelated personal details, just ask. I think I've lengthened this post long enough for right now. I've got a few GDDs to write.

I am programming and funding an iOS RPG, which is in need of a 3D artist.  The artist must be proficient in 3D modeling, rigging/animating, texturing.   Both environmental and character models will need to be low poly, so experience with iOS / Android game dev is useful.   The game is set in a sci-fi universe so any experience with sci-fi art is also very helpful.

This is a paid position which will include rev-share.  Please provide a link to your porfolio as well as any other projects you have worked on that you feel are relevant.

A little about myself.  I have released 3 iOS titles so far, the most successful being [Deadlock: Online](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/deadlock-online/id439931031?mt=8) which has grossed over $200k to date.  I was also the programmer for [Free2Die](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-2-die/id518201510?mt=8).  I am hoping to find a well rounded artist which I can work with on this game plus future titles.

Requirements:

* Commitment to producing high-quality code using professional practices, including source-code control and unit testing.

* Excellent C++ skill (or excellence in other languages with an interest in becoming an excellent C++ programmer).

* Detail orientation.  This is a research group, but we're building serious games that are used and judged by practicing physicians-- stability and realism are paramount. 

* A strong interest in computer graphics and/or game development.

* An unmistakable passion for solving hard problems in creative and insightful ways.  A strong interest in learning about and playing with the very latest technologies in graphics, games and VR.

* Comfortable with ill-defined or unusual problems.

[x-post from /r/Gaming]",17,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/12ki7l/creating_a_spiritual_successor_to_age_of/,"So, not that long ago I [commented on a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11tfwb/this_was_my_childhood_im_ashamed_to_say_i/c6pjdzr) stating that I was hoping to make a successor to Age of Mythology in the near future. I wasn't planning to actually get the game into development until 2013, but due to the massive amount of interest from the community, I figured I would see if we could get it started sooner rather than later.


I run a startup indie game development company, [Adanac Entertainment](http://adanac-entertainment.com), with a friend of mine. The company's origins were from the mod '[EvilMinecraft](http://evil-minecraft.net)' for Minecraft, leading us to want to build upon the 'sandbox/survival voxel game' genre which has led to the development of [Latura](http://latura.net). Personally, I'm also directing another large Minecraft mod project that is currently not announced, writing comic books, and doing contract game design work for another indie startup.


There are various ideas being thrown around for the name of the game - some as simple as 'Mythology', while others would relate to a fictional story based upon the various mythologies featured in the game. If you have a suggestion for the name, feel free to post it in the comments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, on to how you can help. Obviously, a game such as this will require a lot of work. Below are a few of the positions that we're going to need.

* Programmers - both front-end and back-end. We may create the engine from scratch, so people with experience in that area are highly welcomed. Likely will be written in C++.
* Modelers - People skilled in creating 3D models for people/creatures/buildings/etc. of various formats. Specific format will be decided when an engine is chosen / created.
* Audio / Music
* Level Designers
* Animators - Animate the models.
* Texturers / Artists - Create various textures for the game's assets, as well as things like logos. Concept artists are also needed!
* Web Developers - Work to create a website / forums and any other required web pages for the game.
* PR / Community Management - We'll need a few people to help in this aspect, as it is going to be a large project. You would help run social media feeds as well as help to look after the forums.
* Community Members - Throw all your wildest ideas for the game at the team.


If you wish to help in any of those aspects(or help in another way), you can either e-mail me at miclee@adanac-entertainment.com or simply send me a private message on Reddit. Be sure to give examples of your previous works, and actually talk about yourself a bit. Single-line applications will just be ignored(show me that you want to put the effort in!). This is more of a community project, so unfortunately there won't be any initial pay. If there's interest, we may launch a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo for the project once we get it rolling.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,False,,,True,t3_12ki7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/12ki7l/creating_a_spiritual_successor_to_age_of/,

My name is Ricardo. 

I do pixelart and I helped with a couple of amateur games in the past, but nothing serious. So far, pixelart was just a hobby for the spare time, but I am considering to try and push this hobby into something more serious. I don't know if this is possible, but I want to try.

Have a look at my humble portfolio, if you please: 

http://ricardo73.deviantart.com/

I would be interested in helping with any project that sound good and doable, but according with the following points:

* I can work for free o paid. If it is for free, I will be very picky choosing the project that I like, and I wont feel obligated to any commitment with the project. But if it is paid, I will be as professional and committed as I am at work. It makes sense, isn't?

* Many people assume that they are going to make money, so they promise you a percentage in the profits once they sell it or after the kickstarter... For me, a share in the future profit of something that doesn't exist yet is equal to nothing. I will take it as unpaid work.

* I am afraid out there are many guys who think they can make a game, even if they have no previous experience, even if they don't know how to code but they think they can ""design"" or ""write a story"". Well... I am afraid that 9 out of 10 of those projects are going to fail. Maybe they are lucky, but I wont bet my time and work on it. A project started by someone who can not program, or do something really relevant (not write a story) is an ill fated project.

* I will like to work with someone who actually have some previous project done, someone who can show me a portfolio, some proof that they are able to create a game.

Sorry if I sound too demanding! I just want to make things clear.

I'm credited in two reasonably popular cross platform open source games. A list of projects I've performed:

* Advocated for and eventually implemented new testing framework for a 10+ year old project.
* Advocated for and eventually implemented cross-platform build system (CMake) to replace the previous three-headed build system.
* Created a set of web pages for presenting player performance statistics.
* Created a web app allowing players to upload, rate, and download player-made levels and scripts either via a web interface or in-game. (I'm particularly proud of this as it required a C++ project interfacing with a PHP application. I developed both sides of the required interface as well as the entire web app).
* Created a CI server using buildbot with cross-compilation toolchains for w32 and Mac OSX
* Created a large group of Lua-based plugins to increase the functionality of the built-in level editor well beyond its previous capabilites
* Improved the exposed Lua API to enhance plugin capabilities
* Acted as an open resource for community members attempting to write game scripts
* Acted as a liaison between the dev team and community members to communicate development plans and explain design decisions in a way a 12 year old can understand.
* All manner of bug fixes and miscellaneous feature requests

Here's a list of languages I would feel comfortable writing in today, in order of familiarity:

* C++ (or C, but you'd have to do some convincing)
* Google Go
* Javascript (I've written a potentially interesting node.js game networking library)
* PHP
* Ruby
* Python
* Lua

To be upfront about my background, I have no formal CS training. I started programming my TI-83 in middle school nine years ago, began learning web development six years ago, and started seriously contributing to open source software and games in my spare time three years ago.

To that end, I'm looking either for a paid opportunity or an interesting open source project for my portfolio.

I am proud of the work I have done for the projects I've worked on so far, but I feel that my portfolio lacks a ""wow"" factor, so I'm looking for a project which will add that. Please keep this in mind if your project is **unpaid**.

Throughout my 12 years of animation experience I have gained a wealth of knowledge that I enjoy engaging my colleagues with. My natural teaching ability and strong technical background has allowed me to excel in every facet of the industry. I quickly became an inspirational lead animator, motivating teams large and small to complete projects on time and on budget.  From learning how to work efficiently and quickly in on television projects to working directly with clients on commercial work.  I have feature film and video game experience that expanded my repertoire of subtle character driven acting and technical animation. Next I  competently accepted the challenge of being the Animation department head for a studio, overseeing and animating on 2 projects across multiple studio locations and time zones.

What we need are a couple of soldiers from a top down perspective as well as a side profile.  The look should be similar to the game, Trenches, if you are familiar with that.

If you are interested here is what I'm offering.  Create a couple of pieces for us for the Kickstart campaign.

If the project is successful we can pay you your rate and we can continue to design and develop the game, at which point you can stay on as the artist or take the money and go.  

If the KS campaign fails, you can take your art back along with the 150-200 for your time.  I know its not much but its at least something.

I currently work on an RPG, together with a friend of mine, where the player finds equipment, gold and gains experience points, by running in the real world.

The player will spend a lot of time on our homepage, which we're developing right now. Also, most of the calculations are currently handled on the server.

Unfortunately though, we're absolutely crap at developing iOS applications. We get it on a theoretical plan, but we simply cannot program it ourselves (this is very much just a hobby project).

We would love to have a third developer on board. We're two very nice guys and we definitely think that the game has some potential.

To begin with we just needs a prototype that really doesn't make anything else than simply getting the iPhone users location, send the location to our servers and display the result in a uiWebView. However, the iOS application is pretty vital, so in the long run, the application of course should be able to do a lot of other stuff as well!

I know that we don't have a lot to offer, but we would be more than thrilled if any of you guys would like to work a bit on this project with us.

Also, when someone simply wants to build the prototype, we would also pay 50 USD for that (and yes, we know that's not very much...).

Some of you may know me if you have been loitering around the chip music scene for the last few years - but as most of you won't I'll give a brief introduction.

My name is Nathan, and I go by Derris-Kharlan online. I am a music composer based in Melbourne, Australia with a degree in composition and a ton of game soundtracks under my belt.  I'm mostly known for my chip music work, and have played numerous shows/festivals around Australia and the United States. However, I write in a range of styles and can pretty much pick up a style/genre/aesthetic just by listening to it. Essentially what I can offer you is extremely high quality, interesting music, very short turnover, really reasonable rates (not free: my work has value), genuine enthusiasm and the ability to take your game's audio from mediocre to spectacular. Find a varied list of example tracks below. 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

[Dual Dimensions](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/dual-dimensions) is a rejected WIP for the game Parallax. Electronic / atmospheric. 

[Dr. Mad Stage 1 (old remix)](http://rokkochan.bandcamp.com/track/dr-mad-stage-1-old-chipped-by-derris-kharlan) was an requested remix of a Rokko Chan (megaman flash game) track. 
Chiptune / Dance / House

[Folder Quest](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/folder-quest) is the title theme for one of the games I am working on. 
Chiptune / Orchestra

[The Organic Food Store](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/the-organic-food-store) is Jazzy

[Lazy Morning
](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/lazy-morning) is Funky / Disco

[Luminesce](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/luminesce) - I'm mostly known for my chip music work, and have played numerous shows/festivals around Australia and the United States. This was the promo track for the recent Blip Festival that was held in Melbourne Australia.

[Shop](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/shop) - Final Fantasy Tactics style shop theme. I was going for a lighter fun feel and felt that a busier track is somewhat appropriate in a shop scenario (seeing as all you are usually doing is navigating lists)

[Underwater](http://soundcloud.com/derris-kharlan/underwater) - Theme for an underwater city / village or something. 

[Synthy](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/synthy) is ethereal and synthy. Actually the track that I pitched to the Parallax guys to get the job. Very atmospheric.

[Opening](http://weeklybeats.com/#/derris-kharlan/music/opening) - this was made for one of my clients for the opening movie to their game. Medieval/Opening/Voiceover

[Sol](http://chiptuneswin.com/track/sol) - Was my track on the CHIPTUNES = WIN compilation that was recently released. 

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

I have SO MUCH MORE MUSIC. And a I obviously can't show most of the stuff for projects that are currently in progress... but if you have any requests of certain styles feel free to ask and I can either email you a track or post it here if I am allowed.

Finally, I know this post is mainly about games - but feel free to contact me about requests of any kind. I've scored short films/documentaries - even made sound bites for company mascots and recently wrote the soundtrack to a client's wedding invitation!

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

Just a note: I do not work for free. It's my view that if a developer isn't willing to invest money into quality assets / sound, why should I invest my time into their project. I am acutely aware of how difficult it can be for indie developers to fund projects - but that's why I charge so little (and are really flexible... rev share/downpayments depending on circumstances etc) for indie devs. There are mechanisms in place for funding these days (kickstarter, indiegogo... even just good old fashioned sponsoring) so there is really no excuse for not compensating workers. I hope this doesn't come off as dickish - but a man's got to eat!

As an artist, I do all the art for my games. I can do background and 2d asset art, as well as some 2d animation. I've had contract work as an artist for an iOS title (which didn't get released) and I've done commission work before. I am experienced with Photoshop/Illustratior and I can use gimp when I have to. I've also done some 3D work, and I'm familiar with Blender 3D and Maya. Ask me to draw you something, and I'll probably do it for free, because I like to draw so much.

Here is the link: 

http://www.kradenscrypt.com/

Here's a quick game summary: 

You’ve been the last to be banished and sealed into the Kraden’s Crypt, You must make your way into the very depths where Kraden himself resides, but many dangers await! Fight alone or with friends with the physics based battle system, where you control every hurl of your spell, every swing of your weapon or every pluck of your bow. Mix and match equipment and weapons to determine your class and play style. Fight Epic bosses, hordes of enemies and why not celebrate your victories in the tavern rooms with a few friendly crypt creatures? You may meet new characters that tell the story of the Crypt from many different perspectives. Never play the same game twice with our randomly generated Crypt that can catch you off guard through any given door!

We aim to make this game a unique physics orientated combat game, where you refine your skills in swinging your weapons with mouse controlled combat. We are tired of playing games that require a repetitive array of button bashing with only a few variations to compensate. We want you to feel the swing of your weapon, we want to make a game that gives the players the ability to carefully time, aim and control your attacks. We want you to feel the impact of an orc’s charging attack, and see the consequence of mistakes, thus making Kraden’s Crypt all the more rewarding when you prevail! We think the fundamental game-play with these mechanics combined with clever scenarios and coop game-play will offer plenty of challenge, replay value and endless possibilities for the future of the game.

Not only this we are story tellers at heart so we want these characters to feel alive, and very much part of the world around them. Some charters have had a rough past, some are just plain stupid. Some grunts of Kraden will prefer to Drink in the taverns and have long drowned their past in fine old aged Ales, and of course there’s the mystery that is Kraden himself, who even some creatures of the Crypt are skeptical about.

We want the game to unfold through a randomly generated dungeon, so it will offer a different gaming experience every time you play.  Of course we have big ambitions for the game but we want to build from the ground up and we are far from realizing our vision, If you like what you have read and seen about Kraden’s Cyrpt, and would like to see it come to life then help us by sharing it with friends and family, Spread the word!

Also We have no game programmer on the team yet, Our video is simply conceptual emulated game play, a detailed game pitch, but we feel we have done a pretty good job portraying what we wan’t to aim for with our game,

If you would like to be a part of the team as a programmer or know someone who would then please get in touch and contact us at:

foster@wisewonky.com

Of course we wish this to be a commercial game and we will negotiate a fair cut for those who participate, we know it’s not an easy task and we want you to have creative input so long as you like the fundamental aspects of the game. If you already like what what you've seen then we share common ground in what we thing makes a great game.

I've done sprite sheets and animations before, so I do have the technical skills. I have just not tackled on a larger project before. Always doing small projects and what not.

Here's a small sample of some the pixel art I did a little while ago today, just to show my abilities up to date:

http://i.imgur.com/9CjWMkR.png

I am prepared to show more of my work if you would like.

I am serious about making a full game, but it doesn't have to be ridiculously big.

I am in a situation where I can pump many hours into this per week.

I can do 2D pixel art, both tiled and free-styled, animated sprites, I can also do -close- to vector art (but I've been practicing my pixel art skills lately, and it takes less time to do).

My current interests are in RPG's, fantasy or sci-fi games, non-traditional mechanics, but then again, *I'm willing to do a lot of things.*

I also have a basic understanding of programming in java and C#, if that counts.
And a basic understanding of composing music, if that also counts.

Not sure where to start, so here I am, looking for a programmer that may be in the same shoes (or boat, wherever you are from) as I am.

So as to who I am looking for:

-A programmer that is prepared to make a fully functional game in the next few weeks or more, which is most likely going to be made in 2D.

-Unpaid, of course, and with that mindset. This is mainly for a portfolio/to make something cool, but I won't be passing it off as just a ""hobby"". I'm dead serious about this, and so should the programmer. If it does end up selling for any reason, that's just a bonus.

-Also does game design. I don't want to make MY game or YOUR game but OUR game. I want a programmer with ideas as well, so we can bounce off each other. 

I've done some small projects with others so I'm not completely new to this.

Please PM me if you are interested!

Hello everyone, I am an experienced 2D artist with a wide selection of artistic talents. My core talents include character design, User interfaces, 2D asset production, 2D Asset animation, promotional artwork, and a strong focus on user experience. 

Comfortable artistic ranges and styles go from cartoon, to comic, to realistic painting, and I'm flexible enough to match the design styles already put in place by previous artists. I use photoshop for asset creation, and Spine for asset animation.

I also have team-mangement/design experience, so check out my portfolio site and see if I would be a good fit for you or your team. 

Thanks!

I am about 8 months deep into the development of a unique tower defense game. It features a **large open world**, as opposed to level based... Which makes it rather different than traditional tower defense games. I would say that, development wise, the game is around **80% completed**. I currently have a 20 page design document, detailing nearly every aspect of the game.

Thus far, I am simply using ripped images, and programmer art, which is why I'm looking for *you*, the artist. As of now, the team consists of myself, and a writer, who is busy creating the universe and lore.

**Responsibilities:**

* Top down / 2d pixel sprites
* Item / Spell Icons
* UI elements (Buttons, Windows, etc.)

**About Myself:**

My name is Anthony, I'm 23, and I have been developing games as side projects for the last 4 years. I have a real passion for making RPGs, and I've taken most genres I've dabbled in, and turned them into an RPG hybrid. 

I've entered 2 games into my university's game programming competition, and I won **both years** consecutively. This competition is judged by industry professionals. I also had the honor of judging the competition this year, since I am now alumni, and the only repeat winner.

Here is a video of the trailer from my 2012 entry. I created this solo, in less than 2 months. (It's mostly programmer art, so try and disregard how bad it looks)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_dC4vfSPoU


My ultimate goal is to quit my day job, and do indie development full time. I do plan on creating a kickstarter, and marketing this game, to make it profitable enough where I can make that goal a reality.

**Compensation:**

I am looking for someone who also wants to be part of a successful indie project, and take a share of the revenue. Unfortunately, I cannot pay up front, but I am looking for more of a partner than a contractor.


If you're even slightly interested, PM me, and we can set up a Skype call, where I will give you the full concept, along with a quick demo of what is implemented so far. 

I am really excited about the game concept, and I hope you will share that enthusiasm as well.

If you have any samples of some pixel art you've completed, I'd be interested in seeing some links to that as well.

Thanks!

EDIT: Added a video of my solo project which won the 2012 competition.

As a self taught programmer, my area of weakness is shaders and math, and I need a programmer to perform two specific tasks in an OpenGL 2.0 + SDL 1.2 based engine I coded in C++:

* Implement GLSL support (shaders)

You'll need to add GLSL support to the game, so that mappers can easily specify what shaders to apply per object or per level. This task does not require much interaction with existing code, and should be easy if you've worked with shaders before. You will also need to add a few basic shaders to the game, to be used for objects like light sources (lanterns, fire, light shaft) and smoke clouds/trails - nothing very complicated.

* Modify the collision code to add support for collisions between n-sided polygons.

You can use a library like Box2D or boost::geometry for this task (as long as the library doesn't have a problematic license), and you will need to modify existing code. Your code will be used for the combat, movement and collision between sprites and/or level geometry.

Details:

* This is a freelance, work from home gig.
* I can provide a fixed payment in the region of 500 USD (negotiable). 
* There is no urgent deadline, however you will be expected to finish the tasks in a reasonable amount of time. 
* You won't be asked to do anything other than the two tasks mentioned above.

The yellow ramp (represents a staircase) you can use to move up and down floors. You can change speed using the walk/run button at the top right corner and switch player using the top left two.

My name is **Adam Haynes** and I am a music composer available to compose music for your game projects. I compose music for media in a variety of styles, which can immediately be heard in my new showreel here:


* [Showreel - Audio Version - Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/adamhaynes/adam-haynes-composer-showreel)
 

* [Showreel - Video Version - YouTube](http://youtu.be/yau2O-eYOpQ)


The majority of my music is written in the way that **video game music** is: by capturing mood, pace, and character within the piece, whilst setting the scene and establishing an atmosphere. I'm particularly fond of writing music that is fun, quirky, and exaggerated, but I also compose music in a more subtle and emotional style too. I like to focus on themes (character or location) and strong melodies. 
I like to write in many styles, including: classical, jazz, orchestral, instrumental, medieval, choral, piano, blues, abstract/avant-garde, electronic/synth, chiptune, ambience, rock/metal, ""movie-esque"" styles, all with a large variety of instrumentation. 


My biggest influence in my music is **Nobuo Uematsu** (*Final Fantasy*), whilst also taking inspiration from composers such as Grant Kirkhope (*Banjo-Kazooie*), Junichi Masuda (*Pokémon*), and Joe Hisaishi (*Studio Ghibli*). Some metal works are also influential on me, such as Opeth's writing techniques, as well as classical composer Felix Mendelssohn.

Some of my original compositions can be heard in my Soundcloud sets:

I successfully achieved a BA in Music Composition for Professional Media in 2012, and have the ability to compose, orchestrate, and arrange in many styles. Alongside my VGM composition styles, I am confident in my ability in writing music from different periods of Western classical and for multiple instruments of the orchestra. I also compose in styles from different cultures, such as Chinese folk, Argentine Tango.
I mostly compose digitally using VSTi.



I have had experience in working with music for animation (*The Bird Girl*), a point-and-clink adventure game (*Absent*), several student-films (Space Opera for Piano), and have recently had my work showcased at [AlphaOmegaRadio.com](http://www.alphaomegaradio.com/) as a 'Featured Composer'.

I'm currently working with a studio in Canada and they are looking for multiple software engineers right now. This does need to be an on-site position, however relocation assistance is a possibility.  Skills wise they are looking for generalists with experience in Unity and a variety of languages (C#, JavaScript, Objective-C, C/C++, etc.). The pay scale has not been defined yet as the search is just starting but they are pretty competitive within the industry.

This company is serious about hiring so if you are interested or know anyone who might please feel free to get in touch. The quickest way is probably by email at: tedwards@thenewellgroup.com or you can give me a call at 864-288-0011 ext. 200 (or ask for Todd). You can also feel free to message me on here but I don't check it as often as I do my email. Also if you aren't interested in this particular position but would like to keep in touch or for me to keep you in mind for anything I run across feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=169388402&amp;trk=hb_tab_pro_top).

I'm happy to report that it won an award, and so I plan to finish the game and get it ready for a full release. As part of that process, I'd like to get a talented artist to redo all of my programmer art in the game. There won't be too much of it, and it should be fairly abstract and simple, but I'm hoping to find someone who can take these constraints and make the game look gorgeous.

Bombball is a fast-paced abstract eSport game. You can get a better sense of it by [watching the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlpgQqF0ZlA) or [playing the game online](http://emcneill.com/playable/Bombball.html) [Unity]. Due to the choice of surf rock music, the frantic pace of the game, and my placeholder art style, the game has ended up with a sort of beach party feel to it, though that's certainly not a requirement. I'd like the graphics to stay energetic, simple, and abstract (players and mosty objects will still be circular, for example), but beyond that, I'd like the artist to bring a good sense of visual style, as I have little. Just make sure it looks good and fits the music and game feel.

Other notes:

* **You must be able to finish this project by mid-March**, including revisions. I'm aiming to release the game by the 23rd, and I want to make sure there is some buffer time to insert and correct the art.
* **You must be willing to accept more work post-release.** I expect to continue expanding the game, and if that requires more art, I need to be able to work with you at a similar or slightly-higher rate.
* **Pay is negotiable.** I am willing to offer a flat payment or to offer rev-share, but the amount will be limited by my indie budget and the nature of the art requirements.

**Please PM me samples of your work** for consideration. I would also love to see concepts or mockups of your ideas for this game, even if it's just your version of the player circle. I will contact you if I am interested in your services, and I will post here when the position is filled.

**Art Style**

I am leaning towards a stylized semi-realistic paintery / sketch / comic-book and I am not too keen on fully realistic, anime or pixelated 8bit look. [Here is a reference](http://www.koobazaur.com/temp/art_reference_sheet.jpg)

However, I am still very open at this stage; I feel the work will be better if the artists have more freedom and can really put themselves in it, than merely tunneling someone's narrow vision.

**What Is Postmortem?**

Postmortem is a short exploratory adventure game taking place in a fictional industrial-age country of Galicia, ravaged by five years of violent rioting between two ideologically and economically divided communities. You play as death incarnate, sent to a fundraising gala with the objective of claiming a single life from any of its attendants and staff.

By exploring the space, conversing with the patrons, and uncovering various clues, you will learn about the world and the characters, revealing how their deaths might (or might not!) influence the country.

But how much should you meddle with mortal affairs? Perhaps a random choice is the fairest? What other effects could your involvement have?",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1360303661.0,,,True,t3_1847e2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1847e2/lfartist_2d_graphics_for_postmortem_one_must_die/,

My name is Jan Johansson, I live in Sweden and are at the age of 26. I have been working with **game development for ~6 years** and have been using Unity3D the last 2 years.

Early in my career I spent around **3 years developing racing car games** with online web leaderboard systems with administration tools. In short I worked on several different systems since the PC team was small so we all had a more fluid role which was good for me since it gave be a great start with a lot of insight.

Secondly I worked as a **programmer/project teacher and developer for around 1.5 years**, my teaching role is one of the better professional experiences I have had. After quitting my previous work I started my own game company which mainly produces games for the mobile market, also rapid prototyping is something that we perform.

Currently I have just finished a break in all that is programming, I attended a 30p course in Informatics with Emphasis in Creative Media Production in which I learned more deeply about storytelling, game design and 3D graphics.

Now we supply multiple services, mainly Programming, Design and **QA (which is an free addition performed by my company partner)**, but we are in the process to employ 2D/3D artists so we can supply a client with a total package. We also believe in keeping the client updated and integrated throughout the entire development process so all of us comes out of the **collaboration** happy.

Before this ends up being a wall of text I'll sum up my main skills as a programmer and individual:

* I have been working with almost all aspects of game programming / technical programming. Gameplay, UI, Network, Databases, 2D and 3D Graphics, Shaders, Animations, Tools, Audio, Mobile development, Build Systems.

* I use tools like Maya and Photoshop up to a intermediate level so even if I am “only” a programmer I still have knowledge in other fields that will help me communicate.

* I know the workflow of creating a game, from and idea to a finished product and the hardship that comes between.

* I have developed multiple rapid prototypes for a veteran game company and with great result.

* I am organized, structured, easygoing, helpful, driven, humorous, honest and from what I have heard, a bit stubborn ;) I like they city life as much as nature life (Fishing, hikes, boat rides, etc)

Also we are **open to other kinds of payment**, such as full project, lower rate compensated by sales share, etc. Tell us you situation and we will do our best to come up with a solution!

**The Project**

[Example Image](http://thegame-pad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/PULPLogo.png)

Overview: PULP! is a highly customizable, single player science fantasy 3D skyship combat game. Battle enemies in top down ship-to-ship combat, arm frigates with every-thing from cannons to rayguns, and think strategically to vanquish your foes. All this while
following a story based on our heroine Riva; a confident and brutally honest military commander. Deemed too troublesome to have in the public eye, she becomes her nation’s only hope in a conflict no one expected them to win.

1339955452.0,10,self.gameDevClassifieds,v6o1y,[LFA]rtists Who Can Do Isometric Spriting (Rev-Share/Negotiable),11,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/v6o1y/lfartists_who_can_do_isometric_spriting/,"Heya, Reddit. 

We're making an MMORPG, but one that evokes more the days when 'roleplaying game' really meant a game where you roleplayed. Inspired by certain other online roleplaying games, we're hoping to make one that combines good gameplay with good roleplay, and to that end we need spriters.

Payment is... Well, we have a budget. We've got money, if you need it. Off the bat you'll have the rights to part of any profit the game makes from donations, microtransactions, advertising or what have you. If potential money doesn't exactly strike your fancy (totally understandable), we have current money that could be paid as well- Negotiable.

In summation, the game's set in a world fairly similar to 1920s North America. The new money get richer, the old money get older, and the poor folks down below just get trodden on. However, this world is a bit different- For one thing, the colonization of this 'America'- the continent of Dabriehn- was delayed until much later. And, there's magic- Runic tattoos made with crystals found along the ley lines of the world that allow their user to gather power and cast spells.

For a simple way to describe this setting is 'dark dieselpunk magitech fantasy'- There are no elves here, but instead the Dwarves and their offshoots- Humans, cavelings, giants- dominate the world. Below them are the natives of Dabriehn, the Demibeasts- Normal animals transformed into humanoid creatures by magical pollution. Satyrs, harpies, neireids (fishpeople), and wyverns all live in tribal groups on Dabreihn, though now they mostly live in slums. A [world map](http://i.imgur.com/zvfXY.jpg) has been done, if you're curious.

Just so you know we actually do mean business here, here's some artwork examples done by the head concept artist and creator of the setting- Two of the playable races, the [harpies](http://i.imgur.com/3tueo.png) and the [satyrs](http://i.imgur.com/tTiCC.png). (There's also a design document if you want to read it, 80+ pages at the moment) We have an artist for concept and design, several skilled programmers, and a reasonably large number of potential testers and players.

From you, we're hoping for sprites.

First off, we'll need terrain. The look we're going for is an isometric 3d sprite game. Remember [Final Fantasy Tactics Advance](http://defaultprime.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/ffta.jpg)? Like that, but with a color set more suiting the setting (or not, we're not picky). The character models and such would be from that isometric view as well. Gameplay would also be rather similar in its basics of turn-based strategy, although adjusted for playing a single character.

Second, monsters and NPCs. They'd need at least a simple four-way facing model, and a movement animation (Although for most NPCs, probably not the movement.) Attack animations are very much appreciated and hoped for, but not required at the moment.

Lastly, the players themselves. As an RP-based game, character individuality and customization are really major parts. We're not asking for Skyrim- Instead, what we're hoping for a base model + features kind of system. Separate sprites for clothing, equipped items (Probably just armor and such, not weapons or runes or anything), and hair, so that you don't have to actually draw each individual combination. They would also need the four-directions-movement sprites. Attack animations for them would be wonderful, but are not necessary at this point in time. Though adding them later would be a lot more of a nuisance... Spell effects and such are included in that 'not necessary but really really nice' category.

Monster design and visual stuff have people to take care of them- Our main issue is our difficulty in working with isometric sprites. That's what we need you for. There wouldn't be a deadline, really, since our only goal here is to get the game made.

If you want to get into contact about this, email me at jcolema22015@yahoo.com or add me on MSN with the same.

I'm not a lead coder by any means but i think i could bring a lot to a team as a technical artist, particularly in unity or UDK. I think I have a knack for gameplay but I don't let that get in the way of my core role which has usually been artist.

I'm a damned hard worker and easy to get along with. Dunno what else to say, it's been a rough year being on indie teams that have inevitably fallen apart for one reason or another, but that's just how it goes sometimes.

I've done mobile too. So I've got a pretty good range of experience and I know how to build a full stack, game client, server, web, mobile side, all that jazz, whatever is required.

I simply want to undertake a fun creative endeavor and try to build something that people may like. Something my son might like to play one day. I'm looking for a partner because frankly two heads are better than one, and I find the odds of a project finishing go up when you can get a second person to maintain momentum when you go through lulls yourself.

I'd prefer to work in 2d, as I think it just simplifies a lot of things. But that's all up for debate.

If you can only model, that might be okay, because we could do something with a flat/minimal/procedural look. Just please have more skills than merely having game ideas.

If you still really want to show us your musical composition skills you can PM me and I'll definitely take a look.

As for 3D artists we are still allowing some of our applicants to make and submit their sample work. However, we are still open for 3D artists and anyone else who think they may be a good addition to our small and tightly knit team. 

We like talented people, but more importantly we would like to meet people who we would enjoy working with on a daily basis and maybe even become good friends with :). Keep producing great games and content no matter what!

Our group email: explosivepixelinc@gmail.com

We are Explosive Pixel: http://explosivepixelgames.com/blog/
  We've worked on smaller, simpler games in a program called Scratch, ,but from the beginning of this year we've started to get into Unity 3D. 
  
I myself have just quickly made a minigame over the past week and posted it to Kongregate(see link at bottom). Other than the ad revenue from Kongregate, we haven't done much commercial work. We are more of a hobbyist group right now but we are certainly looking into doing more commercial work in the future.

We are right now just interested in setting up a team to work with. Our current size is 3 members. We are open to add people of all skills but we specifically are lacking in certain artistic fields. We would be most interested with people who have experience in: music composition, 3D texturing and animation.

As for our skill level, I would say intermediate-amateur Unity users. I've been programming in Java for 2-3 years, C# and javascript in Unity. I've also been into video editing, motion graphics, and general photoshop for 2 years. My other partners program as well and we all have done some basic modeling and texturing, such as basic architecture, powerup items, etc.

Please leave a reply if you are interested.

You can check out some demos on my [website](http://robrisley.weebly.com/) or [BandCamp](http://robrisley.bandcamp.com/) page and also some [samples](http://robrisley.bandcamp.com/album/works-in-progress) of works in progress from some games I'm currently working on.

As you might notice, I compose in a range of styles from retro/chiptune, to orchestral, metal, etc. I'm a guitarist by trade but I really like branching out and doing different genres and instrumentations. My goal really is to make sure I'm creating music that matches the developer's vision.

As far as compensation goes, I try to be as flexible as possible because I know everyone's situation is different. I can work on a pay-per-track or per-minute of music basis. I'm open to the idea of rev-sharing as well. For small projects, I can be even more flexible. And I'm always happy to do a free spec demo up front.

The game is a word puzzle game in a similar vein to Ruzzle / Scramble With Friends.  The gameplay is essentially finished, it needs some juice and polish though.

What I'm looking for in graphics:

* A theme
* Letter tiles that are interesting to look at
* Background(s)
* Menu buttons

What I'm offering:

* 50/50 split of any contest winnings
* A 50/50 split of any app store earnings if the game earns at least runner-up status in the contest.  (I don't have the GameMaker master collection, and a $500 investment to release a game that doesn't make the top 50 in this competition doesn't make sense)

Please contact me via PM or in this thread.

Thanks for reading!

- Is an individual, not a company
- Can communicate in English
- Has knowledge of Marmalade SDK (big plus)
- Will sign a NDA

I've been a sound designer in the game industry since 2007 and I'm looking to switch to an *associate* producer position in the game industry (AAA, Indie, casual, serious, mobile, any type - I just love games!). In my last position for nearly 5 years, much of my duties were already production in nature, as I was in charge of the scheduling and asset management for audio, as well as QA duties. These kinds of things are actually what inspired me to make the switch. 

I would be coming to production with a full understanding of games from the audio perspective - which is an indispensable asset for many game studios. But that's not all! I can read and write code in C++, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby; I'm familiar with Maya, very experienced with Photoshop, AGILE (Scrum), Dreamweaver, Unreal, perforce, and office. I have a jack-of-all-trades nature that is beneficial for a manager to understanding colleagues, facilitating communication, and innovating solutions for the development pipeline.

*Scroll to the bottom to see my portfolio work and example code!*

**Summary**

Hi, I'm Brian, and I'd like nothing more than to help bring your game to a sell-able state!

**Why probono?**

I'm currently looking for work, but since I'm not as strong of a web-dev as I am a Java application/game developer, it's been difficult. While I would work for free on an unreleased game, I would expect to be included in some rev-share after release, or at least be salaried. What I really want is something to throw myself into, and help produce a game *to completion!*

Ideally, I'd like to help a team on an existing project, and help them bring it to a sell-able state.

**My Skills**

* Years of expertise and experience in Java
* Proficiency in Python, Ruby, PHP, and Lua
* Experience developing games
* Experience in procedural generation
* Proficient with Slick2D &amp; LibGDX
* Skilled with pixel art
* Flexible, give me a problem and I'll find a solution!
* Very friendly! Don't worry how messy your code is, I'll help clean it up and document it (I understand what it means to write code under looming deadlines)",,False,self,t5_2sg66,False,,,True,t3_19s5ep,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/19s5ep/programmer_available_for_fulltime_probono_java/,

I'm back! Many of you have seen me throw posts on here in a the last few months looking for coders and programmers for an RPG project I'm designing; well thanks to the thorough tutorials and the excellent community here, now I'm back looking for full-time artists! We have posted here a few times in the past, and found some great talent, but unfortunately our timing hasn't lined up yet for a committed addition. 

Scope of work: Right now we are collecting area models (buildings, scenery, etc), enemy models, and looking for a solid 2D artist for title screen/GUI/item &amp; ability icon work.

First, I'll go over some details of the project:

* Prototype is already in creation (many major systems working, but more progress every day)
* The entire game is laid out and ready for generation (with a focus on introductory areas currently)
* Currently the prototype is using mostly place holder art; this is a great opportunity for someone with some time on their hands to make an artistic mark in a big way!
* Extremely driven team that sets milestones &amp; goals (and then works to achieve them)
* Coded and developed in Unity for deployment on the PC &amp; Mac platform in C#
* Game-play and style reminiscent of Fallout 2 / Arcanum / Wasteland 2.

The current plan for this project:

* This project is marked Hobby due to the fact that we are not currently offering monetary compensation for the artwork.
* This project is also marked Revshare due to the fact that active and committed individuals will be asked on to the team when final development begins. *As a note, the current culmination date for the project is 2015*
* The current timeline has us finishing the prototype (introductory area and prologue with all major systems in place) in Dec 2013. 


To put it bluntly; at this point we're looking for enthusiastic artists that want to work in an environment where progress is being made daily. This is the kind of project where you submit us models/art in the morning then download the latest update that evening to see your enemies/NPC/graphics in action. Again, the prototype is **already playable**; this is not a vaporware project or anything like that.

More details on the project are available on request. We'll also give out the demo to anyone coming on board. 

If interested, please PM me directly here on Reddit and we'll exchange e-mails for further discussion.

Thanks as always, guys!

I have some projects I voiced near release or recently released, including narration on a fantasy tower defense mobile game, voicing an under-appreciated and under-employed protagonist in a comedy sci-fi point and click adventure game, and an Amnesia: The Dark Descent mod called Obscurity as the protagonist.*

From the in ship heads up display (HUD) and the game's overall GUI (eg: windows, buttons, frames) and because the game is also a RTS icons such as ""build"" ""shipyard"" - commands ""hold"" ""retreat"" ""move"" should also be represented via graphics.  Because the game is moddable you should be able to experiment with different looks and ideas - so I'm looking for someone with the ""modding"" mindset as well as artistic ability. Your suggestions can be also implemeneted into the project so I'm hoping that you bring some ideas in as well.





Because this is a project with commercial aspirations you will be paid for your work with a sum that we agree on. To get started I'd like for you (those interested) to send me a ""mock up"" of a hud and/or some other portion of the current game. 




Thanks for reading and have a good day :)


EDIT 1 --------------------------------------





This is the newest vid - shows the terribly bad current HUD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JefyJU8SPs





EDIT 2  --------------------------------------






I hope this is clearer  - what I'm after as a sort of a start:

Grab a screen shot (either from the project's webpage) or download the game - play it and grab a screen shot (SHIFT H to hide the hud elements). Mock up the screen shot with your personal style/artistic ability/vision - in a semi rough state (eg: one item could be close to the finished style) rest could be placeholders very rough. Send that to me and we can go from there.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1356561438.0,,,True,t3_15ftsb,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/15ftsb/lfartist_2d_for_a_hud_and_gui_overhaul_of_a_space/,

As for price, it's all up to who you are and what you're doing. If you're just a hobbyist and you've got a small project going, it'd be free. But if your project demands more work than a few tracks, we'd set up an appropriate per-minute pricing.

I run a small indie dev team out of Melbourne, Australia and we are looking for a talented 2D pixel sprite artist to help us finish our current major project.

We have a lot of art assets to be created, mostly static building and environment objects that have damaged and destroyed states. There are some animations, mostly for weapons, combat and effects.

(Paid contract),9,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/qfd35/lfa_2d_artist_needed_for_android_game_paid/,"I'm working on a 2D (pseudo-3D) Android arcade game, and I'm nearing the point in development where I need final art to keep moving.

The project is an arcade-style game where you are a kid in a neighborhood flinging water balloons at your neighbors who are wandering around. Your slingshot is at the bottom of the screen, and it is dragged back, aimed, and then released to fling balloons deep into the scene and hopefully hit a 2D character.

**EDIT**: Here is a [programmer-art screenshot](http://imgur.com/rFyUv) that shows the basic layout. Character art is completely temporary and for testing purposes only. I'm not looking to make a pixel-art game. The green boxes are to illustrate perspective.

The style of the game will be a cross of edgy and cute, similar to the way that Angry Birds has easily recognizable characters that are cute but also have an attitude. The pleasure of winning will be soaking, for example some businessman who is walking around with a smug look on his face, and seeing him holler at you as he fades away. Obviously the art of these characters will be very important in establishing motivation and providing payoff.

A basic list of assets needed is:

* 7-10+ characters (kid, dog, cat, mom, business man, old man a few more interesting special characters), with about 4 very simple animations each (walking, ""dying"", etc). Characters will (with one exception) appear small onscreen so there isn't much room for detail, but ideally the characters will be created in hi-res for marketing purposes.
* Art for the slingshot, balloons, and water/splash particles
* 1 background scene: grass and sky.
* A few houses to scatter in the background.
* Other static objects such as bushes and shooting target (for practice mode)
* Simple menu assets that can be cut-up and reused to create the various menus
* Title Screen background (probably using hi-res versions of other assets)
* Miscellaneous UI art (badges, balloons, checkboxes)
* Finally, a font choice that I can use for the menus

There is also room for further creativity on your part, as the character list can always be added to. I'm thinking about professions like police officer, doctor, etc.

Obviously this is a *simple* game, so it needs pretty simple art. Small characters, simple reusable backgrounds, etc. Some of the assets (like the Kid character, or the houses) will be color-shifted and reused.

I'd love to discuss this project with any interested parties. **This is a paid contract**.

The story goes like this: 

It begins on December 10th, 2012, and talk of the end of the world is amidst San Vita University. A group of five friends who frequently collaborate amongst one another are the focus of the story.

Aric, a medtech student, is about to leave for some hands-on experience, lending medical aid for refugees in Africa. He tends to be rather shy around women.

Ethan is an accomplished rhythm guitarist, and is relatively popular. His band has just recently broken up, so he is rather distraught.

Michael is a game design student, who likes smoking pot. Perhaps a little too much. Though he loves his recreational activities, he's one of the better students in his class. He is also the player character.

Crystal is doing a CNA program and is about to leave to start a job at a local hospital. She's in a relationship with her school work and likes keeping it that way.

Shane is a marketing and media student, and Michael's roommate. He disapproves highly of his marijuana smoking, but respects his work ethic. They frequently bicker due to their political views.

As the days go by, Aric leaves for Africa and the four friends enjoy their college experience and the like. Unbeknownst to the world, a homegrown insurgency is about to take place. This group, calling themselves the Continentals, believe America to be corrupt and rather than sitting back and letting the world play itself out, they want to do something about it. On December 20th, numerous ""End of the World"" parties begin popping up, and Michael can't resist the promise of booze and drugs. Ethan eagerly attends one such party, along with Crystal. Shane is a strictly straight edge person, and Michael's attempts at convincing him to go fail. 

On the other side of the world, Aric is on a plane with his class, returning from Africa. He is sitting next to a girl who has a crush on him; in a move unlike him, he offers her his iPod so he can go to sleep. As Led Zepplin rocks out, the first slice of the Continentals' attack begins - The plane is shot down, though Aric and two classmates only barely survive. A group of the Continentals arrive and take the three survivors captive. While being held, we get a glimpse of what the Continentals really want. In front of a video camera, one of the Continentals' camarilla begins to explain - They believe America has run its course, and corruption and lust has taken priority over the will of the people. They believe the poor are neglected since they can't financially contribute, so the government doesn't care about them. That said, they don't want money, and they don't have any demands. They simply want the government gone. And over in Washington D.C., they have the manpower to do so. (Basically, they're pissed off at the Man.) As the older man wraps up his monologue, he begins to execute the three surviving students. Slowly.

Later in the day on December 21st, Michael is extraordinarily hung over. What he initially believes to be either a bad rain storm or a prank quickly turns to dust when Shane enters the room and tells Michael that the school is being attacked. Michael thinks Shane is just screwing with him since he doesn't approve of Michael's antics, but then a gunman enters their dorm and begins to shoot it up. As he approaches their room, Shane's fight or flight instinct kicks in and he steals the shooter's gun. He tells the guy ""I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I have to"". Shane then proceeds to shoot the man as he pulls a knife and tries to stab Shane...

...And ""Fall of the Union"" begins.

I feel like part of the reason I can't connect to most modern games is that it's all about shooting terrorists and having a prick waving contest between nations, without any real explanation to who I am and why I'm fighting. So with my story idea, I thought it'd be interesting to shake things up and have this tale of the country's darkest hour told by the people who get caught up in the crossfire. The story would focus on that guy Michael, as his life of living life inebriated and being cynical is suddenly uprooted when he needs to leave his life behind and learn to survive. The theme is the loss of innocence; we already get a glimpse of that as Shane, a very serious, business oriented fellow is forced to take a human life.

**tl;dr Four friends get caught up in a coup d'etat hatched by their own countrymen and must survive when their world goes to shit.**

Our hope is for the game to be released for PC, Mac OS X and PSN, possibly more in the future. We plan to put up a Kickstarter page with art, demos and more, as well as possibly Steam Greenlight, once we have content to share. Right now the work would be unpaid, but the game is intended for a professional release so payment in the future is on the table to discuss when that point is reached depending on how successful our project ends up.

Dynamically, the game will work something like a combination of the aforementioned games in this post, as well as aspects of such games as Bioshock, Condemned: Criminal Origins, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and Dishonored. Ruin involves the use of stealth, a gameplay element that will be of great importance in your survival. The game also features a parkour system and tense combat, focused mostly on melee that brings the player closer to the unique foes that inhabit it, with guns being a rare but powerful weapon when found. The world takes place, for the majority of the game, in a forest based on the real-life Aokigahara, a forest underneath Mt. Fuji, famous for suicide. The challenge is presented in the player's ability to avoid situations that will affect their character's sanity level, which will diminish in varying ways depending on interactions with the environment and enemies.

The player will proceed through the game recovering articles and more alluding to his eventual discovery of the reasons which have brought him to this place, and ultimately confront his greatest fears.

My name is Jameson Wilkins. I'm a freelance 2D digital artist with several years experience doing art for mobile, browser, and independent games. I've worked on everything from sidescrolling platformers to isometric social games. I've done character design, User Interfaces, environmental tilesets, splash screens and more. Some of my assets are even currently displayed in a interactive experience located in a major Orlando based theme park.

I charge competitive rates for my work and finish contracts quickly and efficiently. I am skilled primarily in highly graphic vector art, and pixel art.

I've worked with quite a few clients that I have found through this very job board to make their games look as great as they play. In addition to this, I myself am a fairly successful independent developer. [Last year I released my title ""A Nation of Wind"", you can find the trailer for it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md_dkJlTbsQ) What this means is that I understand the pipeline of creating high quality art for your needs, and delivering it to you in the most useful way possible. Need a sprite sheet for a Corona App? I've done that. Need .gifs of my animations for promotional materials? No problem.

With that being said, I have created many hobby demos &amp; projects throughout the past few years and am looking to take things further through collaboration.   
  
If you're an artist or programmer and just looking for someone to work with, feel free to give me a PM with more details.   
  
I do have aspirations to move this beyond a hobby, but for now I'm just looking for like-minded individuals or a good (small) team to work with.  
  
There's a few holes in my knowledge here and there, but I'm beyond confident that if I don't know how to do it I can learn how to do it. I would prefer to work on tasks that require me to learn anyway :)  
  
Now for buzzwords:  
* C/C++/C#/Java, Perl/TCL/Python/Javascript  
* UDK/Unity/XNA  
* Networking (Topology &amp; Discovery, Client-side prediction, Entity Interpolation,  P2P &amp; Auth Server setups, Lidgren, TNet, etc.)  
* AI Algorithms (Pathfinding using nodes/navmesh, Decision trees, Player Prediction)  
* Mesh/Voxel generation using marching cubes, vector fields, and lots of noise  
* Basic Cg/HLSL Shaders  
* Custom &amp; tailored algorithms (Weird scene graphs, Infinite terrain, Dungeon generation)  
* Databases (experience mostly in MS SQL)  
  
Video/source examples for most of the above can be provided upon request if you're in to that sort of thing.  
  
Artistic workflows I know how to do but mostly suck at creatively (programmer art):  
* High Res modelling &amp; sculpting (Blender/Maya &amp; Zbrush/Mudbox)

I'm shooting to make a game in a month, or even less. Earlier this month my desktop PC decided to take a break, forever, after a Power Supply decided that it would be a great idea to let insane amounts of electricity in. So I'm kinda in need for any financial income (I'm currently using 5 years old laptop). 

If you have a game idea, I would be more than happy to hear it, since I'm not very creative person. I'd like to point out that I have the knowledge of making Desktop applications using C++, and also should be able to port a game to mobile devices if that seems like a good idea. (Even though I hate mobile markets, and can't possibly see myself in there. :D )

I'm just fine with splitting income of sponsorship 50/50, and up for a bigger projects afterwards, if I like you. :)

Hi all,

We're a small indie start up working on our first game as a company. Between the two of us we have nearly a two decades of game industry experience. We are self funded, but have a fairly limited budget. We're looking for an animator who is familiar with 3dsmax and Unity.

Things you will do in the project will include:
-Setting up rigs and skinning about 4 characters to work with Unity.
-Cleaning up and fixing mocap data (we're using ipisoft mocap studio).
-Keyframed animations.
The game is a mobile (iOS/Android) 1v1 moba style game with a primary focus on PVP. You play as a ninja with ninjutsu powers (think Naruto) but it will be more about the different cool powers as opposed to hand to hand combat (there will be a little). The game has been described as a cross between Naruto and Magicka. You can check out our website with a bit of info about our game here (Jurojin): 

www.criticalbacongames.com

We will need between 30-40 animations (we have some walk cycles and some power animations done, but will need tweaking to look good). Animations will include things like spell casting animations (throwing different type of projectiles, like fireballs, ice sprays, lightning bolts, aoe's etc), walk cycle, sneak cycle (currently using procedural cycles from CAT, needs some tweaking). Animations for command inputs (hand symbols). Much can be reused for different powers.

The time frame is about 3 months with a large portion finished and working before PAX (2 months from now).
Please drop me an or a message on here with your portfolio if interested, thanks!

I've been doing pixel art as a hobby for maybe 8-9 years, helping out a few internet friends on their projects and working on my own simple and unfinished games in my free time. I've been putting off looking for actual work to avoid the stress, but being one of the many thousands of poor souls with lots of art school debt to pay off I've realized this would be a good time to change that (I can't even afford a website for a portfolio).

I obviously haven't done professional work before, but if I'm being compensated you can count on swiftness and reasonable quality. I'm looking more for small, relatively casual jobs as a way to ease myself in but I'm open to nearly anything, including non-game work, that isn't on-site or a several month long commitment.

-Programmers that are good with vehicles, custom weapons and/or working with online gameplay. I definately need at least one person that is good with saving player information on servers for leveling purposes and server travels, I have setup the basics but need help.

-At least one person for creating the environments of the interior of the space ships/space stations.  Think the prometheus ship interior style.

I am uni student that is learning games programming/computer science. (I'm only in my first year however but I have been programming C# for probably 4 years and before that VB.net). I love programming and so far I'm completely self taught.

It is a ""mmo"" fantasy-style-combat-oriented 2D tile based sandbox (it's not a mmo however, and yes it is clearly inspired by many other games). I'm almost at the stage of development where I need 2D pixel artists/spriters to continue development. I'm not saying the game is nearly done because its no where close, I am saying I would love good sprites/textures instead of placing placeholder sprites everywhere.

If I think the content you produce is good enough you will definitely be given credit for it and added to the team list :D

I am a game designer with a plan for a game called Hero Wars. Hero Wars has it's roots in the mod of Warcraft 3, much like well known DoTA. Like DoTA Hero Wars is a RTS where two teams of 5 players, each with one hero fight to destroy each others bases, or farms. That however is where the similarities end, Hero Wars has one C shaped lane instead of 3 branched out lanes. Instead of creeps there are troops, which are only able to be upgraded by a player. Players can send waves of troops, each with unique abilities. Players' defenses are not made at the start of the game like DoTA, but built (however there are 3 rows of towers until the initial farm, each progressively stronger). Hero Wars has proved successful, but declined in popularity a few years ago after a lack of updates. There is currently one version of Hero Wars holding on, with about 200 followers.
My goal is to create a Hero Wars engine that can be put on valve. I can game design and I am willing to learn anything that any member of the team needs me to learn so I can help more. 
For this project I need Two Programmers and an Artist, just to start out. The programmers need to know C++ and C and the Artist needs to be able to model in 3d Studio Max. I have experience in modding but not much experience in game engines on their own so this is a new experience for me. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

If you only texture, that is perfectly fine, however if you do have other modelling skills, that is a great benefit.

So, lets get right to it, what is the game about? Well, it's a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda, where the player must navigate through an environment to reach the end goal. They must avoid guards, and use the environment to their advantage to get through the world. One catch however, is that the character is blind! In a twist of fate, the character is blinded by magic, but the same magic has given them an extra ability, the ability to see where sound touches. They player is able to navigate the world by listening to sound sources bouncing off of surfaces, giving them a unique ability when looting the world and avoiding danger on their adventure.

We have a [very early demo](http://digitalraingames.com/), this was built around 2 months ago after a month and a half of work.

Our target platform is PC, with the possibility of expanding to consoles at a later date.

**Who am I**

I'm Ariejan, sole operator at Forsaken Labs. I'm planning my first game and I'm looking for a cool identity to put in the game. The game is an 8-bit rogue-like, set in space. I love the pixely retro 8-bit look. for instance, my game is made up out of 8x8 pixel sprites. 

To get an idea, the game is based on this http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005d42ce4b0d534734e9706/51216524e4b0dce195c4ff5f/51861414e4b09995885ec00c/1367741461352/mockup_1.png?format=400w

**The Task**

I'm looking for a logo for Forsaken Labs to use as a splash screen and for the website. The logo should be pixely (see stuff I like). I'm looking for a logo that includes ""Forsaken Labs"", but can also be used without the explicit name attached to it.

The logo itself could show something of a laboratory setting (like a flask or something) but with a touch indicating the 'forsaken' part. Feel free to come up with fresh ideas here.

The logo should should be delivered as a standard PNG image that could be used a sprite directly with the sprites mentioned above (""Purge the alien menace"")

**Stuff I like**

To give you an impression of pixel art logo's I like:

* http://logopond.com/gallery/detail/123947

By no means feel obliged to follow any style in these examples. It's here to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

**The Reward**

I'm putting this request ""out there"" as a contest. Please submit your (watermarked, low resolution, whatever you deem necessary) version as a comment. 

I'm a hobby/indie developer trying to put out my first game later this year.

The winning entry will be rewarded with a $75 Amazon Gift card. For the runner-up (if any) there's a $25 Amazon Gift card waiting.

Please do not apply anymore until further notice. If none of the applicants work out (which I don't think), I might be opening this up again. Thank you for your understanding.

Main topic:

I'm looking for a talented 3d modelling artist, who also does the skinning/texturing himself. Animation and rigging is not necessary.

This is paid work, with potential additional work in the future, if the project is (financially) successful. Think: expansion pack.
In such a case, I would prefer working with the same artist, who created the original art, for the sake of better art consistency.

I would need about the following things:

- Space station modules (all models must be the same size dimensions):
  - Hub module (central connector unit)
  - Docking bays (three different kinds, for ship sizes small, medium and large)
  - Various additional standardized station modules (the more visual variation I have here, the better) - at the moment, 4 different modules.

- Space ships
  - Small (fighters, small freighters, bounty hunters, etc.) - For starters I need at least 3 different ones of this size.
  - Medium (big freighters, small warships (corvette type))
  - Large (destroyers, carriers)

Needless to say, all assets must be original art!

If you feel qualified to deliver the whole list, please contact me via PM with an offer (please estimate the price). Please also include your email address where I can reach you and possibly skype or phone number. I might also consider someone, who only does station parts or only ships, but I would prefer one artist for everything.

People have often commented that it sounds like video game music. 

**Samples**

You can hear a few of my tracks here:

[Flat Apex](https://soundcloud.com/buttered-peanuts-n-jelly/flat-apex-dry) It's just sitting around waiting to be used. I can custom format the arrangement as needed. 

[Concussion Symptoms](https://soundcloud.com/buttered-peanuts-n-jelly/concussion-symptoms) This track could be tweaked in a lot of ways. I can separate the different parts too, if you wanted to apply different music to different parts of your project. 

**Hardware and software**

I have my own studio, and am experienced using the following software:
Logic 9 Pro,
Nuendo,
Komplete 8,
T-Racks 3,
and a random assortment of other plugins.

Genelec 1030a's,
RME Babyface,
dbx Vocal preamp,
Various tube preamps.
Lots of microphones including...
4 AKG C3000 (two matched pairs),
1 CAD E200,
7 Various Shure microphones.

I'm not sure that I can invest the kind of time required to learn all the ins and outs of video game music. So I'm not offering to jump in and work with code. If you are a developer working on your own thing and you want it to have a soundtrack, I have a lot of stuff just sitting around. And you can use it. I don't want your money. Just acknowledgement no different than anybody who works on a project. 

[Here is my entire SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/buttered-peanuts-n-jelly). I'm offering instrumental tracks (I can easily remove a vocal track from something). Licensing won't be an issue because everything is built from the ground up. 

I'm not trying to score a full time gig or anything, I have a day job that I enjoy. I also have a lot of developer friends and I know how hard it can be to put something together. I just want to help out, even if you only used it for your beta version and then you replaced it, I dont care. I'm just sitting on all this music and I should do something with it. I'd totally be willing to tweak something to your liking too.

If you are interested but you don't hear anything on that page I have more, let me know what sort of thing you like, what vibe you are looking for. I'll have something to suit your needs.

1361398282.0,5,self.gameDevClassifieds,18wvi2,Would any programmers want  to collaborate on a tower defense game? (I'm an artist/ designer that dabbles in programming),8,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/18wvi2/would_any_programmers_want_to_collaborate_on_a/,"Here's my portfolio:
http://jeffberry.carbonmade.com/

Pitch: Tower defense games are relatively simple and offer tons of fun for relatively simple development both in programming and art, they're doable for a small team and can be adapted for even the simplest of platforms.

Plants vs. zombies for example was an incredibly successful game and I feel there's tons of room in this genre for more games of this type. The dream here is to make a game we're both wanting to work on and have ownership of while still making something that could end up being commercially viable.

I have some ideas of my own for where to take a tower defense game but i'm very open to coming up with an idea that we can both be excited about. I've been around this scene enough to know  how important it is to focus on your team's strengths and build the game around that, rather than burn out trying to make a dream game that isn't feasible.

I'm looking for a competent programmer with shipped games able to follow through with a project and is a fan of the tower defense genre. There's plenty of fair weather designers out there, i've been burned by them, I can assure you i'm not one of them and in this for the long haul to finish a quality game.

I have no doubt i could create quality 3d or 2d towers and landscapes and even enemies, though down the  line we may need an animator depending on how we decide on how enemies should look and behave. To reference plants vs. zombies again, i think ideal game designs for small teams not only subvert the massive asset requirements of AAA games, but are actually more fun because of it. The zombies in plants vs. zombies were incredibly simple in their animation, but also very endearing and unique... Fun games don't have to be overly complex, but they do need to be deep in their simplicity.

What platform would we build this in? what engine? all that is up in the air, and I would assume the person I'd want to work with would know better than I where to take things in this regard!

I know the odds of finding someone worth working with in these parts is rare, but i figure why not give it a shot? Send me a message if you're interested and maybe we can get the ball rolling on a really cool and innovative tower defense game or heck maybe something totally different! Tower defense just seems like a really good bet to make a fun innovative game without going overboard.

Oh and to supplement my art portfolio here's a 2 button (left and right mouse) Unity game I was working on solo that focused more on gameplay than art, this I hope would show some of my rudimentary design and programming skills that i could  bring to a project.

(requires Unity)

And here's a starcraft 2 mod i made a while back that's easier to digest than a unity project (made all the art and gameplay tweaks myself):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3EsAjCreE4

As a side note if anyone else has a really killer project that needs an artist I might be interested in that as well, but I'd really like to have input in the overarching design of the game.

I know css and html, in other words I am useless for the programming aspect of this aside from maybe an idea here and there.

That said, I have a friend on board to create all of the music (he is an excellent guitarist and musician, I have known him for something like 16 years), I will do all of the artwork and I even have a game concept! Even though I haven't designed any of this yet I am sort of looking for a programmer and sort of gauging interest in this project.

The concept comes from my girlfriend while we were playing video games. She said to me ""Why don't they make a video game where you don't die"". Well, I'm here to (sort of) make this happen and then some. The idea is a platform game where the plot is to simply walk through the game and enjoy it. You can be alive or you can be dead, all it takes is a simple right click of the mouse to change your state and jump 100 years forward in time. One world will be a brighter and more ""real"" world and the other another world will be the the darker ""dead"" world. Yes this means that I have to create the platforms very similar to each other and create 2 different worlds but I think that is worth it for the overall design of this beast.

In the dead world you observe similar things to the real world, but they are altered to suit your newly-aged self that no longer exists (in a physical sense). There will be many Easter eggs in both the ""real"" and ""dead"" world. When you change states (right click) the music will change accordingly. All of the Easter eggs in the game will alter your music/perception or both in one way or another. You play until the end, what's at the end you ask? Well, maybe you'll know if this game idea takes off.

We can release this game on donation or for a price, I am willing to split the profits of this 33/33/33 between myself, my friend and a programmer. What I ask for in terms of programming is essentially something that is capable of what I've mentioned above. I want to right click to change states/worlds and music, I want to be able to left click to find easter eggs, and I want to be able to move left/right/jump with A/D/SPACE.

TL;DR : I want to make a platform game where you play as a human that can either be alive or dead by the right click of a mouse, many easter eggs as well as character design/level design and music engages the user in this adventure instantaneously through time.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1360249937.0,,,True,t3_1813oh,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1813oh/lf_programmer_for_game_creation/,

My name is Bryan and I've been programming as a hobby for the past ~3 or so years.  I first started learning with Microsoft's XNA Game Studio back in 2009 which taught me a foundation of C#, though I primarily worked as an artist at the time.  I collaborated with a programmer and we created a simple game similar to the card game Memory called ""Match-It"" which was never fully released, though I'm sure some digging could find it on the XNA forums.

Since then I've taught myself a moderate understanding of JavaScript, having completed all of the courses available at www.codeacademy.com and made smaller projects for myself for fun.  I then got interested in making video games, so I spent a few months dabbling in Java and created a small tile-based top-down RPG base just to have something that I've created and could run around in.

Since then I have gotten reinvigorated at the prospect of working in C#, renewed my XNA membership and created a couple small private demos in that such as Tower defenses etc.  and have since started learning Unity3D, which thankfully combines all of my knowledge of 3D game spaces, C# and JavaScript into one.

**TL;DR**

JavaScript : Advanced

C# / XNA / Unity3D : Advanced

Java : Knowledgeable

HTML / CSS : Moderate

I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science in San Francisco, so I wouldn't be available to work full-time ( unless obviously there is an offer I simply can't refuse. A guy can dream ) but I am willing to work part time for compensation, or on smaller and simpler projects for free as a hobby with maybe an artist or another Unity3D programmer.

We are in need of a few more talented people to help us get into the final stages of the game; so if you have years of experience in the gaming industry, just looking for something fun to do, or even just starting out, we want you and look forward to having you!

[paid] [revshare],6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/16f9yt/lfartist_to_give_our_tower_defence_game_some/,"Hi!  I'm currently working on a multi-platform mobile game for iOS, Android, Amazon and Nook.  Most of the game programming is done - the game is working and playable, but I need help from both graphics and sound people to polish it off before it's ready for beta testing.  I found someone to work with me on the sound, so now we just need the graphic artist to complete the team!

I do have some money, but not a lot (it's just me), I was hoping to find people that wanted to work for some up front cash and then long term revenue split.  I do understand that there are a ton of programmers who are offering revenue split, but I have three things going for me that many don't:

   - I have already shipped many apps so I'm confident this one will ship

   - I have a partner on two of my previous apps and have been revenue splitting with him for a year now, it's working fine

   - I do have some up front cash, since we all know the stores can be a gamble and I don't want anyone to starve

What's needed: 

   - [1] 3D model of a rabbit, rigged with 1 small animation (throwing)

   - [5] 3D models of other animals (the enemies), rigged with 1 small animation (walking)

   - a critical eye to the rest of the game, making suggestions for any visual improvements you think should be made

I tried my hand at Blender, and although I got the rabbit modelled, rigged and animated, I wasn't happy with the rendered result:
[Rabbit spritesheet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A3iiR-rCYAAx4mH.png)

If you're interested, PM me please.  Ask questions here if you need more info first, I probably missed something.  Up front payment and long term percentage amounts to be negotiated.

Thanks!!",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1357968336.0,,,True,t3_16f9yt,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/16f9yt/lfartist_to_give_our_tower_defence_game_some/,
1357615475.0,6,self.gameDevClassifieds,165tu1,"[LFA]rtist - technical artist / FX artist who can code (Unity3d - mobile) - [contract -&gt; hire?, Remote]",6,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/165tu1/lfartist_technical_artist_fx_artist_who_can_code/,"We are an indie game startup of 2 people, myself (programming + design) and my partner (business stuff + design + art director). We're using Unity3d and we're targeting mobile devices, and we're looking for a technical artist, specifically someone who specializes in special effects.

Our first game is 2D sprite based (we're using the 2D Toolkit, RageSpline, and TextMesh plugins) and while we have gotten some great 2D art so far from our contractors, we're lacking in special effects and could greatly benefit from someone who really understands how to make stuff look ""cool"" in Unity3d. I'm trying to find someone available for contracting (and who could potentially join us as a partner if things work out) who:

* is a great artist and a decent coder
* is great at making special effects in 3D engines (with a focus on Mobile devices)
* has experience writing &amp; tweaking shaders
* has experience creating awesome particle effects
* (optional) has experience making 3D objects with animations (or at least can rig them so we can animate them later), for special effects
* (optional) knows the Unity3d art pipeline
* can use Git (source control)

Let me give you 2 examples of special effects that we would want someone to be able to do:

1) We have a bunch of flat 2d icons for a matching game. If you get a match, we want to put a special effect on the icons that are being matched. Got any ideas?

2) If you do something good in the game, we want to play one or more awesome looking special effects on the whole screen as part of the reward. Could you be creative and come up with some good stuff here (and know how to implement it in Unity3d)? Anything goes really, we could have particle effects, a 3D animated object (like a treasure chest that coins and stuff fly out of), etc.

The challenge for me in doing these types of things is that I'm 95% programmer and 5% artist. In other words, I don't have a good idea for knowing what would look cool, and when I do have ideas I am not quite sure how to implement them. I just don't have that kind of experience. So, I'm hoping to fill that gap with someone else, someone who has a good eye for art but is also technical.

Let me give you an idea on what I expect our workflow to be like. I'm going to be doing the majority of the game programming. I would basically make the game work, but it would need visual polish. That's where you would come in. You can look at what we have and then we can collectively brainstorm on what kinds of special effects we want. Then, we can work together on implementing those special effects.

We would pay you an hourly rate (negotiable based on your experience) with the hopes that if things worked out you would want to join us full time. Then, you would be offered salary + equity + rev share. If you want to do more than just technical art stuff, there is also room for growth on both the programming and art director side.

I'm located in Berlin, Germany and my partner is in San Francisco, so we're a purely remote operation. You would be expected to have skype chats, video calls, and screen sharing for collaboration.

Interested parties should email me (taylor at foxcubgames.com) or post here. Include a link to your resume and/or portfolio. Then, we'll setup a skype call / facetime / google hangout and we can discuss in more detail.

Here is a screenshot of our current project: http://i.imgur.com/cMRE5.jpg

My name is Liz, I'm the co-owner, sound designer, musician, and VO-director/creature VO artist for a brand-spankin'-new audio company called [Bombadeer Studios](http://www.bombadeerstudios.com/). I gave out some [free stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/12f9dq/want_some_free_sounds_bombadeer_studios_here_with/) recently. Help yourself!  
My prices are super reasonable, I work quick, and everything I give you is original. I don't hand you SFX strait off some library disk or website like most guys, and I never use loops in my music. I create them, fresh and new, just for you. Hell, most of the time I record the raw materials myself.  
  
**Here's the sort of quality material I can create for you:**  
[Creatures](http://youtu.be/dkgGbIOqOM0) and [vehicles!](http://youtu.be/ZsR5fqk2D4M)

[Plucky iconic sounds](http://youtu.be/OR96_sAhvF0) for your casual game  
[Smooth, crisp, and satisfying UI](http://youtu.be/gKhRV77MJ-4) for your interface  
PLUS! Combat, cutscenes and trailers, foley/movement, VO recording, editing and processing(I'm in touch with a couple very talented VO artists! Sadly we're still putting together our demo at the moment), video editing(I put together all the videos linked here myself) and, of course, implementation with FMOD, Wwise, Unity, and whatever other various game engines.  
  
**What about the music?**  
Well, how about some [action and excitement](http://www.BombadeerStudios.com/Music/TrialbyFireofDOOM.mp3), or perhaps something more [soaring and dramatic?](http://www.bombadeerstudios.com/Music/TakingTheNextStep.mp3) No, of course your game needs something [happy-go-lucky!](http://www.bombadeerstudios.com/Music/BigglesvilleMarket.mp3) Or maybe even a little [silly](http://www.bombadeerstudios.com/Music/ImaginaryFriends.mp3).

I cut my teeth on C++ with the Freespace game engine from 2003-2008. Since then I've done some small-scale game development with Unity, and other things tangentially related to games.

If you've played [Diaspora](http://diaspora.hard-light.net/), you've seen some of my work.

* Architected the embedded Lua scripting layer as well as implementing the initial libraries.
* FTL effect
* Initial glide mode; I think someone else has updated it since then.
* Initial in-game cutscene and camera code.
* 3D gun/missile icons and 3D ships in the ship/weapon select screens
* Some additional engine configurability

These were all added to the Freespace engine, so other mods will have them. I just played Diaspora recently, so it's an easy demo to point out.

I have worked with and deployed on iOS before (iPad and iPod Touch were my testing devices) using XCode and Unity, and I've also worked a little bit with the Android SDK/NDK.

I presently do not have a personal Mac or iOS device or Unity, but these are useful enough tools that if this is the only obstacle, we should discuss it.

As I say at the top I'm chiefly interested in short-term/part-time work. Everything's negotiable but in general I think this would be the best fit. I don't want to get pulled into a fast-paced fulltime job that's going to need 60-80 hour workweeks. At least for the time being, I'm more interested in pay than equity. That may change in the future as I become more established.

I'm working on a modern 2D (topview) action MORPG and I'm looking for an artist who can help create and cultivate the style we're looking for. Our concept is to have graphics similar in style to both Zelda's Minish Cap and Link to the Past games.

* 16x16 (upscaled to 32x32+)
* Black border
* Highly rounded
* High contrast
* Vivid primary colors
* Crisp lines

Characters:

* A little ""pudgy""
* Very little/no realism
* Semi-cartoon proportions
* Potentially templating characters for ""visibly worn armor"" appearance (let's discuss)
* Not a ton of animation frames (e.g. idle, walk, attack, magic attack, rest)

Tilesets:

* Solid color backgrounds with light detail
* Most detail in the foreground
* Simple details
* Minimal animation

Also need effects, skill icons, objects and more.

(We're using upscaled graphics to provide a retro ""pixel art"" look while maintaining readability of on-screen text and interfaces - plus the user can resize the window for dynamic rescaling anyways.)

In addition, we're have tools available to do ""auto-tiling"" graphics generation, so making border tiles and the like will be fairly simplified.

The game itself is heavily inspired by the Zelda series, as well as classics like Crystalis, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana, with modern game design elements like Torchlight, League of Legends and World of Warcraft.

Example links of the styles:

I enjoy game development and the workflow behind it, which has led me to pursue making my own games with my friends.

**Portfolio : http://imgur.com/a/6aNl5**

I'm best with 32x32 or 16x16 tiles of pretty much any variety(sidescroller, RPG, top down) and can animate characters but at a longer turnaround(it would definitely help if you had a concept of the character to work on).

I can also pixel large background landscapes or scenes for your game, and also create any UI elements or graphics that you might need. I'm also learning vector art and digital painting for some more high-res assets, but animation would be out of the question for that.

I'd prefer contract payment(I usually do 25% upfront and then 75% at the end) but would be willing to rev share as long as there was some payment at the beginning.

If you'd like to contact me with a serious inquiry telling me about your project, your asset list that you'd need from me, and your budget, I'd be happy to discuss that all with you. My email is **kas1092 (at) gmail.com.**

I have a blog set up with some public information [here](http://dragonwranglers.blogspot.com).

I would need someone to be able to set up multiple update-able storefronts (including cash shop), simple menu screen, as well as a battle system that I can emphasize on in depth for those interested but not sure what they are able to do as far as turn-based battle systems go. If you can shuffle from a deck and read custom abilities and act on them with health and energy bars, you should be good, though.

I am a college student and work almost full time to pay rent and groceries etc. as well as being a full time student so my time and cash is limited which is why I proposed a rev-share. I would really like to have this game done by sometime next Spring or early Summer. If that is too late for you, you could provide a quote for a flat-rate to make something that I could update with future content down the road if you could not wait for rev-share and hopefully we could work something out.

I am at the University of Arizona, so if you lived in Tucson, that could be a plus for meeting up but I am not too concerned otherwise.

I can also do some programming work and am familiar with C#, Javascript, and some Java and Lua.

As far as engines/production environments I'm familiar with: Unity, Flash, Construct 2 and the XNA framework.

Audio Edit: On the audio side of things I've got a good working knowledge of: ProTools, Avid, Audacity, and Fmod. I've done foley work, field recording, editing, content creation, some implementation and I've ran recording sessions with voice talent.

At this point, I'd be interested in either a full-time position OR an internship. If you want to know more feel to either PM me or send me a message through the contact form at the bottom of my website [here](http://robbraunproductions.com/).

A little bit about me: My name is Ben, and I’m an (solo) independent game developer.  My project is part time, as I have a full time job (and a family!), though I make progress on it nearly every day.

**2. Project Title**
The title of my project is Clash of Cards.

**3. Description of project**
I have been creating my game for about 11 months now from scratch in Java using LibGDX.  It currently is able to be deployed to PC (as a stand-alone app), Android phones/tablets, and to the web as an applet.
The project itself can be best described as a Card Based Adventure-RPG set in a somewhat classic medieval fantasy setting (mostly human, though creatures such as Gryphons exist).  The player will adventure through a story, meeting and defeating various characters and creatures.  The card system is explained as such: In this world honor is tantamount. If you defeat an opponent and they are honorable, you obtain their ‘card’ (like a business card). The card battle is therefore explained as calling upon your honor-bound allies and friends to help you.  Cards will also be obtained through many avenues, in-world minigames, special events, or simply hidden throughout the world.  The art style is pixelart, and heavy inspiration has been taken from the classic Neo Geo Pocket game, Card Fighters (for the card art) and various RPGs for tile art, such as Secret of Mana 3.

**4. Position &amp; Job Requirements**
At this stage of development,  I’m looking for 2 or perhaps 3 tilesets. I don’t even want to think about card art quite yet (I don’t have all the cards fleshed out yet, and It’s going to be expensive!), though I will certainly pass on my specs if requested.
As for the tilesets, this is what I’m looking for:  

*Forest Tileset:* The forest surrounding my capital city of Amn Isile is a thick deciduous forest.  Because Amn Isile is founded near the sea, it could be considered a deciduous rain forest: Think mossy logs, rain often, overcast, that sort of thing. 

I have created a VERY rough tileset of grass/dirt/cliff which you can use as a reference here:
http://www.clashofcards.com/screenshot/ss2.png  
Some of the stuff I’ve seen from the RPG Maker community is also great. Here is a good example:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKFx9Qkkgvw&amp;feature=player_embedded

*City Tileset:* The other tileset I need is of the city of Amn Isile itself.  Some background about the area is that it’s the only place in this world where magic is allowed to be practiced. Sort of like a Las Vegas of magic.  The building tiles should be of a tudor style, also with strong use of stonework(walls, pavers), and perhaps elements of magic (glowball street lamps? That sort of thing). I have not mocked up my own placeholder tileset for the city, so I will only have references from other art:
http://kiwinuptuo.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4v6ro9
http://kiwinuptuo.deviantart.com/gallery/16300074?offset=24#/d2euwlo
http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/075/6/4/wizard_house_by_pinkfirefly-d3bsa4r.png
Though these aren't exactly in a city, you get the gist of it.

Technical details:
Tiles should preferably be 32x32 px, ¾ top-down orthographic perspective.  My engine can handle other sizes, but it needs to be consistent.  Larger objects, such as trees, lights, etc do not have to be tiled(if you prefer), and can be any size/dimensions as they are essentially non-moving actors – I call them doodads.  Tiles and doodads can also be animated with any number of frames.

**5. Payment**
I have the utmost respect for game Artists, and Musicians.  While I am not rich and am funding this project entirely from my full time job, artists need to be compensated accordingly.  The average rate seems to be somewhere between $15 to $30 /hr based on ability, and I have no issue with this.  The caveat of course is that I’m not sure how long these tilesets would take to produce, though I realize quality takes time.
I’m not looking specifically for a rev-share or anything like that.  Perhaps part upfront, and part at completion, or a milestone kind of thing – I’m open to negotiation.

**6. Contact Information**
Please contact me at dashiva(at)dashiva.com.  If possible, please attach some sample work, or link to a portfolio with art you believe is relevant.  

I hope this wasn’t too long winded, but I care a lot about the project.  Thanks for reading!

To make a long story short, I'm working on a small ORPG with a ridiculous and outlandish 1980's NES/SNES theme for kicks.

* Low-polygon modeling for real-time assets. High polygon work would be a major plus but the meat is in the real-time. 
* Texture assets for those models.
* Animation for these low polygon assets. You really need to know your chops here.
* Experience with vertex/fragment programs is desirable but not a deal breaker.
* All of these have to be high quality! If you cannot create assets that you would want to look at in a game you would purchase or are comparable to assets in a title you have purchased before this will not work out.

Now the general bits... this will be somewhat lengthy.

I am seeking a like-minded artist to join me in the development of a low-budget game. You must be an independent, dedicated, responsible individual who can work efficiently with little management.

In anticipation of working with a small group I have not set a genre of game in stone and leave that up to a future discussion.

Compensation is an open discussion -- I would prefer a like-minded partner (You must be business savvy as well) but am open to contract based employment of a talented and dedicated individual.

I run a small indie dev team out of Melbourne, Australia and we are looking for a talented 2D pixel sprite artist to help us finish our current major project. The target platform is iOS with ports to android and desktop if successful enough. 

We have a lot of art assets to be created, mostly static building and environment objects that also have damaged and destroyed states. there are some animations mostly for weapons, combat and effects.

We are using a top down view similar to GTAI and II. We have an older working prototype playable [here](http://www.anomalousinteractive.com/AnomalousInteractive_BBW_Prototype_v1.0.html) and some of our art samples can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/mVhl0)

The concept of the game is The Three Little Pigs meets Grand Theft Auto. You play as the big bad wolf who is back with a vengeance and a bulldozer.

Being a small indie dev team we don't have the budget for upfront contract work but we will be reimbursing any terrific art skills with generous revenue share. We are not expecting fulltime work AT ALL - just 2/3 assets a week (most of them are &lt; 128x128)

So that was fun, but there's so much more we want to do. Code is our bottleneck. That's why we're looking for a collaborator.  

**The general business plan: **

* Work on flash games with short development cycles.  Develop franchises.  
* Generalize the most useful tools and classes from each project and incorporate them into our rapid-prototyping platform.  
* Utilize the platform to iterate on games quickly, get lots of sponsorships, build a brand rep, get paid modestly
* Release parts of the platform as open source to help noobs in the Flashpunk community :)
* Start targeting mobile, desktop apps, get paid better.  Bootstrap, hire  more people, etc.


**Here's a little bit more about the two of us:**

* Our artist/designer worked at Budcat for several years. He's super pro at making stuff look and feel juicy.
* I run a successful online-business/light-manufacturing operation. I'm good at balancing art and commerce, and putting out fires. 
* We are a distributed team (I'm in FL, he's in IA).  


**Here's what we're looking for in a collaborator:**

* Likes to support a designer.  In our workflow, the designer says ""This is what I'm trying to make,"" and then the programmer gives him a system to accomplish it.
* Doesn't complain too much about hacky solutions in the short term, just gets it done. 
* Can give 5-10 hours per week communicating with us and advancing the cause.  


**Compensation:**

* Rev-share for work performed
* Non-expiring license rights to anything you create
* Experience working with a team (version control stuff, business processes, peer review)

I'm a Mexican-American English / Spanish translator who's currently looking for freelance gaming work. I graduated from UABC's Language Faculty (Mexicali, BC, Mexico campus) a few years back with a Bachelor's Degree in English / Spanish translation, but I never really worked in my profession due to lack of local work opportunities.

Since my hometown is pretty much dead when it comes to *any* new job opportunities, I've decided to give freelance game translation a shot. My goal is to get experience so I can build up my resume and potentially get larger jobs later in the year.

I'm open to working on any kind of game on any platform. I'd translate smaller scripts for free, while larger jobs would have to be paid, but my rates would still be much, much cheaper than anything a big localization company could offer you. All I ask is that you give me credit and let me list you on my resume and website (along with a sample of my work, with a link to your own website or stores that sell your game). Even if your game is something really simple that only needs its instructions translated, I'll gladly do it. Additionally, any touch-ups that might be needed for one reason or another (a bugfix, a patch that adds new content, etc.) could also be done for free or at a reduced rate. Any translation issues (stuff which would need to be changed due to regional dialect differences) would be fixed up at no cost.

I'm a native Spanish (Mexico) speaker but grew up speaking English (US) thanks to my relatives and a steady stream of American books, TV and movies, so I consider myself to be 90 to 95% fluent in the language. Anything that I don't know, I'll look up. Most people who speak to me online in games or message boards don't realize that I'm not a native English speaker. I'm also open to working on other non-game stuff like literature and comics - web or print.

I'm looking for an artist to do all of the art for this game, including the art required for each mini game. 

Each mini game will not have a lot of art pieces (most have 2 objects of interest, 3 bonuses and a background), but will have several animations, such as objects of interest exploding, bonuses being activated, player scoring, object's charging up, etc. Imagine the mini games in Wario Ware and Mario Party.

As for payment, I can either pay per hour or per completed piece of art (or I'm open to a revenue split). I do have a budget but I'm willing to spend what is required to get this game finished. I'm expecting to pay competitively for high quality art.

The game aims to be quite gritty. Music will be dark ambient.

A human would be about 40px in height. I don't think there's need for views from all angles, so front view only would suffice. About 4-5 different enemy types + one boss character.

Enemies will range from dark robed monks (or something) to high tech battle human/mech/monsters (think Quake1, maybe).

(Here's my lame attempt at a walking turret thing, that folds open to shoot. Don't laugh: http://phoboslab.org/crap/super-secret-fps/turret.gif )

The game (including all art) may be open sourced with a permissive license in the end, so you have to be ok with that.

Fixed price for the whole project is about ~ $1200 (don't know if that's fair - you tell me), or by the hour.


**Update**, fixed player height info above and some more info:

The number of animation sequences of course depends on the type of enemy.

So for instance a human type enemy will have an idle animation (think 2 frames, slightly bobbing up and down), walking, shooting and maybe a melee attack.
	
A simpler enemy type that behaves like the Fiend from Quake or Head Crabs from Half-Life will need an idle, walking and jumping animation.

The game's theme will be a kind of ascension. Going through Maya themed jungles, catacombs, old tech facilities and finally high-tech outposts. So I can imagine enemies ranging from monks and lovecraftian monsters protecting the jungle and catacombs, man-machine hybrids or battle-suits with somewhat like humans in them to fully automated turrets for the later levels.

I love the enemies from Quake1, so somewhat in that direction would be awesome: http://quake.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Quake_enemies

What I don't want is enemies to look like normal humans with guns. There are enough COD games in this world already :)

When Intelligence became a commodity, writers were bought and sold like champion thoroughbred horses.

Intelligence, true intelligence, became rare. Survival was the most important genetic trait, forced to come to prominence when the Artificials took over the so-called ""defense"" satellites. Fire, tungsten rods, decrepit satellites in decaying orbits, even nuclear waste--the Arts used them all in their insane effort to drive humanity back into primitivism so they could take over our factories, laboratories, and remaining natural resources.

When brush fires are common, your ability to evade them is the evolutionary pressure that pushes your species to survive. When predators chase you down, your legs become your greatest asset.

When the computers kill anything near books, writing, and tools more sophisticated than a sharp rock--in other words, signs of intelligence--the survivability of your species forces you to get stupid, fast, or go underground.

The sperm of a young, healthy writer is worth ten bushels of potatoes, or one working stick of DDR12. Their DNA is prized because everyone else has become mentally lethargic. No one does their times tables anymore. The only homework our children get assigned is to go outside in the daylight, find a rabbit or other morsel of food, and live to share it with their idiot siblings.

The only exception to the rule of Dumb is the Factory where young women willingly submit to artificial or 
not-so-artificial insemination from the brain trusts of our era. They spread their legs for humanity in the dim hope that one day our best and brightest can emerge from the darkness and take back the surface from the Artificials.

TL;DR: IAMA fiction writer L.ooking F.or P.roject to get some credits, money, or both. I'm comfortable in Science Fiction or Fantasy genres, and I pretend to be humorous. I enjoy long walks on the beach and the Oxford Comma. I wrote this post in one go on a whim. I am comfortable with many dozens of words in the English language, including *most* of the ones in this post. Hire me for your project; you need me!^*

- 1 year project deadline
- minimal quests  / inventory.  It's more of an exploratory scenario than grinding and killing monsters
- audio and possibly video in different rooms of the building
- player characters have slider controls for features (but I'm open to something more generic if it's less of an issue)
- player characters can communicate with each other through voice or text
- date / time would be based on an actual location (weather to match the season?)

I'm sure there are a lot more to discuss before getting into numbers.  Please PM or ask questions here and I'll answer what I can.

I've been a lurker here a while, and I saw another Writer advertise here today, so I thought why not!

I'm a comic book writer and screenwriter (in that order ;) and I've always been interested in games as more than just a casual gamer. I have been writing professionally for 5 years now, I've been assistant editor of a humor magazine here in India, have edited a few comic books and have 2 small graphic novels in print currently (both parody / satire) and have an black comedy / action graphic novel set to release later this year. For the last year I have also worked as a script consultant for a feature film project, have written dialogue for another film currently in production, and am working on dialogues on another screenplay at the moment (this is 'work for hire' and not the work I've done 'on spec' and am currently shopping around.)  

I am also one-half of the team behind 'Aaapki Poojita' a humor webcomic in Hindi and English, rooted in Indian pop culture and reference humor that probably only people who grew up middle-class in the 90s, in North India will understand :/

I would love to be involved in the development of a game with an experienced company since I am new to the medium, though I have experience in writing humor comics, screenplays and script-doctoring. I have a lot of ideas as far as stories are concerned, and with a good programmer would love to learn how to translate those to Game Mechanics.

* I am looking for a company / team / developer / artist to work with who had at least 1 published game under their belt - someone professional, prompt, and original.

* As I mentioned in the title, my strengths are Humor, and Adventure Games (I'm a big fan of the old Lucasarts SCUMM games, though Grim Fandango is my favourite among Lucasarts' catalogue, and Telltale games is fast becoming a close second.)

* I am looking to get into this professionally, and I am looking for paid jobs only - though since I'm just starting out, I probably won't be able to quote what might be a 'standard' rate (if there is any)  

So how about this - I will charge for 'game doctoring' i.e. if you have a basic idea for a game, and a rough story, I will flesh it out for you, write backstories, worldbuilding, or clear out plotholes if your game has any, or even if its a basic Plants vs Zombies type game, come up with an interesting twist to it - what ever you need, for a price.  

BUT, if I get a free rein, a nice big credit on the front, and we develop the idea together - we work out some sort of a revenue sharing or a deferred payment dealy.



Below are some links to whatever of my work you can find online (not much, and most of its very rooted in Indian pop culture, so I'm not sure how much non-South Asians will understand this, but here's what I have)  

Uud Bilaw Manus (Otter-Man) A sort of cheesy superhero comic book parody, about a half-otter half-man, speaking a made up 'rural dialect', who's arch-nemesis is a giant bug - It's a little hard to explain, read a small sample for yourself here - http://issuu.com/popculturepublishing/docs/u_bi_maar

Widhwa Ma Andhi Behen (Widowed Mother, Blind Sister) A pastiche of Hindi films from the 70s and 80s, making fun of the tropes and cliches of those times, with the overt plot of a mystery-solving duo - a tiny sample can be found here http://issuu.com/popculturepublishing/docs/wmab

Aaapki Poojita (Your Poojita) A cast of TV show characters have to learn to live in the *real* world after their long-running TV show gets cancelled. This is the webcomic I am currently working on, and you can read it here http://aaapkipoojita.com/ (Text is Hindi-English, sorry international readers :(

These 3-d models will then be converted to a 2-d sprite image and re-introduced in our 2-d isometric environment.  
  
**Where we stand in terms of developing the game**  
We're about to enter the exciting phase of unit interactions.  
Currently our code has developed to a point where we can start accommodating said building/terrain/unit assets.  We have unit pathfinding and movement working, and can generate a city with a realistic clustering of building types, roads, and bridges.
  
Likewise, we've been successful at generating a large map with a natural looking terrain.  We've reached a map resolution of 2048*2048 tiles.  
  
-To get a feel of how well we've been able to randomly generate the contours we find in natural geography, here is a close up screen-shot that details our terrain generation on a micro scale 
http://i.imgur.com/vK4diL1h.png  
  
-This is a screen-shot of our seed generated map on a macro 2048*2048 scale 
http://i.imgur.com/PS4qrJM.png   
  
You may be wondering why our game looks so bland. The fact of the matter is that our current team members need to focus on the coding and coding alone. We do not have the time, or energy to pay attention to graphics.  
We are looking for someone willing/capable to take initiative on the graphics end.  
  
**Work ethic**
This game is large commitment on everyone’s end. We're trying to move as fast as we can given our limitations on free-time and our ineptitude to compensate anyone(including ourselves).  
The coders don't a have a lick of free-time as most of it either goes to school, intern-ships, work, or the development of this game. If we can expect the same from you, you'd be a good addition to the team.  
  
**Quality of work**  
We're not expecting top notch quality models from anyone. Only their full and undivided effort.  
We're willing to accommodate novices and intermediate level graphics people as long as they're reliable and produce better content than the coding team is capable of producing.  
We value work ethic, over skill and ability. 
  
**Communication**  
We rely heavily on skype for communication and use it on a daily basis.

**Contact us**
Send a pm with you skype user ID, name, and a working email. This is our primary measure for accountability. 
We're also using this to build a private profile for graphics artists we plan to reference whenever new projects come up.  
  
Tell us a bit about yourself and your current capabilities within the field of computer graphics/animation.
  
You can also post references to your portfolio/work in this thread so that it could be shown off to other people looking for Artists.
  
**Payment**  
Revshare /equity.

I'm planning on making a MMORPG game like Zelda.  It will be episodic in nature.  Each episode will have new features and quests to do.  Eventually it will end in a Kingdom Simulation game, territory conquering and an army builder of up to like 1000 large.  

I have a game engine complete.  And also I have levels which are mostly complete too.   There's only like a couple weeks of finalization on my end for the first episode.  I've played it and it is fun even with placeholder art.

What I need is an ambitious artist to reskin the art, as my prior company moved on to match 3 tech instead of following through and realizing a MMORPG.  If you want to play on the engine, check out: http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/dungeon-run.jsp

I guarantee I can follow through on my side.  I have like 1,700 hours invested in this game already, and it is fully functional with no known bugs.

I'm a hobbyist high school game developer creating my first game for iOS/Android. I've been programming for two years now and am self taught, learning in my free time. I've made many prototypes over the last year, but have never released anything due to my lack of artistic talent. My game concept is an infinite runner with a new and unique twist. Your a bat flying through a cave, dodging stalagmites. To make things more difficult, the cave is also dark. In order to make it brighter, you use your echolocation. This makes the cave temporarily brighter before it starts to drift back into darkness. If you're interested in helping me out, I'd gladly go into more detail.

**What I Need**

Currently, the game is targeted at 640x960 pixels (**2D**). I'm picturing the game in either a pixel or vector art style, but I would be willing to go with anything that looks good. :D

I would need just about every type of art done. Here's what I can think of right now:

- Characters and Animations
- UI Elements (Buttons, etc.)
- Backgrounds

The game itself is a rather simple concept, so not much art will need to be done compared to most projects. As I am making this as a hobby, there are no deadlines to meet or anything like that. I currently can not offer compensation for artwork, but after the game is released and some revenue comes in, I'd be able to pay for the artwork. Perhaps we could partner up and maybe even revenue share.

If you're interested, please PM me and I'll discuss the game in more detail. Also, please include some examples of your work so that I know what style(s) you work with.

Thank you for your interest. :D",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1370384396.0,,,True,t3_1fix2w,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1fix2w/lfartist_for_casual_mobile_game/,

Nowadays I'm trying to build my portfolio and CV, so I would like to try various stuff to expand those.

I'm a big fan of video games (especially shooters and sci-fi games like **Mass Effect, Fallout 3, Borderlands, Deus Ex** etc.) and I'd like to work full time with this some day, so I thought I'd put my little portfolio out here and see if anyone wants to hook up for a fun project!

Since this is my first time into the video game area, I'd like to start off modestly by being part of some **less ""serious"" stuff to begin with, just having fun with something like a hobby project or modding**, just to get a feel of how it is to work with programmers etc. across the internet.

You can [check out my music portfolio here (Soundcloud)](http://soundcloud.com/c-z) and my first and only video game [ME3 sound design demo (on YouTube)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D1RHRt2QaM) based on a video recording.

You can search for my artist names Christian Zechner, Antares 101 or Dude Unit on Spotify etc. to have a listen.

My style would be described as **dark, melancholic, ambient/deep, industrial, breakbeats or trance** and would probably fit best for **any Sci-Fi stuff**.

I work in Cubase 5, 6 and/or 7 and own a home studio. I also have access to a recording studio and some of Norway's best voice actors (we cast the voice actor for Roald Amundsen in the video game [The Secret World](http://www.thesecretworld.com/)), but this will of course cost money and require some serious time and planning, so paid work isn't really what I am looking for to start with.

I decided to take my chance when I saw this community. When I saw the first comment I figured that I should edit the note. I am looking for a 2D Artist to team-up.

Because I adore old NES/Sega Genesis games especially for their art and game design. Highest priority is making great games as possible.

Before the edit (thanks to cryoclaire) I was just mentioning about a game idea, like a boss looking for a employer/artist. But as I mentioned above this is not about searching project based artist, this is about searching teammate to make games. If the artist comes with an idea we can also develop/integrate it together. 

Currently I'm developing a 2D platformer based on actionscript 3.0/flash using box2D physics. With a few words it's a game about a tar ball running from factory to freedom. I have detailed story also. Game mechanics is unique so far among the games I've played/seen. As an additional detail, game can parse Tiled maps at the moment based on 32px grid. If we decide to go further I will show you a demo of gameplay with I have built so far.

If things change in the future I'll update/repost here. Thanks guys!

**Some things about me** (Skip down for project details)

I am a programmer. I work on games in my free time for fun. Most things I work on are just ideas me and some friends have bounced off each other. I have never actually completely finished a game, and that's mostly attributed to the fact that I can not do my own art. I always get a decent way through the programming, but get to a point where I need to test stuff. To test things I need something to see, and so I try doing the artwork myself. It just kills the fun for me because it's extremely difficult.

My current project was something I came up with one night which I thought was pretty funny and have stuck with it because it sounds like a fun concept to me. None of my friends are very good artists, which is why I've come here.

**About the project**

The game is currently a pixel style and my current character looks like Mario a little. It's only pixel at the moment because it was the easiest for me to animate. However, if someone where able to come up with something that's smoother, and albeit more appealing visually, I'd totally be up for a style change.

I need pretty much everything art related done, but I'll list it all here just so you have an idea as to what the work load would be like.

* Characters &amp; animations for each state
    * Idle stances (left and right)
    * Walking states (left, right, up, down)
    * Attack/block/using of items
* Level art, streets/trees/buildings. Think pokemon, how the cities were pretty much just one large image, that's what I'm aiming for.
* Items and weapons
* Some HUD and UI stuff
* And probably more, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head

Like I said in my sorta half-assed bio, I program for fun and as a hobby, so there is no dead line on when things need to be done. I'd expect whoever expresses interest to be someone that does artwork as a hobby as well. I can not offer a pay at the time because I don't have plans to make much, if any, money off the game. However, if while working on it, the game begins to look and feel really good, I may submit it to steam greenlight. If it were to be accepted there, we could talk about compensation for **all** work completed for the title.

I don't feel comfortable discussing game details here, but if you PM'ed me expressing interest I'd gladly go into more detail.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1369167062.0,,,True,t3_1equ1a,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1equ1a/lf_an_artist_for_some_2d_work_hobby/,

My name is Bryan and I've been programming as a hobby for the past ~4 or so years.  I first started learning with Microsoft's XNA Game Studio back in 2009 which taught me a foundation of C#, though I primarily worked as an artist at the time.  I collaborated with a programmer and we created a simple game similar to the card game Memory called ""Match-It"" which was never fully released, though I'm sure some digging could find it on the XNA forums.

Since then I've taught myself a moderate understanding of JavaScript, having completed all of the courses available at www.codeacademy.com and made smaller projects for myself for fun.  I then got re-interested in making video games, so I spent a few months dabbling in Java and created a small tile-based top-down RPG base just to have something that I've created and could run around in.

Since then I have gotten reinvigorated at the prospect of working in C#, renewed my XNA membership and created a couple small private demos in that such as Tower defenses etc.  and have also been creating simple games in Unity3D over the past year in my spare time, which thankfully combines all of my knowledge of 3D game spaces, C# and JavaScript into one.

C# / XNA / Unity3D : Advanced

JavaScript : Advanced

Java : Knowledgeable

The details of the engine are quite fine grained, and I would be willing to elaborate if anyone is interested.

The engine is made with C++, SFML2, and Poco. 

The github is [here](https://github.com/Astrognome/AstroEngine), but I have made very drastic changes in the couple days, and haven't pushed my changes yet, so this is definitely not indicative of the current code, but it should give you an idea of my skill level. I have done a lot of code in the past (coding for 7 years, done C++ for 4), but many of my projects are long lost, were experiments, or completely broken. It wasn't until fairly recently that I felt my skills were good enough to complete an engine and look for a partner.

I did overuse shared_ptr a bit, and I haven't commented my code much, but that is fixed in the latest code, which I will actually be pushing this evening.

I chose someone who seemed competent and we got to work, trying to make a slimmed down version for mobile devices but it quickly became apparent to me that our finished game, limited by the mobile platform, would not be one I would be excited about.

""Another Survival Game..."". If you are familiar with this Genre you may know that there are currently two games competing for top spot. Day Z &amp; War Z. You may also know that there is a lot of controversy surrounding these games and the limitations both of these games have.

Who Are We?
A group of individuals who have developed various types of games, and prototypes. We own two online communities related to Survival Games (War Z, Day Z, SAMP)with a combined total of over 10,000 members. Over the past several years we have seen the interest this game genre has received, and received valuable information from our communities on what people are looking for. At the same time, we have developed a Multiplayer FPS prototype in Unity, several Mini-Games, and a browser based 3D chat game. All of this however, has built up to our first big project. Our survival game has been drafted based on market research over the past several years, as well as personal experience and feedback given to us by thousands of players. I am currently getting a degree in Game Development and plan on developing the 3D Environments, Props, and Characters myself - with assistance from whomever we hire.

What About The Game?
Unfortunately, we can not reveal many details about the game to the public at this time. The reason being, is that we wan't to release a Kickstarter campaign some time in the next year. This campaign will help fund the project, and allow us to develop it fully. I am confident, that if we had the proper materials for our campaign, we could easily reach our fundraising goals. I can tell you, that it is a zombie-free Surival MMO set some time in the future. The environment will feature a post apocalyptic city. Though this information is somewhat vague, we will reveal more details to anyone interested in joining our team! 

What Do We Want? 
We've expended our own investment money (out of pocket) into other projects over the years. For this project, we take it very seriously and that is why we are planning it over a longer term, and setting a realistic budget. We want to fund the development of the game through Kickstarter. What we require now more than anything, is some concept art for our Kickstarter Campaign. This will help us promote the campaign as well as help prospective players understand our ideas. If any artists would like to join us, we would very much appreciate it. Your work will be fully credited and you will be fully compensated once the project is funded. We are excited to get started, as there is great potential for our game to be hugely successful. You can be a part of it!

Concepts We May Require
An image of the futuristic city. A city block, residential area.
Character concepts. Male &amp; Female Sci-Fi Appearance.
Modern/Futuristic House showing above/below ground structures.



What Else? 
We will be moving forward with the development of this game regardless of whether we find an artist to help us now or later. The only difference is going to be time. If we were to launch the campaign within the next few months, or year, it would be ideal as there is a huge number of prospective players. The sooner the better, which is why we are asking for help from you guys.

I've broke ties with my last company for various reasons. The idea was that we'd make a MMORPG out of the Gauntlet style engine we wrote. I wanted to do episodic content, and roll out something new every 3-6 months. The recurring theme was you had to solve a town's problems. Eventually the game changed from a Zelda style game into a kingdom simulator, where you could grab out land and defend it, gaining resources in the process. Also another key feature would be that you'd recruit an army, and equip them with treasure. This would beat the problem most MMORPGS have of decking a single guy out with super uber rares, so rares no longer looked attractive. You should generally have someone to handme down some equipment.

Since it would be upgraded every 3-6 months, tech upgrades would come regularly, so even without full tech, the game would be playable. But in a couple years, the game would be in full force.

If you want to test drive the engine, play this game: http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/dungeon-run.jsp

The difference between that game and the one we're making is all about depth of the RPG influencing the combat. I want to get to a state where you're having 500 against 500 army battles in full speed. Do you want to risk your own self and deal damage quicker, or do you want to hide behind the lines until things thin out?

I have an overland already coded up, and it is playable, and pretty fun. The problem I have now is that it is 100% placeholder art. You gather resources, and rebuild a town. You can either feed the townspeople daily and instruct them to rebuild, or you can gather resources to help build it quicker. Anyway, the game is fun, and I spent a couple hundred extra hours on it from the last game, but my last company wouldn't even look at it because they didn't have time.

I know it is a shot in the dark, but does anyone want to do art for a Gauntlet battle system meets MMORPG questing game? I only have about 2 weeks of work on my end to do, and it is mostly map editing(easy). But there's a lot of art to do. Like 500 tiles, and many multi frame monsters. So I could understand why no one would want to help, it is significant work. But on the upside, you'll know the code is already done.

Hello,

My name is Mark St. Jean and I have been working on a 2D MMORPG for the last few years. I am looking for an artist I can work with for the next few weeks while I prepare for a Kickstarter campaign. As is the same with most no-budget games I have been using art from a pre-existing game which I would like to replace to prevent any legal issues.

All art resources are 32x32 pixels in size and if animated contain ~3-5 frames. I really need someone who can create art in the style of older games, particularly Ultima 1-5. It's very important that the artist can also design partially isometric artwork to fit the perspective, as most of the current art isn't isometric but needs to be. The main job at hand is to replace the existing artwork but I would like someone who would essentially join the team for the next few months who can create new resources as they are needed. You are free to do as little or as much work as you'd like, I'll take any help I can get. The current art needing to be replaced is ~&lt; 30 individual frames.

There is no budget for this project and I can't offer monetary compensation. In the event of financial gain for the project through premium purchases, donations, or crowd-funding you would be reimbursed for time spent.

**More Info:**

I have been working on various projects since I was about 15 (that's nearly 12 years,) and always attempt to bring curious enthusiasm to projects. I ask questions and really like to get involved as much as I'm allowed. Need a town theme? I'll be sure to ask about the life styles of residents, the role it has in the story, what do they eat, and other things to ensure that I can capture the feel of the place the best I can. The goal of music in video games is to communicate to the audience what can't be done through text, dialogue, or gameplay. 

Style-wise I tend to focus on a mixture of electronic, rock, orchestral, and jazz. I am proficient with 8-bit music as well. I really enjoy working in ambient, noise, and other ""experimental"" genres.

When it comes to sound effects I create them using digital instruments, self recordings, and if need be from sound effect libraries. I usually strive for all original sounds, but sometimes that's not possible. 

I take my work seriously, but I am generally a fun-loving and sarcastic person. In groups I tend to be diplomatic and approachable.

**Education:**

* Bachelor's of Music - Five Towns College, 2011.

My name is Christian and I recently graduated from uni (literally a few days ago) and want to spend some time on a serious game project. I'm looking for a group to join and help successfully produce something fun!

My name is Sottaceti, and I'm working on a horror game called Astral. I've had it in ""development"" since 2011, and it's seen many changes. I've already reached a point where I have an entire introductory level planned out, but I need a team to help me out. I have a lot of experience with writing; I've even written me own mum's papers for college and earned her perfect scores (least I could do for the lady for takin' care of my ass). I have a negligible amount of experience with 3D modeling, and I have a bit more extensive experience with music-making. I have no experience with programming at all. The majority of the creation of the game will be a co-operative endeavor.

I want to essentially utilize Amnesia: The Dark Descent's HPL1 engine, which they've provided free of charge on their website to create the game, so making a library is unnecessary if the programmer should not want to build it himself. However, I would like the programmer to be able to tweak it should he wish. I want to build environments from scratch or using royalty-free and customized scenery and objects. I can assist in grunt work for 3D modeling if it is needed. I have FL Studio 9 along with NI Massive, Shreddage II, AmpliTube and Miroslav Philharmonik VSTs. I've made a variety of pieces utilizing those tools and, previously, Edirol Orchestral. I also have a partner who will be assisting us who is more dedicated to music production and has a better ear for composition and score than I do.

The game's story will be told through letters, notes, monster instances, and dialogue between two additional characters besides the main character. The story is built upon an extensive lore that has been in light development since 2009 intensive and intricate development since as early as mid-2012, so many portions of the story are set, however, the associates shall have a hefty final say in the inclusion of elements aside from those few predetermined.

The associates will be compensated as the project moves along as needed out of my own bank accounts. I have a minimum wage job lined up, but since I've no bills to pay and my college is paid for by scholarships all my pay will be available as funding deemed necessary for the development of the project. The associates will be compensated with revenue from sales completed through the online platform, Steam, and through digital downloads hosted by the associates' and my website for our act. I will take full responsibility in acquiring and funding voice talent where necessary.

Examples of talent will be mostly not directly related to the project at this point in time.

The system is very good. It uses graphs to create a reference map and then 'tile-izes' it with prefab 3d tiles. Its not actually that hard, but a working project needs a lot of programming under the hood and a LOT of 3d tile prefabs.

There is *big money* to be made creating a system for this in C#/Unity and selling it on the Unity Asset Store, which is a hot market right now. Its arguably much more lucrative for small teams (meaning, us two) than developing actual games in Unity. There are tons of products carving out big niches for themselves right now. For example, I know the maker of NGUI was grossing $300k/year on his $95 GUI system. Depending on the quality and amount of tiles, the system could be worth anywhere from $35-$200 per sale (bare bones tile set vs Path of Exile quality) and there is currently no solution available on the asset store for this to compete with. I think the business case speaks for itself. 

I'm looking for an artist to work with me in a joint venture to produce a working procedural system a la path of exile. The first person to publish a really great procedural system on the Unity asset store is going to make a lot of money and I hope its me and you :)

The Style: The game is played from a bird's eye view (top-down) and I'm leaning toward a pixel art aesthetic. The artist will have input into the overall look and feel of the game, including art style, palettes, etc.

Assets needed:

* Walk/attack animations for the four player classes.
* Walk/attack animations for ~10 monsters.
* Some effect animations, TBD.
* Dungeon architecture &amp; items.
* Incidental game art (title screen, logo, etc).

I'm developing this project on my own dime, so I need to keep an eye on costs. That said, I understand skilled artists need to be paid. 

The game is currently in a playable pre-alpha state, so I can send applicants a link/login to get a feel for the gameplay.

Examples of my previously published games:

* http://lab.wx3.com/defender/

I am seeking an animator to join in the development of an adventure stealth game. The animation style needs to be exaggerated motions, so I am looking for someone with experience in cartoonish animations, or someone who can adopt the style.

So, lets get right to it, what is the game about? Well, it's a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda, where the player must navigate through an environment to reach the end goal. They must avoid guards, and use the environment to their advantage to get through the world. One catch however, is that the character is blind! In a twist of fate, the character is blinded by magic, but the same magic has given them an extra ability, the ability to see sounds. They player is able to navigate the world by listening to sound sources bouncing off of surfaces.

[ Rev-share ],8,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/16ezgv/lfprogammer_for_as3_art_game_revshare/,"Hey everybody Joe here! and I have been throwing around this game concept and have done all the artwork for more than a month now and every programmer Iv hired has bailed or sucked so I need a good codemonkey for this project.

its Called ""**Grace**""

Grace is an art platformer game. Grace is designed to challenge the players problem solving skills in all categories. But, it is designed to challenge the players emotions as well. To make them think or decide within the game based on the players own emotional efforts to find “grace” in the game. When you start the game you are in this black and white world. No sound, no color, no sign of peace. Only discomfort and confusion. Inhabited with morbid and discomforting people that only talk about sad negative or downing subjects that when you walk by them. You don't quite understand what they would mean if you were a kid and think it was something innocent. The setting of the game is this moody depressing round-based world that rotates to your movement, so you can explore it, and figure out what the world is! You are this little boy. He is seen with out facial features, no eyes, ears, mouth, ect. Thus he is mute and cant experience the world for what it is. The little boy is in the park about to burry a time capsule. A mysterious old man walks up to him slowly and tells the boy “there's nothing inside that thing” the boy can only listen not talk back or show any emotion to respond to the old man, yet the old man knows he's listening. The old man then tells the boy “do you know what your suppose to put in that thing?” the boy still doesn't respond. The old man says “ you put whatever makes you, YOU! So you may come back to it when ever you've lost touch in yourself or have forgotten what you mean, coming back to open it back again when the world takes its course on you.” The boy then runs off. The Main objective of the game now is that the boy must find the pieces of himself that makes the world worth seeing so the boy can find grace within it. The objects you collect in the game ARE the pieces of the boy. Such as, eyes, ears, mouth, ect. There is one piece of the boy scattered through out a section of the world and the world is divided up into 4 sections. The Park, The City, The Forest, and The Bridge. Each section has a different way of challenging the players problem solving skills. The four main focuses are memorization for the city, perception for the bridge, awareness for the park, and timing/planning for the forest. You work your way to collect the pieces of the boy's face, which activate the reward for the game. The reward for finding the pieces of the little boy are the aspects of the world. Such as the music of the world if you found his ears or activate the color of the world when you get his eyes or maybe the ability to talk back to the npc's when he gets his mouth. Finally when the boy acquires all of his features and the features of the world, the world is now colorful with nice calming music instead of a gust of wind and the ability to cheer up all the npc's through your own grace. You head back to the time capsule you were about to burry in the beginning and the old man hasn't moved you go ahead and start pulling off your facial features and start putting them in the time capsule, the old man asks “why are you putting them away?” the boy then says “I know who I am now and who the world is” the old man nods and fades away. The boy is seen walking away from the scene. But the music and the color of the planet still stays. The end.

Vox Venio is a 2D puzzle platformer with a slight twist. The player controls two characters -- one with the keyboard/gamepad as is the norm, the other with voice commands. The game is already well into production.

You can read the game's development blog here:
http://deck16.net/tagged/vox-venio
There are plenty of images and videos if you scroll through.

**What roles are open?**

We are currently looking to fill two roles: an artist and a level designer.

The Artist:

The artist will be taking over from a previous artist who is no longer able to work on Vox Venio.

The new artist is not constrained by the old artist's design and may redesign the look of the game as he or she desires. Currently the game has a ""pixel art"" style, but the engine supports high-res art if that's the route the new artist would like to go. Be aware, though, that the game is tile-based.

The Level Designer:

Level design in Vox Venio is quite easy and doesn't require skills beyond general computer literacy. Creativity and imagination matter most.

Both Roles:

Both positions are encouraged to take an active role in the ongoing design of the game. If you have good ideas we want to hear them!

Applicants should have easy access to a Windows computer (XP or later) so you can run the game. It does not have to be a particularly powerful machine, but it should be ""real"" and not a virtual machine or an emulator.

Applicants should be willing to communicate over IM or voice chat (it's so much easier to explain things that way).

If at all possible it would be nice to see your past work and/or any ideas you have regarding Vox Venio.

**What's in it for me?**

You should not be motivated by money. The game will only be sold (as opposed to made available freely) if it is good enough. And even if that happens there's no guarantee anyone will buy it. I repeat: you should not be motivated by money.

You will be joining a small and friendly team of hobbyists. Hopefully you'll have some fun!

Moreover, you can be more sure about this game being finished than most. Development has been underway for months, and a playable (if still very early) version exists.

Operational car I'm looking for is something like this (but obviously more post apocalyptic): http://liveimages.carsales.com.au/carsales/car/dealer/110521475.jpg?height=700&amp;aspect=FitWithinNoPad&amp;width=1050 the rear of the car should look like this: http://www.mynrma.com.au/images/motoring-car-makes-toyota/hilux-sr5-2009-rear.jpg with a couple of the letters missing and maybe a feint outline of a third letter, just enough to hint that it's a Toyota, inspired from Pixar: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/24/article-0-0D24712700000578-961_634x354.jpg
 
It needs to look very post-apocalyptic, my plan is to have a pick up like in the first picture driving around and maybe looking a bit more rugged with say something like spot lights arranged on the roof.
 
In addition to that car specifically I'd like an assortment of others to be littered around the track as obstacles (the video alludes to this as you can see), some of the obstacle cars may have ramp like structures in front of them to jump off of, here are the real world inspirations I'm looking for:

First off just so everyone knows from the get go I am a recruiter who works exclusively in the game world, but i'm not a pushy or obnoxious one!  Also i'm an avid redditor and geek in my free time!

Anyways on to the positions.  I've got a couple positions i'm working on at the moment.  I've got one company who is looking for a Ruby on Rails developer and iOS developer in Boston.  The company is a mobile game developer and the Ruby guy will be doing a lot of backend/API work and the iOS guy doing a lot of the front end game work.  Pay is going to vary depending on experience as they are looking at entry level to senior level guys.  Anyone with a good Ruby/Rails background or Objective C/Coccoa background give me a shout, let your friends know too!

Also looking for an iOS developer in the Dallas, Texas area; again for a mobile gaming studio.  This would be for a Mid or Senior level guy probably looking at the mid $60k and up region.  If you've got Objective C/C++/Coccoa's experience give me a holler.

I really want to stress the fact that i'm not going to be pushy or salesy or anything like that but I would love to help anyone out that might be a fit for either of these companies (who by the way I will tell you their names, info, anything else you want to know once we can talk).  

If you're interested email me at: tedwards@thenewellgroup.com or call me at 864-288-0011 and ask for Todd.  You can also PM me on here but that probably won't be as quick as the other ways.

1355868241.0,4,self.gameDevClassifieds,152nfk,[LFP &amp; A] Looking for some collaborators on a Fallout 2/Arcanum style project,6,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/152nfk/lfp_a_looking_for_some_collaborators_on_a_fallout/,"Hello!

About half a year ago I posted in /gamedev asking about how to get started with a few hundred pages of IP &amp; mechanics. Since that time, the concept has developed into a fully playable demo (about 40% featured) and an extensively laid out wiki full of information pertaining to this project.

**What we're looking for currently:** Right now we're looking for a few good programmer and artists that want to work to bring this game to light. This game is primarily focused on the people who thoroughly enjoyed the freedom and exploration character possibilities in games such as Fallout I &amp; 2, Planescape: Torment, and Arcanum. Right now, this is not a paid position; I'm currently in school myself, and we have not yet made a push to publicly fund the project. All of this, however, will come later. We're looking for people who are passionate about bringing this type of experience back into the field, in a way that is interesting, innovate, and most importantly, immersive. 

**What we have:** Currently we have a working demo of the initial prologue location. The demo itself is about 25% complete, but has many of the foundational mechanics working. Real Time combat is in and functional, however the animations (for instance) are paltry at best. Also a large section of the game and the transitory elements of combat system (Real Time/Turn Based) have not been included. *We are expecting that the entire demo will most likely need to be rewritten by more experienced and agile coders.*

So why would you want to dedicate your free time to this project? Let's go over some of the features we'd like to eventually see in the game:

* Top down, semi-fixed perspective gameplay in a 3D environment.
* Point-&gt; Click driven interaction system
* Vertical-pane UI system (Left/Right panes) with Right/Left click choosing functionality (can extrapolate this further if necessary)
* Extensive experience system with bonuses for exploring 
* Unique Skill Group system (Characters are comprised of Skill Groups which house Ability Trees)
* Real and Turn based Combat system - This system is created, tuned, and ready to be implemented. 
* Forward progressing storyline with five major Acts.
* Unique and magic world based in science and technology
* A long dead race of almost completely unknown origin that is just now being discovered
* Main story can be played by either side of the main conflict; Do you infiltrate as an honored brother or join the so called ""terrorists"" fighting for their freedom?
* 6 major continents (including the main city in the game). These continents all feature plotlines associated to the different tribes that originate. Map is created and ready to go, and major plotline have been fleshed out and ready to go.
* A combination of old school roleplaying, current day graphics, and timeless storytelling. 

Now, I could go on for hours about this; but frankly you've probably already read enough to get a basic idea. Right now the demo is in Unity, and we're thinking, for platform flexibility, that we may keep it as such. *However, this is subject to change if required* as we will be willing to work with whatever talent is available. 

**Programmers**: We're looking for people who can work in a collaborative fashion with others, mostly in a DropBox-type fashion (as yet TBA). As this project is not under any type of time delay, we're also willing to work with a small team/solo coder. This is all flexible, just shoot me a message with any questions.

**Artists**: Specifically we're looking for 3D modellers for the initial demo, as well as a talented Concept Artist. We have numerous character descriptions ready to go for talented artists to work with!

For 3D Artists, basically we're at the stage where placeholder art is what we require. We, of course, would like to start working on our final product, but that is not reasonable in the current scope. 

**Our Current Scope:** What we're looking to do is create a ""foundation"" build for this project. We have a semi-lengthy Core Build Requirement document that we'd like to have completed before the world construction and integration begins. This includes:

* Character and NPC systems
* Point -&gt; Click interaction systems (Identification of move commands/object interaction/etc)
* Pathfinding and Locomotion system (Currently using A*, however this is mailable)
* Hex based tile integration
* Real and Turn based Combat transition and system P.O.C. (Already created, just needs to be coded)
* Functional Indoor/Outdoor movement system (Moving inside a building and having the ""fade"" portions properly show the character and direct surroundings)
* Functional UI and Statistical system (As with the combat system, this is already completely planned out and ready to be coded. Unlike the Real/Turn based combat system, this is already working and present in the demo.)
* Zoning and Map changing.
* Saving and Loading of data (currently using the built in PlayerPrefs system for Unity; this will need to change)
* More, but directly related to some features still under wraps

So if you like what you hear, and may have a chunk of free time coming up to help make this dream a reality (and a Steam Greenlight project! XD), please contact me or post here and we can see what we can do.

Thanks for your time! I'll probably be back in a few weeks as well with another one.

Pluses:

* Unity engine experience
* Game design/programming

Profits:

* Since we are just starting out as indie guys we don't have much to offer on the front end, but we are planning on creating a Kickstarter and we're going to use the funds to finish the game and relocate dev members. We are planning on a rev-share situation since this is a start up of hopefully a new company/team that will allow the members to do this full time and get the game out.

I do game design and writing. I'm willing to work as hard as I need to in order to complete this game. I guess I should explain how this idea came to be then tell you what the game is about.


The game is kind of a mixture of the age old question, ""If you were stranded on an island, what would you do?"" This takes that question to the next level. One day I was hanging out with one of my friends and as we were driving he asked me what I would do if I was stranded. I thought about it, gave him a basic answer. I'd find shelter, forage for food, and purify water. But then I kept thinking about it. By the time I got home I had a million ideas in my head of what I would do, so here I am ready to put that into a game.


The game's main concept is surviving on an island. Other than that I can't get into details, paranoid maybe, but safe. If you want to know more you can shoot me an email at 


anon599999@gmail.com


**EDIT: Details. The game will be a free-roaming text based RPG where your main goal is to survive on an island an find out why you were put on the island in the first place. The map of the game will kind of work like a grid. You might start out in maybe C12 and you want to move to another area which will be C13. When you move to the next area, a description (which I will come up with) will pop up and tell you about the area. You can search the area, forage for food, fish, gather materials, and set up camp. Every event will have a response to it. There will be unique events, some pertaining to the main storyline and some independent ones.** There is a lot more to the game but I'd rather talk about it in voice-chat.


So far I have a list of game concepts, a map of the grid that the island will be on, and the introduction to the game, I may add/revise the introduction to give it more character/personality.


This game should be easy to code and create, the problem is the amount of content I want to put into it. You can email me about the game, I'll be happy to answer questions pertaining to the game.


What kind of team I'll need:

~~-Flash Developer (or something similar)~~

-Artist (2D)

~~-Writer/Game Design (For extra help)~~

~~-Music/Sound Composer~~


I may be missing something vital to the game's creation because my lack of knowledge of coding, but if I'm missing anything let me know below.


If you want to be involved in other ways other than the making of the game itself. I may need a website down the line once the game is ready for release.

The first phase of the project is working with the North and Winterfell, see the link above for a little snippet of our work. I'm hoping to reach out to interested artists and modelers to join us to complete this amazing project!

Please PM for details if you're interested!  Or reply below!

We desperately need enthusiastic people who are willing to join our small band and make something great from the source material we've chosen.  We will value your opinion in any area that you would like to contribute to.

This project is pro bono, but it can be used to add to a portfolio or CV.

We are Mercenary Games, an independent network of game developers based in Santa Cruz, California. We are the creators of FleetCOMM, an upcoming tactical space combat title (due late December 2012), and also [a Kickstarter survivor.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mercenary-games/vigrior-maneuver-warfare?ref=users)

**THE MISSION**

We've decided to freeze off our 2nd Kickstarter run, so we can focus on our crews critical objectives.

* Completing FleetCOMM (at ~80%) 
* We are looking for new crew members for our new mission starting Winter 2013.  

As described in the heading, [we are making a new game focusing on PvP.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/13h1rr/the_2013_game_concept_confab_something_that/c73xvq7) We want to get a head start on our next project. This involves sounding a recruiting call for any independent artists looking for a unique mission.


**THE IDEAL RECRUIT**

*Anne Hathaway, but with gamedev related art skillz.*


**THE RECRUIT**

Someone who wants to have a project gearing for an intense combat atmosphere. Your role will be producing cohesive, yet strikingly mad, character animations. You're hungry for an ultra-violent themed project to add to your belt. And no, we don't mean mindless violence, rather *mindful violence*. You also want to own the visual style of the game, and will be the principal artist if the project expands.

You must be comfortable working with a networked group with no physical office, using Skype as a primary means of communication. 

*We don't care how many years of ""industry experience"" you have; if you show us a portfolio of your work, we will investigate to see if you are a fit.*

**YOUR SPECIALTY**

You must be hungry for a project with a mecha-dystopian scifi style, modular weapon systems, space pirates, and drone armadas. 

**THE TOOLS &amp; ENGINE**

We have a custom built pipeline that values simplicity. Nothing as big as Unity, and easy enough to maintain for a small team. 

We use Skype, Dropbox and Git as tools for syncing up work.

Our core engine modules can deploy in the following platforms

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac
* iOS
* Android


**THE TEAM COMPOSITION**

This next project will start off with a very small team; a maximum of three to four core members. We're keeping this operation small since the next game concept is still being drafted. With a smaller team, we will have more room for ideas, and a faster iteration process.

**PROJECT PHASES**

This is a long term project, not a game-jam ""run-n-gun"" operation. How long are we gonna take? A playable alpha by the end of Winter 2013, not more than 6~8 months to get to a beta state. This is also a project that intends to ship within 1 year from concept completion.

**THE TIMELINE**

* JAN 2013 : crew members convene to create core game concepts.
* FEB 2013 : core engine modules drafted and ready for playtesting.
* MAR 2013 : playable multiplayer alpha engine, with initial art asset manifest.
* SUMMER 2013 : multiplayer beta.

**THE LOOT**

This is a revenue sharing project, we have a simplified contract agreement, minimal paperwork, and no NDA. We don't need ""secrecy""; you can blog and talk about the project at your discretion. While keeping this core team small, we will also have a bigger share for each member. Crowdfunding potential is always on the table, depending on what we can accomplish and show as a playable game using 3 months of crafting time.

My name is Michael Notarnicola.

Fed up with working alone on everything, I got myself a domain for my self declared dev team, BirdStreet Games.


I am quite proficient in java, and I'm interested to get a project off the ground and possibly greenlit on Steam. Currently there are 9 slots open for developers and artists.

Any English speaking individual may apply. This will be online collaboration.

Please PM me if you are interested. Thanks.

EDIT:
I'm sorry that I was not quite as descriptive. This is a non paying gig. Until we actually make an income and distribute it, this will be on our own time for no pay. Some might call this unfair, but I'm not getting paid either. This team might be more attractive for those that are in the same boat as I: just looking to get noticed with a game.

I'm currently looking for an artist to design an icon for a mobile app. The app in question is here.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hau.yourcity

The application icon will be displayed in the Google Play Store.
What I'm looking for is an icon that better portrays what the app is about (eg. the current icon looks flat, even though the app is 3D), and something that will catch the attention of users that browse the app store, and make them want to click on it (the current icon is way too dark).

The sizes needed are 36x36 48x48 72x72 96x96 512x512, so it should scale well. The most viewed and important sizes are 48x48 72x72 96x96.

$50 flat fee. Though I'm willing to pay more for higher quality work.
Please email me with any relevant examples of your work, and a quote (price and time needed).

Medior: Game Developer / Unity3D / (objective-)C / C# / Go / Android / NoSQL  
  
  
**What?**  
For the next 30 days i am offering my services to build small (modest scope) systems/backend components for game developers at a very low price.  


**How Much?**  
$50 per day, offer is valid from aug 14 2012 up to sep 13 2012  


**Why?**  
well, i:  
*  would like to make new contacts in the Game Dev community.  
Hopefully a special offer like this will lower the threshold for companies/indies in need of someone like me, with almost zero risk.  
That knife cuts both ways of course, since that will give me an opportunity to showcase my skills and build new relationships.  
*  want to practice my native languages fu. In Uni i worked with C-like languages, but i'm a bit rusty there.  
*  have a bit of time in between contracts.  
*  would like to know how much demand exists for systems/backend programming.  


**Ok, how do we do this?**  
Shoot me a message describing what you need.  
It should be in the area of systems/backend programming (examples below).  
Don't worry if you're unsure what a systems/backend is, or is not. I'd be glad to spar with you, and i'll give you an honest go or no-go.  
We will discuss and agree on the 'interface' (scope, specs) and i'll provide an estimate of how many days of work this is.  
If we can agree, i'll start the work.  
As long as the 'interface' (scope, specs) doesn't change, i take the pain if the estimate was too naive. No risk for you there.  
I'll provide a build every day, this means an executable.  
You make a payment of $50 after each of these daily deliveries.  
You receive the full source code after the final payment.  


**What can i expect?**  
A compiled executable (or a set of those) for the platform of your choice.  
The components will be unit tested.  
The full source code, including tests and documentation.  
Fast performance: a native -compiled- language will be used (no scripting language or VM based language).  
Professional grade software design for 1/8 the price (my current regular rate is $50 per HOUR for web dev work).  
[12 factor compliance](http://www.12factor.net/)  


**What happens after this offer expires?**  
Back to business as usual.  
I may organize more special offers like this (if this turns out to actually work), but certainly not as cheap.  


**What are examples of systems/backend services?**  
*  load balancer for your backend cluster  
*  centralized high scores  
*  anti piracy validation  
*  chat module  
*  random generated world server  
*  multiplayer match maker  
*  multiplayer server for simple games  
*  cluster manager (start/stop servers as load in- or decreases)  


**A bit of background plz?**  
For the last 16 years i have been working in the area of web development and relational databases.  
Recently i have been very exited about how Indie Gaming, mobile gaming and eSports have been developing,
and i made the decision (based on passion for gaming, music and programming) to bend my career path in that direction.  
Two years ago i took a first small step, when i started working for a big european publisher of flash game portals.  
However, this was in the role of Senior Developer / Software Architect for the web portals.  
What i really wanted was to be involved in the actual game making.  
Now that this contract has ended, i'm taking the next step.  
Besides taking on systems programming, i'm working on games of my own (currently i am working on Asteroid Ace for Android).

I'm doing this as a side-project, not a full-time job, and I want someone who is in the same position -- looking to learn from the project and (a huge) maybe make money on it assuming we sell the final product. That said, if the final product is sold, you will be 100% involved in making decisions about how we do it. I'm all about being fair and keeping things ethical. You will not be my employee or contractor, you will be a partner.

Here is a small pitch of my project:

 * The character is a household pet going through the trials and tribulations of daily life. I want the game to be interesting, so though the control mechanics won't change, the goals/themes of each level will. Graphics and musical style will be in a retro platformer style (think 8-bit). Lots of humor too (don't worry I have tons of ideas for that and almost all of the onus of responsibility will be on me since I'm doing the graphics). That said, I'd like the game to feel as fluid as Super Meat Boy or Rayman: Origins (e.g. lots of very fluid jumping).

Responsibilities:

 * Front end client programming
 * Graphics rendering (though I'll provide/edit the artwork as we work on things).
 * Game logic development
 * Enjoy ourselves!

Requirements:

 * Passion and enough skill to hold your own
 * Previous experience in game development would be nice, but it's not a must. Again, I'm looking for a partner for this project who can compliment my art and music skills (I can create the music and graphics).
 * I'd like the game to end up being cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux, and Xbox Marketplace), so I think C++ is the way to go.

Compensation:

 * Compensation would only come at the end of the project assuming we decide to sell it. You'll hopefully learn to find that I'm quite the Good Guy Greg and will be fair and ethical in this domain. I can't stress this enough. Trust is hugely important in any team. I'll trust you, and I expect you'll trust me.

PM me if you're interested. If you have any demo work you want to share, more power to you! If you're a college student looking to work with someone who is not going to take advantage of you, I can promise you I'm very fair and will respect your opinions and contributions.

I will also be documenting the development progress on my blog at http://blog.smalleycreative.com, which will be hopefully very interesting to my readers (I get about 200 hits on my blog per day, so it should help get the game some exposure).

...and guess what? Here are some early graphics: http://i.imgur.com/TZPql.jpg

We are two CS students from spain who, in our spare time, have developed a simple Android game. 

**The game**

Sequence is a skill-based game where the player has to complete as many sequences as he can, before the time expires, by pressing the balls in the correct order. When the player completes two or more sequences without failing it's considered a combo. The higher the combo, the more points the player earns, granting him the option to enter a special mode to boost their time and score count.

You can see a video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hArqdmgnooo) (note that it's recorded on an emulator so the performance and colors are not entirely representative).

Some screenshots here:

[Screenshot #3](http://i.imgur.com/MfalL.png)

[Screenshot #4](http://i.imgur.com/0E8Um.png)

[Screenshot #5](http://i.imgur.com/HWnci.png)

When finished, the game will be uploaded to Google Play and will be free to play and without advertisements. We decided that the game should reach the most people as possible and that ads shouldn't spoil the experience. Therefore, we are not making any money from it and so we are not looking for a paid musician/composer.

We understand everybody likes being paid for their work, but we are looking for someone who, like us, wants to be part of a polished project for fun, experience and expand (or start) his/her gamedev portfolio.

**Details**

At least two musical pieces are needed, one for the menus and one for ingame. Ideally a 3rd, more fast-paced, one would be appreciated for the moments when the player gets to enter into a special mode.

We prefer the pieces to be in .ogg, but nothing is set in stone. 

Besides that, the composer has complete freedom to work as he/she sees fit. If the composer has an Android phone, the .apk can be handed for him/her to test the game and get the feel to it.

We really want this game to finally see the light so if you want to join us we'd love to see some of your previous work or a little preview of what you think the game could use.

Finally, even if the game is almost finished, feel free to send us feedback about it.

Thank you very much.

All the art for it needs to be done. The artist will have to work on the backgrounds for the levels (7 different level types), barricade objects, the spritesheets for the character and zombies (8 types of zombies) and some UI elements. I would like a flashy cartoony style, but I would be very open to other styles as well.

Since the coding is already 90% complete, I would be hoping to find someone who can start on this soon. I am open to someone working part-time on this too.

**About FableLabs:**

FableLabs is passionate about creating storyline driven social games.  We're interested in creating experiences that pull the player forward and leave them wanting to find out more.  We see ourselves as story tellers that use tools to build characters and worlds for players to explore and engage with. We're looking to become the ""Pixar of social games"" and are looking for a few more folks that want to make a huge impact. If you are passionate about creating memorable IP that players can form emotional connections with, let us know.  We'd love to have you on our team.  We're based in San Francisco, in the Hatchery (1 block from the ballpark).

*What We're NOT:*

* We're NOT making clones of Zynga games
* We're NOT making reskins of Evony, Kingdoms of Camelot, Atlantis, etc
* We're NOT letting short-sighted conversion metrics rule our lives (we start with a thesis and let metrics validate)

*What We ARE:*

* We ARE making games that are focused on delivering amazing storylines
* We ARE creating characters and worlds that players will care to explore
* We ARE building tools that will allow allow content creators to do 1 and 2


**Why You Should Apply:**

* *TECHNOLOGY:* We embrace cutting edge technology if it saves us time in the long run. Ask us about how we wrote our own DSL that in turn generates code for serializing game data and defining API routes. Or perhaps watch our webinar with Membase about how we are able to support millions of users with NO sysadmin and a tiny team. Bigger doesn't always mean better, if you know how to use the right tools.
* *INNOVATION:* We have built a wide range of tools and processes that greatly reduce both low level work and endless cross-functional meetings. By making sure team members are unblocked and focused on high value activities, we're able to spend more time on adding innovation to our games.
* *IMPACT:* We've signed some long term deals with publishers that want to distribute our games on the web and mobile platforms. We are looking for folks that want to join on this initial traction and help take it to the next level. We will be asking for your opinion so be ready to have one.


**What You'll Need:**

* 5+ years software development experience
* You identify yourself as a game developer rather than a flash developer
* You didn't just pass your CS classes, but have actually implemented, say, a doubly linked list in AS3.
* You know about A* and depth sorting as much as you do about DisplayObject and BitmapData. (and I hope it's quite a bit!)
* You have compiled swfs without using timeline or straight from the command line.
* You apply the hotkey skills acquired from StarCraft in the daily use of your favorite IDE.
* You can configure your own linux server or better yet, even know some vim commands.
* You have MUST shipped a game, or released your own open source project.


**How to Apply:**

What I am seeking is to start a collaborative community project. We start by creating a team of like minded and motivated individuals. Once we have a selection, we discuss ideas each of us have. We create a document that list the pro's and con's of each idea and then we vote on the ideas we think are best from that list, whittling them down as we go along until we come across the best idea. 

Then we as a team work on designing this game, we collaborate on the design document, on technical aspects. We then move on down a organized tasklist, helping each other out. We keep the tasks publicly shared and updated and focus on making the aspects cohesive.

- Ideally you'd have very strong C++ skills with a mathematical or graphics background

- You're willing to work under and follow directions from our lead programmer. 

- You're someone who understands how to deliver, that it's the end result that's important.

- Someone good at working in a small team of completely unprofessional, but lovely people. 

- Have time to dedicate at least 20 hours a week to game development

- Are happy to work with an emphasis on communication and planning

A friend of mine pointed me towards reddit, so we'll see how this goes. I have two projects in mind to start with since they are small and quite achievable, but hopefully things work out and we go on to bigger and better things!

About me: I’m a designer, an artist, a producer, and a general business guy. I can do just about anything for game dev, but while I have a rudimentary understanding of programming (some XNA and scripting work), it’s not really something I’m very good at. I’ve formed, led, and worked with many teams of people before successfully. My most recent project was a card game that I got published, revealed and sold at Gen Con, is already in some Chicago stores and is about to have global distribution. Our projects are all share based, with agreed upon shares based on who’s doing what work. I am dedicated to my work and will do whatever we need to finish our game!

About the projects: Depending on what kind of result I get, I could go with either one of these, but most likely I’d like to start with:
LOCKS is a simple word game for two players. I’d like to release an iOS/Android (and maybe web) version. The project is incredibly simple to make which makes it a good way to gauge how we work together, and the most complicated part will be smooth matchmaking and multiplay capabilities.

The second project is Tannhauser Gate, where players take control of a space carrier and send out fighters to defend the ship and take on enemies. It features a rich setup and upgrade system for the carrier and fighters, but with a fast arcade-style gameplay. This project was intentionally designed to be easy to iterate, with a very simple first-stage prototype that can be built on and iterated until the final project is finished.

About you: You know how to use Unity, and as such know C# or Java to go with it. You can show previous projects to highlight your skill and dedication. You want to actually build, complete, and follow up on a project to its fullest. You’ll quickly prototype and show work as we go, so we can both iterate and keep momentum high.
If you’d like to be my partner on either of these, I’d love to hear from you!

Reentry Games is a Brooklyn based startup focused on creating 3D real-time synchronous multiplayer games for the web and mobile platforms. We are three full-time, seriously dedicated software engineers with thirty years combined experience at companies such as Electronic Arts and Microsoft.

We're looking for a 3D artist to help us drive the artistic vision of our titles, and make our first game look fantastic. The ideal candidate is not only a great artist, but also has great ideas that can help influence all aspects of a game, from color scheme to gameplay.

**Responsibilities**

Create concept art for characters
Create concepts for the layout of UI elements and overall look and feel
Implement concept art as 3D models with textures and animations
Create 2D art for GUI elements, icons, and backgrounds


**Skills and Experience**

Strong experience with a 3D modeling tool. 3DS Max or Maya preferred, but anything that can export to FBX will work.
Ability to create good looking low-polygon models that are textured and rigged for animation
Not required, but would be a huge plus:
Experience creating models for mobile games
Experience with the Unity 3D game engine

**Location**

We would prefer someone who can be onsite in Brooklyn. If that's not possible then offsite is acceptable, but you must be able to meet with us a couple of times a week.

**Compensation**

As an early stage startup, we are looking for a person to become a long-term partner that is interested in taking an equity stake in the company. However, we can can pay a negotiable mix of cash and equity.

I'm even pretty good at art as well. I'm going to finished this freaking game because it's the only reason I live now. It's my goal in life, and no ones going to stop me.

Seriously though, I need someone who can rig and animate to team up with. I need lots of fucked up looking alien/abstract creatures. I can model if you can't do that, but I'm not exactly a pro at that either.

You wont get paid jack shit for this. You will get to join me on my quest to make an awesome, bloody, indie game that could potentially end up getting big.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,False,,,True,t3_hz7ls,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/hz7ls/artist_needed_3d_modeling/,

I am well versed in modern C++(11) (including TMP naturally), which is currently my area of interest, and has been for quite a few years.
In an ideal world, I would prefer writing all code from very high level perspective, but unfortunately, that's not the case and there is always architecture to be considered, and I enjoy considering it :);
I can also write assembly (x64 / x86) if necessary. (Along with SIMD stuff.)

To insert a few more acronyms, I can also write C, C#, Java, Python and when it comes to worst, Haskell. I can pick up a new imperative paradigm language if necessary in a few days / weeks.

I also understand GPGPU (C++ AMP preferred, CUDA basics), although I have yet to apply this knowledge to something more difficult than blurring an image.

Knowledge of OOP is a matter of course, although as a (slightly-stubborn, sometimes-high-horse-riding) C++ person,
I think OOP is fairly overused and I prefer parametric polymorphism in general.

I've been trying to come up with something interesting to attach, although I've so far worked mostly on silly pet projects,
so maybe my stack overflow profile link might be of interest. It hints at what I am generally interested in and some answers also contain code snippets.
http://stackoverflow.com/users/1056928/scarletamaranth

And last but not least, I see this as a learning opportunity and not as a job or something like that, so I am willing to (and quite frankly eager to) learn pretty much anything. (I have very solid math background, so anything ranging from crypto to 3d graphics is just fine.)

I play a lot of dota, chess and guitar and I drink a lot of coffee and tea (highly relevant!) :).

I would prefer to be working on back-end and I would also prefer a simpler project (no MMORPG space battles with many lasers and cross platform kinect enabled fights) so that we can realistically get something done. I can also write (hopefully highly optimal :P) utility libraries and template machinery, as I bask in the glory of C++ :).

Random fact: My standards for code quality (and especially C++ quality) are absurd and I will tell you what you're doing wrong and how to do it better while trying to avoid sounding condescending! :P

What I expect: A project that is (or is going to be very soon) something more than an idea / ideas in a text document.

While we are near the beginning of the project, we have a passionate team that is eager to see this project through to completion. The final component we need to complete our team is a developer that can turn the concept into reality. 

An ideal applicant for our team is someone that is highly interested in the game concept (sci-fi RTS/RPG) and has the skills to make this type of game. Even if you have not created an RTS previously, if you have some experience and believe you are capable, we encourage you to apply. Someone who is in a U.S. time zone is also ideal, but not required. Additionally, if you want to be involved in the growth and maturation of a unique story with a diverse cast, then this is the perfect position for you.

Because we are a start-up company, we are offering rev share based on the amount of time and work devoted to the project. 

If you are interested in working with us on this project, or would just like to know more, please contact us at Management@FreshSquozeGames.com.

FAQ:
Q: Engine?
A: Spring/Unity/Source. We are investigating which will be most suited to our needs.

Q: Platform?
A: PC. Additional platforms (Mac, iOS, Android, etc.) may be considered at a later stage, but PC is our target platform.

Q: Language?
A: We are all fluent in English. For everything else, it will be at developer's discretion.

Q: What do you bring to the table?
A: In addition to providing an immersive storyline, a fully designed tech tree, units, background, well-written and relatable characters, music, and our sparkling personalities we will also handle the business side of the operation, allowing you to focus on creating a game that you can be proud of. This includes handling the funding, operating costs, marketing, PR, etc that goes into turning what could be a small indie game into something much larger.

Q: Who's on staff?
A: The two co-founders, a financial manager, and a composer are currently on staff. We have two artists (one specializing in concepts, the other in models) that we anticipate adding to the team sometime this week. Our target staff is around 10 members until the final stages of the project, at which time we may consider additional help to ensure that the game comes out on schedule and in peak condition.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1376425310.0,,,True,t3_1k9miy,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1k9miy/science_fiction_rtsrpg_looking_for_a_strong/,

I'm a professional programmer, looking for a small, fun, dedicated and enthusiastic game development team. I've been working on some hobby projects of mine, but I can't get anything worthwhile developed because I lack the skills in anything that's not programming(or falls withtin a small management skillset).

*Me*

* 21 years old
* Dutch, living in the Netherlands
* 4 years of professional industry experience, as a programmer
* 1 year of small management experience
* A total of more than 6+ years experience as a programming freelancer


*Programming experience*

I've basically tried and used all the major languages, including webdevelopment and Unity3D. You could call me a jack of all trades, but in the programming world I don't believe in ""mastering"" one programming language or skillset.

Contact me to see some of my work or get more info, I'd rather not post it here in public.


*Requirements*

I'd really like to develop a mobile game, but I'm open for anything that sounds fun really. I find it far more important that the team is dedicated and fun.


*Rates/Payment*

I haven't even thought about this before writing up this post. I'm basically willing to work for a rev-share or something. I'm open to everything, so I'm sure we can work something out. Again, I'm mostly doing this because I find it fund, not for ""the money""  

If anyone's interested, please send me a message with an address or something I can contact you at, or reply in this thread. Also, don't hesitate to ask me for more info!

Here is a simplifyed example of the [layout!](http://imgur.com/DzPwIsZ).

*If you are not interested then you can stop reading here.*

**Application**

The layout is customizable to your needs partly: colors and font can be changed and ,in case you are an artist as well, pictures implemented.
The menu will have a button with a link to your portfolio, webesite or whatever you want it me to link to. You will own the app and I will send you the source code if you wish so. 

**Requirements**

To simplify the creation of the app you will have to follow certain rules when writing your script. Your app is divided into ""pages. The picture of the layout is such a ""page"". Each page contains text and up to 8 choices to choose from. You need to indicate when a page, text or choice starts with the following pattern:

1. p#   #p

2.  t#   #t

3. c1#  #c1  -  c8#  #c8

4. g1#  #g1  -  g8#  #g8


 p# nameofthepage #p 

give your page a unique name, no spaces in between the words and use lower case only.

 t# your text #t

no restrictions

 c1# text of first choice #c1

no restrictions

 g1# name of the page you want to proceed to when picking the first choice #g1

give your page a unique name, no spaces in between words and use lower case only.

 ##

the double hashtag indicates the end of each page.

I wrote an example on [pastebin!](http://pastebin.com/REGVnn1y).


I hope you can see through.

This is a non-paid position, since I don't plan on selling the game. I'm doing this for fun, because I enjoy programming and making worlds of my own that I can share with others. I'm simply hoping to find someone who is like me and we could work together on this.

For the past few months I have been prototyping and finally started work on a 2D platform game in Unity. I am a lone programmer/designer however I am less than useless when it comes to art.

I'm looking for someone who is able to contribute everything from environments/characters/sprite sheets to the project. I have a rough idea of what I want however the floor is open to experiement in whatever way you want. I'll try to contribute to the overall process however, as I say, I have ZERO experience with art so you'll pretty much be taking the wheel.

Unfortunately, I also have zero budget for this project and am spending 110% of my spare time working on it. Because of this all that I can offer in return is a revenue share and some bad jokes along the way. I appreciate that rev share is not an ideal scenario for someone looking for work so thanks to anyone that wants to help out in advance...

If anyone is interested, drop me a PM. If you want to check out the devlog (apologies for programmer ""art"") then check out [My Devlog](http://ciaranharrigan.tumblr.com)

** EDIT ** Adding description of the game

The platformer that I am working on is a game called Tempus and its main mechanic is inspired by the time rewind mechanic of Braid. The key differences between this game and Braid however, is that the player is always immune to the time rewind mechanic, and that there are other NPC's in the game.

The NPC's in the game perform various actions on the level, such as moving objects around, opening and closing doors etc. and each level has a number of NPC's (as well as traditional platformer enemies that can kill the player). The NPC's are on a different timeline than the player however these timelines, from the players view are all playing out simultaneously.

Lets say and NPC, walks over to a box, picks it up, and continues on. If you take that box to use in a puzzle solution, you are interrupting the timeline, and so the NPC ceases to exist. If you however rewind time until the point BEFORE you interacted with the box, the NPC exists again and the timeline is reinstated.

In a nutshell, the puzzles in the game rely on solutions that can be carried out, not only by performing the correct actions, but by performing the correct actions at the correct time. Since time is not explicitly linear, it is up to the player to manipulate time in order to find the correct place on the timeline to perform these actions.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask away and I'll answer what I can :)

**I do not want someone who will not talk to me. Communication is a very high priority in developing a high quality game. If there is no communication between us, how can a game ever get completed. Don't be afraid to message me before I message you. Obviously you don't have to every time, but if you message me first once every week, this is far too little communication.**

There will be a screening process as I will not work with you until I think we are a good match. You must have the same interests as me or how can we even be friends.You will be required to create a concept piece before anything is finalized and we begin working on the game.

**You must be familiar with working in Unity3D. You must also have fast internet.

My name is Bjørn and I live in Copenhagen, Denmark. I'm 21 years old and I have been developing games for about 5 years, mostly in my spare time. Although I've completed 5 games, I have never worked with an artist before and could not be more excited!

Anways, the game is a RTS game, where the main objective is to control an ants nest. I have later come to realise that it has some things in common with dwarf fortress. 

I have done -some- art, in the form of terrain and very simple ant animations, which you can change or throw out. For the game I'm using 16x16 pixel tiles.

I'm a student, but I have a job on the side. That means that I can pay you, but I'm definitely not a game studio with hundreds of dollars to spare.

I will be getting my portfolio around tonight but wanted to at least get a thread started. 

Recently I have done a lot of work for Disney.

I also did work for Zynga on FarmVille 2 as well as character and environmental work for Kixeye. The latest shipped title I worked on was Roaming Fortress on IOS. For that game I helped with modeling, game/level design and creation, as well as over 100 hours of play testing.

Modeling - Modo

Texturing - 3D Coat and Photoshop

Sculpting - Zbrush 

Animation - Maya

I have used many other programs but these are the ones I'm most familiar and comfortable using.

I finished writing a game for android a few days ago but with placeholder graphics it doesn't look like much.
I'm looking for an experienced artist, preferably with android experience as the different resolutions and pixel densities are driving me mad, to draw all the game's assets .

The game is a 2D side-scroller strategy game: you get to spawn some units (while minding your gold) and so does the computer and they battle it out until either of your castles are destroyed. Those action sequences are separated by a campaign style map where you manage your economy and defend or invade countries.
Other game mechanics include spells, a skill tree to improve your troops and building stuff like defense tower and such...

The assets required would be:
# 5 units, each having 3 animations. (move,attack,die)
# 1 environment with a few layers to use for all that fancy parallax crap.
# 2 buildings: A castle and a tower.
# A map, divided in different countries .
# A few icons for spell and skills. I haven't counted but that's between 10 and 20.
# A full UI, meaning about 10 buttons, and a few backgrounds for each menu as well as frames for some labels.

That's about it, please send me your quote via pm or in the comment section. If you don't have a reddit account you can mail me at stephen.j.jacob at gmail but I'd rather have them on reddit.
I realize that's a lot of work, my budget is in the few hundreds but if your quote is above that maybe we'll be able to work something out by removing a few assets.

Alternatively, we can direct you on how to use simple open source 3-d modelling software to create assets. The catch is, you will be creating close to 100-150 assets we will use in the game. Most of which will be buildings, debris, dead people, alive people, fighting people, mourning people, trucks, cars, tanks, drones, planes, debris, destroyed stationary cars/trucks/tanks, etc etc.

This process is too tedious and time consuming for the coders to do and still be able to comfortably develop.

The perks of this offer are simple. Our development group wants to assure you a great measure of freedom to take the style, story, graphics, and design of the game in whatever direction you wish.  
At the end of the process. you will also have a 100 or so designs/models under your belt

There is no pay involved in development of the game. The coders are going without, you will too, until the game reaches a stage it can be marketed.

I'm Danny Wu, and I'm a Year 10 programmer/student in Sydney, and I'd like to do work experience for an awesome gaming company. Quick notes about myself:

I started learning programming back when I was around 10. I enjoyed gaming, and I wanted to make Flash games. So I did, I started cobbling through (not really best practices) coding tutorials on the internet. I learned some more from experience. I picked up some computer science knowledge. I made 2D raytracers for a top down shooter with vision, I have some pretty extensive knowledge with the Display model in Flash, I implemented A* pathfinding, I made my own Chess game with minimax AI.. Stuff like that.

I've made a few games, but then I moved on to web development. I picked up some more languages, made websites for me and did some paid jobs.

I won Google Code In 2012 as one of the grand prize winners - check for ""Ze Yue Wu"" on the list!

I am a composer with years of experience (along with playing in a band &amp; composing band's music) willing to compose your soundtrack for FREE. Since I've never done composing for games before, I'd like to compose for indie games. My main style is either medieval (folk songs without percussive feel) or futuristic (short songs based on looping), but I compose other genres, too: retro (VVVVVV), soft guitar/piano (To The Moon), spooky stuff, ambiental stuff etc. Here is my Soundcloud where I uploaded some of my stuff so you can assume what to expect:

https://soundcloud.com/jinx_11

I highly recommend you to download the track you want to hear so you can loop it because tracks like these are supposed to give the listener that ""loopy"" feeling.

Short description of each track (ignore their names, because **you** are the one to eventually choose them):

*Winds of liberty* - sadsadsad :'(

*Visoka Afrika* - melancholic, optimistic

*Transpiracijski usis* - medieval, sad

*Pleonazam* - futuristic

*Mikroetika* - soft &amp; slow

*Kut refleksije* - futuristic

*Homeostaza* - medieval (some kind of tavern?)

*Ekopwols* - :'(

Please remember that these tracks can be adjusted to your game's needs: you tell me the way you want them to be (deeper? no percussion? orchestral?) - I remix them until they are perfect.
Also if you want my future tracks to accommodate your game's needs, you can either explain what kind of song do you want (length, style, ambient, tempo...) or send me a song you want mine to be like.

I'm CK, a programmer.  I'm looking for an artist for a 2D sci-fi-themed (think Mega Man style) action/platformer (moreso action) that I'm going to begin work on full-time in a few months.  If I find the right person for the job, though, I'd be happy to set that person to work on asset creation (and start paying him/her!) immediately.

Our first target platform is Windows if that's a thing you care about.

Said artist will be responsible for the entirety of the project's art, including but probably not limited to: character/enemy sprites, weapon animations, level backgrounds/environments, HUD/menu colorfulness, icons, etc.  You are not responsible for game mechanics/design, but your input is more than welcome.

About me: I've made a game and a half by myself previous to this project.  The full game is [SPACIOUS](http://www.desura.com/games/spacious), and the half -- as well as the reason I won't be working on this project full-time for a few months -- is [Rift Rush](http://www.desura.com/games/rift-rush), a game I Kickstarted for the Rift a few months ago.  (RR is in an open-to-Kickstarter-folks Alpha state at present, but most of my dev work for it ought to be done in a few months.)  I worked in other industries as a programmer for five years prior to making SPACIOUS.

I've raised funding for the project and would like to pay an artist outright for the work.  I'd be willing to make a revenue-share deal (or some hybrid) if for some reason the right person for the project would prefer it.  This is a full-time contract that will last at least six months. 

My target artist is someone with talent but not a tremendous amount of industry experience; I have funding, but I'm not wildly rich.  If you're a 10+ year industry vet who expects compensation like you'd get from a AAA-producing studio, I'd love to have you on board but I probably cannot afford you. :(  

In terms of your personal style, anything's fine as long as it's aesthetically pleasing.  I'll even consider someone with great style not in the sci-fi genre; the story can be reworked to accommodate whatever you can do.

If you're interested, please send me a PM or email tastive@gmail.com with a link to your portfolio.  I'll tell you more about the project and ask you to create some simple samples of the kind of art we'll use in-game.  If we get along, get ready to take a shot at making a hit. :D

Sorry to be a bit of a beggar here but I figured there might be someone out there who would be willing to help out with a single texture for a game/mod that I am working on.

To give you a brief overview, I am a programmer working with Unreal Engine. I am currently working on creating a number of different weapons for the heck of it, with a vague goal of eventually developing into something more (but trying to keep my scope small currently so I don't overdo it). One of the weapons that I am creating is intended to be a rare laser rifle of alien origin.

In order to convey the feeling of this weapon being alien, I have been wanting to use some exotic looking images for both the crosshair and the weapon's scope. I currently have some images for this ([Crosshair](http://www.wailofsuicide.com/screenshots/NightshadeCrosshair.jpg), [Scope](http://www.wailofsuicide.com/screenshots/NightshadeFocus0.jpg)) however I'm not entirely satisfied with the scope texture.

What I'm looking For:

* Design a cool and exotic looking scope for a futuristic gun
* Max 2048x2048, RGBA texture (dds DXT5 preferable)
* Should probably resemble the crosshair design (e.g. Hexagonal theme), but if you want to go in an entirely different direction or create a new crosshair that's cool too.

Over the past few months I have created and refined a Super Meat Boy style (wall jumping, solid controls) platforming/run &amp; gun engine.

To be super brief: I CAN make a solid game. My engine has many possibilities, but right now, its almost entirely shitty pixel art placeholders.

The game currently has no art direction at all. Can you make sprite art and **more importantly can you animate it!** I don't have the time or the art skills needed to make both a game with solid mechanics AND a game that looks good.

If you're interested in doing some casual (no rush) stuff for me, I
'll put it in the damn game!

I haven't included a video of the engine because it's constantly being updated, so it would be out of date. I can live stream the prototype or create a video later.

TL;DR - **If you can make nice sprites AND ANIMATE the essentials (running, jumping, etc.). You should DEFINITELY hit me with a message.**

Remember even a game as beautiful as Braid started out with even worse placeholder art than mine!

My name is Ben and I'm looking for an artist to help establish a unique artistic style for a 2D game I'm working on. 

This project can be summed up as evolving the monster-catching genre by incorporating modern gaming techniques and storytelling. 

I work as the Writer, Project Manager, Community Manager, Marketer, and Investor for the project. 

The team thus far includes myself, and a mathematician. I also have a up-and-coming musician interested in composing music for the project as well.

In keeping with transparency, I do not currently have money to pay anyone right now. My plan is to have a payment structure as such: Set payment for each milestone reached (negotiable), payment for each asset used in the game (negotiable), and rev-share. 

The game is currently in pre-production. The job of the artist would be to help visualize settings and artistic style for the game and once we enter active production, to create assets to be used in-game. The game will only involve hobby level hours (2 - 7 hours a week) until adequate funding can be secured to support full-time development. 

Send me a private message, reply to this thread, or send me an email to littlebigrepublic@gmail.com if you're interested in the project.

Shadow Grip is a top-down puzzle game where you control a human character and his two shadows (red and blue) to solve puzzles.  

This game is the result of 1 semester of hard work from our small team at Indiana University.  However, when we formed the group in the course, we had an obvious lack of any artists.  As such, I had to pick up art duties and tried my best to fill the role.  Now that the course is finished, we are looking for any artists who are passionate and looking 
to build their portfolio.


**What our goal is:**


Our goal for Shadow Grip is to make a great indie game that we can show off on our portfolios.  As such, none of us are getting paid and are really doing this out of a labor of love.  

Making money off the game in the future is a possibility, but our first priority will likely be to buy Unity Licenses (so that we can published the game on other platforms) and to send the game/team to conferences such as GDC.  That being said, if anyone on the team is ever making money off of the game, you can be rest assured you will be making money as well.  Our goal is to be as fair as possible because to be honest, we are just looking to make something we can be proud of.


**What we are looking for:**


We are looking for motivated 2D and 3D artists who are interested in building a portfolio and some experience.  Our goal is to make a game that stylishly meshes 2D and 3D aesthetics.

2D Artists - Our 2D art of the game is focused on characters and character animation.  This however can extend over into character effects if the artist has the desire.

3D Artists - Our 3D art is focused on the game environment.  These 3D environments are meant to eventually mesh well with the 2D art.  This is a good example of what we will be going for in regards to this

**Get in contact with us:**


If you are interested, please either post in the comments or feel free to send me a message.  I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have or even talk to anyone who is just interested about the game in general. 

 If you would like to work as an artist on this project, please post a link in the comments or message to your portfolio/work.  If you don't have any portfolio/work available, we can work something out.

Last but not least, here is a link to our game so you can try it out yourself.  This is build is still early in development and while we have a good amount of content, we really need to work on some polishing and the introduction of new mechanics.  That being said, I am really proud of what we have accomplished in a few months of work.

1367695517.0,4,self.gameDevClassifieds,1doxs9,Deep psychological thriller/horror project seeking help.,4,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1doxs9/deep_psychological_thrillerhorror_project_seeking/,"Hello everyone! There is quite a bit of information here, but I recommend reading through it if you are interested in joining the project. For a few years now, I have been thinking of some great video game concepts. Most that I imagined seemed far too ambitious for a small team of developers to handle as they would require massive budgets and a lot of work.

Yet as I explored various genres, a brilliant idea finally dawned on me. The game would still be difficult to develop, but it was far simpler than the previous concepts I had thought up. At the heart of the game lies an incredibly deep and thought-provoking story, an engrossing setting, excellent narrative and seemingly limitless gameplay possibilities. I have been writing for about nine years now and gaming for the past eight. I have written many stories before, but none have ever been published as I had no intention of doing so at the time. 

I have always dreamed of becoming an author as a hobby, but I now feel that my writing is better suited for the world of gaming. I am currently 17 (18 in two months) and I live in South Africa. Video games have always been a passion of mine and now I truly believe that I am capable of heading a project to create one. Alright, without further ado, allow me to introduce the project and give you all a better idea of what is expected and how I plan on handling this.

Concept, details and description:

Working title: Ethereal

Here is a bit of the narrative from the beginning of the game. All work in progress.

The game begins with a line from the protagonist while the screen remains black, “I have no memory of what brought me to this vile place.” The screen will then flash immediately into gameplay with a transitional sound playing to emphasize the sudden change. The player will be able to gaze at their surroundings while the narrator continues the opening monologue, all the while he will be lead to the platform by two clothed creatures with hoods over their faces. They are armed with crude weapons. “It feels as though the life has been drained from my fragile existence. Darkness surrounds me at every turn, blocking out all hope of escape. These creatures do not utter a word, but their intentions are clear enough. I find myself standing upon a diving board, my eyes drawn into the abyss that lies before me. I can hear death's voice growing louder with every passing moment, but never does it extend the courtesy of calling my name. The glow from the rancid waters below offers little solace in such a cold and unforgiving place. A bubbling mess that has consumed so many before me. Their souls swell around in the green liquid, begging for forgiveness, cursing their misfortunes and crying out for loved ones that have been lost to them. All the while I continue to ask the same question over and over again; how did I get here? I barely remember anything of my life, only a sense of utter loneliness remains. Perhaps whatever lay beneath was a far gentler fate than waiting for answers that never seemed to come. Is this truly all that I have left? A final step before plunging down into the unknown? At least I had these few moments, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. A final chance to reminisce about a past I cannot seem to recall. One cannot ask for anything more in my situation. I can think of few words with which to leave this strange world...but these will just have to suffice. Adieu and farewell.” The player is presented with a prompt to move forward, but as the protagonist takes his foot off of the platform, a blinding light pierces the area. After the protagonist recovers, a glowing orb is revealed floating a few feet in front of him. It has chased away the darkness and illuminated the area, revealing stone walls all around him, appearing almost as the interiour of a cave. The creatures shriek and die around the player, shriveling into particles that are released into the air. 
Throughout the game there will be a very deep inner-narrative, voiced by the protagonist. The narrative will be somewhat similar to that of Max Payne 3, Alan Wake or Dear Esther. It is a very story-driven game, but gameplay is a major part of it as well. It will be a first-person game. 

What makes it a psychological thriller/ horror game is the setting in which the story takes place. I do not want to give away the entire story here by detailing exactly what the place is or what brought the protagonist to it, but it is incredibly mysterious and full of possibilities. 

There will not be a fixed gameplay style, as the setting changes from area to area, the player will need to adapt to the new surroundings and a new gameplay mechanic will be made available to them in order to progress. There will be a major antagonist in the game which the player will need to escape from in various moments, but there will also be various other obstacles and enemies to overcome along the way. The game will be single-player only (for now). There will be a lot of different locations: caves, buildings (one in particular is about five-stories high) and even natural environments like forests.

Ultimately I plan for this game to be an incredibly deep and moving experience for the player. It will offer very interesting gameplay mechanics, an incredible story and beautiful environments fueled by Unity 4. The main platform for the project is PC, but should the team decide to branch out to iOS and Android, it is open to discussion. Those two platforms will probably be Kickstarter stretch goals however as we can then hire experienced mobile game developers to assist us. 

Once a good team has been recruited, I plan to divulge more of the concept to them. We can play around with the art-style and decide on which looks the best. I was thinking that the art-style would either be relatively realistic looking (think about the Crysis series) or possibly a more 'painting-like' art-style similar to that of the Witcher 2. Naturally I am not expecting the graphics to rival those games, but we can most certainly give it our best try! Knowledge of DX11 implementation is a MASSIVE plus!

Right now (2013), development will be very casual. I will not expect too much from you and you can do your work in your own time. I plan on starting up a personal forum for us to showcase designs and a place for you to submit various WIP assets for the team to comment on. There will be a team-chat in Skype for general discussions and meetings. If you come up with an awesome new area or gameplay mechanic, feel free to share with the team!

I can program pretty well and I have been learning Unity 4 for the past few months. I am already working with a number of different AI programming techniques, spawning systems and statistics.

I am currently involved in another game-development project where I have learned A TON of important things, so I can safely say that I have some experience with game design and programming. I am finishing my final year of high-school and thus I am pretty tied down, so that is why this year (2013) will be a very casual year of development should you decide to join up. As of next year however (actually from about December 2013), development will go into full swing. 

I plan to have a trailer out by about March- May 2014, start up a Kickstarter around that time as well and get the project onto Steam Greenlight. We can do a few videos of early concepts and things to spread the news about the game and gather more potential buyers. We should try to keep our community updated with all the latest news (of course things that we all decide can be shown or revealed to the public, we can't showcase a system that may not actually work) via Twitter, youtube devblogs and other communication mediums. 

Now onto the topic of money (yay!). The Kickstarter will hopefully bring in a good amount of money that can be spread around between all of us. Some of that money though will NEED to go toward additional things to assist with the project (possibly additional licenses, purchasing of Unity 4 pro versions for the team and other costs). All final profits made after the launch of our game will be split between us. We can discuss the sharing a bit closer to the Kickstarter, but I must inform you that I will be using some of the profits to start up my own game-development studio. The maximum I will take for costs of the project will be 30%, the other 70% of profits will go to everyone that contributed to the project, calculated by how much each person put in. 

Positions:
If you have previous experience working on a game-title or have some sort of portfolio to present with your application, it will be a really great addition! You must be relatively well experienced with the role that you are applying for and the team will evaluate your application before accepting you into the team. Should you be approved, you must be willing to accept the terms that will be presented to you which may include signing and agreeing to an NDA( Non-Disclosure Agreement). Of course, you should have some experience with Unity as well (Unless you fall under the role of concept artists or similar fields). You must have some people skills! We don't want any fights breaking out about silly things. English is the primary language of the team and therefore you must be able to speak and write in English fluently. We will definitely excuse some bad grammar or spelling if English is not your language of choice, so don't be afraid to apply. You must be willing to communicate with the team and be able to meet deadlines when the time arrives. Knowledge of DX11 implementation and programming is a MASSIVE plus! If you already have a professional version of Unity 4 (legal version), that is another big plus. 

Each of the positions below will have a lead position, for example, lead-programmer. This person must have a lot of experience in their particular field, must have worked on a previous game-title and be able to manage their team. They should do things like: Give information as to how to do particular things, teach people how to optimize their code(programmers), be willing to check through submitted work and give suggestions or be able to fix it themselves. These lead positions will naturally get a bigger cut of final profits. Concept artists and voice actors do not have lead positions. I will still be available for comment on all submissions and the leads must report to me and be willing to listen to my ideas and suggestions. 

Here are the open positions:
Concept Artists: Must have a great imagination and excellent artistic skills. The concept artist will need to be able to express my ideas (and of course their own) through their creations with relative ease and create a very clear concept for reference. 

3D Artist: Must have experience with programs such as 3DS Max or Maya. Blender is acceptable, but the previous two are preferable. Good knowledge of poly counts, texture sizes, LODs and the such. If you specialize in a particular field (vegetation, characters, environments) let us know! Must be willing to communicate with texturers if you do not texture your own models.

Texture Artist: Similar knowledge and requirements to the 3D artist. Excellent drawing skills and knowledge of texturing is required as well. Must be willing to co-operate with the 3D modelers and work together to create the best looking assets possible.

3D Animator: Experience with animation programs such as 3DS Max, Maya or similar programs. May be required to import animations into the Unity 4 engine and apply them to in-engine assets. Communication with modelers may be essential.

Programmers: Should have great knowledge C# and possibly Java (Current code is all C#). You must also be experienced with Unity programming and be able to create the essential systems and gameplay mechanics the project will require. 

Sound Artist: Inventive, creative and flexible. You must have knowledge of implementing sound into Unity 4 and have a good portfolio for us to check through. Previous experience with developing sound effects for games will be a nice addition. It would be great if you can handle the two sub-sections below as well!
Sound Artist-Music: Must be a musical person that can truly capture the atmosphere and emotion of a particular scene. Should be able to implement music into Unity 4. 
Sound Artist-Dialogue: Similar qualities as above, but should have a good ear for voice talent and have sufficient knowledge of his job and experience with Unity. 

Voice actors: 
If you have an awesome voice, or know someone that does, don't hesitate to apply! Please attach a sample of your voice-acting for review. It will be much appreciated.
Protagonist: This is the most important role in the voice acting category. I am looking for a particular kind of voice to fill this position as the entire narrative and even some dialogue sequences will be voiced by this character. 
Little girl: Relatively small role, but essential to the story. Voice of innocence that one can expect to hear from such a character.
Woman: Another relatively small role, but also very important. Typical voice of a woman in her 30's.
Additional voice actors (male and female) for enemies and other roles: If you have an interesting voice, please feel free to apply for this field. There will be tons of additional characters that will need some awesome voice actors to bring them to life. There will be enemies in the game that require some freaky sounding dialogue (think about how the enemies in Alan Wake sounded). The other roles are still under production and hopefully more information will be available soon.

Open-category: If you have any other talents that can assist in bringing this project to life, please let us know! All applications are welcome.

Send all applications to this email address: etherealthegame@gmail.com
Yes, Gmail for now. We have yet to start up a proper site for a more 'professional' email system. 

Once again, thank you for your interest in this project! Hopefully we can create something truly beautiful, something that we can all be proud of.

Cheers!

I would really like to offer my skills as a composer to some of your projects. I can do just about anything, but I specialize in large epic scores, dark, somber, sad, etc. I don't really know what else to add, so I will post some samples and let them speak for themselves.

Some of this stuff I was messing around with for some of my metal projects.

1) https://soundcloud.com/johndiasparra/evigilantem-serpens

This is a small introduction I did, the image I was trying to capture is a large snowy valley on a foggy day surrounded by mountains. In the middle of the valley is a large beautiful castle town. The dim light of the sun comes through the clouds and the black shadow of a dragon is seem coming from the mountains(hence the roar and wing flapping.) The rest of the song is the cities reaction to the impending battle.

https://soundcloud.com/johndiasparra/orchestration-epic-build-up

This is a song I was working on for my symphonic project. I am sorry for the drums on it right now, but you can still get an idea of what I can do. There is a nice dark/epic build up that leads to a key change that I was pretty happy with.

Just another short sample.

A small ambient type track, this one is rather old and I don't like it as much. But I figured I would add it anyways.

You guys can contact me on this post, or via email at johndiasparra@gmail.com. Thanks and I hope you guys like it.

1367344828.0,4,self.gameDevClassifieds,1dfat3,[LFA] Looking for dedicated 3D texture artists [volunteer/rev-share],8,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1dfat3/lfa_looking_for_dedicated_3d_texture_artists/,"Survivor Zero is a game that got a bit of attention on reddit back when it was first announced as being ""the game everyone wanted"" - a zombie survival sandbox with emphasis on cunning over killing; you have to think about what you do in order to survive a zombie apocalypse. The style of the game is realistic, and set in present-day (post-apocalypse) america. To get a better idea of what we're working on, [click here to check out our recent trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFLpVevlSPc&amp;feature=youtu.be) and [click here for our website](http://survivorzero.com). We've been working hard for over a year now and have **a lot** of 3D assets waiting to be unwrapped and textured, so we need motivated texture artists who will stick around and help us out.


A bit of background on the team: around 17 members, with a fair amount of us actively working on the game's completion. We have a good spread of output over every department, but our texturers can't keep up with the load of our 3D artists. We're all in regular contact through a skype IM chat, which is the prefered method of communication if you were to join since it makes it easier to talk with everyone.


So we're looking for texture artists who:

* are self-motivated

* know how to unwrap and texture

* can do decent work in a reasonable timeframe

* can take constructive criticism

* get along well with our group

No requirements on programs; use whatever you're comfortable with as long as you can deal with FBX files.


You'll be working with all sorts of stuff - indoor and outdoor props, first-person items, many varying environments, characters/zombies (as well as baking high-poly normalmaps), animals and anything else. If you can do any or all of the above, then send us a link to your portfolio to HiddenPandaGames@gmail.com, or our subreddit over at [r/survivorzero](http://reddit.com/r/survivorzero) and we'll get back to you ASAP!


Although Hidden Panda Games is a company, this is a **volunteer project**. If this project makes any money then it will be fairly distributed, but there is no guarantee of that happening and we'd prefer members who are dedicated to make a game rather than hoping for an eventual pay-out.

Thanks for checking us out!

So to start with I have developed a small arcade game which is very near to completion. 

I have been using my own programmer art so far but would really like some better graphics. hopefully though these should serve well as a reference. 

There is not very much to do and only one small animation. There is a certain degree of freedom in the style as long as its consistent. 

Although this is a hobby I do plan to try and go through flash game license and would be able to offer rev share.

I'm currently working on the game design and programming of a game where you play as a cult leader trying to achieve world domination. I'm looking for a 2d artist to produce the visual assets for the game. The position would either just be [Hobby] or if there is enough attention, negotiable [Rev-share]. I think a cartoonish style would suit the satirical nature of the game, unless someone else has a better idea. 

The gameplay is a mix of Pandemic and Political Machine 2012 (along with other features) with the satire of the Tropico series. The player designs a cult and then must attempt to control the world by converting the global populace. The player must develop their cult at each stage of membership: recruitment, indoctrination and exploitation. They must manage their finances (and hopefully one day reach tax-exempt status). They must also avoid negative publicity, lest global powers become threatened by the growing power of the cult.

I'm currently doing everything that you need to do to make it happen, so i don't 'NEED' any specific thing. It'd just be nice to get some weight off myself in any area.

First of all there wont be any pay, of course any potential revenue is shared to a percentage we'd agree fitting based on who works/contribes more and less. I don't have any direct plans for monetization. Maybe try Greenlight, maybe just throw it up on the web for free with a donate button, we'll see, there will be plenty of time to think about that.

I'm making an Adventure game, it's not nessecarily meant to fit into the Adventure game label, or to be something molded in a genre. It just happen to be something that's most like an adventure game, you mainly ""just"" walk around and talk with people, solve small puzzles etc. Unfold the story and explore the world. But i certainly don't throw ""unfold the story and explore the world"" out there lightly. There will be alot of heavy story, and alot of world. In terms of themes and thickness of it. Probobly not lenght.

It has a few plot threads, I'm not going to go in depth here but it can be summarized as a dark comedy that would enjoy making the player cry aswell. I guess it's something like South Park+Louis CK+Bioshock+Limbo... Or something.

If you're wary and want to know more and/or see some shit i've done so far just hit me up on 
Skype: anton.qvarfordt

I also want to stress that it's NOT trying to be retro or trying to be ""like"" anything. We use the tools, artstyle, themes, music and gameplay features we think are cool and would be fun but most importantly interesting, moving and funny. ""Engaging"" is more important than ""Entertaining"". Did you think of a feature that would be cool, maybe a gameplay mechanic that's witty, engaging and could maybe act as a methafor through gameplay, or something like that, in the game? Then great, I havn't decided exactly what the game will be like, but there will be a million things i don't want it to  be like. However my point is you will be creatively enabled, but i'll probobly shoot down most of your ideas. ;)

I'm the Lead Developer at Red Dragon Gaming. We're currently in the process of polishing up the concept for Kickstarter.

Our Game in short is an RPG based in 61.A.D, During the Roman Occupation of Britain.

**We need an Artist that can draw our characters, Romans, Celts etc...**To convey the concept to the backers on Kickstarter. (We would do this bit ourselves, but non of us are very good at drawing), most of our time goes into the character design and 3D modelling. 

We are extremely confident that our game is unique and something our players will enjoy.

**More information will be shared later.**

**Payment** may not be upfront, depending on how well the Kickstarter goes or not. I'd be a liar if I told you there isn't a tiny bit of risk required. Payment will be a percentage share of the revenue when the game is released.

*What do I need to see?* Roman Soldiers, Roman Citizens, Celtic Warriors, Weapons, Armor and Helmets.

This is a fun project for my group so we're looking for someone who shows equal enthusiasm, We're sure we can make it a success.

just wondering if there was an interested party who might want to help with a project that I have mostly completely.  It's an action arcade game with a killer proof of concept (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8212240/DragonSiege.html).  I want to change some things within it, mostly the theme (from steam-punk to pirates).  Its written in Unity with Java and would like to keep it mostly like that as.  I also wanted to port it to mobile devices.  Any help would be awesome. Let me know.  Even if you play it and have feedback I would like to hear feedback.  Thanks!!!!

What we might want to do with it is make a few changes and then maybe Kickstart it or Indiegogo to raise a few dollars for the hard work put into it, or just release it as a free to play game and see how it goes.  I'm up for anything as long as we can get it out there for players to play.

So for awhile I've been working on a hobby project. I've been programming it and designing the levels with a friend. I found an artist to help me, trough a mutual friend, but she hasn't been able to work on it for awhile. The last time I got some art from her was about 2 months ago. So I'm here looking for someone to help me finish my game.

Here are some current screen shots of the game.

There hasn't been much done but as you can see it's a pixel art. The only thing I ask is for it to still be that. I'll be willing to collaborate with you on it as long as we can get it done. The game is just a hobby and a project I've been working on for awhile.

The one thing I'll hate to do is not be able to finish something I've been working on just because of one person.

The work is for 2D interactive game-like apps for iPad, so it's not exactly full-fledged 3D games.

Ultimately the work is for managing 2D fullscreen ""panes"" that will shift around when certains objects on the scene are pressed. Two of the panes will have very simple minigames. One is basically whack-a-mole, while the other is a true/false set of trivia questions.

The app is designed with the intent of relaying educational materials to a young audience. An illustrator is available to make modifications as needed, however most of the illustrations are done as of now. So, what we are specifically looking for is C# coding help to implement the features.

Currently, the first app is in the state of having the panes visible and animating in and out when objects are clicked. So this first job is more about the two mini games being implemented on one pane.

Edit: A pane is basically just a plane with a navigation script that controls the GUI elements and where the camera is focusing currently.

I've had a game incubating for some time. The game will have a significant story part. I'd like to commission some writing for the game, and you might be just the person I need.

You'll be starting from almost scratch. I do have solid ideas as far as themes and some characters, however your style and decisions will weigh in heavily. Come with an open mind, but also your participation is needed.

The total workload would amount to:

- 3x story structures (simply arranging arcs and lists of events and places) [400 words each]

- 6x character bios [600 words each]

- 4x location sheets [600 words each]

These are just guesstimates.

As I said I have no material to share with you. I hope we can have fruitful conversations to develop these pieces. Your work will set the tone for the art, music, and design I will commission later; perhaps even a full game script in the future. It could also be used as copy for the website. You must understand your contributions' importance.

Concerning the software development: the framework for the game is in a good place, but I'm getting bored and I'd like to acquire some assets from creative people. It's not in a playable state yet but it's getting there.

As is mentioned in the title: we'll take it step by step and payment will be upon delivery of a written piece in good condition.

PM me with your email (our main means of communication) if you're interested.

-Itd be cool if we could create marketing listings as well.  
  
-These marketers would be the much needed promoters, advertisers, and schmoozers you need to make a name for your indie/professional production.  
  
-Game marketing is as specialized of a trade as game Art, game Designing and programming, so it deserves specialized attention thats hard t find.  
  
-I see a lot of cool games posted on r/gamedev but I get the feeling that the developers dont understand that Marketing is as much of a full time job as development is.  
  
Now I know what you're thinking.  
  
""Its easy to bs experience and hard to gain proper self-perspective as a marketer. Hiring some random guy who thinks he knows it all is going to bring me more harm than good. And that there exists an abundance of these people as there are no real per-requisites to marketing and anyone with an ego can join in.  
  
How are we going to keep gameDevClassifieds from turning into r/gamemarketingclassifieds?

I'm a bedroom coder that makes fun, short, browser games.  

I'm currently working on something that is beyond my art skills so I'm looking for a 2D artist that would be interested in collaborating with me on a quick game.

**Game Description**

The Rise Of The Wizard is a fun, easy to play version of a roguelike game.  You move around a level, collecting bonus items, and try to defeat as many monsters as possible.

The game plays out as a combination of [Desktop Dungeons](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/HTML5/) and [Quick Quests](http://armorgames.com/play/12427/quick-quests).

I currently have a basic engine for the game.  If I continue at the pace I'm going, I should be able to finish the programming side of things within 2 weeks.

It's written in Javascript / HTML5 and will be playable in most browsers.

**What I need**

I need someone to create the 2D art resources for the game.  I'm open to any style.  Tiles sizes are 32x32.

As far as the specific assets I'll need, I'm looking for:

* Main character with animated cycle [standing guard, attack, death]
* 8 Monsters with animated cycle [standing guard, attack]
* 5-6 pickup items
* GUI elements [HUD, menus, buttons, etc.]
* 2-3 tilesets
* A handful of miscellaneous effects [taking damage, gaining a level, etc.]

(As far as ""animated cycles,""  I'm only expecting 2-3 frames of animation.)

**Compensation**

The game is going to be released completely free and open sourced.  I'm not expecting to make any money off of this project and I can't pay you.

Personally, I'm working on this project because I enjoy making creative, experimental games.

I'm planning to submit the game to various indie friendly game sites, and I'm sure that some of them will blog about it.  So, at the very least, it will look great on a resume.

**Contact Me**

If you're interested, e-mail me at: tiniglob@gmail.com

Also, be sure to send me any links or past projects that you've been a part of.

Thanks a bunch and I can't wait to meet YOU!

However, as I'm sure you all know, making ends meet while starting out is a difficult thing. Well, to try and keep the bank manager at bay for a while, I'm here offering my services - and I promise I'll be cheap.

For what it's worth I hold a 2:1 degree in games design and have been a lifelong hobbyist. Over that time I've gathered a lot of skills in things like Blender, Max, Photoshop, Gimp, Flash, Unity and UDK. 

I appreciate I can say this and it won't mean a thing without some sort of portfolio. Unfortunately, a lot of work I have done over the last three years was for a university - and therefore done in a group. While I could sit and circle everything I did in a hundred different screenshots I thought it would be easier just to upload a small album of more recent work to imgur. This is my current project - a bright and colourful puzzle tile based game set in a lab. I'm proud to say if I had to circle my work here I'd circle it all.

First, apologies for the repost. I needed to edit the job titles we're looking for. 

So we're heading into the Christmas season and we want to get our style-guide finished and start moving into full production in the new year.

Hey Devs, 

We're still working on growing our team so we came to you guys. We are an Ottawa-based company, but we operate online as well.
The project is called CoreTechs. The game: has collectible cards; is primarily small-scale, hex-board, tactics; and plays like a turn-based, multiplayer game set in a cyberpunk universe. Think Magic the Gathering on a hex-tile board.
We have a facebook page up: [CoreTechs on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/CoreTechs.Team) 
for anyone who wants to take a look.
Here's our work-in-progress website with our Wiki that contains rules and such - 
[CoreTechs on Home](http://coretechsgame.com/)
There is quite a bit of material that I can send out for those that would like more details.

Here are the **positions** we're looking to fill:

* **Graphic artist**
* logos
* buttons
* banners
* UI skinning

* **Concept Artists**
* characters
* environments
* backgrounds
* UI skinning concepts

* **Web designer**
* fixing up our current website

Drop me a line if this sounds like it may be up your alley.

Please contact me via email at jamesrabels@gmail.com I will not miss anything sent to the email, it may slip my mind to check my PM's as often. 
    
I'll include a list here of things you can expect from me
    
Sound effects, 
    UI sounds, 
    ambiance loops,
    implementation of said sounds if needed,
    V.O processing if needed,
    V.O editing if needed,
    Possible V.O work, I'm not too terrible,
    
Music?
I can make music, though if you're looking for music steeped in theory, meaning, and great execution a        dedicated composer might be a better choice. I can eq, mix and edit music to some extent if that is needed, though again a dedicated composer may give the best results.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1348613307.0,,,True,t3_10h49w,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/10h49w/sound_designer_looking_for_some_exp/,

We are looking for an artist to work with us on our small iOS platformer.


As the title suggests, all the art in the game will be pixel art, so you should be able to draw and animate all of the assets (sprites, tiles, background, etc.) None of these will be very complex, most of the art should be fairly basic.


The game will be launched on the App Store, and we are offering a percentage based revenue share.


The project is relatively small, and we are looking to work with an artist who is serious, but is also able to relax and just have fun making games.


Please post here or PM if you are interested or want more info.

No, this is a hobby project. If the idea seems appealing enough and the extra effort of getting a sales system set up is worth it then that could change.

In my experience longer posts turn people off- if you want to know more just ask but I'll try to keep the OP as short as possible.

**What am I doing/What skills are already accounted for.**

I'm going to be blunt and say I don't have much technical experience. My programming skills are limited to Visual Basic and I'm no good at modelling. I am, however, an experienced composer, have access to professional recording facilities for sound effects and music, I'm familiar with a large number of (voice) actors who'll happily help out with the game, and a lot of free time to spend on the project.

I always push for a powerful and unique sound that is not just memorable, but is something that captures the essence of the game world.

Some examples of my work can be found at my [Bandcamp](http://delusional.bandcamp.com) page, though I have many more available to show people, as I tend to only place official soundtracks on there (there's one on its way for [Spellsword](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spell-sword/id498685137?mt=8) and [Terra Noctis](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/terra-noctis/id479517015?mt=8) and [Legend of the Peach Girl](http://delusional.bandcamp.com/album/the-legend-of-the-peach-girl) are already there.)

Composing for free, as much as I would love to, is simply not viable for me, and shouldn't be encouraged, since it devalues the job of the composer.  However, my prices are highly competitive, and I am always fair when it comes to negotiating prices; if you have a small budget, I'm not going to ask for professional rates.  I'll accept service trades as well, along with commissions and other stuff; it's really up to what we all decide upon.

**Description**
Turtle Boogie is an action puzzle game for mobile touch-screen platforms. The game has been developed (on-and-off) for almost two years, with new ideas and features being added along the way.
There is a playable prototype demo for Windows Phone 7.5 that can also be played (for testing and evaluation purposes) on regular PC/Windows computers.


I am a professional developer of 10+ years, based in Stockholm, Sweden.
Nowadays I am focusing mostly on Windows .Net/C# and SQL database (not game related) programming, but I have in the past been programming small 2D retro-style games for e-game.com.

My great passion is game programming, and I am spending a lot of time right now on finishing Turtle Boogie to hopefully soon be released on the Windows Phone Marketplace. The current graphics (turtles and background tiles) are ""borrowed"" and licensed as free to use non-commercially, all other parts of the game have been drawn by my clumsy programmer hands in MSPaint, and most of that would be good to replace.

So here's my vision: Team up with a talented pixel perfect partner to finish Turtle Boogie and put it on the Windows Phone Marketplace together. 
Hopefully after that we can continue making more games together, I have plenty of more ideas - what is your dream game?


**Website**
http://www.TurtleBoogie.com

**Contact Method**
Contact me on daniel@turtleboogie.com or via Facebook.

**Target Aim**
Adware or Trial mode with a low-cost upgrade.

**Compensation Plan**
50/50 of any net profit.

**Technology**
The current target system is Windows Phone 7.5, using C#/XNA.
(After it is finished, we can look at porting the game to iPhone, Android and ""mobile web"".)

**Additional Info**

There are some actual game screenshots on the turtleboogie.com website. They hopefully give a good feel about the game.
I pulled the downloadable demo from the website, because it was a very outdated version - will have a new prototype playable demo available soon, just ask if you want it.

I am working on a fantasy themed game in XNA, and need a modeler&amp;animator to make the main character(s) for the game.

I'm working alone and paying out of pocket so obviously I can't pay studio rates, and as such I'm okay with not having a ton of experience. I will try to pay fair but again, I'm not going to be able to afford highly experienced people who are expecting to be paid that way. We can agree on a price per model before starting. I need model, texture, rig, and animations. I have a very rigid set of technical requirements for the model, although the art style is very open at this point. I have one enemy mob done, so it just needs to fit in with that. I am not looking for anything next-gen. I would prefer simplicity over making something highly detailed. 

Technical Requirements:

1. Must use 3DS MAX 2011 or earlier (for #2)

2. Models must be exported using KW X-Port. This is non negotiable. Models having multiple animations that can be blended together do NOT work correctly in XNA unless this exporter is used. If you have experience using this it's a huge plus.

3. XNA can be very picky about importing models, so expect some back and forth on that, most of the time problems arise because the skeleton is setup wrong, or vertices are duplicated or not weighted to any bone.

I have a document detailing how to export with KW, and has some of the pitfalls that can arise. There is also a video walking through how to use it. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Your task would require you to have complete understanding of a C++ programming language and also a have strong background in SDL.

The project we would be working on is a 2D RPG.

You would be also involved in designing the game with me.

Your specific task would be building the game engine.

 - Meaning besides some specific design rules. You would have creative freedom to do as you see fit.
 - Meaning using the SDL to load and display images.

 - Meaning handling the user input.

 - Meaning triggering the scripts once the player (or NPC) enters the certain area.


My tasks would be:
 - Building an active user UI

    * Meaning I will build all of UI. (In game and otherwise). Of course all in SDL.

    * Meaning handling all of the player's inventory and the math behinds it. (player equips another weapon etc..)

    * Meaning Save/Load 

 - Net code. ( If we decide we need any ).


We will use a ""Tiled"" teditor and a ""tmxlib"" for scripting and SDL for representations of the tiles on screen.

I already have a musician who will compose audiotrack.  And I know of an artist who will be happy to join. (worked with him before).

I'm also a writer on this project. And the main premise is that we ( our society as it is now ) are invaded by a force we don't understand. We are slaves now. Tasked only to breed and work. 

The main prologue would be like this for the protagonist: (story concept. Intro)

""And the moon shines bright once again. He raise his eyes and his soul cries out. 
""How long... How long must we endure this. Slaves for another? Why?"" 
And from his suffered eye a single tear shed. 
A tear of happiness, of sadness, of joy and cry. This tear was humanity. Good or bad.
That tear were we.

This is where the game starts.

Could be a good learning experience if you're starting out, or just something to keep you busy. If you're interested, you can also participate in the game design and stuff.

One game is a classic pseudo 3d arcade racer, Outrun style. The other is a side scrolling shooter, along the lines of Gradius or R-Type. Feel free to apply for either, or both. Because I intend the games to be samples, I don't need a huge amount of artwork, but I won't hold you back if you're really committed!

I'm basically splitting up and improving a game I wrote last year so you can see what I have there: http://www.ventajou.com/spacedinos/

1342482470.0,3,self.gameDevClassifieds,wo76i,[LFP] Client needed for very simple multiplayer Turn-based Strategy. [Hobby],5,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/wo76i/lfp_client_needed_for_very_simple_multiplayer/,"I'm currently working on getting a Turn-based Strategy/RPG ready for initial testing but have come across a flaw in my plan. The initial idea was for the game to be play-by-email, but the logistics are holding me back.  

The game is a hex-based mediaeval RPG/Strategy in which each player is a Feudal Lord. A large part of the gameplay is diplomacy- meaning lots of discussion and negotiation. The easiest way to handle this would be letting players email each other the majority of the time, but this isn't possible because a large part of the interest is that, at any time, your communications could be intercepted. This would be handled by the GM (me) but isn't possible if I don't have access to chat logs to simulate this. Of course I could simply use honour rules but... that never works.  

The other option would be forcing all communication to be done through the GM- but this would become unwieldy for larger games and the delay between messages would be terrible for playability.  

Another issue is that the game has essentially no cap to size. I designed the game around 30-50 players but can imagine larger numbers improving gameplay substantially. This would turn the GM's job from a hobby to a full-time job.

The easiest way out I can see is to have a dedicated client where players can chat, input moves, battles can be calculated automatically, and all that jazz.  All chat messages can be copied into the GM's inbox so that they can process them but still letting players chat freely. This would vastly improve the flow of the game and decrease the workload on the GM exponentially.     

I can expand more if you have any questions, and thanks for taking the time.

I realize that most of the recruiters here aren't located in Poland, but I'm a third year comp sci student and if anyone can help me get my internship form signed and has an interesting project to work on then I'd be glad to work with you. I don't care about payment and I have a lot of spare time.

I mostly work with FlashPunk, but I've also worked with Flixel, Box2D, and AS3 without an external framework to a lesser extent. I do everything in FlashDevelop making use of classes and OOP. Other than AS3 I also love to code in C# - it's much better than AS3, imo :D

[CavernDash](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/CavernDash-AKLOS.swf) - a clone of the classic BoulderDash games.

[Stickman Card Battle](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/StickmanCardBattle.swf) - a strategic ""card game"" where the player fights against an AI by using cards from a hand of 5 randomly picked cards.

[EatTheFlies](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/EatTheFlies.swf) - this is a simple tug-o-war game idea I had. Click on the screen to ""eat flies"" before the hunger bar reaches zero and click on the frog to buy upgrades.

[BoomChime](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoomChime.swf) - a chain reaction game based on ""BoomShine"".

[BoundGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoundGameFinal.swf) - a top down game where the player must get to the end of what is essentially an obstacle course. Press SPACE to jump, WASD/Arrow keys to move.

[BreakinBalls](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BreakinBalls-AKLOS.swf) - a physics game where the player tries to launch a ball into other balls and break enough of them to pass a level. I used Box2D for the physics in this, as my own physics code wasn't good enough. Mouse controls.

[LDGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/LDGame.swf) - this was going to be my submission for the last Ludum Dare competition. Mouse controls, click to shoot.

If you want to see the source code for any of the prototypes, I'd be glad to send you it. All of the (bad and temporary) art is mine as well, so I have some basic skills with vector and pixel art.

I developed a very simple Choose your Own Adventure engine for Android (**I'll be developing more, but the core engine is ready for release**) and I've already started the storyline for the first ""novel"" which will be a zombie apocalypse based game (do something easy first and get it out the door right?).

Here is an excerpt from the demo:

&gt; The zombie is extremely slow, and looks to have been elderly. You aren’t sure if the smell is coming from the decomposing corpse or the horrible refuse that you spy in the bathroom. Regardless, you need to deal with this. You grab a metal stand that was used to hold IV bags and smash it into the zombie’s head. The pole is cheap and bends instead of doing any real damage.

&gt; The zombie tries to grab you, one hand still clutching the bedpan which drips an awful unidentifiable substance on the floor. But it’s a solid metal bedpan. Holding your breath you wrench the bedpan from the undead grip and bash it in the head. The liquid in the pan goes everywhere, making you retch. Luckily the bedpan is solid and the hit caved the zombie’s skull in.

&gt; Your clothes are also covered in some foul smelling gore and you trade them out for some fresh scrubs, minus the vomit inducing liquid. You leave the room, and the bedpan behind. That is one weapon you just can’t bring yourself to use, it’s no use fighting zombies if you’re going to throw up every time you swing your weapon. On your way out, you find a metal cart and spend some time disassembling it to get a solid metal piece, about the length of a baseball bat. It’s heavy, but it will do the trick.

I need someone to develop artwork for this project that is zombie oriented. The biggest and highest priority thing I need at the moment is an icon for the game, but after that more artwork could be added onto the pages.

In terms of work and payment, I could use a front page (like a novel cover) after that and a few pictures for pages. If you have the skill, some sprucing up the UI wouldn't be bad either. The demo will be released free with no ads.

After that, I'll be releasing a ""light"" version which includes ads. After that a full version will be pay only for $1.99.

Proposed (negotiable) profit share:

 * 10% - Icon design
 * 30% - Icon design and cover page
 * 40-55% - Icon/cover/artwork pages (40% for at least 5, 55% for 20)
 * 70% - Icon/cover/artwork (full/20)/UI design

I'm dead poor right now obviously, but if the game makes money, I would like to propose a buyout option depending on the work (I pay you a lump sum in order to lower/remove percentages). Obviously completely negotiable, or not at all if you don't like the idea.

Please have a link to some of your work! Thanks!

I'm the only American in the vid so I'm easy to spot. 

Here are some recent examples of stuff I've been working on:

We're looking for a graphics artist to do a small subset of pixel art for our game. We use a new and innovative room-based approach to map design. Our rooms are small biome-based areas, such as forests, plains and deserts, where gameplay takes place. They are designed to be sparsely decorated with a small palette of ""set dressing"" so to speak - a forest might have a few trees and rocks, a swamp may have tall swamp grass, and a desert may have a cactus or two.

[Prototype screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/I6xQM.png)

[""Set dressing""](http://www.squidi.net/three/set07/img/entry121-abstract2.png) (the trees and rocks displayed)

---

We want you to develop our set dressing.

Our graphics are **black-border** tile-based graphics that are created at 1/2 scale (on 16x16 to 48x48 canvas) and scaled by 200% to give a more retro feel. We use fairly bright colors tending toward primary colors and less of pastels.

We're looking for sprites for each of the following regions:

* Plains - small rock, small tall grass, small hole in ground
* Forest - large tree (x2 varieties)
* Swamp - small swamp grass, medium pool of swampy stuff
* Wetlands - large pool of swampy stuff
* Water - small shoals
* Desert - medium cactus, small hole in ground
* Dirt - small ""well worn"" dirt patch
* Lava - small dried lava formation
* Volcano - small lava pool, medium lava pool with ""bubble""
* Jungle - small jungle plants (x3 varities)
* Barrens - medium tall rock formation (x2 varities)
* Caves - small stalagmite (x2 varities)
* Mountain - medium cave in mountain
* Ice - small chunky ice formation
* Snow - small mogul, large snowy tree
* Arcane - small floating orb, small energy effects
* Blight - small corrupted rock, large corrupted tree

* 19 small (16x16)
* 6 medium (32x32)
* 5 large (48x48)

---

We have more details as necessary and I'm definitely open to chatting and even changing the concepts if any particular items prove challenging. The goal of this post is to have a nicely bounded project for an artist to work on and turn around in a couple weeks time, without any scope creep or a bunch of redraws on particular graphics. There is also an opportunity for follow-on work if you like the job, as we're still looking for a dedicated artist.

It will consist of 2 playable  characters, and a monster to fight. The  prototype is being made in Unity Engine.



We are looking for an Animator to produce various animations for our 2 characters and monster, which will all be placeholder models for now. The characters will be given a modest amount of moves, so don't worry about being bombarded with outrageous moves to animate for us.

3D Artists are also welcome to model and texture our 2 characters in full 3D, as Turnarounds (Character sheets) have already been drawn by my 2D Artist, so any Artist willing to join can start modelling right away. However, our main focus is searching for an Animator.



I  am working as game designer and project leader for this prototype. My  friend is an expert at Unity and is taking care of the programming,  another friend is a very talented 2D character artist and is acting as  my lead character designer and artist. She is the who provided the  turnarounds as well. We also have 2 other programmers working on camera adjustment and the actual fighting input system.

* If a position isn't listed, please still send your resume our way as there may be additional opportunities (**HR@vespyrgames.com**). Will be checking comments and PMs.
* Work can be done remotely and doesn't require moving to a different state or country.

**Our Team:**   
The majority of our team members have AAA project experience (or at least prior game development experience) working for companies such as Obsidian Entertainment, Threewave, Sony Online Entertainment (Planetside 2) and Piranha Games. Our core sound composer was nominated for a BAFTA for his work on Thomas Was Alone for Mike Bithell. 
  
**Vespyr Games:**   
Vespyr Games was founded in January of 2013 with the mission of creating unique, innovative, and above all  else, fun video games. Our company is based in Florida, and our core focus is developing affordable video game titles on PC/XBLA, although we also intend to pursue the mobile market (iOS and Android). The company was founded by veterans of the video game industry with experience developing for PC, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and the mobile market of Android and iPhone/iPad. While we will primarily be developing and publishing our own titles, we are open to external publishing opportunities.

Our goal is to make high quality games for audiences of all ages. Down the road, we will also be interested in collaborating with other developers on projects, and publishing third party titles.

    
**Myself (Michael):**   
I've worked on four video game titles. The first release was for PC with a small game developer, and second was with Obsidian Entertainment on Alpha Protocol (PS3, Xbox 360, PC). I also worked on two iPhone games. The last 2 years I have been a Lead Coach at Microsoft for the Xbox 360. I have a Bachelors in GSP (Game and Simulation Programming) from DeVry University, and I also spent two years studying Entrepreneurship. 

Production is my love. Most people are surprised to hear this, because few take the position on by choice.  But the truth is, I love the supervisory side of things: scheduling, handling documents, relaying communications, and most importantly, making sure the team has access all the tools they need to succeed. I also enjoy working with the Microsoft suite (Project, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, SharePoint, etc.) and anything technology or game related, so the job is a pretty good fit.

These would include level backgrounds, character spritesheets, etc. and of course I encourage an open dialogue where we can discuss the art direction and even overall game direction, so it's not just a ""hey I need you to draw X with Y colors and Z expression, no I don't like the door, show me another..."" kind of deal.

The August game--the one we'd be starting with--is a somber/serious one that aims for a cinematic experience. The theme word for this month is ""PHILOSOPHY"" and we'll be exploring a few concepts about human nature and whatnot (don't want to give away the ending!).

The game will be receiving a Kickstarter treatment as well as a Steam Greenlight submission once these positions are filled. The game will be Rev-Share, anyone involved will receive a percentage of the profits. 

The game is a homage to System Shock 2 and Thief, as well as newer ones such as Bioshock, Dishonored and Amnesia: The Dark Descent, to name a few.

Dynamically the game will work something like a combination of the aforementioned games in this post; the game involves the use of stealth, a gameplay element that will be of great importance in your survival. The world takes place, for the majority of the game, in a forest based on the real-life Aokigahara, a forest underneath Mt. Fuji, famous for suicide. The challenge is presented in the player's ability to avoid situations that will affect their character's sanity level, which will diminish in varying ways depending on interactions with the environment and enemies.

The player will proceed through the game recovering articles and more alluding to his eventual discovery of the reasons which have brought him to this place, and ultimately confront his greatest fears.

I am offering my services to anyone who is interested.  I am a quality game designer.  
I offer assistant game design services to anyone who has a crew that makes games.  

My credentials:
I've designed games my entire life. I've also logged over 10,000 hours of programming in C/C++, Basic, and AS3(Flash).  I've played video games since 1980, and they have been my major point of interest since then.  I treated them as if one day they'd become a professional sport since I was a very young age.  So I was among the best in the world for Starcraft/Diablo 2 hardcore/Warcraft 3 because I at one point held a #1 on each ladder.  

I coded and assist game designed Dungeon Run:http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/dungeon-run.jsp

I coded a puzzle game: http://goodnewsjim.com/DiamondDrop/HowToPlay.html

I coded a way to play pencil and paper RPGs: http://www.abcrpg.com/

I was working on MMORPGS solo since 1992.

I'm working on an episodic MMORPG now with Dungeon Run's engine as programmer/designer called Throne And Crown.

I'm also working a 3d game called Crystal Fighter which is going to be like Tekken meets League of Legends: The old webpage for when I was making it a MMORPG is here: http://www.goodnewsjim.com/js2/work/roaming.html

I am currently programming two projects, but I still have a great deal of time to spare to further apply my skills.

I have a game design blog where I talk about things on my mind at: www.crystalfighter.com

The reason why I am doing this:

*I'm looking to help other teams solidify their game.  

*My coding background helps me know what is easily implementable.  

*My game design background knows what is fun in previous games I've played, how they could be expanded, and what new stuff could be added.  

*I can help guide the development of your game.  

*I can tell you new features to add, or I could tell you what features you could nix if they're not needed.  

*I am somewhat creative, so I can add new content in the flavor of your style.  

*I choose to be an assistant game designer as to help you form your idea and develop the game you envisioned.  

*I will have more titles worked on.

*Complex game design is easy for me, but seeing projects through in code/art is the time limiter.  I can design many games at the same time.   But I can only code one serious project at a time.

So my offer is to become an assistant game designer for a fair negotiated rate.  I'm down for % of revenue of a finished product, or hourly for a crew who has funding already.  I can help you expand your features or avoid classic pitfall blunders in development.  Not only will I give suggestions, but I can architect up how to program them as well.

Please feel free to discuss what you feel is suitable, but we would prefer individuals that would benefit from our current payment model.

**Future possibilities:**

We value skilled and friendly individuals and, depending on the success of the project, would like to take them onto a more serious long-term position with us. 

If you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer them:

I'm part of a two person team working on a stealth side scroller called ""Cat Burglar"". The game follows a petty thief in ancient Arabia discover a terrible plot while performing missions in which she steals cats. It's going to be a fun game full of cat puns, action, and mystery. 

Gameplay is similar to that of ""Art of Theft"" and ""Mark of the Ninja"". Currently it's just myself working on design, writing, and music, as well as another guy doing the programming and art; we would like to bring on an additional artist to help progress.

If you have any questions (I'm sure I forgot something), would like to play what we have so far, or would like to read the GDD, send me a PM.

Thanks!

Edit: Currently not a paid project, but you as an artist would be entitled to 33% of any revenue the project creates. There is a tentative plan for a small kickstarter.

Edit2: Regarding your contribution to the project, you will need to be able to create the player character, traps, supernatural enemies (mostly things like ghosts or zombies.) and tilesets for the levels. Our programmer has been making the art so far and will try to assist you if possible. Don't worry about needing to adapt to his style of art, we plan to replace the current art work with someone new.

I'm a programmer, and I'm currently making the final project for a course in video game design.  
Here is the mid-term game I made with a partner in class: http://www.materialpoetics.com/Hatchlinks/Hatchlinks.html  
This is a 10 weeks work.

Through some unfortunate circumstances, I was left without team-mates to develop a game. I initially was supposed to work with two people, but their project was too ambitious for the time constraint for my taste, so I left. By that time, there was nobody left without a team.

I have a concept, which I have already submitted in class. Here is the concept document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dYxyaOA29La61B3TjoGl5t8oPZ-nTDHIrS-TQIkwkCA/edit?usp=sharing  
The document contains a link to a first prototype.
It also contains a link to some pixel art I made, of course, this can be thrown out the window.

There are two ways we can work together.  
1. If you want to develop the game as 50-50 partners. We share game design decisions, and you'll have influence in the entire development process. I'll need some kind of commitment, because I'm on a time schedule for class.  
2. I can pay you. I'm not sure how much I can pay, so we'll have to discuss it. I'd prefer if you'll also do the art direction, and not just produce art according to my specification.

Bonus points if you're female, or know how to target women with your art, as I'd like the art to appeal to everyone graphically.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1374164826.0,,,True,t3_1ikfcu,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1ikfcu/programmer_lfartist_to_work_together_on_a_game/,

Most of my recent work has been in for iOS in Obj-C using Cocos2D for 2D games, but for the past couple of years I've been mainly prototyping in Unity3D using C#, which is probably what I will use for any future releases for its cross-platform capabilities.

I am looking for a 2D or 3D (preferred) artist who wants to partner up with a developer to work on their own ideas and not be grinding on client projects or their current job with nothing to show for it at the end of the day. 

There is some money to play with for certain things, but for the most part we are both contributing our time to build something together. I'm looking at short dev cycles (3-4 months tops) with time allowed for game design.

You must install the game on Facebook and game servers.

Create a database for the game.

Wanted to let you guys know I'm having a huge Summer Sale. 20% off ALL music libraries! If you've been looking for professional video game music now's a good time to pick up a library or 2 for you future games. Also, check below about custom music.

A few libraries I'd like to highlight:
KINGDOM OF LIGHT BASIC/STAND/PREMIUM EDITION: This is a huge library of cinematic quality  music for RPG / adventure type games. Definitely check this out if you're needing high quality orchestra music. I think it's an amazing deal for the amount of music, quality, for the price - Up to 192 minutes in the Premium edition.

KINGDOM OF LIGHT MODULES: Music of the KoL in modules for those needing just tavern music, battles, mystical, tavel music, etc..packages instead of 192 minutes of all orchestra music.

KINGDOM OF LIGHT - COMBAT:  A module of close combat (skirmished) and Epic Battles. Loops included for prolonged fights.

KINGDOM OF LIGHT - Dungeons &amp; Caves: A popular KoL module that brings the same cinematic quality like the rest of the KoL libraries for your dungeons, caves, or other dark places.

TITAN SCI-FI: The music from this is one of my best selling products. It brings new material and combines the music libraries Atmospheric Sound Design, ASD v2  and ASD Sci-Fi for a discount, plus another discount with the sale. Cool engine sounds, celestial bodies and great sounding drones and ambient tracks.

CUSTOM MUSIC: I should be available for custom tracks soon for those needing something specific for your games. Starting prices for basic custom cues start @ $50 per minute. However, I try to work with indie game/film producers to match there budget if possible. Shoot me an email for questions.

I spent a fair bit of the last decade working on a physics puzzle game that never made it past beta due to poor execution. Having learned many lessons, I'm looking to reboot it as a cross-platform game for release in 2014. Though I'm still inspired by the original idea of building sets and watching dominoes fall, I have no vision for its design and implementation as a puzzle game or even a sandbox game that would really appeal to gamers...but I can program just about anything I put my mind to given enough time.

I'm open to doing this one of two ways:

 * Working with an already-established development team that is looking to adopt a project. IP sharing and compensation would be negotiated.
 * Working with a designer on an hourly basis to refine the design document, and on a per-level basis to create level designs. Hourly and per-level compensation would be negotiated.

*Applicants must have at least one released game in their portfolios.*

If you feel inspired by this project and you'd like to take some of your free time to help me with it in return for compensation, drop me a line!

Most importantly, you must be able to relentlessly tune the game, day in and day out, for fun, monetization, sustainability, and scalability.

**Requirements:**

* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in game design.
* 2+ years in the industry.
* A formal understanding of video game design concepts and their application.
* Basic understanding of calculus.
* Fluent with spreadsheets.

(Not casual, not for kids, not for moms.)

Our team already has one artist who will be collaborating with you and sharing the workload. You would join us in producing backgrounds and scenes with small 2- to 4-frame animation loops here and there. We have been in development for a while now and the art assets are what's keeping this project from completion, so we're keen on picking someone up fairly quickly.

If you have played or know anything about Shadowgate (NES) and Deja Vu (NES) this would help your understanding of the project a great deal. Bonus if you have a fondness for the NES/SNES era and aren't afraid of breaking genre definitions or stereotypes.

**Must be in greater Seattle area only** as we are all local to downtown Seattle and you must be available to meet in person on a regular ongoing basis -- we work as a team, we make decisions as a team.

This game is the first of a series of ongoing game projects, and we all as a group would like to turn this into a full-time job for everyone involved. However, *no one* on this project is being paid -- this will change with subsequent games!

Serious interest appreciated: we love what we do, work hard &amp; move quickly. We critique and re-evaluate every step of the way and prefer quality over quantity. Everyone on this team wants to get better at what they do and we're all helping each other accomplish that.

I am seeking a texture artist to join a team currently consisting of 5, for an Adventure Stealth game. If you only texture, that is perfectly fine, however if you do have other modelling skills, that is a great benefit.

So, lets get right to it, what is the game about? Well, it's a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda, where the player must navigate through an environment to reach the end goal. They must avoid guards, and use the environment to their advantage to get through the world. One catch however, is that the character is blind! In a twist of fate, the character is blinded by magic, but the same magic has given them an extra ability, the ability to see where sound touches. They player is able to navigate the world by listening to sound sources bouncing off of surfaces, giving them a unique ability when looting the world and avoiding danger on their adventure.

We have a [very early demo](http://digitalraingames.com/), this was built around 2 months ago after a month and a half of work.

Our target platform is PC, with the possibility of expanding to consoles at a later date.

**Requirements and responsibilities on the team**  
If you join us, be prepared to work hard, and have fun! All of us currently work full time in game studios, and then come home and work until we go to bed. The team is dedicated to seeing this project develop, and we expect the same in return for the person who joins us.

*here's some ways we can work together*


-------------------------------------------------------------
**If you have a set budget**

If you are father along in development email me a complete asset list and budget, then email me both and we can figure out how to work it out. It is also helpfull to send me screenshots from other games whos styles you would like the art to be inspired by.

I don't currently do rev-share with companies who don't already have a incoming revenue.

**If you have an don't have asset list or don't know how much to charge**

If you have never worked with a pixel artist, then the best thing to do would be to just give me as much info as you have, a video or prototype. Enough info that i know what your vision is.

It's super helpful to know your budget too. I try to spend enough time on your project that i work an hour for each 15$ you send over. So if you send 50$, 500$ or 5000$ i'll make sure it's worth your money. And, I have on occasion finished under budget (usually i just make additional assets). 

But no matter your budget or project size, feel free to email me, even if just for advice

**If you are still in the 'prototyping phase'**

I've done 80$ prototyping deals with great effect for this community. I've done 4 so far. Basically, i'll make a psudeo-""screen shot"" of your  game, which has GUI elements, a player character and some background elements. This picture can be posted online to help convey your ideas, or cannibalized to have a little more professional graphics while you program your game.

We can make a great game together.

Does that interest you?",3,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1fxss2/lfa_programmer_unity_c_for_partnership_on_an/,"Hi,

I have a game that I've been working on for over a year now, in my spare time. I have hired a programmer to do some coding and done the rest myself. The game is a mountain biking game / simulator. It's at a prototype stage, with a working bike and rider,  but needs more help to make it really work right.

This is where you come in!

I'm at the point where I'm realizing that I really should be collaborating with someone else on this, and not just trying to do it alone. So, I'm looking for a **partner** who's interested in the type of game I'm trying to make and has the spare time to work on it. We would be working out some sort of dual ownership type arrangement.

So, I mentioned the game is about mountain biking, and thus is **ALL** about getting the bike to work properly. I have a bike in game with working front and rear animated suspension, and an animated rider. But, it's not good enough yet, and needs some TLC. 

**That in mind, here's what I feel the ideal person would be / have:**

* Experience in Unity. Or just starting out, with a desire to really get in to it and learn fast.
* Experience in programming, specifically javascript and C#. The current bike scripts are in C#. 
* Desire or experience in 2 wheeled vehicle physics. I'm trying to create the best mounting biking simulation available. Does that interest you?
* On the West Coast, USA (I'm in Oregon), or as close to the West Coast as possible, is ideal. 
* Wants to have fun, chat, play Q3 Live or other games once in a while. This should all be about fun! No deadlines or stress involved. 
* Bonus: You are a mountain biker! 

**About me:**

* I'm a mountain biker and amateur (very amateur) game developer. 
* I can low poly model (3ds max) and texture characters and in game assets. 
* I'm a web designer and can do all kinds of 2d design. (Gui Logos etc..)
* Fairly new to Unity , but comfortable with core concepts etc. I used to create Half Life levels back in the day.

Please respond addressing the above points, and include sample of work if you have it. I know, I can't demand much in this position, but I feel like the right person is out there somewhere. Skilled in programming and Unity, and wants to get their first or second game under their belt. Maybe someone currently in school for game dev, or just fresh out?

There is a good demand for this type of game. I hope to get a solid alpha running and then do a Kickstarter, which would provide funding for both of us.

I have a temporary site up. You can learn more about the game, here: http://www.singletrackflow.com/ And facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Singletrack-Flow/429234053826662 Couple screenshots on there...

1370200144.0,3,self.gameDevClassifieds,1fj6zf,[P]rogrammer looking to join or create team,3,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1fj6zf/programmer_looking_to_join_or_create_team/,"I'm looking for a weekend project. I'm serious about making a good game, but I *am* full-time employed and don't intend on leaving unless you are some miracle team that can afford to pay me reasonably well.

I'm located in Vancouver, Canada. A local team would be preferable, but I'm used to remote work, so that's fine too.

I'm a web app developer that has done game dev as a hobby for years. I'm very deep-rooted in the web app dev community, with core contributions to Node.JS and MRuby. I also hope to contribute to Polycode (Like Unity, but better for 2D), including adding MRuby as a supported language. And I contributed a bit to the Moai engine, but it's kind of a mess. :(

**My game dev experience**

I've worked with a wide variety of languages and libraries including; Visual Basic, C, C#, C++, Java, Objective-C, SDL, DirectX, OpenGL, XNA, OpenAL, fmod, Lua, Squirrel, Javascript, and MRuby. I've also worked with several engines including; Moai, Cocos2D, Polycode, Torque2D, Corona SDK and an HTML5-based canvas rendering engine of my own creation called [Peint](https://github.com/Qard/Peint).

I got started in programming by making a 2D online RPG with Visual Basic and DirectX about 10 years ago while in high school. The graphics were ripped from various SNES games. It was effectively a gamified chatroom for my friends and I, though it had the full spectrum of RPG mechanics.

I also made some Gameboy Advance demo games. One was a short mario clone and mainly a 2d physics experiment. The other was a mini RPG, which was mainly an experiment in script triggers. GBA dev was interesting, as there was no graphics or audio libraries; everything was done by writing bits directly to specific memory locations.

After that, I decided to try working on an actual team and started working on a top-down shooter with XNA. Sadly, the artist flaked out upon entering university and the game was never released. I released the source of the Tiled Map parser for it though, and it's been used in most tile-based XNA games since.

I worked on an engine several years ago called [JSGame](https://github.com/Qard/jsgame), that exposed the full OpenGL and OpenAL APIs to the V8 Javascript VM. This was about the same time Node.JS was just emerging, so my focus ended up moving to that.

About a year and a half ago I joined a mobile games company. I created the Peint rendering engine for HTML5 and canvas while working for them. I didn't really enjoy the games I was building though. I wanted time to work on stuff I actually *wanted* to create, so I left not too long ago and now work on Node.JS.

I have complete confidence in my coding abilities, but not so much in my design abilities. I've historically just made lots of engines and tech demos with bad programmer art or art ripped from other games.

**Samples**

I don't have too much to show as most of the more interesting stuff I've done was years ago, but I can show the stuff I made at the mobile games company I worked at recently. Both games were built with a custom framework I built layered over the Moai engine and backed by lua ports of underscore and backbone I made.

**What I'm looking for**

- Not interested in web. I do Javascript all day at work, I want something different.
- I want to work on 2D stuff; ideally using the Polycode engine.
- Story and style are important. I want to make something unique.
- Don't really want to do core engine stuff. Would prefer rapid prototyping to toiling with engine innards.",,False,self,t5_2sg66,1370203332.0,,,True,t3_1fj6zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1fj6zf/programmer_looking_to_join_or_create_team/,
