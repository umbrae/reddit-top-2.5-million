Wanted to give you all a heads up about this.  This Monday, April 1st, is of course April Fools Day.  Sometimes news websites will post fake stories to commemorate the holiday, many of which many of which involve really strange things (for example, in 1996 it was reported that Taco Bell had bought the Liberty Bell for advertising or Burger King announcing in 2008 that they were making a Whopper for people that were left handed).  While submissions will still be open on Monday, we ask you all to please use discretion while posting, and be careful of those false stories.
