I'm the Senior Community Manager for Star Wars: The Old Republic, based at BioWare in Austin. I manage the entire Community team, working on everything from Forums to social media, fansites to guild outreach, events to website content.

A few caveats:

- I'm not in charge of any design decisions on the game - if you are looking to get something changed, ask nicely on the official Forums :)

- I'm not aware of every single bug in the game, or the status of their resolution - although I am happy to hear about them

- I am British and likely to use dry humor (but note: I spell things American now)

- I am going into a meeting titled "" ""THE AWESOME ATTACK OF RAINBOWS AND NARWHALS AND BACON THAT WE'RE GOING TO HIT THE BLOG WITH"" right now, so I'll be 30 minutes or more late before I start answering stuff...

That said... go for it.

**6:33PM CST:** That's it for me folks, I'm out. Tried to answer as many things as I can. If I didn't answer a question likelihood is because it was too specific to current developer thinking or future potential thinking - apologies for that.

I may ninja in the odd reply going forward, and if you enjoyed this (despite me...) then let us know and perhaps we'll do similar with other development team members. :)

**10:23PM CST:** Alright I'm *really* done this time. We will do this again in some form, possibly with other BioWare folk, I promise! :)",,False,self,t5_2qxih,True,,,True,t3_nty9d,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/nty9d/im_stephen_reid_senior_community_manager_for_star/,

Please feel free to add more tips/tricks in the comments and I will add it in.)

**General Tips**

* Not sure which crew skills go together or which one you want to pick? Refer to this chart, http://i.imgur.com/aZdbv.jpg

* Press Control + U twice to reload your user interface to fix common UI issues.

* Press Control + Shift + F to view your frames per second (displays in bottom left corner). Green indicates GPU, red is CPU.

* Right clicking a mob will fire off whatever ability is in your 1 slot.

* Always log out in a Catina, your ship, or the Fleet for rested experience bonus.

* If you don't like your conversation gains (light/dark or companion affection), press escape to do the conversation over again.

* When you first walk into the Fleet to pickup your crew skills, talk to every trainer. You'll get half a level just from Codex entries alone.

* To leave a Flash Point after completing it, click ""Exit Area"" above the minimap.

* If you want to gain levels fast, do your daily Space Combat, Emerging Conflicts (Flash Point PvE Daily), and daily PvP missions.

* To visibly see your alignment (light/dark) gains without hovering over the choices, enable ""Show Conversation Alignment Gain"" in the options.

* To enable looting in an area, enable it under the controls, ""Enable Area Loot"".

* You have an Emergency Fleet Pass with an 18 hour cooldown you can use, press P, and find it under the general tab.  In addition, downloading the **free** mobile authenticator gives you access to cheap Fleet Passes that have only a one hour cooldown.

* You don't have to keep crafting materials on you, you can put them in storage and still use them to craft.

* When leveling your crafting skill, dont sell your extras. Reverse engineer them to make better ones and get some of your materials back, making it easier to level your crew skills.

* When you get around level 20, start saving up for 48,000 credits for your mount/ mount training (at level 25), don't blow it all on crew skills.

* Type /stuck if you get stuck anywhere.  Also works great for raiding, if you decide you want to start the encounter over again, everyone can type /stuck and it'll instantly kill you.  Much faster than waiting for everyone to slowly die.

* Once you get your Advanced Class, remember to look at both skill tabs at the skill trainer. One is for your default class (Sith Inquisitor, Jedi Knight for example), the other is for your Advanced Class (Sith Assassin, Jedi Guardian for example).

* If you don't like the crafting missions that are offered to you, zone and they will change (board your ship for example). This is particularly helpful for leveling Diplomacy if you don't want to take any light/dark points.

* Gaining companionship means your crew skills go faster for that said person.

**PvE Tips**

* If your companion is very low on life after battle, you can dismiss/resummon him with full health. You can also mount and dismount quickly and they'll return with full life. This is much faster than resting if your life is still full after battle and your companion’s is not.

* Similar to the previous one, if your companion dies. Dismiss/resummon him, or mount/dismount and he'll return with full life (as opposed to partial life when manually rezzing him)

* If you're having trouble with a class boss, take advantage of your 20 minute companion cooldown (Channel the Force for example). Use the ability listed on your 20 minute cooldown, then once it fades, use your 20 minute companion cooldown ability and pop the same ability again. Inquisitor example: electrocute (four second stun), once electrocute fades, use Channel the Force and place Electrocute on the target again. That's 8 seconds the mob is stunned and you take no damage.

* Using a Companion Health Pack will rez him during combat.

* Press the space bar in Space Combat to do a barrel roll, helps avoid taking unnecessary damage.

**PvP Tips**

* The PvP vendor offers amazing gear at level 20 and level 40 for very low cost that is better than anything else available at your level (typically).

* In the Huttball warzone, knocking people into the poison pit or fire grates and then stunning them is a very efficient way to kill someone and/or reset the ball. Also knocking huttball carriers off the bridges and onto the bottom level of the Warzone is a tremendous way to help your team.

* In Huttball, Inquisitors/Consulars can sprint across the pit at the beginning of the match to grab the ball faster than any other class. Be careful using this tactic though, you'll get pounced on hard.

* In the Civil War warzone, make sure you always cap the node to your left first (great for Inquisitors/Consulars with the force speed buff). It is near impossible for the opposing faction to get there before you can cap it. Easy way to give your team a node right off the bat.

* In the Void Star warzone, after the first set of doors has been blown down and the attackers must cross the bridge to advance to the second set of doors, it is very easy to throw players off the bridge using abilities that knockback (Overload for example).

I was obviously a little under-levelled, because using using every medpack, stim, and debuff I had I could only get him down to about 20%. I died twice; after the second respawn, a level 44 player ran in, grabbed him, and wiped him out. Sent him a quick msg asking if he'd mind sticking around to help me out. He did, waited around for three or four boring minutes (doing nothing) and I got another 22k xp from being able to kill the mob and turn in the bonus quest.

Last night, I got to another elite mob just as a 44 operative was killing him. The mob died, he looted, and then vanished away. I sat there for another three or four minutes; got up and went to get a drink, and when I came back the mob had spawned. I attacked him, and immediately after I took aggro, the Operative jumped in and helped me wipe him out. I didn't ask, he didn't offer. He just stuck around because he knew it would be a tough fight, and because he was a nice guy.

Meanwhile, on Hoth, a guild mate was speedering along when he noticed a lower-level player fighting a tough mob - whose health wasn't decreasing at all. He jumped off his speeder, killed the mob, and saved the player.

It's people like these who make this game fun to play, who instil a sense of community and camaraderie to what would normally be a fun but solitary game. It's easy for SWTOR to feel like a single-player game you're playing near others, or a co-op game where you do your thing while other people do theirs. These sorts of interactions and assistance make it feel like we're all in this together, which is kind of the point.

We have to let them know we won't tolerate this!"" So then quit the game. Speak with your wallet.

We missed out on a great opportunity to learn about the history of the game. We could have found out about some hilarious bugs from the start, where things have changed, things they've tried and didn't work and all sorts of things like what it is like to work at Bioware and the specifics of his job.

I know this won't be the popular opinion but there's gotta be other people out there who are ashamed at how many questions were repeated over and over about the same bugs and same requested features that have been on the forums since the start.

EDIT: I'd also like to add, as discussed below, that there really wasn't anything FOR Stephen Reid to say. What could he say? The game just game out. It would have been better to either just wait when he could talk about something, or get someone like Georg Zoeller or Daniel Erickson who could talk about their future visions of the game.

If in a year or two or three+ this game is still popular - and hopefully it is - this will be something very cool to have on your account. 

The game has problems, yes. BioWare perhaps is not implementing solutions as fast as we would like, yes. However, I have faith that broken things will be fixed and I will continue to support them for the time being in hopes that my $15 will do its part to help in the development of what could be an awesome game for years to come (hell, I would even pay $30 if they told me it would bring about swoop bike racing faster). 

This title says that you helped to create something; a title that years from now will signify your efforts in the creation of a world. A world where everyone else who came after you owes a slight debt of gratitude to you for your role in the stabilization of this games foundation. 

So here is to all the other founders out there. I raise a glass to you!! Cheers!!

",802,260,304,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o2mzi/there_seems_to_be_a_fair_bit_of_confusion_about/,"I saw some comments on the ""2.5 instead of 8 hour downtime"" posts that indicate an extreme misunderstanding of how game patches work. Basically, stating that they wished the downtime was longer so that more bugs would be fixed. That, and a lot of ""wow, this patch sucks; they didn't fix anything that was important, why waste time on mount emotes?"" 

Just so we're clear:

1) the devs don't spend the downtime actually fixing bugs. It's not like the servers go down, and they have a fucking strike force standing by to tackle all your complaints before the servers come up. The downtime exists to simply apply bugfixes that have passed testing since the last patch. 

2) Not all bugs/issues are created equally. Don't get offended that some bug you deem gamebreaking doesn't get fixed immediately. Minor bugs are often only a few lines of code and some minor testing to fix. Larger bugs might require a shitton of work, going back and rewriting something you thought would never even be looked at again, and extensive testing to make sure you didn't break anything that code was attached to. And fuck, that process might reveal bugs in other segments of the game. 

3) Just because minor bugfixes are making it into the patch doesn't mean that they aren't progressing on major ones. The fact is that a lot of the minor bugs get handed off to junior devs who  can handle them easily enough because they're simple problems that often amount to the programming equivalent of a typo that made it past spellcheck. The big ones have to get looked at by the senior guys, the architects; there's only so much expertise that can go around. Even if they dedicated all of their resources to fixing the biggest bug in the game, it's not going to speed it up if there's only 4 people in the building with the expertise necessary to actually fix it. 

This should be pretty obvious to most people, but I see a fair amount of complaints that come from ignorant and/or entitled people who think that whatever patch just hit is inadequate because Bug X wasn't fixed, and that BioWare owes them because they paid $60 + n*$15, etc. ",,False,self,t5_2qxih,False,,,True,t3_o2mzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o2mzi/there_seems_to_be_a_fair_bit_of_confusion_about/,

New Free-to-Play Option Will Open Up the Critically-Acclaimed MMO from BioWare and LucasArts to Millions of Additional Star Wars™ Fans and Gamers Worldwide

AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BioWare™, a Label of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), announced today that it will be expanding the story-driven, massively multiplayer online game Star Wars™: The Old Republic™ by adding a new Free-to-Play option this fall. This option will give players access to each of the eight iconic Star Wars character class storylines, all the way up to level 50, with certain restrictions*. Unlimited game access, including new higher-level game content and new features, will be made available through individual purchases or through a subscription option.

""Players want flexibility and choice. The subscription-only model presented a major barrier for a lot of people who wanted to become part of The Old Republic™ universe,"" said Matthew Bromberg, GM of BioWare Austin.

Jeff Hickman, Executive Producer of Star Wars: The Old Republic added, ""Since launch, we've been listening to feedback from our fans and adding new content and refining The Old Republic at a breakneck pace. We believe we are in a position to help improve the service even more, not only by continuing to add new content, but also by expanding the game to many more Star Wars fans, increasing the populations on worlds and the vibrancy of the community.""

Starting this fall, there will be two different ways to play Star Wars: The Old Republic:

Subscription — A service designed for players who want unrestricted access to all the game features via ongoing subscription or by redeeming a Game Time Card. In addition to gaining access to all game content as our current subscribers do now, subscribers will receive ongoing monthly grants of Cartel Coins, the new virtual currency that will be introduced later this fall. Cartel Coins can be used to purchase valuable in-game items including customizable gear and convenience features that will enhance the game play experience.
Free-To-Play — The first 50 levels will be Free-to-Play, with restrictions on access to new content and advanced player features. Some restrictions can be ""unlocked"" with Cartel Coins.
As the first step towards adding the new Free-to-Play option this fall, Star Wars: The Old Republic will go on sale in August for $14.99 USD, including one-month of free subscription.

Current and former players will also find additional benefits as part of this program. BioWare will be increasing the frequency of game content updates, with the first of many new releases coming in August. In addition, current subscribers will receive Cartel Coin grants and qualify for access to special in-game items. Even former players who re-activate now will qualify for special benefits. To learn more about these rewards, please visit www.StarWarstheOldRepublic.com/FREE.

Star Wars: The Old Republic is one of the most critically acclaimed MMOs of all time, having won MSNBC's ""Game of the Year"" award in 2011, ""Editor's Choice"" awards from IGN, PC Gamer and ""Best MMO of 2011"" awards from Game Informer, GameSpy, AOL Massively, Ten Ton Hammer and more. The game is set thousands of years before the classic Star Wars movies, with the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire locked in the middle of an epic, galactic war. Players choose one of eight iconic Star Wars character classes, including the Jedi Knight, Jedi Consular, Smuggler, Trooper, Sith Warrior, Sith Inquisitor, Bounty Hunter and Imperial Agent, becoming the hero or villain of their own personal Star Wars saga.

Translation (thanks solembum): ""if you dont have installed the latest version of directx 9.0c additionaly to your DirectX11 it could help to do so. Nothing will be deleted or overwritten dueing this process. Though it can help increase the FPS.""

Theory is that basic directx 9 stuff is being emulated by directx 10/11 if you are missing the dx9 files.

Personally I can confirm vastly improved frame rate, especially in zerg pvp in Ilum where I went from 5-10 fps to 25 fps.

Stephen Reid yesterday:

Today, we invited people who had pre-ordered up to the very beginning of October (roughly). Tomorrow, we're going to be inviting the same number of people again; that will take us up to the last week or so of November. On Friday, we'll be inviting even more, and we'll give you an update on that tomorrow.

You'll see more servers coming online tomorrow, and almost certainly there will be some queuing. That was always expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Reid today (thanks to everyone who posted):

Here's the good news: overnight we decided to send out more invites than we had originally planned. However, we'll be spacing those invites out, which means we'll have more 'waves' than the previous four-per-day. We are inviting more people today than we did during yesterday.

Disclosure: I pre-ordered November 17th

The story, as in all Bioware games, is adictive.

I suspect that when they iron out the gameplay and bugs a bit more, this game will rival WoW during the early days of Wotlk: which wow player doesn't remember the fun of killing Skaadi in Utgarde keep despite having it bug out on you twice? Great fun will be had by all in SWTOR as well. Still, the launch has had its problems. Not all minor ones.

",470,95,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o1lm5/so_you_hit_50_now_what/,"Here's a post I made on my guild forums regarding content at 50. Warning: Most of this is my personal opinion based on experience, so please feel free to correct, criticize or contribute. I'll update this is there's enough interest. 

**EDIT 1:** One thing I want to point out as well is that this was intended to be for someone hitting 50 and wanting to prepare for raiding/Operations. I don't talk about Ops as a gearing method at all, since this is prep for that. 

**EDIT 2:** Added my suggestions on End Game gear progression (in conclusion) and refined some descriptions.


**PvE Gearing**

1. Ilum and Belsavis Dailies - This is probably the most significant source of pre-raid PvE gearing available right now. Well, at least the most consistent. Once you complete your story quest you'll be able to start the Ilum chain. I highly recommend doing this, as well as the Belsavis Bonus Series (at 50). Ilum has about 6 dailies (1 is heroic) and Belsavis has about 6 as well (2 heroics). Between the Daily Commendations you'll get from these, as well as the quest rewards, you should be able to buy an Epic Armoring/Hilt/Barrell, and you'll get an Epic Enhancement, Mod, and Companion Weapon from the quests. That means that doing your Belsavis and Ilum dailies basically gets you a piece of epic gear per day with the rewards. This is a must do for PvE gear. It also gets your companions pretty geared out because of the repeatable quest that gets them a moddable level 50 weapon.

2. Hard Mode Flashpoints - The way these work is that the bosses up to the final boss will drop epic gear, and the final boss will drop a class token. All bosses will also drop Tionese Crystals, which are used in conjunction with other commendations to purchase epic PvE gear from the Tionese vendor on the Fleet. The Hard Mode Flashpoint Effort-to-Reward is kinda fucked right now, but here's a quick suggestion:

   * Black Talon - This is pretty easy, even for fresh 50s. It's basically as quick as doing @ 11.

   * Boarding Party - Semi-long instance with challenging final boss. Poor reward for time invested.

   * The Foundry - Last boss is no longer bugged. 2nd boss is semi-difficult.

   * Directive 7 - Straight-forward and alot of trash you can skip. Bulwark will get alot more difficult once you can't interrupt his stuff. 

   * The Battle for Ilum - Not too bad. One tough boss (Krel).

   * The False Emperor - Can skip and creatively eliminate lots of trash (knock them off, etc), and bosses are really easy. 

Here's a great image that was posted here and shows where to get what loot form HMFPs: [LINK](http://i.imgur.com/kZp3I.png)

3. Tokens/Commendations - Similar to the badge system in WoW (or Valor Points), go to your vendor to see what costs what. Tionese Commendations are the lowest (rating 126 gear) and are gotten from completing Hard Mode Flashpoints, and Normal Mode Operations (as well as doing your Daily Hard Mode Flashpoint and Weekly Hard Mode Flashpoint quests). Columi are a level up (for Rating 136 gear) and are from Hard Mode Ops and Nightmare Mode Ops. Use these in combination with Tionese Crystals to purchase set gear. WARNING - Your set bonuses do not show on your gear in the vendor window. Make sure you're picking the correct piece of gear for your spec (based on the name) so you get set bonuses that aren't worthless (e.g. A piece of gear that looks fine for a Sith Assassin DPS spec, actually would have Sith Sorcerer bonuses because it was intended for them...do some research before making the purchase).

4. Flashpoint Dailies/Weeklies - These are straightforward and gotten from the Fleet. Complete 1/day and 3/week to get the max reward. Basically you'll just be doing Black Talon to complete this quest. 

**PvP Gearing**


1. Champion Gear Bags - There are a variety of ways to get these (described below). They will have Centurion Commendations, and randomly they will have a loot token for a specific slot of Champion PvP gear. By doing all of your dailies and weeklies, your potential earning of bags would be 20 per week. (7 for Ilum Daily, 7 for PvP Daily, 3 for Ilum Weekly, 3 for PvP Weekly). Additionally, any purchased bags are icing on the cake.

2. Battlemaster Gear Bag - These are similar to Champion Gear Bags, though they have better stats (Rating 140). You can only get these if you're Valor Level **60** [edit: thanks hooj] from PvP (you can see on your PvP queue screen what your progress is).

3. Currency and Gear Purchase - Champion and Battlemaster bags are purchased with Commendations, like anything else, but they're a bit easier to obtain. The Champion Bag at 50 (Rating 136) is easily purchased with 200 Warzone Commendations and 200 Mercenary Commendations. Merc Comms are primarily gotten through a Warzone Comm conversion (3:1 conversion rate) at the PvP vendor, but can also be gotten on Ilum and Tattooine, by participating in World PvP and getting chests. Basically, for every 800 Warzone Commendations you get, you'll be able to get a chance at a piece of gear from a bag (by converting down some of those to Merc Comms).

4. Battle for Ilum - On the fleet you will get a Daily and a Weekly to contribute to the War Effort on Ilum by taking control points on the western portion of the planet. This is pretty straightforward, but is a bit of a pain in the ass due to the requirement of Republic needing to be there to flip the node. Often times you will go to Ilum and all nodes will be Empire controlled. Best wait this out while you're queuing for your PvP daily/weekly. You need to get 5 control points for the daily and 15 for the weekly. The daily will get you 1 Champion Gear bag, and the weekly will get you 3. Pretty awesome rewards, though random.

5. Daily and Weekly PvP Wins - These two quests are picked up on the Fleet. Win 3 matches a day, and 9 a week. Daily gets you 1 Champion Gear bag, and the weekly gets you 3.

**Crafting**

1. This is self-explanatory, and unfortunately most of the crating recipes blow with the exception of Biochem. Feel free to look into why we're all whining about our craft skills elsewhere.


**Conclusions** 


So as you can see, PvP is the quickest way to gear up in this game at the moment. It's slightly more reliable, and certainly gets your more gear per minute spent. The downside is that the gear is relatively tight on the stats it provides, and you get the Expertise stat on the gear (which is a PvP only stat that increases PvP Helaing, increases dmg/reduces dmg vs. Players). Do your Ilum Control point daily/weekly, and your PvP daily/weekly to max out gear gain here. Only bad thing is that it's random what's in the gear bag, so it's entirely possible to get nothing or an item you already have. 

It's definitely worth doing your Ilum and Belsavis dailies for Tionese Crystals and for the Epic mods/enhancements/Armorings, etc to get yourself in somewhat of a raid-ready state. 

Flashpoint Dailies/Weeklies seem to only be worth doing if you just do Black Talon. Sadly, you can only do this once per day. Hopefully, Bioware will retune/tweak the drops and mechanics for some of the buggier Flashpoints to make it worth doing more than just Black Talon. 

Finally, here's a summary of gear progression from new 50, to end game raider (also subjective and my opinion): 

Late 40s/50 Quest Gear -&gt; Moddable Gear bolstered by Daily Rewards|Tionese Gear -&gt; PvP Champion Bags|Columi Gear (Normal Mode 8man/HMFPs) -&gt; PvP Battlemaster|Rakata Gear

Feel free to add/correct anything I've put in here. I'll edit this as I see more info come in (especially info/opinions on the Flashpoint worthwhileness).

Yes, I could just make sure to have my item window closed while I'm browsing the GTN (assuming I'm not selling anything). But I'm paying $15 a month for this game and I shouldn't need a workaround for something that would require a change in one already defined parameter in a single line of code.

Anyway, that's my annoyed version of the problem description. Anyone else agree? Can we escalate this issue and suggest it to BioWare?

I don't have any doubt that EA was pushing for a finalized date, and with dollar signs in their eyes, pushed even harder for the week prior to Christmas. I can imagine Bioware asking for as much time as possible, with EA settling on the 20th.


There is a reason two of the most successful game developers have a ""When it's done"" approach to release dates. Things come up, things happen. I can guess MANY more people would be upset if come Dec 1st they pushed it back to February.


Yes, it's almost a glorified beta test, but honestly, many of you would have paid 14.99 a month for beta access, especially knowing you could keep your character.


And don't try to say that you shouldn't be charged for the game yet, it still takes a LOT of money to maintain the servers, pay the GM's, and everything else that come from having millions of people on the servers.


So here we are, it came out. Did it come out too early? Yes. Is there any way EA would have let it miss the holidays? I doubt it.


And if you're wondering if they care? Of course they do. [Look here](http://www.swtor.com/patchnotes/1.0.2c/162012). The game has been out 24ish days, and we've had TWELVE patches. These guys are working on it. Many of the problems people are having aren't easily reproducible, which is by far the hardest type of bug to fix because you don't know what is causing the problem. There isn't some magical switch. This doesn't happen:

Customer: ""Hey, I'm having graphical problems. I'm on the exact hardware someone else has and he isn't having them"".
Bioware:""Oh, we're sorry, we had the 'Crap Graphics' tag on your account, it should be fine now.""


It's frustrating to see something with so great be bogged down with so many problems. But I'm sure it's TONS harder for them. It's their baby, you can tell every single person there is pouring their heart and soul into this game. The reason you're not seeing blog posts from developers other than ""We're working on it"" is because they are busy WORKING ON IT instead of writing blog posts.


I know this was a rant, but if at least one person reads this and understands just a little more, well, awesome. I'll leave you with...

&gt;Hammond: ""When they opened Disneyland in 1956 nothing worked."" 

&gt;Ian: ""Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down the pirates don't eat the tourists.""

**Edit:** Additionally the servers aren't up. People will complain about this. They said two, it's been longer. Last night they said eight, and it took two. People complained. If they said ""An indeterminate amount of time"" people would complain. It takes time. They are guessing. You want guesses, they give guesses.

As for me personally, I find this game amazing, incredibly immersive, each of the 8 stories are more involved than ANY single player game out...AND more engaging. They clearly love this game and are working tirelessly to fix it. It will be polished soon. As for me, I'll be here with them on the road there.

**Edit 2:** Some fun observations:
Many people(2nd place post atm) are *complaining*(Irony?) that there really aren't any complainers on here so my words are wasted.
 
Many of the posts are people complaining about the game, in full defiance of the first observation.

Quite a few people have posted something similar to ""What problems? It's been smooth for me""

Others are posting that the game is completely unplayable and clearly must be that way for everyone, and that everyone in their guild basically has a half finished copy of Zork.

A large number of people complain that the game is unfinished and that is unacceptable. Those same people have yet to let me know the date that WoW was finished.

As hard as I would have thought it would be to claim that this launch is a sign of declining quality, in spite of no one ever doing it better, a lot of posts seem to think that way.

A surprising amount of people hate playing this game, and have hated all 20 hours they've put into it, and are going to hate the next week of playing, and hate even having to post here, and hate....

Which server has a good republic faction size? Is my server dead? This may come especially important come March 1st when the oceanic servers are opened up and Bioware may allow some limited server transfer.


That being said, there has being hardly any numerical data on the server population and Imperial/Republic balance. Bioware is unlikely to release this data anytime soon, if ever. I went to 79 PVE/RP servers and created two level 1 characters per server over the span of 3-4 days and recorded the population data for both sides for 79 PVE and RP-PVE servers for 6 planets (Korriban/Tython, Dromond Kaas/Coruscant, Alderaan, Hoth, Voss, Ilum) and the fleet during each server's prime time (6-10 PM EST for east coast servers and 6-10 PM PST for west coast servers)


The data collection method isn't perfect by anyways but it is the best I have got. Hopefully you will find this data handy as well :)

Anyways, here is the link to the results of the study - whole bunch of excel charts: http://dulfy.net/2012/02/24/some-numerical-population-data-for-swtor-servers/

**Some interesting info:**
I estimated around 71646 concurrent players on 79 PVE/RP servers – with 35686 concurrent players on 46 PVE East Coast servers, 24817 concurrent players on 24 PVE-West Coast servers and 11142 concurrent players on 9 RP servers. 


In terms of overall estimated fraction balance – 39395 concurrent Imperial players and  32250 concurrent Republic players, a Imperial/Republic Ratio of 1.22. 

**Note:** If there is enough interest, I can do these for the PVP servers as well. 


**My post on the official swtor forums got deleted without a notice at all, guess bioware doesn't want this data to get out or something**


Here is a youtube video showing you how I gathered the data: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ggt64F19P8

**US PVP server data collection will start next week and will have the 6 previous planets + fleet and the following additional planets/instances: tatooine, the pit, the civil war, voidstar**

Please note: I may come in and clean up the posts as real data starts coming in when early access starts, so please don't be offended if your post is removed for not including **both** pieces of info.

Thanks!!

(Thanks and all credit to [badalchemist](http://www.reddit.com/user/badalchemist) for the suggestion. We will probably keep this in the sidebar until launch.)

Edit: --------PLEASE NOTE---------

While I appreciate the fervor (and the constantly orangered envelope :P), I wasn't looking to have a million people come and just announce when they pre-ordered. It is obvious that many of the posts are placeholders just waiting for their early access to hit, however this was not what my intentions were for this thread. The relevant posts will be too hard to find amid all the people who either won't remember or bother to update their comments (because they'll be having too much fun playing!!! :D).

Therefore, I'm going to be making a new thread sometime late tonight or early tomorrow (will link it here, and re-link the sidebar), where there will be some more strictly enforced rules. *Only those who have gotten into early access* will be allowed to post (a screenshot of some form of proof will be required), and they will list only the two things I asked for up top in this post. Any deviations or posts with a lack of proof will be removed.

General discussion about it can and should take place here, while the other thread will be where we have the real, unencumbered info.

I will repeat these updated, more strict rules in the new post when it is created as well. Thanks for understanding.

Hey, [/r/swtor](/r/swtor). I was reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p7gx7/the_truth_about_vanilla_world_of_warcraft/) in [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) about how MMO players have changed.


I couldn't agree more with it. After reaching 50 in SWTOR I found myself falling back into the old rut of sitting in queues and grinding out daily quests - things that I don't find particularly fulfilling. That is, until last night. I decided to make my own fun.

My friend [Imperial Agent Sniper] and I [Bounty Hunter Powertech] were queuing for Warzones, as per usual, when we hit a bad string of 5 losses in a row. I was about to log out from boredom when I said to my friend: 

* **Me:** *""Hey... X and Y (two friends) are leveling Republic characters now, aren't they?""*
 
* **IA Friend:** *""Yeah. They are around level 40 now, I think.""*
 
* **Me:** *""Good... Log into your Republic character to see if they are on.""*

Sure enough, they were both logged in and leveling on Hoth. We boarded our starships, set course for Hoth and let the manhunt begin.

Now, Hoth is a big planet. Finding two specific characters on it was going to be like finding a funny joke in an episode of Two and a Half Men - which is to say that it will be difficult. We needed intel.

My friend, being the sneaky Agent that he is, joined X and Y's teamspeak channel (while we conversed with each other in a ventrilo server) to eavesdrop on them. I, on the other hand, decided to flex a little muscle to get some information.

In the middle of a path, I spotted a rather unfortunate Jedi on her speederbike. I caught up to her and defeated her in combat. While standing over her body, I said in the /say channel:

* **Me:** *""Go ahead, use your medical probe. I won't attack you again if you cooperate.""*

Her body disappeared, indicating that she used her medical probe. I laid down my Stealth Scan to pull her out of resurrection stealth to make sure she couldn't sneak away. My Agent friend had caught up to me at this point and fixed his rifle on the Jedi.

* **Jedi:** *""Okay, what do you want?""*

* **Me:** *""We're looking for two people: X and Y. Ask around, try to find out where they are. Make no mention of us.""*

* **Jedi:** *""Are you guys RPing?""*

* **Me:** *[uses Quell to pistol whip the Jedi] ""TELL US WHERE THE REBELS ARE.""*

* **Jedi:** *""Fine. Will you stop pointing that [blaster] at me?""*

* **IA Friend:** *""No.""*


Meanwhile, in Teamspeak (as relayed to me from my IA friend in Ventrilo):

* **X:** *This guy in general just said that there are two Imperials looking for us.*

* **Y:** *Who would be after us?*

* **X:** *(Presumably looks at Teamspeak and notices my IA friend sitting in their channel silently [Or the Jedi gave them names]) Oh, shit. It's [IA Friend] and [Me].*

The Jedi had tipped them off. We were displeased with her lack of cooperation and put her out of her misery before we continued our search.

Back at square one, we decided to go for a brute force search, interrogating (and ultimately killing) the various Republic players that we came across to see if they had seen X or Y anywhere. Knowing that they were being listened to, X and Y were careful not to discuss any of their surroundings in too much detail when talking to each other on teamspeak.

This continued for about half an hour until X accidentally mentioned a type of NPC that they needed to kill for a quest. I knew where those NPCs were.

We hurried off to the location in the shipyards. After a bit, we found a trail of dead bodies and followed it. We found X and Y fighting some NPCs on the top level of the large, destroyed ship.

We opened fire on X (a Jedi Guardian). Laughter and the words ""They found us!"" were heard in Teamspeak. Y (a Gunslinger), distracted by us, forgot that he was standing near the very edge of the ship and was knocked off to his death by an NPC that was fighting him. X went down with honor by trying to fight us. Unfortunately for him, he was outgunned (and outleveled).

With our targets eliminated we left Hoth and I called it a night.

Easily the most fun I have had in an MMO in years.

Today was the day I met my new student, and after spending the weekend listening to raids and chatting to awesome people from reddit, I felt prepared, but a bit nervous. This was after all a kid who for the last six months hadn´t talked to _anyone_ except over a computer, hadn´t left the room except for food and toilet for the same amount of time, and had kicked out / ignored the last teacher to enter his domain.. And sure enough, I enter, get a look, and the focus is back on the computer ^-^

But aha! He is pvp´ing! And by the looks of it, he is getting his ass kicked. ""Get out of line of sight!"" I shout, smoothly positioning myself next to him so I can see better. It looks slightly humorous while he runs around a rock, and when he dies I proclaim a masterful ""stupid smugglers!"". 

Now, I´m not entirely sure if it was a smuggler that killed him, but the ice is broken, and as he runs back for revenge he starts telling me about how long he played, why he is on the dark side, and how the server is pvp-wise. 

Seriously! We didn´t shut up! When the pvp was over, he handed in a few quests, logged out, and focused on my tasks. I hadn´t brought much, to keep the first time short and sweet, but when that was done we talked about dogs, games, and made a plan for our next lesson. I managed to fall off my chair at one point, talented as I am, and he almost fell off his laughing :) 

At the end of our lesson, as the gentleman I knew he would be, he walked me to the door (downstairs!) to say goodbye, and promising to be up and ready to go out on our adventure next time. We will visit a new game store that has opened:D


This is a huge step. It could not have gone better in any way shape or form. And the _only_ reason it went that well is because of all you redditors jumping up, offering to help, and helping me out hugely. I could not have managed this without you &lt;3

To all of you: Thank you so so so so much! Words fail me, so if you will pm your addresses I will send you chocolate. My country has seriously good chocolate.

One of the things I always wanted to know while leveling up is if it is worth while to do the heroic 2, and 4s on that planet and if I should bother with the bonus series. Obviously if a heroic quest give me some really nice orange gear, there are more incentives to do it compared to a heroic that give me a random box and some credits.

For this purpose, I went on every leveling planet* on both my Empire (sorc) and Republic (commando) characters and did every heroic quest/bonus series I am aware of and recorded their rewards. For the class specific rewards, I was only able to get the rewards associated with my class (sorc/commmando) but luckily the Torhead comments for alot of the heroic missions are fairly helpful and I was able to get some data for other classes as well. Also, Zoopercat started a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/rhb2t/orange_gear_from_heroic_quests/) about a month ago asking for submissions for orange gear from heroic quests and she shared her collected data with me. 

While the reward data isn't complete, there is something for every quest. So if you know the reward for the classes listed, you have a pretty good idea for the other classes that are not listed (i.e. if a quest give sorcerer orange chest, it is pretty much guaranteed to give say juggernauts orange chest as well). If you are doing the heroics on your characters and noticed a reward for your class is missing, feel free to comment and and I will add to the list :)

Anyways, for every quest there are 

1) Torhead tooltips for the mission so you can see the steps or get more details.

2) Name of the NPC to start the quest (first name recorded only)

3) Location of the NPC (Both the area and the exact coordinates)

4) General and class specific rewards.

1324011961.0,300,self.swtor,net67,Please try to understand how servers work in MMOs,406,106,263,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/net67/please_try_to_understand_how_servers_work_in_mmos/,"It is sad to see all the complaints about how bad Bioware is dealing with the issue of servers being full during peak hours and the ~10-30 minute queues on almost every server.

To all the complainers:

Understand that in two months when the original hype has died down and players who have been playing 8-10 hours a day since they were admitted into early access will go back to their normal lives and play maybe if they're lucky 8-10 hours a week?  How about the players that bought the game, played the first free month that comes with their purchase and then DON'T subscribe after that?

In my opinion Bioware is doing a pretty decent job with their launch of this game.  Yeah it is annoying to wait in queues to play but I'd rather wait now then come 2-6 months down the road have completely dead servers that lose their fun because there is not enough players playing on them to find groups, world pvp, queue times, etc.

A server develops a community and that community evolves and grows and I know that a good amount of people don't want to have to combine the community that has grown on their server with a completely different community from another server.  God forbid everyone from the ""Dead"" server gets placed into another random server.  At that point the whole community is lost.

This is why Bioware is trying to limit the amount of servers to the smallest number possible so that later down the road there isn't the issue of dead servers.  Don't keep saying Bioware is doing a bad job and they should have known how many people preordered blah blah blah.  Bioware knows how many people preordered and they know roughly how many servers they need.  They will be adding new servers as they see fit through the rest of early access and probably right before launch day.

TLDR; Before you get angry about the queue times on all the servers during peak hours go read up on what happened to Rift. They quickly ran into the issue of dead servers and had to combine servers.  IMO Queue times at release are better than dead servers 2-6 months from now

Let's see if we can get some traction to this idea somehow if you guys support it. 

Datacrons were a cool idea I think. They offer an insight into lore with a moderate stat bonus. But lets face facts. Once you get them on one character (especially that pesky +10), it becomes an absolute pain to get them on other characters. This would also make the leveling experience less painful.

Let's hear some feedback. What do you guys think of this? Am I alone in thinking this is an absolutely stellar idea?

Edit: This thread seems to be taking off well. When the website comes back up, I plan on starting a post in the suggestion section of the official forums. I hope I can count on all of you that support this idea to be vocal about it when the thread comes up! For that matter, if someone can make it sooner, lets all get in there and support it! The devs have shown that they DO read our suggestions and are in touch with this community. Lets get this in the pipeline of Bioware's ideas and plans! :)

I am completely enthralled by this game.  Sure there are some annoyances but I am coming to love the fact I get annoyed I have to travel such distances to do some quests.  and that it takes time.  

I am almost rank 2 darkside SI assassin and absolutely LOVE how my toon looks.  As soon as I got rank 1 darkside my eyes turned an amber color instead of the usual green.  I am excited to see what happens at rank 2.  

The crafting.  God the crafting in this game is fucking perfect for my tastes.  I don't have to go anywhere, I don't have to follow some specific ruleset for making this and that.  I just send my companion off and keep going on about my business.  Now this takes money to constantly send off your companion but if you are one of those natural credit makers/hoarders then it's not a big deal.  I suck at making money so I find I do best by just questing and not sending my companion off constantly.  For professions I took biochem, bioanalysis, and diplomacy.  I am amazed at biochem, I kept disassembling med kits and stims and eventually got the schematics for purple reusable med kits and stims.  The medkit is a HUGE bonus because it only requires lvl 8, restores 1k hp and is reusable, with a 90s cooldown.  That's sooo helpful. The next rank is way better so i am just waiting for it.  Also the stims, when you get a reusable one, it's like a constant main stat upgrade when you think about it.  Willpower is my main stat and I have the reusable stim that gives +16 wp for 1hr.  Uh..yes please!!  

Anyway, today is my first day off since getting my invite and I am absolutely loving this game.  It's innovative, it's fun, and it has all the familiar mmo elements that captured my heart so many years ago.

Some of you might remember me, if that is the case I congratulate you on excellent short-term memory! 

I am, for those who don´t, a special education teacher, who got a new student dumped on me without much time to prepare. What I knew was that he is autistic, love star wars, is very hard to connect with, and really only talked to people via sw:tor.
I made a post on reddit, asking to be allowed on peoples vents, to get a better impression and knowledge of the game. In a very short time, so many people offered all kinds of help, and I stalked vents all weekend, talked to so many awesome people, and met my student almost mastering the star wars lingo:) 
How that went the interested can read here: http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/uwgu8/to_the_brilliant_people_of_swtor_3_update_on_a/
I managed to delete the original post, so that is lost sadly&gt;.&gt;

The first comment on that post is from Bioware, and here is what they sent me: http://imgur.com/a/KmCux
Sorry for completely crappy pictures, it was raining, so couldn´t take pic outside, and wanted to show it off as soon as I could! The third poster is very rare I am told:)
I´m meeting my kid monday to give them away, the first pic in the album is for me, the other two for him:) He is gonna love them! I called today to set it up, and he is pretty much ecstatic! 
I still don´t know if I can keep him, but both my school and the parents are hoping that I can, and are working for it while I am on vacation:) 

I got so much help from reddit, I would had a much harder time building a relation with him without you!

The impression you guys gave me of the community and game made me want to play too, so I am now a lowly little sage in the Jeddit guild, getting killed by sith-it sith´s in battlegrounds:) 
It is so much fun! 

Thank you all for helping, so much! I sent chocolate to the few that dared give me their address, to the rest of you; so much love &lt;3

(last updated Dec. 1)

*To anyone reading, feel free to cut and paste this (or link to it) if other people ask about mods or crafting, I've typed something similar a few times now.*

#**Basic stuff:**

All characters in TOR use one primary stat of Aim, Cunning, Strength or Willpower which is determined by class.

- Knights &amp; Warriors use Strength
- Consulars &amp; Inquisitors use Willpower  
- Smugglers &amp; Imperial Agents use Cunning
- Troopers &amp; Bounty Hunters use Aim

Primary stats are then broken down into 2 catagories: Tech and Force

Tech:

- Aim gives Ranged crit and 0.2 ranged damage
- Cunning gives Tech crit and 0.2 Tech power 

Force:

- Strength gives Melee crit and 0.2 melee damage
- Willpower gives Force crit and 0.2 force power

Force stats are useless to Tech uses, and tech stats give nothing to force users. 

The primary stat for each class will also inherit the benefits of it's shared (force or tech) stat. This means that if I'm playing a Warrior, my primary stat is Strength.  For every point of Strength, I will get +0.2 melee and force power, and a small amount of melee and force crit. I will still get the force power and crit bonuses if I have Willpower on my gear, but ultimately, the only primary stat you should ever itemize for is Strength.

Endurance gives everyone 10 HP per point (before talents)


Secondary stats are: 

* Presence - boots companion health, damage and healing
* Power - adds melee, ranged, force and tech damage
* Force/Tech Power - Found on weapons, works like Power but does not provide melee/ranged damage
* Accuracy - Increases the chance to land attacks and abilities. Reduces dodge/deflect chance for the target over 100%
* Crit - gives melee, ranged, force and tech crit
* Surge - increased critical damage (base crits are 150%)
* Armor - reduces physical, energy and kinetic damage (all non-Elemental or Internal damage)
* Defense - increases Dodge/Deflect (deflect is dodge against ranged for lightsaber users)
* Shield - increases chance to be shielded when attacked
* Absorption - increases the % of damage shaved off shielded attacks
* Alacrity - Cast &amp; Channel Haste
* Expertise - PvP exclusive stat. Increases damage and healing done, reduces damage taken.


#**Item Rarity Levels**

Converting from WoW rarity levels:

- Uncommon = Premium
- Rare = Prototype
- Epic = Artifact

The fourth item rarity is Custom (or moddable) which we'll get to later.


#**Basic Equipment Information:**


All character have 10 armor slots, 2 relic slots, 1 mainhand and 1 offhand slot.

10 slots are: Head, Chest, Hands, Waist, Legs, Feet, Wrists, Ear and 2 Implants

Most gear has ""rating (*xx*)"" on it, which indicates the equipments overall power. Think of it like an item level. It is directly reflective of how much damage or armor an item has, or the total number of stats on an items in the case of implants and ears. Rating values are notably absent from relics because of their functionality.

Mainhands Weapons: Lightsabers (single and double), Vibroswords, Blaster Pistols and Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Assault Cannons, and Electrostaves. Companions will also use weapons such as Techblades and Techstaves that are not intended for player use, as they would not provide effective stats to any class.

Offhands: Focus, Shields, Generators, Lightsabers, Blaster Pistols, Knives, Scatterguns.

Relics: Relics are basically trinkets. Some will have active use abilities (giving crit, alacrity, and defense currently) and others, those created with Matrix Shards, have static stats. You can only ever have one Matrix Shard created relic. Matrix Shards are items obtained from datacrons, which are static world objects that are usually hidden and give cool bonuses like small amounts of permanent stats. 

Most gear is itemized currently so item types have correct core stats (i.e., no +Willpower Heavy Armor.) There may be a few arrant items (+Aim Knives and +Cunning Assault Cannons, for example) but they should be fixed/removed before launch.

Some gear also has Light/Dark requirements. For example, a Light Side Jedi (with Light I or higher) cannot use a red color crystals in his weapon unless it is already equipped in the weapon, and the entire weapon has no Light/Dark requirement. The Light/Dark system is tied to conversation choices, and has extremely minimal impact on gameplay beyond cosmetics. That is to say, there is no item it the game without an alternative that is identical in stats in the event it has a light or dark requirement.


**Companions:**

They share the core-stat system and all wear armor of a certain type. They do not have relic slots, and only have a single implant slot. 

Droid companions have different gear, but share the same gist to itemization. They have a Sensor Unit (Helm), 2 Cores (Chest/Pants), 2 Motors (Gloves/Feet), and 2 Parts (belt/bracers) and they all use +AIM as a stat. They still use Ear and Implant slots, sport regular Blaster-type weapons (pistols or rifles), and use normal off-hands (sheilds or generators.)

Companions cannot equip items that have light/dark requirements. They can, however, use any color crystals.


#**How Custom &amp; Moddable Equipment Works:**

It should be first stated that not all items have mod slots and cannot be upgraded in any way. There are absolutely no moddable ear pieces, implants, or offhand items. There are moddable bracers and belts currently in the game, but it is believed they are not intended to exist (they are significantly better than non-moddable versions and incredibly rare.)

There are 7 types of mods in game: Hilts, Barrels, Armoring, Mods, Enhancements Color Crystals, and Augments (we'll talk about Augments later).

There are 2 types of moddable items: Custom and moddable. 

On Custom items, Hilts and Barrels control the primary rating (damage range, force/tech power) of weapons and Armoring provides the rating (armor value) to armor. These mods will also provide a large chunk of primary stats and endurance to an item.

Moddable items have static values for their armor, damage values, and force/tech power as well as a large chunk of endurance and the items primary stat. This emulates the function of Hilts, Barrels and Armoring, so those types of mod slots are absent from the items. This effectively ""locks"" a moddable item into a certain rating.

Moddable items are currently all high level epic items in order to prevent players from simply taking the hilt/barrel/armoring out of their gear and selling them to other players as they upgrade their raid gear. This seriously impinges on the ""customization"" aspect of the mod system, unfortunately, but is needed so raiding never becomes devalued as a way of acquiring gear.

Mods and Enhancements are on every moddable and custom item in game and provide primary and secondary stats, depending on which type is socketed into an item. Mods provide Primary stats and endurance, and can give secondary stats as well. No enhancements provide primary stats, and all provide +Endurance and 1-2 secondary stats (no low level enhancements give secondary stats).

Color Crystals are on every weapon in the game (custom, moddable or otherwise) provided it is not exclusively an offhand weapon (knives and shotguns do not have them, off-hand only lightsabers and blasters do.) Color crystals can provide Endurance, Power, and Crit for stats and will change the color of the lightsaber blade or bullets fired.

For a fee, all modifications can be removed from items, allowing you to change the cosmetics of an item. This is mostly useful if you can buy an offhand-specific item to upgrade your mainhand weapon (both would need to be fully moddable for this.)


**Augments:**

Augment slots are found on critical crafted items, and are effectively a free bonus slot. 

Anything crafted can have an augment slot, even if the item is not moddable in any other way (implants, for example). Augments are obtained through Slicing crew missions and can have any stat (primary or secondary), making critical crafted fully moddable items potentially the best pre-raid items in the game.

Moddable items (raid drops) will all have high enough ratings to make up for the augment differences, so they have little to no meaningful impact on the itemization system.

* **What does everyone think about a screenshots sub like [/r/swtorscreenshots](http://www.reddit.com/r/swtorscreenshots)?** We kicked this idea around a little (and [/r/swtorfun](http://www.reddit.com/r/swtorfun) earlier than that) as a place for this content.

I saw a few comments about how we should have some rules here, or how we shouldn't have any rules and I'd like to clarify. The guidelines in the sidebar are the rules. The ones I see people confused about the most seem to be posting pictures not related to SW:ToR and no ** memes / rage comics **.

We've had that last one in place for months now and it's working great. We interpret this very liberally so occasionally you'll see posts that ""violate"" this rule. I think it's worth it so that you all can try things out and get creative. We're not here to punish you for your efforts, and we really do appreciate that you want to make the sub a better place.

Guys. Admittedly, the first ten or so loading screens were hilarious. But please. Stop. If you really need to post more, someone should make a post about it and everyone else can share theirs inside of it. Otherwise we're going to be /r/swtorloadingscreens.

I'm not going to remove them or anything (yet), this is just a personal request for my own mental health. Thanks!

Keep in mind, when I submitted this, half of the front page was screen shots. 

*********************************

Hi guys,

Sorry, but I need to be 'that guy'. I know a lot of people here are new to reddit, many of which post almost exclusively to this subreddit. In subreddits like these, it is a lot easier to get a large group of people upvoting the most pointless of pointless submissions (such as this one, many of you will probably think). 

At the risk of getting downvoted to oblivion, I'm here to be the ass hole to say, PLEASE stop upvoting every single screenshot submission you see. Please encourage self-posts that are **informative** and not just very minutely humorous. 

I can already hear the flame wars that are going to happen. I know this place is a “democracy” and things that make it to the front page are “what has been decided” as the most interesting thing on the page that day. The truth is, we are upvoting tons of sensationalism. The front page is littered with “So tired of this, ‘marite?” with a picture of a graphic error, or a picture of a map with a title “oh man, this place is confusing, ‘marite?”

It’s not that I hate the subreddit, I just think it could be a lot more informative than it currently is without all the BS. 

****************************

P.S. If someone would like, I've been working on developing a subreddit for the abundance of screenshots. [r/SWTORScreenShots](http://www.reddit.com/r/swtorscreenshots) is up and running. If someone else would like admin priveledges please message me with your modding experience. I really don't believe this subreddit is needed, I just think that lazy screenshot submissions should be treated as such.

*********************

**TL;DR - I'm not addressing the mods of this subreddit to remove screenshot submissions, I'm not telling everyone to post them to that other subreddit I made (I honestly don't care if it gets used, but if it does, great), I'm speaking to the redditors of this subreddit to please encourage informative posts more than lazy humor and screenshot karma whoring with your votes.**",,False,self,t5_2qxih,True,,Consular,True,t3_ocds0,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/ocds0/wtb_more_selfposts_in_the_swtor_subreddit/,

I hit 50 on New Years day.  All throughout January I was PvP'ing like crazy, doing my dailies and space missions, and leveling any one of my 3 ""serious alts"".

Right around the beginning of February, I slowed down my play time dramatically.  I only logged in for maybe two hours a week, and about a week into February I ""quit"" altogether.  It wasn't completely by choice, as work hit hard and I didn't have as much time as I did before.

In the past couple of weeks, I have wanted to get back into MMOs.  D3 beta got stale, and I can only play so much Skyrim before I get overwhelmed.  I reactivated my Rift subscription for the free week that Trion gave me, I played in the beta for TERA, I tried out STO again since it went F2P, as well as DCUO (both games I originally subscribed to).  Throughout all of those games, something just felt like it was missing.

Then I launched SWTOR (and waited a while for patching :-P).  It was quickly apparent what was missing from those other games: the cinematic, personalized, **fully voiced** game play of SWTOR.  Even the quest-to-quest game play in SWTOR just felt so much better than everything else.  I know it is seen as hokey to call SWTOR's combat ""heroic"", but that's honestly what it started feeling like after playing the other MMOs.  Even making another Smuggler (my first 50) and knowing the story, it was amazing.  The narrative, the cinematic feel, everything just felt awesome.   I honestly can't go back to the traditional MMO anymore.  I think people who have played SWTOR will feel the same when they go back to others, and that makes me think that SWTOR has some *serious* staying power in the MMO race.

I'm so out of the loop now with updates to SWTOR, and going through the 1.2 patch notes is mind blowing.  There's so much new stuff and changes.

1331053053.0,247,self.swtor,qkc0f,I'm really curious how this is going to end up...,410,163,427,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/qkc0f/im_really_curious_how_this_is_going_to_end_up/,"There has been a huge amount of people complaining about how buggy swtor was when it came out. My guess is that most of those people didn't play a fresh MMO on release.

To this day every one I have played which were, EQ, SWG, SG, EVE, and vanilla wow, were all buggy as heck coming out. It's part of when an MMO is released there are several things crafty players discover and exploit that are unexpected. Not to mention problems with server stability and many other issues that most people don't consider when starting these said mmos. Even StarCraft and Diablo II were chaotic on release, does anybody remember being able to dupe anything with a potion in Diablo I? 

My point is that all the people that are jumping off board for the sake of bugs to go to GW2 is going to be humorous to me. I think GW2 has potential as well to be a good game. Not having a monthly fee though will make bugs from release linger for up to six months though and understandably too, somebody has to get paid to do that stuff. So I wish that people could take that into consideration before tearing into ANY MMO before giving it 6 months to fully flourish. 

Vanilla wow was so bad you would completely crash on looting items off mobs in the STARTING areas. Or you would be stuck for at least 5 minutes before it would release the item to you or even let you keep moving. But I miss the hell out of vanilla wow that was an outstanding mmo experience all around to say the least. 

For those of you already done with ALL of the content and refuse to level an alt to see the other story lines. You're playing the wrong MMO that was the most advertised part and the fact that pvp is already as good as it is was a huge shock to me. 

So that's my rant I feel like this is a fenced conversation and people will either agree 100% or downvote me to oblivion, which was another good game btw.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,False,,Trooper,True,t3_qkc0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/qkc0f/im_really_curious_how_this_is_going_to_end_up/,
1327365134.0,245,self.swtor,otob7,This is the formula for figuring out how affection levels lower your crew skill mission times.,313,68,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/otob7/this_is_the_formula_for_figuring_out_how/,"After a lot of research and data collection performed by knudlen and I, I believe I've finally figured out the formula used by SWTOR to determine what percentage of time is taken off of crew skills.  (I also have a theory that crit/success increases based on these levels, too, but that's much harder to figure out.)

The % time off is between 1% and 15%, and steps up 1% at a time at certain intervals.  Here's the formula:

**Floor((X+1000)/(733+1/3))=Y%** OR

**Floor(3 * (X+1000) / 2200) = Y%**

X is your current affection level and Y is the % your mission times is reduced by.
In order to figure out what level your companion's affection needs to be in order to take off another %, just solve for Y without the Floor function:

**Ceiling((733+1/3) * Y% - 1000) = X** OR

**Ceiling((2200 * Y% / 3) - 1000) = X**

For instance, to achieve 13% reduction in mission times, (733 + 1/3) * 13 - 1000 = 8534.  Once you hit 8534 affection (roughly), you'll jump from 12% reduction to 13% reduction.

This should help those who are doing a lot of crafting and seeing that their companions are almost to the next affection level.  Invest in some companion gifts should push it over the edge to the next %, and it should end up saving you time in the long run.

Here's an easy table of what affection level you need in order to get to a certain % (for those who don't like math):


* 1%: -267

* 2%: 467

* 3%: 1200

* 4%: 1934

* 5%: 2667

* 6%: 3400

* 7%: 4134

* 8%: 4867

* 9%: 5600

* 10%: 6334

* 11%: 7067

* 12%: 7800

* 13%: 8534

* 14%: 9267

* 15%: 10000

These numbers may be a few points off here and there, but they should be mainly accurate.  For those who want to see the research thread, it is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o9e3a/til_companion_affection_affects_mission_time_in_a/).

Happy crafting!

**EDIT**: I noticed a couple discrepancies here. So, I retuned the formula. See changes above. All of my numbers fit now. It used to be 733 but further tests show it is 733+1/3. And, ceiling the % to affection values gives an accurate chart.

I was leveling on Ord Mantell and minding my own business, when I got a whisper asking if I wanted help with the Heroics (I'd died about three times at this point because I hadn't realized that Heroic quests weren't meant to be done alone).

To keep a long story short, over the course of the next seven (yes, seven) hours, this couple (husband and wife?) showed me the ropes of the game, helped me level, were just really friendly, and gave me an overall awesome MMO experience. I've played WoW for YEARS (just quit about 3mos ago) and had never been treated so well... plus it was a lot of fun.

By the end of it all (it was seven hours, after all) I'd told them that I planned on subbing first chance I got because I was really enjoying the game but am in the process of starting a new job after a bout of unemployment and it probably wouldn't be for a couple of months.

The wife responded with ""A few months of restrictions? Playing something you enjoy? Nope. Not having it."" and **gave me a 60-day game time code.** Just... gave it to me. They then spent another hour explaining all the new features I had with being subbed. (Whole new world. Really.)

At the end of it all I just thanked them profusely and we all logged off. I didn't see them the rest of the weekend (I assume they were on their 50s), so I just wanted to say thanks. I know there's a better chance than not that they aren't redditors, but they are a credit to the game's community and their kindness was very much appreciated.

**EDIT:** Thanks all for the welcomes! Further testament to the how great the SWTOR community is. Also, now that I've read all of this, I would like to track them down.

Overall, just about every class can get almost every ability necessary for every spec - it just takes a little bit of knowledge of what not to stick on your bar for the class/spec you're playing.  Rather than leaving folks to struggle who may not be familiar with the game well enough to figure it out on their own, I've put together a guide.

It's a work in progress currently.  The vast majority of the prep work is done, but recording the videos and putting everything in a readable format takes an awful lot of time and is quite a strain on my voice.  Here is the first half of the video guides for the Republic.  The other half should be uploaded by tomorrow, and I'll edit this post to include them.  The text is in progress now, and of course I'll make adaptations for Imperial classes. While I know most of these classes and specs fairly well, if someone sees something they would consider blatantly wrong, please by all means let me know and I'll look at it and annotate the video and make sure the text edition is correct.  I hope this helps!

Just remember, this is earlier than you were given at first, and there was never a guarantee everyone would get in the first day.

* Yes, we all know that the servers were stress-tested several times. But there have been changes since then, and there's good reason to just go easy on launch and let waves in as the infrastructure allows.

* I know you want to have fun playing SWTOR, just like me, but imagine if we all started at once. The first days would just be unbearable, with starting zones full with thousands of people.

* Many of you have been upset that the waves so far haven't gotten past the end of July. The reason is that there was a large spike in preorders the first days that they were announced. Don't think of it as ""one week"", think of it as ""a fifth of all preorders"".

* Some of you have waited for years. I know it's unbearable that your chance to play is so close, but it will be worth it. Let's just all take a deep breath, relax, and trust that the devs are doing their work. They've been close to us as a community for as long back as I can think, and they're not looking to spite us.

**1.1.2 Patch Notes — 2/7/2012**


Classes and Combat


    Combat Ability Responsiveness
        Further improved response time for ability activation requests, especially in low-framerate situations.
        The activation bar now appears at the correct time (when the activation of an ability begins) and disappears when activation is complete.
        Instant combat abilities no longer occasionally start their combat animations twice, resulting in jerky behavior on the executing player's client.
        The display of the floating text from instant healing abilities is no longer delayed by the animation on the client and now properly reflects the time the effect happens on the server.
        Abilities on cooldown are now more easily distinguished from abilities that can be used.

    General
        If Sprint was active when a player died, it now remains active when the player is revived.

                Searing Saber: Now correctly modifies the critical damage dealt by burn effects.
                Changes to Searing Saber and Plasma Blades result in an overall increase in Damage Per Second.

So, **thanks**. Thanks for making and managing the game that has fulfilled my gaming sessions from day 1, and that I still enjoy to this date. A fact that many people share but too few seem to really appreciate.

It is nowhere near perfect, I do not always approve your moves and there's a **ton** of good MMORPGs out there, but it's the game **I choose** and I'm enjoying every bit of it and for that, you have my gratitude.

There was the infamous exploit months ago with the white crystal, the addition &amp; removal of a crystal vendor pre-1.2, the fuss over the Black Green and the SE Black Green from Razer owners, and even the recent May4th Q &amp;A had 2 questions on color crystals. 

In fact, inspired by the May 4th Q&amp;A, I looked around and saw that there weren't much documentation on the endgame color crystals. Some of the crystal colors like purple and cyan are still fairly one sided and methods to obtain them seems mysterious. 

Anyways, I decided to compile a list of all the color crystals available at endgame (+41 stats) and listed some ways to obtain them. There are still some unanswered questions but hopefully this will encourage members of the community to share on their crystal hunting experiences and unravel some of the mysteries. 

I know some of you are like ""just show me the colors!"", here is an picture showing all the color crystals available at end-game (that I know of) in a work friendly (imgur) format. http://i.imgur.com/6OOrt.jpg

Male Chiss 'core names,' which is what the character name will probably represent, include one sound from each of two 'family names.' So Mitth'raw'nuruodo went by Thrawn; his given name ""raw"" (the middle name in Chiss form) surrounded by the last sound of his first family name and the first sound of his last family name. In the same vein, Kres'ten'tarthi went by Sten, and Brast'alshi'barku went by Talshib. For females, the 'core name' is only the given name and doesn't include anything else, i.e. Hess'irolia'nuruodo goes by Irolia. **EDIT:** Not always the case. Female names can certainly follow the naming conventions that I've laid out as 'male.'

Technically Chiss would expect any inferior to use their full name, but they're at least as racist as Human Imperials and consider any non-Chiss to be *so* inferior that they can't even pronounce a Chiss full name. So most Chiss just go by their core name when outside of the Ascendency, which means using the core name as the character name field makes perfect sense. The first family name is the one that seems to be common among families, so that two brothers would share the same first part of their name (Mitth for Thrawn). I have no fucking clue what the last part of the name represents (Nuruodo for Thrawn). Maybe something that has meaning only among the family or something. (**EDIT:** The final part of the name is apparently tied to a professional family and I guess reflects station or status, below comments.) Anyway the point is, the legacy name would be the first part of the name.

So the end result of all that is simply that, if you want your Legacy name to reflect your character's family name, and you want your Chiss to be consistent with that in terms of in-universe Chiss naming conventions, then your Chiss's character name should start with the same sound that your Legacy name ends with. That is, I believe Grand Admiral Thrawn's character name would be Thrawn, and his legacy name would be Mitth. Nuruodo wouldn't be entered into any of SWTOR's name fields, and I don't know where that part of the Chiss name comes into play ayway.

1326694082.0,208,self.swtor,oiz5z,Companion affection explained,281,73,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/oiz5z/companion_affection_explained/,"This is an expansion on my previous post: http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/npx61/companion_affection_tips/

That post contained a few errors and wasn't very complete. I still don't have all the exact numbers, but I have a much clearer picture now of how companion affection works so I thought I'd explain for those who are interested.

**Conversation**

The most common way to gain (or lose!) affection with companions is to have them with you during cut scenes, or speak with them directly when they offer you missions in cantinas or your ship. The base affection gain for a dialogue option they approve of is +15, and the base loss for one they disapprove of is -1. Those values are modified by a multiplier that reflects how late in the storyline the companion joined up with you. [Knotor.com](http://www.knotor.com) has those multipliers for each specific companion, if you're interested. Less commonly, there will be choices they strongly approve of, which have a base +40 gain, or strongly disapprove of, for a base loss of -30. In very rare cases there will be dialogue options that give much larger gains (usually restricted to romances, but sometimes also available during companion quests). The largest I've seen was +550, during a ship dialogue with the 4th Sith Inquisitor companion.

Tips for increasing companion affection through dialogue:

* You can hit ESC to cancel a cut scene and start over, if you accidentally said something your companion didn't like. It isn't always obvious which choices they will prefer, even if you know their preferences, because -- as we all know -- what comes out of your character's mouth can be quite different from what the dialogue wheel said.
* You **do** gain or lose affection if your companion is currently deployed on a crew skill task, or even if they're dismissed or unconscious. The game goes by active companion, and you always have an active companion after receiving your first one (it's the companion with a highlighted ""person"" symbol in the crew window). However, if they are not physically present, you won't see the tab pop up at the bottom of the screen, so you won't know how they reacted until later.
* Affection gains/losses from conversation aren't applied until you turn in the quest that the cut scene was part of.
* You can swap companions in and out for cut scenes in order to gain affection with those you don't normally use in combat. The downside of doing this is that you may have to cancel a crew mission from time to time.

**Gifts**

Gift affection is slightly more complicated. There are five ranks of gifts, and within each rank there are three qualities (green, blue, purple) and ten categories (Weapons, Trophies, etc.). The most counter-intuitive aspect is the ranks. They correspond to five ""tiers"" of companion affection, which are 0-2000, 2001-4000, etc. up to 10000 max. It is always best to give your companion a gift of a rank that corresponds to their current affection tier, because gifts of a lower rank get a severe affection penalty: if a gift is one rank lower, it gets a 0.5 affection gain multiplier, and if it's two ranks lower, the multiplier is 0.2. It goes down from there, and eventually you will get 0 affection from giving them a gift that is ""too cheap"". (This seems to apply only to green quality gifts. Blues and purples always give *some* affection, even if it's a very small amount.) Conversely, giving gifts that are ""too expensive"" (of a higher rank than the companion's affection tier) wastes affection, because you get only slightly more than the base value; this means you would've been better off holding on to the gift until their affection reached the appropriate tier.

Gift categories are a reflection of the companion's specific preferences. Military companions often like Weapons and Military Gear; scientists and droids often like Technology; criminal types like Underworld Goods, etc. Again, I recommend [Knotor.com](http://www.knotor.com) for the best information on what each companion wants. Note that there are four possible responses: High, Medium, Low, and Indifferent. For a rank 1 green gift given to a companion with less than 2000 affection, the gains will be +96, +54, +24, and +0 respectively. I take that to mean the ""base"" gain is +24 and the multipliers are 4, 2.25, 1, and 0 (I have not tested this with higher affection tiers). Not every companion has a High category, but most of them have at least one, and obviously you should give them gifts of that category whenever possible. There are different emotes for each interest level as well.

Quality is fairly self-explanatory because it corresponds to the same system as item valuation: purple is better than blue is better than green. I don't have the exact multipliers.

Tips for increasing companion affection with gifts:

* Identify their High interest category and get them to *at least* 2000 affection as soon as you acquire them. Try to get even more if you don't plan on using them much as an active companion. Rank 1 green gifts only cost 200 credits from a vendor, which means you can get them over 2000 affection for just 4200 credits (7600 if they don't have an interest category above Medium). That is much less than you would spend later on trying to raise them from 8000 to 10000. Remember, there are no diminishing returns for conversation affection gains, so it's better to give gifts early.
* Becoming romantically involved with a companion changes their gift preferences, and not just where Courting gifts are concerned (~~all~~ most companions are Indifferent to Courting gifts if not being romanced). Romanceable companions have two separate tables altogether; in general, they react more positively to all gifts from a girlfriend/boyfriend.
* All Mission skills can provide companion gifts. Gift missions are usually cheap, fast, and an effective way to level the skill. Treasure Hunting in particular is useful for obtaining gifts, because it gives you gift fragments that can be redeemed on the Fleet for specific desired categories (other skills' gift missions are a crap shoot).
* When buying gifts on the GTN, green and blue gifts are usually a better value than purples. On my server people charge outlandish prices for purple gifts, 4-5x what blues cost (and purples don't give nearly 5x the affection of blues).
* When giving a lot of one type of gift, bind it to a quickslot and left-click it anytime the buff wears off.
* The categories listed in the game code for gift preferences are misleading, and unfortunately most sites have just transcribed those values without testing them. The code lists gift categories as ""Indifferent"", ""Likes"", ""Favorite"", and ""Loves"", in ascending order. Be aware that if you're looking at a guide that uses those terms, the ""Favorite"" category isn't actually their favorite.

Edit: Just for trivia's sake, there actually are *white* companion gifts in the game, but they are extremely rare. I got one in the mail as a followup to a low-level quest on my Jedi Knight. My theory is that they were removed in one of the beta builds, but a few were missed here and there. AFAIK no vendors sell them. They give less affection than greens.

Edit 2: Thanks to kadaan in the comments, we can fill out some more specific multiplier values.

**Base gift value: +24 affection**

Companion Preference Multiplier

* Indifferent: 0
* Low (Likes): 1
* Medium (Favorite): 2.25
* High (Loves): 4

Gift Quality Multiplier

* Green: 1
* Blue: 1.66
* Purple: 5

Rank Difference Multiplier

* -2 Ranks: 0.2
* -1 Rank: 0.5
* 0 Ranks: 1
* +1 Rank: 1.1
* +2 Ranks: 1.3
* +3 Ranks: 1.5
* +4 Ranks: 1.5",,False,self,t5_2qxih,True,,Agent,True,t3_oiz5z,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/oiz5z/companion_affection_explained/,

I think an MMO as massive as SWTOR needs that many characters, though.

I have been in the Beta since late June and I've played multiple character up to around level 40 or so.  I'm not going to do a traditional review where I issue a number value for various aspects of the game.  Instead I am going to go through what SWTOR is, what it is not, what Bioware has done right, what they've done wrong, and my hopes and concerns for the game in the future.

**So, is it a WoW Clone or Not?**

Unfortunately the first thing people say when they dismiss SWTOR (Usually before playing it) is SWTOR is a WoW clone.  If it is or not depends on your definition of the term 'clone.'  If you distil anything down to its very basics you can mock it.  We could say all FPSs are clones because all you do is shoot people, or for that matter we could say all video games are clones because you simply respond to certain patterns of pixels by pressing the correct buttons to achieve victory.

SWTOR is similar to WoW in that they are the same genre and sub-genre of MMORPG.  The main reason it gets called a clone is because MMORPG is a very vague term that could be used to describe everything from WoW to EvE Online, two games that are so far apart in terms of gameplay they might as well be different genres. 

SWTOR follows in the traditions of EverQuest and WoW in a type of MMORPG sometimes called a 'theme park' MMO.  When Blizzard came onto the scene with WoW, they looked around the industry, saw what their competitors were doing, and cherry picked the good aspects of the genre and left out the bad, while innovating as much as possible.  Bioware has done the same thing, and as a result, they take much from WoW in the same way WoW took much from EverQuest. We may not all remember it, but WoW was called an Everquest clone at the time of it's release too.

So, is SWTOR a WoW Clone?  That depends on your definition of the term clone.  My definition is a game that is designed to be another game redone with no innovation or meaningful changes to game play. By that definition, SWTOR is not a WoW clone because SWTOR has innovated and changed game play in several ways.

Now, the skeptics are probably saying ""Yea Yea, it's WoW with cut scenes.""  I'll talk about story and context and why dismissing this isn't fair later.  For now, let's stick to gameplay.  In WoW you typically fight 1 on 1 battles over and over.  In SWTOR you have a companion and fight packs of enemies even while soloing, which makes things a lot more dynamtic and interesting. SWTOR has no auto-attack forcing you to be more active.  No character in SWTOR uses mana (No, not even Sorcs/Sages, it's just a bigger energy pool), rather they all have various forms of rage or energy which means there are no long periods of auto-attacking to regen mana.  SWTOR utilizes mini-instances for most group or boss content rather the phasing which feels a lot smoother then WoW.  I've always found phasing to be rather jarring when NPCs or resources appear or disappear as I move back and forth across the phasing line, and phasing has a lot of negative aspects to open world pvp and grouping.  

SWTOR's mini instancing feels like an innovation in this respect because the phases are clearly marked and cannot be entered while in combat preventing hit and run attacks on open world pvp servers.

I could go on about the anti-down time features such as medical probes or how everyone has an out of combat heal that doesn't require food or water.  I could discuss in detail how addicting the crafting system is and how you'll want to create and RE everything just to unlock new recipes, and how this can all be done while you are out questing instead of sitting at a forge watching a progress bar over and over again. I would discuss the legacy system and how it encourages multiple play throughs and helps keeping track of your guildmates' alts easier, or how cool having low level grouping content that is repeatable daily is for getting to group up with friends... well you get the idea.

To me the difference between a clone and simply a new entry in the same genre is innovation, and SWTOR has it in spades.  Yes, they took things like flight paths and mounts and quests and talent trees from WoW.   Because those things work.   Bioware isn't avoiding staples of the genre simply because WoW does them too.  

If you don't like MMORPGs, you probably won't like SWTOR either. There really isn't much more to say on it.  The game is not a sandbox MMO, and It's not an action game.  If you come into it expect it to be either, you'll be disappointed.

It's also not KOTOR III, as much as some would like it to be.  There are some people who like MMOs and some who prefer single player games.  If you are like me, and you've playing KOTOR, Dragon Age and Mass Effect and thought to yourself this would be awesome if it was an MMO, then this is your game.  If you hate MMOs and online gaming then perhaps not.  Don't get me wrong, even if you only solo the game is still fun, but you have to deal with all of the downsides to an MMO which isn't a particularly good deal if you aren't interested in the positives.

**Does Story Really Matter?**

Until you've played SWTOR I don't think you can fully appreciate how much fully voiced cut scenes add to the enjoyment of playing an MMO.  It's very easy to say it's all just collecting X and killing Y, only with a cut scene, but that's getting into the idea that anything boiled down to basics can be mocked again.  The fact is you won't find a theme park MMO where you don't go around collecting X and killing Y, and if you want a game where you don't do those things, you are looking in the wrong genre.

When people dismiss the story and immersion in the game, they aren't judging it fairly.  Ultimately isn't the only difference between the original DooM and MW3 the context around which you shoot the gun? Take out the graphics, story, and narrative and all FPSes are the same: point and shoot.  Context is a very powerful thing.  If you cut the story and narrative out of Mass Effect, Dragon Age, or KOTOR, you aren't left with much either, but that isn't a fair way to judge those games.  It's like saying someone is a weakling because they are only alive thanks to their heart, and if you cut out they'd die.  

The fact is context and story do matter, and this is the first Bioware game where not only do you have that great story telling experience, but you can share it with a friend.  It's really cool striding onto the bridge of the Black Talon, telling the captain he's relieved then executing him for refusing orders.  It's about a million times better when you get to do in front of your friends.  It's especially exciting when you don't know what your friends will do, or even if you do know, you don't know who will win the roll.  

It is actually fun to level rather then being a chore you have to get out of the way before you can experience the end game like it is in wow. That isn't to say it doesn't get old and lose some of it's appeal over time, but that is the same for every game.

All credit goes to the people who noticed/found these problems and posted
[in this thread](http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=101553)

Basically what they're saying is abilities for classes and their mirrors aren't exactly the same a lot of the time. I've noticed this from playing an operative in beta, and playing a scoundrel after release.  

Some of these are a blatant numbers issue such as CD's or how long an effect lasts, while others aren't as apparent such as an animation causing the damage from an ability to come out later than its mirror.

I'll keep a list of differences I've found in the OP from the thread linked above and posts scattered throughout.


Jedi Knight / Sith Warrior:

- JG's Freezing Force slows for 6 seconds, SJ's Chilling Scream (equivalent) slows for 9. 

[Freezing Force](http://www.torhead.com/ability/9xVgSEF) :
[Chilling Scream](http://www.torhead.com/ability/7eLd3W2/chilling-scream)

- JK Blade Storm has a wind up time (the jedi visibly pulls his hand back) and a travel time (both moves are 10m), SW Force Scream deals damage immediately regardless of range

Jedi Consular / Sith Inquisitor:

- Project (Cons) doesn't damage until projectile hits, SI Shock does damage instantly.

Trooper / Bounty Hunter:

- Mortar Volley (Trooper) takes about 2 seconds for any damage to be registered in the area, while Death From Above (BH) damages instantly. (Not Confirmed)

Smuggler / Imperial Agent:

- The talent Accomplished Sawbones (Scoundrel) provides a 5%/10%/15% crit healing bonus opposed to Accomplished Doctor (Op) 10%/20%/30%. 

[Accomplished Sawbones](http://www.torhead.com/ability/gjPW4oM) / [Ingame](http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/9778/screenshot2012010821343.jpg) : [Accomplished Doctor](http://www.torhead.com/ability/86nQ9PR)

- Flash Bang (IA) has a 60 sec CD, Flash Grenade (Smuggler) has a 90 sec CD. 

[Flash Bang](http://www.torhead.com/ability/f5R2qsF/flash-bang) : [Flash Grenade](http://www.torhead.com/ability/fT8pWgj/flash-grenade) / [Ingame](http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/2577/screenshot2012010821342.jpg)

- Debilitate can be used while moving, Dirty kick forces the player to stop.

- Smuggler Sab Charge takes time to get to the target, IA Explosive Probe hits target instantly

That's all I have so far. I will be adding more to the list as I find them posted or find them ingame. I just wanted to get the word out because these **are** game changing problems (especially under smuggler/IA)

Also, any constructive feedback would be great. I'm usually lurking but felt this needed to be posted, and probably made many mistakes. Thanks!

Edit: I should note I've only confirmed the JK/SW and Smuggler/IA as I have played those classes personally and experienced the differences. Any confirmation for the other classes would be appreciated.

And spied a treasure guarded fast;  
That gold-starred elite would just have to go--  
I took its life by rifle blast.  
Would an epic or bit of fine-made gear  
Reward me for my macabre dance?  
No, as always, curse the luck--  
--FRILLED LEATHERIS PANTS.  
  

Then Alderaan's snow-capped mountains in view  
(Suppressed an urge to FUS RO DAH),  
Another elite was pacing through  
And right behind, a chest I saw.  
Would I win a weapon to make foes fear?  
Credits to help my skills finance?  
No, as always, curse the luck--  
--FRILLED LEATHERIS PANTS.  
  

Belsavis bound, I lingered long a day,  
Struck down Jedis mad and droids cruel;  
Grim guardians, their chests I took away  
For gear to make my friends all drool.  
On this, a world of vaults and treasures dear,  
Would here I stand a better chance?  
No, as always, curse the luck--

So I compiled this little guide here outlining some of the things that I thought might be important. It is by no means comprehensive but rather serve as a general guide to get you started! Here is a rough TL: DR of it. I also bolded the parts in the article that I thought were important if you just want to skim through it

* PvP: Buy Champion/Centurion for looks, grind BM pieces, stock up on commendations

* Dailies: Do Ilum/Belsavis dailies now and stock up for 200 commendation relics 

* White &amp; other crystals: 2.5 million/1 million version. If you don't get them now they will be gone

* Buy those giant speeders

* Level alts, credits for the new legacy system. See [here](http://dulfy.net/2012/03/27/legacy-system-in-1-2/) for a writeup of the legacy system

* Crafting - level armsmech, armstech, synthweaving, artifice. Pick up slicing (will make good credits) and mission skills for schematics

1343211903.0,182,self.swtor,x4ip9,"An honest, personal review on SWTOR endgame and why I think this game is here to stay.",269,87,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/x4ip9/an_honest_personal_review_on_swtor_endgame_and/,"Something has been bugging me lately and it has to do with all the negative reviews/comments about SWTOR endgame content. Tons of opinion peices have popped up recently because of the F2P rumors and they all seem to share the same opinion - SWTOR endgame is disappointing at best. I disagree and I find it really hard to believe how one could even come to that conclusion, especially since the addition of group finder + adding better rewards to Hardmode Flashpoints. I believe the opinion that SWTOR endgame sucks is just another example of the gaming community's perpetual dissatisfaction with any product released...ever.

First of all, I am not a Star Wars fan. I saw the original Star Wars movies as a kid but never became a ""fan"" so to speak, so I wasn't really sure that this game would be right for me at first. Honestly, I didn't play the game at first because I was afraid of being tagged a ""Star Wars nerd"" just for playing the game. I eventually came to the conclusion that it couldn't be worse than being a ""WoW nerd"" which, admitedly, I already was. So I sucked it up and bought the game. I now have a level 50 Jedi Sage and I have to admit, I enjoy the shit out of it.

I spacebar through almost every quest dialogue. Yep, sue me. If there was an option to skip the cutscenes and just get a WoW-style quest box with text I can safely choose to ignore, I would totally enable it! I won't complain though. Does it really bother me having to repeatedly smash my spacebar just to do something as simple as pick up a quest? Surprisingly, no. The cinematic stuff is a huge selling point for some people and even I enjoy watching certain conversations unfold from time to time. It's not my cup of tea but I can't hate on it since it doesn't actually take anything away from my gaming experience. My point is that I am not wrapped up in the storyline (a major selling point for the game) and my goal while levelling is pretty much: get to level cap. That being said, levelling a character up to 50 has been the most enjoyable experience in any MMO I have ever played -- even without the slightest idea of what my class quest is all about. It was a grind that never quite felt... grindy, if you will.

So I finally get to the max level and am ready to finally ""play the game"" as I would say. First thing's first -- I need gear. A bit of online research tells me that Recruit PVP blues are a good starting place for both PVE and PVP so I farm up a set. This is even easier to do now since there is a new PVP mission that practically says ""Gratz on 50 here's some starter gear to help you not suck"" which I think is AMAZING and other games should really take a hint (I'm looking at you, WoW). Okay, I've got a blue set of armor so I can retire these level 40-something greens and try my hand at a HM Flashpoint. About an hour later I have my first HM Flashpoint completed and a few new peices of gear to boot! The boss mechanics were surprisingly tough on some fights and we wiped a few times but eventually figured everything out on our own. Since then I have completed every Flashpoint on Hardmode and I have to tell you, I am very satisfied with the quality and difficulty level of the content. I have yet to see any of these ""bugs"" that people claim exist but maybe I'm just extremely lucky.

It's time to try some of this infamous level-50 PVP. It's a little rough at first but having the Recruit gear definitely helps me feel less squishy and as I get more Battlemaster gear I start to feel much more confident in the ring. The objective-based gameplay, in my opinion, is some of the best I've ever seen in an MMORPG. Planting a bomb in Voidstar or capping a turret in Civil War is an intensely rewarding experience. There is much more focus on attacking/defending the objectives than on racking up kills, which I love. Sometimes I get stunlocked to death and it sucks but it happens only when I have multiple people beating on me. It's not like the majority of my experiences in WoW where a single player can completely lock you down until they have single-handedly chiselled away your health to zero before you have a chance to fight back. I'd like to also add that giving players a free ""trinket"" is again something that certain other MMORPGs should take note of. 

I hit the forums for some tips and am overwhelmed by the sheer volume of players complaining about PVP imbalance. In highschool I had a friend who, every time he died in a video game, would blame it on the controller. I get that same vibe from 99% of these posts. Nobody likes losing and the mob mentality on these forums only lends to blaming the ""imbalanced"" system for our shortcomings. Everybody also claims to be an ""expert"" player, yet none of them agree on the best spec, stat balances or strategy. Hell, I remember when video game defeat inspired innovation. When something wasn't working we tried a new approach. But many of these players insist that their way is best and therefore blame the system for short-selling them instead of just changing up their strategy. Oh well, maybe this generation is just imbued with an unrealistic sense of entitlement. I suppose that's a different topic for a different thread. As far as ""balance"" goes, I will rate this game on par with the WoW standard in terms of player vs player combat and far above that in terms of Warzone maps + team play. But hey, this is just like, my opinion, man.

So what's next on my endgame to-do list? Raids... err, I mean Operations! Looking forward to this stuff. I suppose I should find a guild that has an open spot so I can progress with them. I see a group looking for Healer HM EV in General chat and an hour later I have a few new shiny peices of purple gear, a new guild, and a raid-spot as the second healer for our 8-man ops groups. I must have been lucky because again I never saw any ""bugs"" that people always talk about. This is where I finally start to sink into that endgame groove. Operations twice a week with a bit of daily mission grinding to keep my credits at a reasonable level. I check the GTN from time to time to see if I can snag a cheap upgrade. I max out my professions and make my Rakata medpacs, stims and adrenals. For a while there I was doing HM Flashpoints for fun but was disappointed that they didn't offer better rewards. Thankfully the group finder changed everything for the better and now I try to run at least a daily FP to score some quick Black Hole comms to save up for that sexy gear.

So here I am now. My guild has been progressing nicely, full cleared everything up through EC Storymode and are about to start working on HM EC. Storymode was pretty tough but I'm excited for the new challenge that Hardmode will present. I hear HM is extremely difficult so I'm sure that will take up a lot of our time. Once we clear that I would imagine, just like every time I cleared the current raid tier in WoW, my focus will shift more to the PVP gear grind, doing dailies, playing the GTN, exploring planets I skipped over, repeating a few space missions and outfitting my ship with the best mods, collecting crafting recipes, maxing out companion affection, discovering all the lore objects, collecting some datacrons, unlocking a few new legacy perks and working on my alts. Don't forget the weekly HM EC farm to outfit the group in Campaign gear and prepare for the next tier of content. Come to think of it, that is a lot to keep me busy. I think then, and only then Willl I be able to honestly consider the notion of endgame being lackluster, and only because at that point will I have consumed the majority of the content already. I somehow doubt I will even make a dent in that list before the next Ops comes out.

So, after a few months of playing it looks like I may be nearing the end of my PVE journey. Yet I'm still deep in the thick of the endless gear-grind that is MMORPGs. I still have yet to get my War Hero PVP set so there is always that to keep me busy. I could go back and do some quests I skipped while leveling and maybe check out the story side of things for once. I finally experienced a bug on a boss! It was really annoying and costed us a few wipes. I still don't know for certain if it was really a bug or if we just failed to fully understand the mechanics of the fight. Probably the later but who knows. I guess that's about the only truly negative experience I've had. Maybe I'm lucky or maybe I just have different expectations than other people. Oh well, I'm having a good time and I suppose that is all that matters. Sometimes though I really do wonder what it is that makes people so critical of the SWTOR endgame. I honestly cannot think of anything myself... yet.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,False,,,True,t3_x4ip9,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/x4ip9/an_honest_personal_review_on_swtor_endgame_and/,

I'm a nice guy. I go out of my way to take a break when I start getting heated, I **never** rage quit warzones, I try to stay positive, and it's a shame more people don't act this way. I've, personally, seen attitudes in a general decline over the last couple months. 
  
  
I'm an avid PVPer -- always have been. I look at PVE as testing yourself against *mostly* expected mechanics, while PVP is (to me) the ultimate test of your abilities in real time. I warzoned my way to battlemaster before the Ilum changes and was, understandably, upset about what happened there. It's okay, though, I let that go. I can't be mad at players for taking advantage of(/using) game mechanics they did not, themselves, create.
  
  
I do everything I can to avoid Ilum because, to me, that's just not PVP. Warzones it is. If I had a thousand credits for every **asshole** I've come across in warzones, however, I'd be one of the richest people on the server.
  
  
Sometimes I think players are killing MMOs for me -- and it's a shame, because I love MMOs. I also love Star Wars -- and this game would give me a constant smile if it were not for the bad attitudes I see every single day.
  
  
""please just let them score so we can get the fuck outta here""
  
""the majority of this team should unsubb""
  
""u guys fucking suck fuck u""
  
Then there's always the ragequit cycle. Two people leave a losing game, screw two people behind them in the queue, more people leave, more people get screwed, more people leave, rinse and repeat until the game times out.
  
  
I've been killing time, hoping things improve with 1.2. I even rolled a character, specifically, for PVE -- he's now in columi/rakata, and I'm in the same spot I was a month ago.
  
  
Sometimes you win warzones. Sometimes you lose them. People need to get used to that, and stop letting *their* bad attitudes ruin other players' experiences.
  
  
I apologize for the rant, but I just needed to get this off of my chest. I've been frustrated for a long time over this.

I originally wanted to have some cool fancy interactive timeline but most of them were rather limited and distracts from the information present. In the end I went with a plain table format.

Hit the button!  Base on whatever you want, most healing, guy who did a wicked cool backflip kill, most impressive display of slamming ones face into a keyboard, WHATEVER, just press it!  You help random people on your faction (or your friends if you're queuing with them) gear up a little bit faster, it costs you nothing, and deciding who to vote for is a good way to kill that 8 second window waiting for the Exit Warzone button to light up!

But neither was the balloon, so I stealthed and waited, nervously scanning the empty horizon.  

When the balloon finally appeared, I was anxious to get on and with nobody in sight, I uncloaked and began to position myself for the jump.  I was backing up while panning out the camera when out of nowhere is a lvl 50 speeder with a nasty looking Bounty Hunter on it. I damn near fell off the crawler but he started jumping up and down, which I assumed was the intergalactic sign of peace. Knowing we only had a few seconds to get on the balloon, I jumped up once then ran to make the leap.  He was right behind me on his speeder and when we were both safely inside quickly established our non-aggression pact. It was a great, albeit long, flight. Thodger, my new Imp friend, and I were showing off our companions and cool skills and discussing the game, when BAM! TOR screen. Then we're standing in the middle of the desert.

After exchanging WTFs, we mounted up and headed back to the launch point. As we approached, we saw the balloon. Going away from us. Now with probably an hour sunk into this endeavor, we were both a bit impatient and made our companions fight for entertainment. A hot chick fighting a midget (in this case, Jawa) is always fun to watch, which got me thinking about making book on a ""Companion Fighting Ring"" we could hold in the open world PvP on Tatooine, but I digress. After a while the balloon showed up so we headed back up top. As I am lining up for my jump, I see Thodgar say, ""please don't attack him"".  I turn around to see 3 red tags standing right behind me. I was pretty sure that was it for me but Xypin and Traxious were totally cool and we all jumped on the balloon for a pretty damn fun half hour ride. In fact the funniest thing to me was after we all got the datacrons, Xypin says ""Oh! Go scare the shit out of that Powertech!"" So I jump around the corner, the Powertech stops, turns and looks at me and promptly logs out. We all cracked up. 

I know that wasn't the most gripping tale as it was a fairly uneventful trip but I told it because this is the kind of thing that makes PvP servers awesome.  I will fondly remember today's adventure over any run through Karagga's Palace. And no doubt it only happened this way because of the 3 cool Imps that I hope I never see on Ilum ;)

Oh yeah, we never did figure out why the balloon disappeared on the first flight.

I said (and got an email verifying it) ""i just hope we don't see aion-style spammers ala 'W W W . B U Y T H I S' its annoying!""

got an email saying I was permabanned for ""Harassment - Advertising (mass or malicious)""

post on forums, tried calling support, tried email support. nothing (and this happened tuesday morning).

no help. finally cancelled my order before it was charged, going to reorder when the funds hit in 24 hours.

fair warning to other people, be extra careful when chatting. it was obviously a mistake (i'd rather have an overprotective bot/rmt guard, then a nonworking one like aion) and would get corrected, but the support is being hammered right now.

be careful, see you in a week!

edit: will add my update here - finally contacted support. gave me a free month but could only make the ban a week-long one instead of permab&amp;. thanks for all the nice comments! :D

That being said, I'm a long-time gamer and avid mmo enthusiast, and I have been compiling a list of minor complaints and/or peeves about this game since I started 2 days before launch. I have no guild (by choice) and only a couple real life friends who play, and I feel the need to vent some of my frustrations. Many of these things leave me thinking along the lines of ""Did we travel back to 1999? Diablo 2 pulled off 'X' mechanic better than this 12 years ago.""

**looking for group**: This is probably my biggest complaint to date, mainly because I love grouping with a team of people and wreaking havoc on a couple flashpoints and it's damn near impossible on my server to get it started. I understand that a lot of people don't want a ""dungeon finder"" tool, like WoW, that automatically queues and matches people. That's fine with me. For the love of god though, at least give us more space in the /who lfg comment to, you know, write down our spec/role, our flashpoint(s) and/or heroic quests of choice, and possibly even other characters you have/could play for something. In addition to that, a dedicated LFG chat channel with a little ""enter/leave LFG channel"" check-box in the preferences or something would be a huge step in the right direction. Drives me up a wall that, in a universe with light speed drives and holocalling that we can't send a damn text message to Quesh to see if anyone wants to run the foundry. The dev team has done an awesome job making cool and unique stories for each class/role. Now they need to keep it going and allow the part of the game that many people enjoy (dungeons and raiding) to be easier to get going. I want to heal. I enjoy healing. It's a powerful feeling to know that the lives of your group rest squarely in the palm of your hand. I respec'd in and out of it until my respec cost was like 22k or something and finally gave up until 50 because it is obnoxious to sit in town and spam chat for 45 minutes or an hour trying to find a group. Solo leveling as a full healing build is totally do-able but it is *slow as balls*. This shouldn't even be an issue in 2012, as other games have been doing it better for a decade or more.
 
**trade market**: The simple fact that I can't just type in (or, heres a novel idea, *link*) an item name and search for it makes me want to punch a baby in the throat. Why would you do this to us? What's the point of the drop down boxes being *mandatory* to fill out? Say I want to look at prices for Resolve Armoring 20. I *have* to click dropdown -&gt; item modification, dropdown -&gt; armoring, press search, *then* type in ""20"" in the search field and press enter. Why cant I just type ""armoring 20"" -&gt; enter -&gt; &lt;a list of items I wanted to see&gt;. Seriously, I'm going to have an aneurysm. 

Another thing about the trade market interface is the fact that you can't tell it to save your pricing. For instance, I have like a million mullinine (really, like 2-300) from UT that I have very little use for as my cybertech is 400 already. I want to sell it but no one is going to buy it in stacks of 100. You need like 4 at a time to make things. I take the time to break it into piles (another whole issue in itself) and the GUI can't even have the decency to remember what price I set the last stack at? C'mon guys, you're better than that.

**trade skills:** Only thing on the trade skills that grinds the gearage is that you can't link your ""cataloge"" into chat. Please just let me say ""[Cybertech 400] Looking for work"" with a link to what I can make. It just makes transactions smoother and easier than ""hey, I need such and such yadda, do you have that?"" ""no but I have yadda yadda whatever, is that cool?"" ""oh yeah, that thing is actually better blah blah blah"". They can just look and see what you have and then ask you to make something. That being said, I actually really like the trade skills mechanics. Lets you have professions while removing the really mundane bits (farming ore, crafting a million &lt;shit item here&gt;, etc). I'd much rather send my crew off for 45 minutes to complete some boring crap while I adventure. So good work on that.

**inventory/bank:** When I have a stack of something in my bank... and I have a stack of that same thing in my inventory... and I put the stuff from my inventory into my bank *it should automatically stack on the other stack*. All I have on this one is a good ol' ""wtf guys?"". The item icons are already pretty similar looking for materials, please don't make me sift through and restack that crap by hand.


**skill trees:** This one is more just personal observation of my own class (sith sorc). I have yet to play the other classes in-depth so I don't know if it's as bad elsewhere. In any case, the skill trees for the sorc are *cookie cutters*. I main raided as a mage (WoW), several times weekly, for 4 or 5 years. Among others of course, I have an 85 resto druid and a 60 warlock. The sorc in swtor is like an even more generic version of an affliction lock, an arcane mage, and a resto druid mix, almost to a T. Dots build, nukechannel/aoe build, healy build with a slow heal, a fast heal, an instant hot, a ground aoe hot, and a damage mitigation (bubble) of some sort. Like I said, don't know about other classes yet but the one I have played just seems like it is so... lack-luster.

**in-game support:** Alright, let me preface this bit with a neat little anecdotal segway. The other day, it was the holidays like it normally is around this time of year. I had been drinking a little (read: heavily) and I decided to play some swtor. Rock and roll time, right? Right. So I hop on and start trashing some quests right in their faceal regions, and, low and behold, I finish act 1! ""Tiiiits"", I thought, ""time to make a bangin' Legacy name"". Fast forward a day, I log in and notice that my legacy name is ""Urato'wel"". That's right, my drunken-ass self made my *Legacy* name ""you're a towel"". Permanently. For every character. Shit. ""Well,"" I thought, ""at least a GM would probably find this mildly funny, escalate the ticket, and help me fix this stupidity."" NOPE! I got essentially a prerecorded response from a ""protocol droid"" saying that, in no way, shape, or form is there any possible way to change anything about the name or legacy name of your character. Even with money. You can't even pay them *real money* to change the few bytes of (easily accessible) data that store your name. Do these people not want money? Is their goal to compete with the mmo market or have another SWG on their hands? Hell, if it would have been a real GM who messaged me and told me that he was sorry but they couldn't fix that at the current time, I would have been less upset about it. The whole ""greetings meatbag, this is protocol droid CV-861 and I am delighted to tell you that you are fucked squarely in the ass! If, in the future, the method for extracting dicks from buttholes becomes avaliable, we will let you know! Have a wonderful day!"" made me want to headbutt someone so hard that the bridge of their nose became securely lodged into their frontal lobe.

Anyway, doesn't really matter to me if you guys agree/disagree/don't give a shit. Feel free to comment, argue, rage, report me to bioware, go play a game, go outside, or whatever the hell else you might feel like doing. I just wanted to rant for a bit really.

All that being said, none of it will stop me from playing. None of it is *that* critical. It's just the type of shit that people who design a game should think about. The game shouldn't feel like it was designed by programmers for gamers, it should feel like it was designed by gamers for gamers, and made into reality by programmers. I want this game to survive because I think it has the potential, the dev team needs to listen to the community, be open to suggestions, and change the little irksome things in a quick and efficient manner. Even the smallest things, if you have to deal with them 150 times a day, will get horribly obnoxious over several months or even years of playing. Also, for the love of god, smooth out skill chaining please.

**tl;dr**: rabble rabble rabble *shakes fist* rabble rabble, swtor is a fun game overall.

**2:00pm-Operations/Flashpoints Discussion**

38% of level 50 players have played in an operation

We know there are lots of bugs – particularly in Eternity Vault

With game testing and feedback things go a lot smoother – i..e KP launch much bettr

looting system in normal needs improvements – we wanted to make it pug friendly so you don’t have to yield to masterloot – we will deviate from this a bit in the next update. another thing we want to do is allow you to trade destined loot

existing operations are pretty easy – we want hardmodes and nightmare be more challenging than they are right now

amoring debuffs from players stacking together – not suppose to – something we will address in the future
hard and nightmare give same loot – we know that. 

Explosive conflict: harder than current operations. needs a whole new level of coordinate rather than more gear and more stats. We want to focus on coordination and execution. 

Takes place on Denova, it will be tier 2 raid (KP and EV are tier 1 raids)

Nightmare mode will be a more serious channelnge

Nightmare mode of explosive conflict not launched with 1.2

changing normal mode to story diffculty mode to reflect the diffculty.

story mode of new raid is not too gear dependent

orange gear viability – in 1.2 you can extract all the mods and set bonuses. 

can reverse engineer operation gear for appearances

Nightmare mode for Explosive conflict will have a different gear tier than hardmode

future of operations: bug fiixng is the highest priorty

fight the boss not the game – more ingame animations to give you clue on boss abilities

Flashpoints: they are enjoyable but we need better endgame progression via flashpoints. We want to smmoth the curve to operations.

Difficult to find group: we are addressing that

Lost Island – finish the story started in patch 1.1

Group finder: introduced in game-update 1.3 – also for heroic quests and flashpoints. single server only. community is very important. 

 
Q&amp; A

Q: trash drop credits on operations to help pay repair bill? also what initiatives to allow high level players to help lower level players (reverse mentoring system)..A:  with 1.2 we don’t anticipate changes to the repair costs. We need to bring additional sinks in place if we want to change the repair costs. No ETA on reverse mentoring system

Q: will we see separate lockouts for hardmodes and nightmare with 1.2. A: no, hardmodes and nightmares are progression raids while story mode is more for socializing. 

Q: 16m and 8m A: we want them to have a relative diffculty, we will lower some of the stats on 16m bosses to counter the coordination issue of 16m. More loot in 16m, more bonus loots (mounts, recipes) but same tier of loot. 16m and 8m will have the same content for now.

Q: Timestamp achivement for boss kills to help foster competition? A: yes that is something we very much do. We love achievements. We want to reward server first kils things etc. These are long term plans, not something in the immediate horizon.

Q: not big difference between columi and rakata, bigger gear disparity in the new raid content? A: yes there will be more of a disparity – our earlier goal is to not inflate the stats too much. Tionese to columi has a big jump but the jump from columi to rakata is more something of a prestigous jump. New tier for pve and pvp coming, it will have more stats that makes sense (i.e. less accuracy). we are opening augments acorss all gear pieces that supports – so there is a separate system you can use to customize your character. With 1.1.5 we have lightsaber crystals with expertise on it. There is limited pvp crafting. There will be more disparity between pvp and pve gear. 

Q: threat meters, dps meters – are they coming? what is bioware’s stance? A: we want reliance on in-game visual cues but that is not we say we won’t give you dps and threat meters. We will have them in but just not in 1.2. We you to have control over what other see about your character – we went for the middle ground – in 1.2 you will be able to use a simple input in the chat system to see what defeated you. we also have a very detailed combat log you can write to your disk – someone enterprising can use it for their guild to see their performance but it will be out of game (3rd party). 

Q: is craftable gear comparable to endgame pvp/pve gear? A: yes but we wil deter it to another panel.

Q: space missions – interesting but any plans to implant them into flashpoints/operations? A: we have a secret project for space missions in the works right now – can’t give you more details.

Q: enrage mechanics – is that soemthing we will see across the board? It limits the standard build you can take and have guaranteed success. A: intention is that in 8 man you have 2 tanks but that didn’t work out too well. with 1.2 you going need a lot more coordinate and tank –trading you will need 2 tanks for 1.2 raid content. 

Q: lucas style of fighting? players split to do stuff – like 2 guys fighting a sith, 2 guys do something else? A: ancient pylons is soemthing we have tried but it is definitely something we are interested in looking into. 

Q: 16m intended to be harder than 8m? A: the idea is to keep the diffculty level betwene the two as close as possible – we will make 16m bosses a bit easier to compensate for the raid coordinattion in 16m. 

Q: as an ops leader are we going to get more tools to shift people around in ops groups? A: On the UI panel there is more discussion but yes we want to have more options. 

Q: ready check system for flashpoints and operations? A: we don’t have a ready check? I am going back to the office and get that in. 

Q: are we going to implent hardmdoes for flashpoints that currently do not have them? A; yes eventually we will be. can’t say when exactly. 

Q: you can reverse eng ops gear – can you get schematics from that? A: yes, we will talk about it later. 
Q: flashpoints – another diffculty added to flashpoints A: not in the near future. we will keep adding new flashpoints and the flashpoints are going to get harder. 

Q: Dynamic style operations? i.e. more open world A: yes in 1.2 we will have open world bosses.

Gotta say that first. But, I love roleplaying female characters. I'm also really friendly and tend to help newer players out.

A couple of people have simply assumed I was a girl, and if they assume it I don't typically correct them. It makes the roleplaying more fun, and I am always fascinated by how differently you get treated. I justify it to myself as a sociological experiment. Most of the time, they just hit on you, I frown and gently rebuff them. I think ""well, they're happy to see a girl"", and continue.

Anyway, I was helping this dude out and he became rather attached, messaged me every time I came online, referred to me in a demeaning manner, and even though I was neutral to all his advances, within a few days he asked me to marry him.

This must be what it is like for girl gamers all the time :( I'm so sorry.

**TL;DR: If I was a girl, I'd never say it. It sucks.**

Girls, you know you've had similar experiences. Any gems you'd like to share?

*Edit:* Wow! This thread gained far more traction than I expected! It's excellent to have a medium to discuss these issues; they're important and it's a shame they aren't seen in the broader gaming dialogue.

**Major Edit:** The responses that have shown up in here are truly illuminating. Thank everyone so very much for sharing. A good friend of mine is a rising video game blogger and we have agreed to co-author a story about gender identities in MMOs. We will try to pull as much info as we can on the topic, so if anyone has any other threads/links to share where similar discussions have taken place, those would be appreciated.

1325715744.0,170,self.swtor,o32sq,New Year's PvP Update. (Developer Blog),217,47,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/o32sq/new_years_pvp_update_developer_blog/,"Fellow PvPers, thank you for taking on the challenge of player vs player combat in The Old Republic!

In the first week after launch there were over a million Warzone matches played, with nearly half of all players participating in Warzones. Bad news for Republic players, though - the Empire currently leads overall, having won 53% of all Alderaan Civil War and Voidstar matches (across all servers). Huttball has been played the most, accounting for 39% of all matches – and yes, we’ll be adding a new same faction vs. same faction enabled Warzone in the future.

We are all really excited at the tremendous volume of participation we’ve seen in PvP thus far. Your interest and demand dictates what we’ll be delivering in the near future. I wanted to give you some insight into where we are with PvP development and where we are going.

First and foremost here is what we are addressing as a top priority:

Level 50 Bracket Warzones: Level 50 players will have a bracket of their own, playing in separate Warzone matches to lower level players. This is something we have wanted to do for some time and now that there is an increasing number of level 50 players we will be implementing the feature in January.

Open World PvP on Ilum: The planet of Ilum currently allows for open world PvP even on a PvE server, but the mechanics and incentives of the planet are not in as intended yet. We’re working on longer term goals for the planet and for other PvP areas, but expect to see some interim adjustments in January - such as more respawn points to focus conflicts, restricting Companion Characters from the area, and revisions to rewards. Ilum will also become a major source of Valor. Valor buffs will increase and decrease based on the objectives your faction owns. These buffs increase the amount of Valor you receive per player kill. However they do not give anything in and of themselves, so players will still need to defeat other players for significant Valor rewards. Additionally, daily and weekly missions will require player kills to complete. Player kills for quests and Valor credit will have diminishing returns per player killed. So, the more players that are fighting other players, the better it is for everyone.

Combat Gameplay: You’ll see several optimizations come online in January, and we are going to continue to tune this as time goes on.

We also have other exciting features coming in the near future including Ranked Warzone Matches, PvP Stat Tracking, Open World PvP Loot Drops, more Warzone medals for different objectives, Guard Optimizations and Target Optimizations.

Additionally we’re looking at ways to enable team vs. team, more level brackets and the ability to choose which Warzone you want to play in.

This is not a complete list of everything we’re working on that’s PvP related, but we have to keep some surprises for later! Thanks again for all your feedback and please keep it coming. We read as much as we can then cross reference with metrics to take action on features and tuning the game to ensure an enjoyable and competitive PvP community.

I wanted it to make very clear to everyone that both The Reddit Republic and The Reddit Empire have both decided to move to the Death Wind Corridor server.


It has come to our attention that the original server that we were assigned to, Kinrath Spider, was declared the unofficial Brazilian server.  Due to the information provided and the testimony given as what that would look like for us as a guild, we have decided that it would be better for the long term success of our guild to move servers now rather than down the road.

If this affects you, please see the posts explaining the server move in both the /r/redditrepublic and /r/redditempire subreddits.  If you have any questions  feel free to ask me, and be patient as we work this out.


Thank you.

I have hinted at its existence before and many people have asked me about it but I kept pushing its release date back and back due to getting sidetracked. I finally decided May 15 would be a good date to finally release it to the public. It is not where near completion and if I worked on it alone it would probably still not complete a year from now. Quite a a few of us  will be playing the other game today but for those who are not, I thought this would be a nice treat :)

**Why Tor-fashion.com?**

Tor-fashion.com is a project idea I shared with Zoopercat from AskMrRobot.com a while back. With every patch in SWTOR, we are seeing an increasing in the popularity of orange customizable gear. The upcoming patch 1.3 I think will be huge for orange gear proliferation due to the addition of augment tables and social gear that scale to your armor type. I have dubbed patch 1.3 the start of something I called the **Orange Revolution** (a bit dramatic I know). However, one thing that is missing from SWTOR is a place where you can view high resolution screenshots of people wearing orange armor sets. Sure there is the preview window but it is such low res that it doesn't do the armor models justice. There is also Torhead where sometimes if you are lucky you can find some screenshots people submitted for particular pieces of a set etc. Anyways, the point I am getting at is that the options we have right now are insufficient. Everyday you see people asking what is that gorgeous looking armor set, how do you get armor set, how does this set look etc. Bioware artists have created literally thousands of different armor models but sadly most us only get to see maybe 10% of that during our in-game lifetime. 

**What is Tor-fashion.com?**

Tor-fashion.com is a project I started with AMR to attempt to fill the void. It focuses on full orange armor sets with good quality screenshots of actual people wearing them. It is a very manual process as I need to first get my hands on the set (GTN, bugging crafters on my server, grinding social points, sending tells to random players on the fleet, etc) and then get people to wear/model them for me so I can get good quality screenshots. 

The end goal of this project is to 

1) Have a list of all the moddable (orange or purple) armor sets in the game with high quality in-game screenshots (front, back, front closeup showing the detailed textures of upper torso and helmet)

2) Every set should have an Imperial version and a Republic version at least (unless they are faction specific)

3) Every set should also have a female and male screenshots. 

4) If I want to get really fancy, every set should also have models that are of different body types as armor look different with a character's width. 

**What is available at release?**

* [Social armor sets](http://tor-fashion.com/social-gear-sets/) (missing the Corellia rank 6 outfit and the male versions)

* [Armormech crafted orange sets](http://tor-fashion.com/armormech-crafted-sets/) (some of the sets only have screenshots for one faction)

* [Synthweaver crafted orange sets](http://tor-fashion.com/synthweaver-crafted-sets/) (some of the sets only have screenshots for one faction)

* [End-game armors sets](http://tor-fashion.com/endgame-armor-sets/) (War Hero, Rakata, Battlemaster are well cataloged but the rest are stilling missing lots)

* [Planetary &amp; Flashpoint](http://tor-fashion.com/heroic-quest-gear-sets/) (Missing quite alot unfortunately. Alot of the planetary sets have set pieces missing due to removal from the game or some are just random drops off mobs)

**How can you help?**

I have made it really easy (I hope) to contribute. If you have an orange set that isn't listed or if you find a set with missing pictures etc, you can simply took a couple screenshots and submit it to the website. http://tor-fashion.com/submit-a-pic/

Your character name and server will be reflected on the page for that set to give you credit. 

To maintain the quality of images and uniformity of the site, there are a couple image requirements like max in-game graphic settings, good lighting etc for the image submission. If your computer can't handle it or you don't know how to do it, I would be happy to create a character on your server and meet up to take some screenshots for you. 


Anyways, I mentioned this before and I will do again for emphasis, this project is no where complete. If you visit it hoping to find images for every orange set in-game with Republic and Imperial, Female &amp; Male, Size 1 and Size 4 equivalents, you will be disappointed. However, with the help from the SWTOR community, I am hoping that will be a reality one day. 

It is my hopes that this project will get to a stage that it will be a great asset for 1.3 when you have alot more flexibility in your SWTOR fashion!                                2/5

Some sets that I really like 

Voss mystic - social 5 http://tor-fashion.com/2012/05/12/voss-mystic/

Hoth Hailstorm brotherhood - social 4 (very unique look) http://tor-fashion.com/2012/05/11/hailstorm-brotherhood/

The overall reaction to the art direction was pretty negative. Since there I have gotten quite a few requests to post the male model version and also some in-game screenshots if possible.

Luckily both my alt and my main got xfered over to the PTS, my alt is an armormech and  my main is a synthweaver. This took a bit but I managed to get all 8 sets (4 sets per faction) crafted and find people who can actually wear it (requires valor rank 70). All the screenshots were taken in max graphical settings in game (including using the high res textures coming up in 1.2) and I also went to my ATI thingie and cranked up all the settings. 

Anyways, I think they look alot better in game with high graphic settings. There are two links here, pick one which you like better :) Oh in case anyone asks why is the agent/assassin wearing two pistol blasters: the person wearing it is a bounty hunter and he forgot to unequip his weapon heh.

So it's pretty much all the gear you get towards and in the end-game.

In the release build, there is one change that takes away everything I loved about the Item Customization in this game, and the change is:  
  
""- Modifiable Artifact quality items now only feature modification and enhancement slots.""  
  
Now let me explain in a newcomer terms, what that means:  
  
Before the change, all higher quality items had Modification Slots. For example in a lightsaber you had a Hilt slot, color crystal slot, enhancement slot and Mod slot.  
  
All the modifications came with stats, color crystal determined lightsaber color and hilt changed the quality and base stats of the item, in this case min-max damage.  
  
You could swap around the modifications as much as you like so if you found a cooler looking lightsaber that had better hilt and color crystal but poor enhancement and mod, you could mix and match both of them to create a new lightsaber with the look and stats you want.  

Now with the change introduced in this build, most of the Artifact items(purple, epic quality items) Have only 2 slots, mod slot and enhancement slot, both of them just add stats to the weapon, so you can't remove the important modification, like the hilt, and use it in the lightsaber of your choice to bring it to the same level of that epic weapon(stat-wise). 
  
What it means is that if you go to a raid(operation) and an epic lightsaber drops, you won't be able to take the parts from it and jam in your favourite lightsaber, making it essentialy the same item stats wise but suited to your likings.  
  
Same goes for armor slots, now if you are raiding as a bounty hunter, you will have to look like every other raiding bounty hunter or suffer from decreased stats, armor and base item damage.  
  
It's a big slap in the face because I really loved that and being able to choose your look was a big selling point of this game for me.

I've never played MMOs before, but some friends convinced me to preorder SWTOR. We played for months, and I was having the time of my life. Never once got bored of the story or of the landscapes.

Then my guildies for some reason got sick of SWTOR and decided to switch back to WoW. Reluctantly, I unsubbed (as it was no fun playing alone) and bought WoW.

Holy shit. I am so amazed by how much more immersive the story and the characters are in SWTOR. Every single line of dialogue is voice acted (well ok, maybe 85%) and cutscened. The moral choices you make affect your character. You don't *have* a character...you *are* your character. You have a space ship and you participate in a story that has a direct impact on the entire galaxy.

WoW has a huge, expansive world. I'll give it credit for that. But so far (1-81), I have done nothing but grind. That's it. There is no story. There is no voice acting. There are no choices to make. There is just grinding. I never once had to grind in SWTOR.

(Plus, in SWTOR, a level 50 can't one-shot a level 46. Unlike in WoW, where I can't do any solo questing or grinding without a level 85 killing me every turn of the way.)

Some friends of mine said I was a complete fool for this, but after feeling bleh from the Jedi Knight story, I've got back on my saddle. I've played all the other classes to 10, and I'm concurrently leveling Trooper to Bounty Hunter to 50, with plans to play another class once I reach that. 

For reasons that are entirely personal, I completely loathe and despise the end-game system of tiered gear and grinding dailies. I'm totally cool with it existing and other people enjoying it, it just holds zero appeal to me. My fun from the game is coming entirely from the experience of questing levels 1-50 in each class, and I'm really having a blast with it.

Just wondering if I'm a rare breed, or if other players are doing the same thing.

With the free time my forever alone life gives me, I can see myself reaching 50 on every class in around 4-5 months if I don't get burned out. I expect I'll probably end my subscription then, and come back when new class content or expansions are introduced, and look at the game fondly overall.

Be aware that servers are currently under heavy load! The website is freaking out right now. If your placement isn't showing up, wait a little bit and reload the page. Have patience! I know this is super exciting for everyone.

Congratulations to everyone! Looking forward to seeing you all at launch!

So I went to the GTN and found the robe for 35k (I had a balance of 37k). I also saw Revens chest for sale for 50K (the cheapest there was out of all the other priced at 350K) so I grinded for about 2 hours to gain the 48K needed, I was successful in gaining this amount and quickly rushed back to the Imp fleet to make my purchase. However, when I arrived at the vendor, to my dismay the chest had already been sold. I was heartbroken (to a degree). 

My reaction to this was me immediately wanting to raise 350K for the more expensive chest (I REALLY WANTED THE CHEST), so I thought I would make it a joke by posting in general ""Who wants to invest 350K in me so I can buy Revans Chest? :3"" The immediate reaction was ""350K? Thats 300K overpriced"" or ""Your an idiot if you want to pay that"". 
But when I was about to leave the station on my great and stupid quest, a player named ""Reapz"" sent me a whisper saying ""I can give you one for 100K :)"". Even though he offered me an amazing price, I was still unable to pay it off, however I asked if I payed him 50k now and pay off the other 50K. ""Sure :)"" 

When we finally met to trade, he posted the chest in the trade window and I posted my 50K, but out of the blue he said ""Take back your money, Im giving you the chest for free"". I was ecstatic at this and the moment we both accepted the trade I put the chest on and did as many /love's as I could to Reapz. He said I was more than welcome and them ran off to do The Foundry, [ to meet with the real Revan.](/spoiler)

Im just sharing this with r/swtor to show there are awesome and generous people in SWTOR and even though it has faced a massive player loss, the best of the original group are still around.

While I was admiring my collection, I noticed a lack of current compendiums/catalogs for SWTOR speeders. The existing ones are either filled with speeders that never even existed in-game or contain images that doesn't really do the speeders justice. 

I took on the task of taking high res screenshots and creating a compendium of all the SWTOR speeders that exists in the game. With the help of the awesome Harbinger community, I was able to get 4 screenshots on each of the 48 speeders currently in-game (44 are still obtainable, the 4 Korrealis ones are discontinued since 1.2). 

Something that I found pretty neat while doing this project was that all the speeders belonged to a family, there are 14 families in total with Aratech family having the most members. I have organized all the speeders according to their family so that you could see this as well. 

Anyways, I hope this will help some of you that are currently in the process of establishing a collection or those who may not have the opportunity to see some of them.

Yesterday after The Bastion server came back up, various people got rolled back and lost quite a lot of things. I myself lost about 4 cartel packs worth of stuff, and the worst part was that the coins weren't even refunded. I made a ticket about it and everything but no response yet, however a couple of people did contact support and they were told that nobody would be getting any of the items they lost back, and cartel coins would not be refunded.  Please help bring attention to this because it is an unacceptable way to treat your paying customers.

**tldr**; After server went down yesterday, a roll back occurred and cartel coins along with items were lost. Support has essentially said, though luck.

**EDIT**: So after about 2 hours of waiting on the skype phone, I finally got an answer. I told them what the problem was, and gave them the approximate time along with the first ticket number I had filled out. The guy said that they would be putting someone on it to look into it and find out what items I lost so that they could restore them. He said they'd be in contact. SO now I play the waiting game.

But here it goes:

1.)  Now that we are pushing mid April with no 1.2 (was originally slated for early March) will SWTOR bring back people who have left or has too much time passed that they have moved on to other games?

2.) Is the content being added a game savior?  Is it enough for people to keep playing?  Based on the amount of time it took to release this major update, how much confidence do you have that new content will keep coming quickly enough to sate players' appetites?

3.) In retrospect do you think Bioware should have released specific items from this major patch in dribs and drabs over the past couple months instead of holding back everything for so long?  Say, the new WZ one week, the new FP another etc?

I ask these questions based on my own experience and feelings.  My guild of 25+ active players, is now being completely gone from the game.  Based on a post I put on our forums (we have played multiple games together going back to EQ) asking if anyone was coming back for 1.2, there were NO responses.  I think the wait was too much and they are engrossed in other games now.  

Opinions?

1376443374.0,154,self.swtor,1kbhzt,A guide to the upcoming Bounty Contract Week,168,14,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1kbhzt/a_guide_to_the_upcoming_bounty_contract_week/,"Hey everyone, as you all know by now, the Bounty Contract Week event will start off tomorrow. Bioware havn't announced a time yet. Here are some information I have typed up that may help you with the upcoming event if you havn't experienced it first hand on the PTS. 

**Important change**

* They made it so that the Completed Bounty Contracts you get are tradeable. This means you can unlock Kingpin bounties on day 1 on a character if you trade them all to one character or buy them from other players. 

**Where do I go?**

* Once the event have started, head to main fleet and look for NPCs standing around carbonized bounties. They are usually around the intersections between the big quadrants on the fleet. 

* Talking to them will give you a one time mission to head to the Cartel Bazaar (south most end of the fleet for Empire players, northmost end of the fleet for Republic players). 

* From the Cartel Bazaar, you will see mission terminals that will give you the missions for bounties.

* You need to be level 15 + to participate. 

* This event only lasts 1 week every month so make sure to do them when it is on or you will have to wait for the next month. 

**Henchman Bounties**

* You will start off with Henchman Bounties for the first 5 days of the event. The mission terminal have a choice of 6 planets and you can **pick any one of them** to start off. (These missions do have level requirements but if you are above Level 42 you can do any of the planets).

* You can only do 1 Henchman bounty per day per character. However, most of you will probably have more than one character so you can do more than one henchman bounties per day.

* Each Henchman bounty you do will give you a Completed Bounty Contact (in addition to a blue rep item and some basic commendations), which is actually tradeable. 

* Once you have 5 Completed Bounty Contracts on a character, you can unlock Kingpin bounties on that character. Since the Completed Bounty contracts are tradeable, you can send them all to one character or buy from other places and unlock Kingpin bounties sooner. 

* Henchman Bounties follow a basic pattern: 

    1) Travel to planet X 

    2) Short convo with the NPC in planet X 

    3) Collect info from shady characters located in a cantina somewhere in planet X 

    4) Talk to a contact with some short convo/same sex flirt options 

    5) Locate the Henchman target and either kill or capture them.

* The main road block will be in step 3, getting info from the Shady Characters. There is a limited number of them and once someone has interacted with them, you will need to wait for them to despawn and respawn (&lt;1 min). On top of that, not every interaction with them is successful (~30% failure rate?)

* To interact with them, you can either use the investigation probe given by the mission or purchase Drinks (give light points) and Interrogation Probes (give dark points). All three of them share a global cooldown but they also have individual cooldowns that are bit longer. The most optimal way I find is to pair either Drinks or Interrogation Probe with the Investigation Probe so you can use one of them as soon as the global cooldown is over. 

* You do not need to stand and wait for the Shady Characters once you have interacted with them. Move onto the next Shady Character immediately. 

* I have drawn maps with locations of most Shady Characters for every planet in my Henchman guide. They might come in handy for tricky locations like Hutta/Dromund Kaas. 

* You can try group up with other players to make step 3 faster.

* Once you get to the Henchman target, the fight is pretty simple but you have to pay attention near the end of the fight. Once the Henchman target is at 10% or below, you can use the carbonize stream provided by the quest item to capture that target. Alternative, you can simply kill the Henchman. 

* For every Henchman (there are 8 in total), there are achievements for both capturing and killing all of them. You have to keep track of who you killed and who you captured if you want to complete the achievement in a reasonable amount of time. I have a word document below you can print out or use to keep track (or make your own). 

* There are five possible Henchmans for every planet and which one you get is purely random. In addition, each Henchman can be encountered in at least 3-4 planets. Out of the eight Henchmans, there are some that may appear very rare to you simply due to RNG.

* In the later months of Bounty Contract Week, when you are just hunting for achievements, you can simply reset the mission if you don't get the Henchman you need but you will need to repeat step 2-5 all over again.  

**Kingpin Bounties**

* You will need to have 5 Completed Bounty Contracts to unlock a Kingpin mission. 

* Each unlock is character specific and once unlocked, you can keep doing that Kingpin mission daily on that character. 

* Like Henchman bounties, you can only do 1 Kingpin bounty per day per character. 

* Once you picked up the Kingpin mission for a specific planet, the Henchman bounty for that same planet will disappear from the mission terminal. It will re-appear once you have finished the Kingpin mission and turned it in. This was done I believe to prevent people from picking kingpin and henchman bounty for the same planet at the same time, thus saving some traveling time. 

* Each unlock will give you a blue rep item, and each completed Kingpin bounty will reward you with a blue rep item. 

* Once you have unlocked your first Kingpin bounty, your next Kingpin bounty unlock on the same character should be faster since you are earning 2 Completed Bounty contracts per day instead of 1. 

* Kingpin bounties follows a different pattern

    1) Travel to Planet X

    2) A different short convo with same NPC on planet X

    3) You get sent to a location to release some bounty probes and then you will use provided macrobinoculars to scan them (fairly easy to find). 

    4) Once you scanned 5 bounty probes, the location for the Kingpin will be revealed and you can either kill or capture him.


* The bottleneck for Kingpin bounties will be at step 4 since there is only one Kingpin per planet. Kingpins can be soloed if you are in say at least Arkanian/Black Market gear but it is always faster to do it with other players and reduce the lineup at the same time. 

* Like with the Henchmans, there are achievements for capturing and killing all of them. However, this one is much easier to get since there is no RNG involved.

1318947197.0,154,self.swtor,lga9n,General impressions of beta from a WoW veteran (state of the game).,188,34,290,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/lga9n/general_impressions_of_beta_from_a_wow_veteran/,"swtor.com is down for maintenance for most of the day I think and I'm not sure but the beta servers might be down too.  I'm at work so I can't try to log in to check that right now.  Work is slow, however, and I'm bored, so I'll write out some impressions that I've had so far of the beta.

I was going to break this down into ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" but I don't really feel like there is too much that fits into the latter two categories.  At least, I haven't run across anything completely game-breaking in beta yet, which is really the only thing I'd put in the ""ugly"" category.  Instead I'll just talk about my perspective coming into the game and what I've gotten out of it so far.

First of all, I'm a real sucker for animations.  I think that, for MMOs in particular, the animations make or break a game.  I have, for instance, played Rift and feel like the characters are stunted, wooden puppets without much range of motion.  The attack animations in Rift (et al.) are boring and unimaginative to the point that, by level 10 you're really hoping for something new and not getting it.  In part I think this is one of the reasons why WoW was so successful, that their character animations had *weight*... *gravitas* if you will.  They might not have been extremely *realistic* but they looked good, ran smoothly and didn't rake your nerves even after hundreds of hours worth of gameplay.

The Old Republic is the same way.  I had been following the development of this game for several years, and watching every beta leak I could get my hands on before I got into the beta.  I originally thought that I'd play a trooper, but I figured that the animations for shooting that blaster rifle wouldn't be ""true to life,"" making me really dislike the class.  I'm pleased to say that your rifle follows the target in 2 axes and looks pretty bad ass when you're pumping rounds into a prone sith in a warzone (like [this guy on the left in particular](http://man-over-board.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/swat-cat.jpg)).

This is probably not as big a deal to a lot of people as it is to me.  It's not the quality of the graphical and textural rendering that matters as much to me as how the characters interact with their environment.  For SWtoR, it is seamless and really well done.

Too, the environments are great.  I've seen a lot of people worry about the size of zones, complaining about the ""lack of free roaming""... blah blah.  Meh.  Listen, the starting zones are not any smaller than the biggest WoW zone and Coruscant (second planet you go to on Republic side) is so big that it's almost kind of annoying to have to run from one end of a sub-zone to the other (there are 5 subzones within Coruscant ... six maybe I can't remember off the top of my head).  And Taris, one of the planets you can go to after Coruscant, is just goddamned huge.  And freakin' beautiful.  Taris is so awesome looking its hard to describe.

As for game play, I've played every class on republic side up to the point of picking an AC and several I've played farther than that.  Every class has been fun and engaging.  Every class plays completely differently than the last.  I'm going to refrain from saying what classes and levels I am because I'm pretty paranoid about losing my beta access, but I will say that I've enjoyed every class and, because they're all so good, STILL can't decide what I'll play as my main when this thing goes live.

One of the big things that is being screamed about in the forums is the change to the ""mod system"" that had been in the previous build.  Prior to the current build almost every piece of gear had ""slots"" (kind of like gem slots in WoW) and you could put various upgrades into those slots to improve the item.  The mods were either crafted by the various professions or looted from mobs/chests or as quest rewards.  The thing that people really liked was being able to find, say, a piece of gear you really liked the look of at level 10 or whatever, and being able to keep it and scale it with your level by replacing it with better (level dependent) mods.   

The current build almost entirely struck the mod system by removing most slots on non-epic and lower-level gear.  There is still moddable gear, but it usually is of the rare and ultra rare (orange) variety.  People on the forums have been in an uproar about it, saying how much they loved the old system and threatening to not buy the game if they don't reinstate it yadda yadda.  Somehow this bled over into the general forums and there have been several threads complaining about this change by people who haven't even played the game.

The fact is that it has been made known that the system is undergoing some changes and that modding will return in some compromised form in a later build.  It was clear (to me at least, other people are clearly doomsaying conspiracy theorists) that there was no way BioWare was going to build an entire gear system and then scrap the whole thing a couple of months before launch.  No, it just needed some alterations so they took it out for a while to bring it to where they wanted it to be.

As for other aspects of the game: 

1) There are just a shit ton of lightning-throwing Sith inquisitors in PvP.  It's just stupid out there honestly.  Way more diverse crowd on the Republic side.

2) Warzones are great, I have no complaints (other than Sith inquisitors).

3) Voice acting is superb and it can't be stated enough: this changes the whole MMO experience.  I can say that listening to every moment of every conversation takes a whole lot of time and I don't mind one bit.

4) Some of the class specs are hard to define in terms of play style.  Just looking at the trees for, say, a trooper, you have a mix of ranged and melee attacks which seems to lend itself to really dynamic play.  It's not like WoW where you do this one thing all the time (spam fireball, shoot bow, swing sword) but involves a mix of various kinds of abilities which, to be honest, is pretty cool.

5) Space combat is fun I think.  A lot of people have complained about BioWare not upping the ante by having a full 3-D free-roaming space shooter *on top* of this already massive game, but I don't give one fuck.  I like the shooter the way it is.  I will say this though: you can buy some ship upgrades on Coruscant right after you get your ship: DO IT.  In the current state of those space missions its really hard to complete them without at least a couple upgrades.  They're not expensive, just necessary as it stands right now (which may change of course).

That's about all I have for now.  I might be able to answer a few questions throughout the day if anyone wants to ask anything general.  Like I said I don't want to give away too many details of what classes/specs/levels I've made.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,False,,,True,t3_lga9n,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/lga9n/general_impressions_of_beta_from_a_wow_veteran/,

1325054607.0,147,self.swtor,ntbjr,DAE wish MMO's like SWTOR kept economists/business people on the design staff to help guide the games economy?,260,113,271,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/ntbjr/dae_wish_mmos_like_swtor_kept_economistsbusiness/,"I've studied economics at university and earned a double major in business related fields.  This is my two cents on how the SWTOR economy will handle the slicing nerf.

Yes, this is prompted by the slicing nerf.  Whatever your personal opinions are on slicing, very, VERY few people in this subreddit seem to grasp the fact that the SWTOR economy is about to seriously deflate.

Most people seem to be of the persuation that 

&gt; ""lol you n00bs that took slicing should just pick a different profession and sell your mats to make money like the rest of us DERP""

but what people aren't thinking about is that economics is rarely that simple.  Most people that were making an excellent living on crafted items were doing so because slicing was the ONLY way, other than questing and PvP, of bringing more money into the SWTOR economy.  

Now that slicing is gone, demand for GTN goods is going to plummet, meaning that prices will fall drastically and those people who are bragging about how much money they make selling implants and the like are going to feel the pinch just as bad if not worse than the players who had slicing as a profession.

The influx of currency in this game was cut by, on average, somewhere around 70% with the slicing nerf taking into account the ""buffer"" from PvP and questing cash influx.

That means prices, on average, will drop by approximately the same amount.

It's not the GTN that's the problem, though...if prices fall so be it, everything will just even out, right?

Wrong.

Exorbitantly prices skill training, NOT including ridiculously priced speeder training, is far more important to players than buying goods from the GTN.  As a result, players will be saving their money for those instead.  THIS is where the true problem lies.

At least if money is being spent in the GTN, it stays (mostly, after commission) in the SWTOR economy; skill training removes that money from the economy altogether.

With so little true expendable income in the game, GTN goods may well fall further than 70% of their current values, making earning an in game living MUCH more difficult for EVERYONE.

This is why one of two things must happen in the near future:

1. Slicing gets buffed again, but no where near where it was prior to the nerf.  Slicing WAS somewhat OP, but the current nerf removes far too many credits from the economy to keep it stable at current skill training costs.

2. Skill training costs will be significantly lowered.  The only way for the games economy to properly survive after the slicing nerf if it remains unchanged is to lower the cost of skills to keep more credits in the SWTOR economy.

3. Vendor prices when selling items/quest rewards/pvp rewards will rise to raise the influx of cash into the economy.

Thoughts?

tl;dr - The slicing nerf ""ceteris paribus"" (there was a definite need for a nerf, just not this big) is unsustainable and I've listed three alternatives.

**Q: Where can I learn my Advanced Class?**

You must finish your class story in your starter planet, reach level 10 and go to the fleet. As soon as you reach the fleet and take the elevator to the center, there will be a quest giver right in front of you. [One of these 4 guys](http://i.imgur.com/dAytc.jpg) will have a quest for you depending on your class, which will direct you to your AC trainer.

**Q: Can I change my Advanced Class?**

There is currently no way to change your Advanced Class and Bioware said there might be a possibility to chance it once but do not take my word for it.

**Tip: Do not forget that you have to [switch tabs](http://i.imgur.com/QOygT.jpg) at the trainer to learn your Class skills and Advanced Class skills.**

**Q: Where can I learn Speeder Training?**

You can learn your Speeder Training at your class trainer.

**Q:When do I get my ship?**

Depending on how fast you do your class quests, you should usually get it around level 16-18

**Q: What is the Fleet?**

Fleet is a place where you will find almost everything you want. Recommendation vendors for each planet, PvP Vendors, Class Trainers,  Galactic Trade Network, VIP/CE Vendors, Speeder Vendors, Skill Mentor, Crew Skill trainers. Also almost every Flashpoint will be accessed from here. [Here's a map](http://i.imgur.com/mzv3l.jpg) to help you a little bit to show where you can find some vendors and important NPCs.

**Q: What is Legacy and how can I get a Legacy name?**

Legacy is a system Bioware implemented which will help your character and your alts in the same server as you progress. At the moment you can only get a legacy name which will be shared with all the characters in your server (Empire or Republic). But Bioware is planning on Legacy perks like XP boost for alts and additional Races (not final)

Legacy will be enabled when you finish Act I on a character (which is usually after Alderaan around level 30-33).

You can choose to show your Legacy name in 2 ways; (for sake of example your name is Luke and your legacy name is Skywalker

You can choose it to look like a Last name, which will show it as *Luke Skywalker*. You can choose to show titles with it, which will look like *Jedi Luke Skywalker* or *Luke Skywalker the Pilot*.

Another way is to show it like a Title, which will be placed under your name like a guild name and will look like *The Skywalker Legacy*.

**Q: What are crew skills and how do they work.**

There are 3 types of Crew Skills and you can have one of each;

Gathering, Mission and Crafting.

Crafting will require mats you get from Mission and Gathering crew skills. For the relation between them you can look at this [picture.](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6449479755_882a07fb9c_b.jpg)

For more information like basics, reverse engineering, qualities you can look at [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/k5mcd/tor_itemization_and_crafting_info_relevant/) 

**Q:How can I get more recipes?**

Your Crafting Crew Trainer will teach you more items as you level that skill. Some Gathering missions will also randomly give you some crafting recipes.

**Q: What are Flashpoints?**

Flashpoints are 4 man Dungeons(for those that are not familiar with WoW/MMOs, they are a phased PVE area with objectives in them.) that will drop great loot for your level. They are not required but they are a nice break from constant questing and fun.

The very first Flashpoint you will encounter is Esseles/Black Talon (For Republic and Empire respectively). You will be able to do this flashpoint when you finish your starter planet and go to your Fleet.

**Q: How can I PvP and what is a Warzone?**

There are 2 ways to PvP. You can either do World PvP, which is killing opposite faction in a contested Planet while questing (Only in PvP servers) or you can queue for Warzones, which are... Warzones with objectives in them that you are required to do if you want to win the match.

There are currently 3 types of Warzones and you can only queue Random and not a specific one. These are;

Huttball: Somewhat a CTF but there is only 1 flag (The ball) and the objective is to take the ball to behind the enemy line (Which is on their end).

The Civil War/Alderaan: This is more like a capture the base/Arathi Basin. This map has 3 points that you can capture. There are 2 side bases and one in the middle. Capturing bases will start reducing points from enemy, having more bases will start reducing enemy points faster. Also note that even if you have 2 bases your base will still lose points if the enemy has a base so if you are very behind, you will lose eventually even if you manage to hold onto 2 bases.


**Tip: If you hold a side base, there will be an extra speeder next to a normal one which will take you directly to the side base.**

The Voidstar: This can be compared to Strand of the Ancients. This is a 2 part game, where each team will defend and attack. The attackers objective is to plant bombs to doors (2 in each phase, 3 phases total) and protect them till they explode, reach the final node. Defenders objective is to prevent the enemy team reaching the final node by not allowing them to plant bombs or defusing them. If one team manages to reach the node and other one doesn't, the one that reaches wins.

If both teams manage to reach the node, the one that reached it faster will win (confirmation needed)

If both teams do not manage to reach the node, the one that progressed more will win (confirmation needed).

Tips: 

* You can press space to skip the dialogue, especially if you did that quest before and just do not want to listen to the same dialogues over and over again.

* If you chose the wrong option during a dialogue (such as darkside/lightside or companion affection) You can press ESC button to cancel the whole dialogue and start from beginning.

*Mousebutton 4 or Numlock is default for auto-walk.

*You can see if that dialogue option gives dark side or light side points by hovering over it.

*You can access the Fleet using your Fleet Pass. It's a General Skill, but is not added to hotbars by default. It has an 18 hour timer. If you have an Authenticator, you can also purchase 1-use passes to the Fleet for 1,000CR. You can also access the Fleet from some locations on certain planets, which is a great shortcut from going all the way to the spaceport, going in your ship, flying to the Fleet etc...

*If you use Light Armour, you can get a full suit of Orange armour (including helmet) at the Dromund Kaas cantina. Pieces are 200-300CR each. It's a great way to get a helmet much earlier than otherwise possible.

**Preferences**:

There are a lot of nice options that people often do not notice and I will list them here.

Controls: You can choose to Auto-Loot on right click or Area Loot which will look the mobs in a certain area by looting 1 mob.

Chat: You can remove the annoying Profanity filter if you want and add timestamps.

User Interface: You can choose to show your/target health/resource in your health bar, enable subtitles and add more quickbars (only 3 avaible).

Social: You can choose to hide your helmet if you find it hideous or you can hide your sith corruption if you want to be dark side but do not want to look like one. You can also choose how do you want to show your Legacy name or if you want to show it at all.

**Modifying:**

You no longer need a workbench to modify your items. A fully modifiable item will have an orange name like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iZOhO.jpg). You can open the modify window by ctrl+rightclick that item.

Item's will get their Quality depending on the Hilt/Armoring you put into them. You can use an orange item you received at level 10 and put level 50 mods into them, and that item will have the same quality as a level 50 item. [Lightsaber modifying](http://i.imgur.com/fJNdV.jpg) / [Armor Modifying](http://i.imgur.com/i8tF0.jpg).

*[You can remove mods from your items](http://i.imgur.com/yz8x1.jpg) to and put them into another items. Just drag that mod into your bag and it will be removed if you agree to pay the credit.

Anyway Im not writing this to flame WOW players or be irrelevant to SWTOR.


WOW Syndrome has had a profound effect on pretty much any good MMOS ability to stay active for the past few years and its beginning to annoy me.


**What is WOW Syndrome I hear you ask in my head?**

* MMO gamers are by nature mostly monogamous, they may play other games but will always to return to their original favourite. Nowhere is this more prominent then in WoW players, I call it WoW Syndrome and ive silently observed it for over 6 years of MMO gaming.


The reason Im writing about this in a SWTOR subreddit is because it is my strong belief that **90%** of all these people giving reason after reason for un-subbing are just WoW syndrome sufferers. I say strong belief... Im 100% sure thats the case, ive witnessed this happen in many games (Age of Conan being the most obvious example).


A game launches with the so called ""WoW killer"" title, the game has heavy population for the first month or so then WoW Syndrome sets in and the complaints start flying. Im not saying that there were no complaints the first month but they weren't followed by Unsubscribe threats as they all are now.


Case in Point with Age of Conan:

* 1. Game launches to huge subscription base.
* 2. A month passes with very little change to population
* 3. WoW syndrome sets in, the complaints start flying about everything remotely wrong with the game.
* 4. Players start leaving, their excuses? small bugs, gameplay flaws etc..
* 5. Server Populations begin to drop
* 6. Second Wave of Wow syndrome sets in.
* 7. Server Populations drop further, their excuses? Low populations, cba to reroll etc...
* 8. Game declared dead by most WoW players.


Age of Conan isnt dead, and by no surprise the majority of people currently playing didn't come from WoW.


We are now seeing similar patterns in SWTOR, but because SWTOR is a stronger game its not happening as quickly. So with that in mind I have some advice for all you WOW players out there who are threatening to unsubscribe or have already done so.


1. Stop blaming game-play, game mechanics, server population, or god knows what else. All of your reasons are just you trying to convince yourself that you need to go back to WoW. All your doing by complaining is giving other WoW Syndromers justification to complain more. Its only natural you want to return to a game were you are more comfortable, just be honest about it.


2. Please stop spamming the forums and reddit with reasons why the game isnt good enough for you. Noone cares..


Plain and simple fact: WoW got here first, other games have to struggle to keep up and the main reason is WoW Syndrome. Please just go back to your MMO and stop acting like its anyone else's fault but your own. In a couple months time when you've gotten tired again well be here waiting.



Anyway Id write more but I Feel that this will be downvoted to hell anyway. Please leave comments below, if your going to say something short like ""this is bullshit"" or ""I agree"", dont bother.



For any mature people our there who want to discuss this it would be nice for WOW players to tag themselves somehow.  


EDIT:

So many People here are just replying with the same things.
To all those people who Im going to stop commenting to individually please read this:

* 1. I am not saying everyone who quits, quits because of WoW syndrome.
* 2. I am not saying everyone who has ever played WoW has WoW Syndrome.
* 3. I am not saying that the game has no issues.


**Read this:**
**""Most WoW players subconsciously want to return to WoW, they will seek any justification as a means to justify their unsubscribing. This has a overly negative effect on the community where smaller issues are blown out of proportion and players rant about absolutely anything to convince themselves they are justified.""**

Right.. that is my point.

Please will everyone stop commenting saying why they are not quitting because of this and that, why the game does need help.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,True,,faction-republic,True,t3_rwbds,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/rwbds/so_much_wow_syndrome_in_here/,

I purposefully avoided details about the game as to not get sucked into the hype for another MMO (I posted on an EQ2 fanboard for literally 2 years before it released, and then played for less than a week).  There were a lot of great things about SWTOR that I liked, but there was one sort of intangible thing that stood out to me:



***My characters had their own personality.***




I've played MMO's for a long time (Since EverQuest), and I've never really considered my character as anything other than an extension of myself.  Just a virtual avatar of me, and everything I did was my own actions.  I've never really been into roleplaying in MMO's, just not something I've ever done.  So as a non-roleplayer, I found it interesting that I was compelled to do things based on what *my character would do*, instead of what I simply wanted.



For example, my Sith Warrior was just the most evil being he could possibly be.  He relished killing anyone and anything possible.  He found extreme enjoyment in shocking the crap out of his slave...err companion.



But, I played my Bounty Hunter completely different.  There was no Good or Evil.  I simply did what I was hired to do, no questions asked.  *Oh. you're doing that because the person who hired me is actually evil?  Well then maybe you should have hired me first.*  I just completed the job, and collected my credits.



Not sure how anyone else felt about this, but it was the single most engaging aspect of the game to me.  I felt more interested in my character than any other MMO, and I've played some characters for YEARS, whereas I enjoyed my SW and BH for less than 3 days.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,False,,,True,t3_mbujt,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/mbujt/the_single_most_interesting_aspect_of_swtor/,

I've been playing for about a month now preferred and have a level 49 Guardian. This is my first MMO (if you don't count that time in high school when Runescape came out ha) so I wasn't familiar with a lot of mechanics. I found that any time I had a question or wasn't sure about something I could easily find it in this sub Reddit. You guys rock :D Plus this has got to be one of the more mature forums of communication for gaming for sure. 

Lastly, the SWTOR community has been nothing but good to me. I usually use the group finder to get the daily quest and commendations and had almost all positive experiences. When I told the group I haven't ran the flashpoint yet most were cool with it. They even give pointers and show me short cuts. I could go on but I won't.

All in all, I guess I just wanted to say thank you to the people who help those in need and to let any new or prospective players that I feel that the community is great and the game is great.

Don't upvote just looking for advice. ,177,35,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/13kg06/swtor_noob_looking_for_help_with_hotbars_and/,"I come from a MOBA/ARPG background, League of Legends and Diablo 3 specifically. As a result of my extended play times on these games I am really attached to QWER as keybindings and prefer a ""chunk"" of keys if you will compared to a ""string"". By this I mean I prefer;

[Q][W][E][R]
 
\ [A][S][D][F]

\ \ [Z][X][C][V]

over

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0][-][=]

The problem this presents is it kills my movement key bindings at *WASD*. When I say prefer, I mean I really fucking hate *1 through =*. I can't stand it so nearly everything is preferable. If you have an idea I will try it. 

I really want to love this game. I have hundreds of hours logged on both KotOR games and love the entire Star Wars universe. I want to play the game for the story and to support Bioware in their Star Wars game ventures - I had been dreaming about TOR since 2004.

I have even contemplated buying a second mouse with a keypad on the side and play *WASD* and cast off the side of the mouse. It would take me some time to save for one - if I did chose to go down that route I would want to splurge and get a good quality one. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So does /r/swtor have any creative methods of keybinding so I can get everything down (I would stick to playing through the story and PVE) off *1 through =* in a manageable way without killing *WASD* or at least killing *1 through =* and providing an alternative to *WASD*? 


I have tried just moving with the mouse but that way I cannot move and cast or kite properly. I would resort to buying a new mouse like I said but only as a last resort as I have a great  one (Razer DeathAdder) already. Are other peripherals an option? I have two keyboards, both with numpad. If you do recommend buying a mouse or other peripherals could you please recommend specifics?

Thanks for getting through the word wall any help would be appreciated. 


EDIT: Thanks for the responses everybody! I checked out the link supplied by /u/geraz and rebound movement as suggested by /u/Parrk and rebound everything in a similar shape to what noxxic.com had suggested. I haven't had the chance to play as of yet but I look forward to spending some quality time with the game as the weekend rolls in.

I did consider going for having movement just on the mouse but it felt too limited and I seem to always need to back peddle  with my Trooper (I don't know if I am doing it right). 


Again, thank you all for the responses, if the above mentioned doesn't fit I will comeback and inspect the other bindings. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qxih,1353539580.0,,,True,t3_13kg06,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/13kg06/swtor_noob_looking_for_help_with_hotbars_and/,

There are only 44 PVP/RP-PVP servers so the data collection took a bit shorter, but it got delayed by a day cuz I didn't know typing ""fleet"" and ""the fleet"" in the who list window give different results - I was typing in ""the fleet"" after typing in all the warzones - ""the pit, the civil war, the voidstar etc"" - this gave much lower numbers (at first I thought it was cuz the players on PvP servers  are less ""lazy"" and don't sit around on the fleet as much hehe). I had to erase all the data and start over. 


7 planets and 3 warzones + fleet were used. Warzone data is a bit weird sometimes as people enter/exit warzones constantly and the 30secs-1 minute time I need to switch characters can cause some odd (uneven) ratios. But as suspected - Imperial players play alot more Huttball (the pit) than Republic players.


Sadly, it does seem that there is a higher Imperial/Republic ratio on PVP servers - a combined ratio of **1.84** compared to **1.22** for PVE servers.

I just want to emphasize it again that this is cross-sectional/(snapsnot in time) population data and it is a *representation* of the actual population data. This is what anyone who wanted to go around servers making level 1 characters would have observed when he/she types in stuff in the who-list during prime time (6:30 pm-10:00 pm EST for east coast and 6:30 pm-10:00 pm PST for west coast). Accurate data would need a team of dedicated people all logging in at the same time, some external software to capture network data (maybe against the TOS) or connections to Bioware.

Like many of you I bought the game at launch, and ended up enjoying it immensely even with its shortcomings, inefficient game engine and missing features that should've probably been in at launch, and ended up subscribing for an additional 2 months. Towards the end of the 3rd month, before the Legacy patch, I felt like it was becoming too boring. I didn't feel like making more than the 2 characters I already had, and I had a small backlog of other games I wanted to play, so I unsubbed and thought that was that. 

A couple of days ago, Bioware sent out a free week's playtime to all inactive accounts to coincide with their ""Allies"" patch, and I figured, what the hell! I'll take the free week. And I've got to admit, I thought I was done with this game completely, and it would just die a quiet death in a couple of months. I was wrong. **This game has increased immensely in quality since launch**. Between the free server transfers, optimizations to the Hero Engine (which is desperately needed), new features, the legacy system, quicker load times all around, and new a new planet \ quest hub, and an actual group finder... I feel pretty guilty for not sticking with the game and having faith that they'd come through. If this game had shipped in this condition, it would not have risen and then bottomed out so quickly.

Real life stuff comes up and sometimes you have to quit during the middle of the warzone. If you need to quit, then you need to quit.

However an increasingly common trend I'm seeing is people quitting WZ as soon as things aren't going their way and it's getting ridiculous. I can't count how many times I'll be in Alderaan and have 2-3 people leave if we don't get 2 caps in the beginning, or in Huttball if the enemy scores first. I even seen a 4 man guild premade quit after the first score, taking half the team away. The reason they do it is because there's basically no penalty for doing so, so why not? Problem is they screw over the rest of the team. Maybe it was a losing battle, but having half your team quit certainly doesn't help.

If I had my way, I'd implement a 1 hour ban on WZs for any player that quits. I admit that's perhaps on the harsh side but I'm just getting so sick and tired of these fair weather PvPers ruining it for our side. It can be something less drastic. Maybe you can queue up for a WZ but you get only 25% Valor and Commendations for an hour. Just put something in there a little harsher so people don't chronically quit. While it may occasionally punish the person who genuinely needed to leave, I would trade that in gladly and accept that penalty personally if it happened to me, if that meant everyone else would think twice before leaving at the first sign of losing.

Hopefully you will find them useful in the days ahead!

**Prelaunch preparation**

* Stock up on experience boosts – major or minor. These boosts (25% experience bonus) will give you about 0.5 to 0.75 of a level more. Three major (lasts 9 hrs) should be plenty. 

* It is not a bad idea to do some dallies/weeklies and then turn them in once the servers are up. If all goes well, the servers will be up about 5 hrs before the weekly reset. Ilum/Belsavis/Black Hole dallies are all staying L50 but Section X is boosted to L55 daily area. It is unknown if the Section X dallies will get reset due to this. 

* Gear up/Respec – Black Hole/Campaign gear will be fine for Makeb content. Dread Guard is more than enough. If you are still in Rakata/Columi you might have some trouble later on. Healers have an easier time but kills a bit slower. AoE specs are great as Makeb mobs often come in large groups. 


* Get rid of extra comms
    
    Planetary commendation cap: 100 (this includes the one time overflow limit). 100 planetary commendations will allow you to buy some L52 mods on Makeb. Remember that Tionese cystals will also get converted to planetary comms at a ratio of 2:1 (2 crystals for 1 comm). 

    Classic Commendation cap: 800 (this includes the one time overflow limit). If you have lots of Black Hole commendations, spend them before the patch as the prices for the Campaign pieces you can purchase are more expensive than buying Black Hole armor + Campaign armoring pre-patch. Remember the best gear you can buy with Classic Commendations is Campaign so if you don’t need those then buy stuff with comms and sell them back to vendors for credits. 


* Form premade groups with friends – questing is a lot faster with other players. 

**Makeb**

* Unless they changed this from the beta, Makeb main storyline + doing all the Makeb dallies once (not including GSI dallies) will get you to L53/54. This is not really an issue as there are plenty of other stuff (i.e. macrobinocular/seeker, GSI dallies, STAGED weeklies) to get you to the level cap. However, if you are severely undergeared, killing L55 mobs at L53 isn't really fun. Hence, doing some pre-patch preparation may come in handy here. 

* I have [a guide here of most of the Makeb missions](http://dulfy.net/2013/04/07/swtor-makeb-mission-guide/) on the Empire and Republic side. Most of the missions are fairly self-explanatory but what you may find helpful are spawn maps I made of various mission objectives. From past experience on launch day, there tend to be more players than items so often there are long lines at specific spawn points. However, these maps will hopefully spread out the population a bit. 

* Datacrons: There are two on Makeb +10 Endurance (hard) and +10 presence (easy). Don't waste your time getting them pre-55 as they can take quite a bit of time. Presence one will probably take you 5-10 minutes but endurance one can take much longer.

* Seeker Droids and Macrobinoular questline can be started at L52 but it is not advised to not to do them until you are finished with the Makeb storyline as they take a huge amount of time to do and it can be inefficient if you are looking to level to 55. 

    On the Empire side, they can be picked up from T4-M7 and Z1-3C  in the Sith Sanctum on Dromund Kaas

    On the Republic side, they can be picked up from M3-8Z and BB-6G in the Senate Plaza on Coruscant. 

* Some of the macrobinocular and seeker droid missions are fairly straightforward (i.e. go to location x, dig y) while others are a bit more complicated and puzzle oriented. I do have [a guide to most of the macrobinocular/seeker droid missions as well](http://dulfy.net/2013/03/26/swtor-macrobinocular-and-seeker-droid-missions-guide/). 

* Make sure to do the macrobinocular and seeker droid story missions together as they require you to travel to the same planets. 

**GSI dallies**

* You can start them as soon as you head to Dromund Kaas/Coruscant to pick up your seeker droids and macrobinoculars for the initial steps of the seeker dorid/macrobinocular chain. Makeb GSI dallies are really easy to do and give a good source of XP on your way to L55. I wouldn't bother with the other zones, especially Tatooine until you are close to 55 as they can be quite tedious. 

* Here is a [guide to the GSI dallies on the four areas](http://dulfy.net/2013/03/26/swtor-gsi-mission-dailies-guide/)

**Gearing up at 55**

* Dread Guard gear is sufficient to clear hardmode L55 flashpoints and storymode L55 operations (TFB and S&amp;V). 

* Running the four L55 hardmode flashpoints (Athiss, Hammer Station, Cademimu, and Mandalorian Raiders) will give you random Black Market pieces which have no set bonus but can be stripped for mods and enhancements.
* Running storymode TFB and Scum and Villainy will grant you most of the Arkanian pieces. 
* Running hardmode TFB and Scum and Villainy will grant you Underworld pieces. 
* Basic Commendations can be used to purchase Arkanian relics and some gear slightly better than the Dread Guard stuff.
* Elite Commendations can be used to purchase Black Market pieces (no set bonus)
* Ultimate Commendations can be used to purchase Verpine pieces (no set bonus). 
* Here is a [loot table for operations drops in 2.0](http://dulfy.net/2013/04/08/swtor-patch-2-0-operation-loot-tables/).

1329512356.0,141,self.swtor,pudg8,"Huttball scores, Turret captures, and Door plants should earn MEDALS in PVP. Give people a reason to fight for the WIN!",196,55,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/pudg8/huttball_scores_turret_captures_and_door_plants/,"Right now, there is a severe split in the PVP community of SW:

A) You either join a warzone to get Win for your daily (Valor 60+s, mostly Champ gear casuals, etc)

B) You are actively farming Warzone commendations for your Purple Champion Bags.

When A's play together, you usually see wins; Many people doing their absolutely best to maximize their effectiveness (although it's not the rule). Fully B teams, on the other hand, usually have 6-0 in the first few minutes of a Huttball round (As they should).

However...

Put those two together, and all of a sudden you're alienating half your player base. SW has constructed a multi-tier system of level 50 PVP; Farmers vs Winners. Steps should be taken soon to rectify this situation, and give incentive to players to do BOTH. This would encourage queueing, grow WF participation, and greatly improve the current stereotypes associated with SW Warfront PVP.

Suggestions for Huttball:

- Every point needs to be a medal, ""Point score"". One person can have up to 6. If one person does, well, they deserve it.

- Passes need to be tracked (completed vs failed). I originally theorized about suggesting a medal for completed passes, but it would be infuriating for a team trying to win to have two people passing the ball back and forth in their own end zone just for a medal. At the same time, however, anything that encourages people to pass the ball would be great a step to encourage this type of team-oriented behavior.

- Fix. Resolve. Please. :)


Suggestions for Voidstar:

- Planting a bomb gives one medal. This can only happen on the first plant per door.

- Diffusing a bomb would be tracked, but no medals given (people like topping charts; giving them more opportunities to do so, even when there is no direct gain with it, is encouraging to those who give up on medals to help the team win)


Suggestions for Civil War:

- Taking a turret initially would give a medal. The medal, ""Turret Capture"", can only be gained on a turret once every 2-3 minutes (this would be balanced on the time of an average round, which I do not have access to), and only at the time of capturing.

- Turret Defender medal: Accruing at least 1k defense at all turrets


General Warzone Suggestions:

- Planet-side nailed the marking system. Just copy this system; allow the raid leader to place ""Marks"" on the map. Allow them to generate waypoints with the big ""loot light"" of a unique color that everyone can see. 

- MVP Titles: Should have some titles based on being MVP (1 vote, 3 votes, 5 votes, 7 votes). 

- See my previous thread on MVP/Social suggestions (more great suggestions in the comments): http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/pu67a/bioware_warzone_mvp_votes_should_give_the_voter/


Basically, the overall scope of PVP is focused on individuals, not teams. This means that a cooperative, driven portion of the player-base is currently being shafted by the ones who want to do their own thing because there is no incentive for them to do otherwise. Basically, the two goals need to be aligned; personal gain AND team gain should be synonymous in the eyes of the player.

As many of you have noticed Torhead is missing many items in the database, this is where you can help. Our developers have recently added a tool to our disposal that allows me and my crack team of volunteers to manually add random prefix items to the database.

Now you may be asking what a random prefix item is, that is an easy one to explain. It’s an item that has random stats, which you have seen in other major MMOs (Random greens in World of Warcraft.) The primary example of this is http://i.imgur.com/n5R85.png and as you can see I have already added it to the database http://www.torhead.com/item/fABCi5f/chancery-cuffs

Once they are added to the database they will show up in the search, (they will show you the base items name) and you can view the stats on the item page.

If you are interested in making Torhead even better, all you have to do is provide us a link to the base item and preferably a screenshot of the item's tooltip ingame and we will get them added ASAP.

They can be posted here on Reddit or in the thread over at Torhead. http://www.torhead.com/forum/TOR+General/topic/798#t5984

Recently, I updated it to include all the speeders available ingame at the moment (excluding those from the beta but didn't make to the live game). 

Anyways, there are ~~66~~ 67 speeders in total (67 after patch 1.6.3)

* 4 of which were no longer obtainable as of patch 1.2 (Korrealis Baron and Commander can still be brought off the GTN, although at ridiculous prices)
* 1 was unobtainable after the Chevin event back in August of 2012. 
* Another one will become unobtainable outside the GTN after tonight's patch (Czerka LD-1 Celebrator)

This is to replace my super outdated dailies and endgame gearing guide I wrote for patch 1.2 back in April. 

**Here is a link to the full guide here**
http://dulfy.net/2012/11/28/swtor-dailies-and-pve-endgame-gearing-in-1-5/

**Brief Summary for those at work etc**

Dailies

* Table of all the dailies available in 1.5, note that subtotals for each section only incudes the dailies, not the weekly since it is repeatable only once a week

* http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/swtor_dailies_1.52.jpg

* Imgur mirror: http://i.imgur.com/5IaTc.jpg

* If you do all the dailies, including space missions and flashpoints, you can expect to get 564-571 Daily Commendations and ~ 2.3 million credits per week!

Weeklies

* Black Hole Weekly: 16k credits + 6 Black Hole Commendations
* Section X Weekly: 16k credits + 6 Black Hole Commendations + 10 Daily Commendations.
* Rakghoul Weekly : 16k credits + 8 Black Hole Commendations (picked up from terminal at Supplies section of fleet)
* Galactic Conflicts: 16k credits + 18 Columi Commendations + 20 Tionese Commendations + 15 Daily Commendations
* Deadly Operations: 16k credits + 10 Black Hole Comms + 10 Daily Comms (Kill 2nd boss of Hardmode Eternity Vault or Karagga’s Palace)
* Galactic Operations: 16k credits  + 15 Black Hole Comms + 10 Daily Comms (kill 2nd boss of  Explosive Conflict in any difficulty)
* Galactic Crisis Points: 16k credits + 20 Black Hole Comms + 10 Daily Comms (kill 2nd boss of Terror from Beyond in any difficulty)
* [WEEKLY] Nightmare Pilgrim – 4 Black Hole Comms

Black Hole Commendations

* Group Finder HM Flashpoint – 5 Black Hole Comms/day | 35 Black Hole Comms / week

* Group Finder EV/KP – 10 Black Hole Comms / week

* Weeklies – 12 + 8+10+15+20+4 = 69 Black Hole Comms / week

* Hardmode/Nightmare Explosive Conflict + Hardmode Terror from Beyond = 20 from EC + 25 from TFB / week

* 35 + 10 + 69 + 45 = 159 Black Hole Comms / week.

Gearing for Operations

* Tionese -&gt; Columi -&gt; Rakata -&gt; Campaign -&gt; Dread Guard

* Included in the guide are the loot tables for every piece of gear from Columi to Dread Guard. 

War Hero Relics

* Dread Guard Relics are mostly BiS now but alot of players still like the passive boost from War Hero Relics. They provide +113 Power/Shield/Defense and costs 1250 Ranked and 200 regular Warzone Commmendations

* Keep in mind that in 1.6, War Hero relics will cost only 550 regular Warzone Commendations and Elite War Hero relics (+120 stat) will be replacing it costing 1250 ranked and 550 regular. 

Stuff coming up in 1.6

* New and existing 50s will be given a set of Tionese Commmendations in the mail through one of the new missions aimed at new 50s. This is almost enough to purchase a full set of Tionese gear. 

* Tionese crystals can now be used to purchase Ancient Artifact Storage Box (Purple L50 Box). While this box doesn’t yield any useful gear for most players, it provides a way to get rid of all those Tionese crystals you got from the flashpoints.

* Six new “hardmode” space missions, reach have a weekly repeatable that rewards 2 Black Hole Comms, 5 Daily Comms, and 40 Fleet Comms per mission.

1374175165.0,135,self.swtor,1ikui8,Low level FP strategies,148,13,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1ikui8/low_level_fp_strategies/,"This is a post about all the flashpoints up until Cademimu. It includes useful tips to all new players I have learned over playing all types of classes up to at least level 29.

Black Talon / Essles

This is so easy it requires almost zero tips, besides do your job and don't try to DPS while healing. This is something everyone shouldn't try unless you can keep up the tank without it being a close call.

Hammer Station

All the fights are quite easy to run through with a mediocre group, but I have seen the worst in kill order of the second encounter, where the DPS attack Vorgan rather than Sawbones. Sawbones first, healers go first in almost every case, if you would like to provide an instance where you don't, go ahead, I don't expect this to be perfect. The last boss however is where I see many tanks screw it up and cause a wipe because of one ability: Sweeping Gunfire. Tanks need to force him to face the computer at the start, with DPS and healer on the sides. When he channels Sweeping Gunfire, charge him and run straight through him, effectively dodging his attack and making the healer take less heat from the adds.

Athiss

The first boss encounter is easy. The only tip I can offer is to have one DPS specifically target adds throughout the entire FP, and if the healer is taking heat, both DPS take adds down. The second is the boss I have hated the most, because its a low level FP, therefore new players or entitled tanks and healers. The most effective thing I have seen done is running into the temple behind the Beast of Vodal and the tank getting in the right wall / back wall corner, while the healer sits as far from the tank as possible. When the Beast spawns its babies, DPS burn them down before it can even reach healer, with DPS still outside by the entrance, as that's the back of the boss to prevent being thrown as well and it is also where the adds spawn. The final encounter is easy. Watch for Soul Rend debuff. If you have it, you are targeted by Living Fire. In other words, run. Healer has to focus on those targeted by the boss's DoT. Later in the fight the Prophet will use a CC which drains health, which the tank should break out of. If you haven't killed him by the second time, then the healer need to focus on you.

Mandalorian Raiders

All tanks should not open with their AoE in the start of trash mobs. Jump in and let them get close, then pop off your AoEs for great threat. Many trash pulls can be avoided if you just run around them or on rails at the side of the bridge, or even down the middle at the case of the turret area below the bridge. The first fight is simple mechanics. The tank leads boss elsewhere while DPS take the dogs out. Don't taunt until he encases you in carbonite, because after doing such, he will reset aggro, which is why you need to taunt him back in. The second encounter is a high step up. I have seen everyone get in a corner by the large stairs, focusing on the Warrior, then Inquisitor, then both to 10 percent, then trash the agent, and take the hunter quickly. Agent will put out Corrosive dart and poison clouds, which can be cleansed. The final encounter is very easy. Kill turrets first, when they aren't up, attack Varad.

Cademimu 

This is a huge step up. Tanks need to use a large amount of AoE on pulls, and CCs help. If you see an opportunity to push a mob off a ledge, do it. Force Pull doesn't break CC, so after a target is hard CC'd, pull them out so you can AoE. The first fight nobody should attack the droid, but run when you are ""under arrest"". If you are under arrest, lead the droid into a large orange circle on the ground which will trap him. Don't step in it yourself. Healers watch those under arrest and cleanse ""electro net"" debuff, which slows the recipient down. The second boss is easy, be sure to save AoE for the ugnaughts. Also, the flamethrower will kill the ugnaughts, try to use that to advantage. If you can't hold the ugnaughts down, have the RDPS and healer stand atop a car and the tank should bring the boss in range. The final boss is easy. When you see smoke, run to a square that doesn't have smoke. Simple as that. Don't stand even close to the fire as the visual effect isn't the same as where it's actually going to affect. 

If you have more to add, or something you feel is wrong, comment on it.

For people on PvE servers who do dailies on Ilum, I'm sure you've noticed there are a good amount of low level characters farming security chests in areas populated by the botter's faction-friendly elite npcs. 

A tell-tale sign of them using a program to open the chest is that if their inventory is full, they can't pick up the items the chest drops so they'll keep on attempting to open the same chest over and over until it disappears.

A simple solution I discovered the other day is if you Toggle your PVP flag on and simply stand in front of them, they'll right-click on you instead of the chest. For most people, this will use the default action in their 1 hotkey slot, which is their basic attack ability.

This only works if you're on the opposing faction and if they don't wise up and change the default action of their 1 slot, but I managed to get this one person a few times before they gave up and logged off.

1333748426.0,133,self.swtor,rwy4u,My WoW experience and how it makes me appreciate SWTOR more.,212,79,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/rwy4u/my_wow_experience_and_how_it_makes_me_appreciate/,"I started playing WoW back in 2005. I played an enhancement shaman almost the entire time until I stopped playing about a year ago. I've seen what started as a really terrible, unfocused class spec dramatically improve, get tweaked, and finish off into mediocrity. Coming from that experience I've been very pleased with SWTOR 's handling of classes, specs, and especially PVP. This is a brain

**First, my WoW experience.**

Back in classic WoW, enhancement shaman had two active abilities. I would use one, use the other, then wait for the cooldown to end. In a group my job was to cast a buff or two and keep it up. Our spec was shit. All shaman had to be healers if you were in a serious raid. There was no gear itemized for my class and my class sets were useless. Of course I didn't know any better and I was playing with my friends, so I got enough enjoyment out of it.

Burning crusade was such a boon for enhancement.  We went from buff bots to central DPS characters. Not only could we finally hold our own against other DPS classes, we still provided very valuable buffs. If you knew how to spec and gear, you could get in the top 3 damage in most raids. I spent a lot of time theorycrafing and gathering gear to optimize my damage, and I was rewarded for it. Our gear sets made sense for the first time. I'm definitely one of those that found Burning Crusade to be the best expansion WoW had.

Since Lich King, Blizzard has been homogenizing classes.  I still spent the same amount of time or more getting my character to the very best it could be, but I was just mediocre in damage and my buffs were replicated by at least one other class in the raid. I felt like in spite of all my effort, you might as well bring along another rogue or mage.

Through all this time, Enhancement was one of the worst PVP specs. Blizzard said explicitly that not all specs would be good for PVP and you should respec, dummy. Having spent 6 years as enhancement, I was a terrible healer (healer is the pvp spec.) I found that with a lot of time and gear I could hold my own, but there was never a chance for me to be a high-level arena player. I only ever saw one enhancement shaman in the national finals and there was just about never one in the top 100 that I remember.

Blizzard never balanced for 1v1 combat and barely balanced for 2v2 combat. On the small scale it became a game of rock-paper-scissors-spock. I could kill priests, druids and I would stalemate, and paladins would kill me. Then there were rogues that could kill just about anyone. I couldn't believe blizzard thought it was a good idea having a class that, with equal gear, would almost always win in one-on-one combat. I still did battlegrounds, but it was just too frustrating to go into the arena.

**After a year or so without playing any MMOs I started SWTOR.**

The leveling experience was better.  There were still the kill 10 boars quests, but they felt more integrated into the other story driven missions. The character interaction at the end of the quest made up for any boredom from doing it. I enjoyed really *feeling* like a bounty hunter. People would come to me with quests and offer me money because they knew I was a bounty hunter. It all felt more personal and tailored. SW quests don't quite flow as well as WoW's. In WoW you would never have to visit an area twice since you'd get all the quests for that area at once. SW's quests are more scattered. At least SW incorporated the hand-holding quest map. I absolutely loved having a companion character with me at all times.

Through all my leveling I PVP'd a lot. Unlike WoW, in spite of being a tank, I felt useful. I was boggled how well my utility played into Huttball and my survivability played into the other warzones. Purely PvE skills like taunting were incorporated beautifully into PvP.  Gear and level disparity were minimized by putting everyone at at minimum power level and HP.  The high-level people had more utility and skills, but I could hold my own. The level 12s were easier to kill, but they were still a threat if I let my guard down. I really feel I could play any spec in any class and have a place in the warzone. There was never one class or spec I felt would /always/ kill me or vice versa.

My server has a fairly low raiding population so it took some time to start operations. Once I did I was pretty satisfied with how they tuned the encounters. I felt like gear mattered, but you didn't have to tweak every last stat to progress. Classes all had something to contribute in their own way, but you didn't feel you had to take a sniper over a sorcerer for example. Several encounters were all about player communication and skill where gear didn't matter.

**Final thoughts.**

Looking back I found that SWTOR is much better for me at this point in my life. I have a full time job, a non-computer hobby, and I'm in a committed relationship. SWTOR has enough depth to warrant playing twice a week, but I can see getting frustrated with it if I tried to play every day. SW equalizes the playing field enough that you don't have to grind factions, badges, crafting, and dungeons to earn a place in a raid. With the first tier of epic gear you're ready to start raiding successfully. However, if you do spend some extra time, you'll notice a difference in your performance and you'll have an easier time.

If SWTOR came out during Burning Crusade I would have played it for a couple weeks and given up. I had a lot more time and it would have been much better for me to play a game that had limitless faction and token grinding, unforgiving raids, and a class that really needed to be optimized to be viable. But now?  I get to raid and PVP as much as I want and be pretty good at it because I'm a good player. I'm not limited by poor design decisions that make me work so, so hard just to stay competitive. It doesn't provide the 40-hours-a-week playing time that WoW could, but I simply don't need that anymore.",,False,self,t5_2qxih,True,,BH,True,t3_rwy4u,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/rwy4u/my_wow_experience_and_how_it_makes_me_appreciate/,
1329754790.0,131,self.swtor,pxwp8,My list of what to do now that I hit 50.,198,67,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/pxwp8/my_list_of_what_to_do_now_that_i_hit_50/,"Finally got around to hitting 50.  (Wolfgang Drogo - Dreshdae Cantina - Repub - Trooper)

Have really enjoyed the game so far. My leveling is mostly from questing and a bit of pvp.  I have seen a few threads about nothing to do once you hit 50.  Mostly on official forums.  *(shudder)*  

I have SO MUCH TO DO! Figured I would just write it all out and use it as a checklist for myself and perhaps others.

Please submit anything I may have missed. 

**Datacrons:** 

Find all of them. I managed to get them all up to Nar Shadaa and then just gave up on focusing on getting them on every planet before I left.  Yes I will even get the datacrons that don't really benefit me stat wise.  

I feel compelled to try to get each one without a guide.  Yes I will use a guide if I simply can't figure it out after hours.  But part of the fun and sense of accomplishment is figuring out the puzzle yourself.

Also need to put together my relic from the datacron shards.  I have only 1 of the 3 color combo's that I need for my lvl 50 relic.  Can I get two?

**Ilum PVP:**

I have yet to do anything here as I just hit 50.  I hear that on many servers it is hard to get Republic players to join in, but I am hoping ours is different.  I have really enjoyed PVP so far, and my experience is that in the &lt; 50 brackets we (repub) won most matches.  Maybe that is because all Imp pvp focused players are already 50?

**Ilum and Belsalvis Dailies:**

Something to do each day.  Have yet to do them, no clue what they take or how much fun they may be.

**Codex Achievements:**

Each planet shows the number of codex entries, lore items, beasts to discover, map areas to discover, and titles.  Need to go back and check all of these off the list.  This is a massive undertaking.  So much to discover and find.  Like datacrons I want to do what I can without guides.

**Social Points:**

I did very little flashpoints or group questing.  I am WAY behind on my social points. 

There are SO MANY quests I haven't done.  Just had to skip them to keep up with my class quest.  Need to find a partner and go back and finish them for social points, as well as do the flashpoints.  Not sure of better way. 

**Flashpoints:** 

Related to above, I haven't done many.  I enjoy them, just wasn't focused on them.  Lots to catch up on here.

**Space Combat:**

I love it.  But stopped playing when I focused on lvling around lvl 30.  I know, you can get exp with it, but I still stopped.  I am now crafting all my epic ship upgrades, etc.  I hear that have fun things in store for us in this regard, and am looking forward to updates.

**Gearing Up:**

I have some pvp gear on from lvl 40 still, plus some upgrades found along the way.  I am undecided if I want to do PVP upgrades or flashpoints.  Probably PVP, and have started collecting for that.

**Crew Affection/Gear:**

One of my crew members (healer) was with me almost he whole time.  She is maxed, or very close. Time to get the others in line.  Also need to gear them up better.  Many were just ignored.

**Crafting:**

I have hit 400 on cybertech, scavenging and underworld trading.  I don't yet have every recipe, but most.  Now I plan on making some good money where I see opportunity in the GTN.  It is clear there is money to be made for those with attention to it.  I have friends who at lvl 30 had a few million credits from GTN and crafting.

**Light Side Max:**

For this character I decided to go all light side.  I am lvl 3 or 4, can't remember.  I see gear I can't use.  That makes me sad.

**Try out Healing:**

I am considering a respec to combat medic for a while.  I see a need for healers in PVP.  Probably mean a second set of gear at some point.  Need to look into that.


**LVL Alts:**

I have a few alts now.  I really enjoy all of them, though the Consular class questline isn't very interesting to me, the play style for shadow is very fun.  They have different personalities, one going true neutral, another dark, etc.

**Collect Stuff:**

I am a collector.  Vehicles, pets, etc.  I don't have the cash to finish this right away, but I have made a small dent so far.  A cool mount on tattooine in the pvp area, btw.

**Outfits for Companions:**

I have this silly idea that I should outfit my healer companion in a fancy dress.  So need to mod the hell out of it.  Others may just wear some other fun outfits.

**Work on Guild**

I have a small guild.  Casual.  Friends and Family plus cool people we meet on the way.  Still there is only 5 max online at a time.  Would like to have more activity and vibrancy there from nice, chill, like minded people.

**Legacy LVL:**

Not sure you can work on this really.  As long as I am active and doing things other then crafting it goes up.  LVL 6 so far.  I am guessing it will be useful starting next month.  Guessing we get a new race playable.  Voss?  Need to leave some alt slots free.

**Events:**

Organize some sort of event at Outlwas Den.  Guild vs Guild maybe?

**World Bosses:**

Killed a couple so far.  But not all.  This is a list that must be completed.  Maybe form a group then travel from planet to planet in order. 

EDIT: Add new items.

**Max Valor**

See suggestions below.

**Collect Orange Equipment**

The suggestion below for helms is a fun one.  I rather like the bubble one from the space combat rewards.

After a few months I went out with a friend and got in a car accident which left me flat broke with 0 income (I'm 18 and finding a job is tough) I didn't think about the fact that Amazon doesn't charge until they ship it and guess what, when they tried to charge me I had no funds in the bank. I told my guild members about this and i wouldn't be able to join them for a while since I'm broke. I just got a message from a member on Twitter that he will be sending a copy to me and says that he will return any money I send to him to repay him. This is one of the kindest things ever done for me by someone who only knows me in a video game. Spread the cheer, it sure as fuck made my day just now.

So i made my own.

I'm at work now, i've been slicing and sending every companion available on slicing missions to try and make credits. I made a spread sheet last night of the last 30 or so missions. I've recorded the money required to deploy the companion to the mission, the time it takes to do the mission, and the reward. 

edit: holy shit mass people have posted wanted this. Guess i'll keep tracking through my night tonight so i get some real data (especially across all the tiers of slicing). Will be posting tommorow morning (probably while waiting in the swtor queue)
Will post spreadsheet tonight if it looks like people would be interested.

Edit 2: Working on the spreadsheet again today (12/22/11), will be posting it once my slicing reaches max level so the sheet will cover every tier for slicing. Slicing is currently at 290, and i will be playing for at least 12 hours today.

It appears a lot of people appreciated this so I figured I might as well show this to more people in the hopes of it proving useful to them or for their fellow gaming acquaintances.**


**EDIT** - I chose WoW for my comparison because it is the MMO that I am still most familiar with and because it has the Highest likelihood of potential in helping people getting a grasp of this game before release.  If you or someone you know are knowledgeable about another MMO and would like to make a similar post, convince them to copy paste my post and edit to reflect that game.



Here are some brief descriptions of each AC and how they function in comparison to WoW.  Just remember, how effective they are at each role is completely different than in WoW.  This list is nothing more than stating that a certain AC will either play similarly or have familiar mechanics akin to a WoW class.  Any statement like ""enh shams suck so a class that plays like an Enh Sham will suck""  or ""this class could be described to be like a WoW class.  This game is totally a clone"" do not apply.  Also, this is just a quick generalization.  Like many others have said, there's better info out there but this could help some Ex/Current WoW players choose which class they'd like to start with until they become more familiar with the game.


Also, I've had some help in describing some similarities and I have noted who have helped in that regard to give credit where credit is due.



Jedi Sage / Sith Sorcerer - caster

* Seer/Corruption (Healer) - Disc Priest + Riptide/Tidal Waves + emergency Lifetap.  Uses ""mana"" (thanks boredlol)
* Telekinetics/Lightning (dps) - Fire mage rotation /w slower cast times + Ele shaman (thanks boredlol)
* Balance/Madness (dps) - Shadow Priest/Lock (thanks Boredlol)


Jedi Shadow / Sith Assassin - stealth class

* Infiltration / Deception - Rogue (heavy positional focus) + enh shaman due to ranged force abilities
* Balance / Madness - More enh sham than rogue - heavy dot focus
 

Jedi Guardian / Sith Juggernaut - single lightsaber

* Defense / Immortal (tank) - Prot war - Most defensive CD's
* Vigilance / Vengeance (dps) - Arms war without MS debuff iirc - fair amount of focus on dots
* Focus / Rage (dps) - heavy hitting war with a lot of utility


Jedi Sentinel / Sith Marauder - dual wield

* Watchman / Annihilation (dps) - Fury war with bleed focus
* Combat / Carnage (dps) - Fury war with multiple sources of damage on strikes (fast hitter)
* Focus / Rage (dps) - Heavy hitting utility fury spec


Gunslinger / Sniper - heavy use of cover mechanics and ranged

* sharpshooter / Marksmanship (dps) - Marksman hunter+ vanilla fire mage (thanks Yshaana) - no pet
* Saboteur / Engineering (dps) - Survival hunter - no pet
* Dirty fighting / Lethality (dps) - AoE, Bleeds, and ranged - Frost DK/hunter (Thanks Boredlol)


Scoundrel / Operative - stealth class

* Dirty Fighting / Lethality - Feral druid  with more utility + better bleeds + heavy resource management


Commando / Mercenary - Ranged

* Combat medic / Bodyguard (healer) - Holy Pally + Earth shield.  Uses Ammo/Heat mechanic instead of mana
* Gunnery / Arsenal (dps) - Hard hitting Ranged DPS with important resource management and debuff stacking - Think Heavy Armor Arcane Mage (thanks L1M3)
* Assault Specialist / Pyrotech (dps) - More dot focus than gunnery


Vanguard / Powertech - medium ranged (thanks L1M3)

* Shield Specialist / Shield Tech (tank) - Pally tank w/o HoPo but more dot focused - mid ranged tank
* Tactics / Advanced Prototype (dps) - Ret pally/Frost dk for quick movement and heavy hits
* Assualt specialist / Pyrotech (dps) - More dot focused Ret Pally/unholy dk

The other goal of this guide is to keep track of the huge amount of dallies and weeklies in patch 2.0, a patch I sometimes call the Rise of the Dallies. 

There are quite abit of rewards and missions to keep track of and I compiled a bunch of tables and charts. Hopefully it is not too messy. In the last section I have a section devoted to just daily/weekly rewards that you can just take a quick scroll and know what you are getting.

I think I would find it discouraging as a new player for someone to spam ""spacebar"" at me while I'm trying to experience the content.

So for non-hardmodes (that is, during the level grind), how about we take a break from demanding it?  If you are really in a hurry, maybe we could ask nicely and be ready to sit through them anyway if a newbie wants to watch?

Just a thought, I want to encourage the new players, not scare them off or be rude. :)",,False,self,t5_2qxih,False,,BH,True,t3_13587t,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/13587t/with_f2p_right_around_the_corner_can_we_all_agree/,

1335114646.0,125,self.swtor,smsv4,Ever wondered how to calculate amount of affection a gift give or how/when convos with your companions are triggered?,156,31,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/smsv4/ever_wondered_how_to_calculate_amount_of/,"Hey everyone, I just learned this a couple days ago and I thought it was pretty cool for sharing!

&gt;**Calculating Companion gift affections**

Many of you have probably seen a chart like this that list all the affection a certain gift will give. http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/giftaffections.jpg

Have you ever wondered how that is calculated?

If you are curious, those numbers are fairly easily generated via a simple formula!

It is simply (gift rank - companion affection rank) * type of gift (green, blue, purple) * Likeness (indifferent, like, favourite, love)

**Rank Difference**

There are 5 ranks of companion affection and 5 ranks of companion gifts

Rank 1: -1000 to 1999
Rank 2: 2000 to 3999
Rank 3: 4000 to 5999
Rank 4: 6000 to 7999
Rank 5: 8000 to 10000

The number generated when you do companion gift rank - companion affection rank is the one you want. For example, giving a gift of rank 4 to a companion that is at 6666 affection rating would give you a rank difference of 0.

Rank Difference	Modifier

-4	0

-3	0

-2	0.2

-1	0.5

0	1

1	1.1

2	1.3

3	1.5

4	1.5

**Type of Gift**

There are 3 ""tiers"" of gifts (for now, there is apparently another tier called Legendary but that isn't in game yet!)

Green - Premium, Blue -Prototype, Purple - Artifacts

Each give you a different modifier

Green = 6

Blue = 10

Purple = 24

**Likeness**

Companions have 4 types of likeness to every gift = indifferent, like, favourite, love

Each likeness have a modifier

Indifferent = 0

Like = 4

Favourite = 9

Love = 16

For example, your ship droid 2RV8, if you have him at affection rating rank 1, and gave him a green rank 1 Technology gift the resulting affection would be 6 x 1 x 9 = 54.

* Gift rank – companion affection rank = 0, modifier = 1

* Green gift (premium), modifier = 6

* Technology (favourite), modifier = 9


&gt;**Companion conversion triggers**

Conversations with your companions are triggered by your affection with them. Some companions are extremely chatty (i.e. Quinn) and have alot of triggers. Other companions like Xalek are super quiet and have fewer triggers. 

Using this chart here, you can tell exactly when your next conversation with your companion happens! (**obviously lots of spoilers here :P**)

Empire: http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/empireconvotriggers.jpg

Republic: http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/republicconvotriggers.jpg

&gt;**The Rest**

I have updated the companion gift list for 1.2, now with enhanced romance function (For some companions, romancing them will increase their likeness to courting/luxury gifts. For other companions, romancing them will change their likeness towards several types of gifts). Keep in mind that these romances for now are opposite sex only.

I also added the ship droid crafting bonuses along with crafting bonuses for rest of the companions!

It makes a healer's life easier.,222,93,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/q3gre/psa_please_disable_your_titles_andor_legacy_last/,"As a healer I find myself missing a lot of heals that result in people dying because I simply can't click select my heal target. Yes, you can choose directly from Op screen, but sometimes there are multiple people getting low, but only 1 or 2 actively taking damage.

I have to look at both screen and pane to determine who I should heal at that moment. If you have your bar littered with something like ""Egggriddle Baconskillet, Knight of the Republic"", and you stand in a group of people with similarly long names, it's difficult to quickly determine what your actual ""name"" is and click the guy in my ops panel to heal you. So please, when you enter a Warzone, turn off your title and either turn off or convert to legacy bar your legacy last name. It makes it much easier to heal you in times of crisis.

Signed, a frustrated healer that keeps losing patients because their name is damn long I can't tell which one of their 3 part name is their actual name to click on my ops panel.

For the right reasons,172,49,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/15zop5/swtor_is_heading_in_the_wrong_direction_for_the/,"Ever since the game launched  bioware has included a variety of updates. It is my personal opinion that some of these updates are headed in the wrong direction. The whole point of Swtor was that it did something differently from the traditional mmo: story. And for an mmo, it did an amazing job with it. I found myself thinking of my characters as far more than some pixels that I would drag gear onto and make fight. Yet now, a year later, we haven't really seen any additions to story. I'm unsure of what the new expansion will bring, but even so, BW's main focus with updates recently has been more on pvp and ops and all that stuff. There is good reason for this, as many people complained about a lack of these things. It's kind of hypocritical actually, everyone complained it was too much like WOW and then turned around and compared its later content to WOW, not understanding that that was exactly the point of swtor; it was different from wow because of its focus on the story. Don't get me wrong having more warzones and everything is great, but I believe bioware should make story the top priority for future updates, just as it was originally. The truth is, many people have a hard time adjusting to this style, and that is why swtor has gotten so much negative reaction.



Edit: A lot of people seem to be saying story content is difficult to produce because it is expensive and takes a long time. However, I'm pretty sure that in early interviews, bioware said it already had voice acting done for story updates far into the future. If that still is true, story content would be a lot easier to make.

* The database seems to need a real update.(items, sortable data fields)
*  Tor Does not have ""Legendary"" items, but it does have ""modifiable"" items, and we should be able to search for just that category.
*  The filter system needs a major overhaul.(We should be able to associate ""and"" with a bracket of ""or"" ex. C and (A or B) and the other way too ex. C or (A and B).
*  They need to expand their sub-categories (namely Uncategorized) to include categories such as ""Ship Upgrades"", ""Lockboxes""

Just to name a few. The database update/upgrade would fix many of their problems since they could categorize crafting materials by skill, thus allowing them to be searched for, in addition to many MUCH needed updates.

What are you thoughts, updates you would like to see, things that would improve their site.

Don't let this happen to you.,176,50,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/ninme/alert_major_game_breaking_bug_dont_let_this/,"Apparently Bioware is aware of this issue, but nonetheless it's important to not fall into this trap yourself, as it's been going on for a few days now.

http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=38481

http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=20021

After completing some space dailies today, I found that I had 5 pending quests and could not send my companions out on missions. My inventory wasn't full at all when I was doing the missions, so the fact that they ended up as pending mystifies me.

While still on the ship, I tried clicking on the pending quest icon to redeem the rewards, but NOTHING happens. No dialog box or anything.

The gamebreaking part is that this does not allow you to accept any new quests. More importantly, if you're still on your ship, you will not be able to exit your ship or talk to your companions. Clicking on the door yields an ""ineligible for this conversation"" message. 

**My character right now is a level 27 paperweight who can do nothing but run space missions, as he cannot exit his ship.**

There appears to be some issues with certain quests not playing well with the pending quest feature. 

Personally my first issue with not being able to accept pending rewards started with finishing very last Sith Inquisitor quest on Balmorra by speaking to Major Bessiker. My inventory was full, but instead of giving out a pending reward, the instance seems to reset and clicking on Major Bessiker has you do the conversation over again. The quest updates and directs you to go to your ship, but clicking on the pending reward button opens nothing, and you're stuck with 1 pending quest, but are still able to go on.

If you have a similar issue. BE VERY CAREFUL when you go to do your space dailies. I would suggest not even doing them at all until this issue is resolved. 

Additionally I'd honestly suggest not trusting the pending quest system at all right now and always making sure your inventory has room for rewards.

I hope this helps some folks. If you are having this issue, make sure you include the word ""blueberry"" in your customer service ticket, as it will make your problem easier to identify for the CS people.

http://swtor.askmrrobot.com/gear


* **Fake items** don't show up in the database, like Mastercrafted mods and other ghosts.
* **If you search for a mod**, you'll get a complete list of items it can be ripped from. See for yourself with this [Advanced Acute Enhancement](http://swtor.askmrrobot.com/gear/8397/advanced-acute-enhancement-25).
* **Crafted items** have all of the variants with correct stats. [See an example](http://swtor.askmrrobot.com/gear/4465/biorestorative-belt).
* **Random items** have all of their variants listed (the first database to have this info!). See an example with [Electrotex bindings](http://swtor.askmrrobot.com/gear/280/prototype-electrotex-bindings)
* **3rd party API** coming in the next couple of weeks: we want to share this data with people who make tools, spreadsheets, and any other cool idea. If you're interested in using the API, drop me a note!

**What's missing?**

* Some sources aren't fleshed out, like mission rewards and world drops. Normal Mode flashpoint sources are 75% complete. HM FPs and Normal/HM/NiM are solid (thanks to Dulfy!), vendors and crafting are also complete.
* Right now, we show that some armorings can be ripped from Rakata and Battlemaster gear (etc) - that's wrong. We're fixing that TODAY!
* Ship items are not in the database yet.
* Comments. We're adding in a commenting system in the next couple of weeks.
* Tooltips for bloggers: also coming very soon
* Mobile app - that's right, a mobile view for the item database :) It will be a free app, so we can spread the accurate information to every user!

If you see ANY errors, leave a comment, we will fix them in less than 24 hours. We are dedicated to having the RIGHT information.

Also, a special thanks to [Dulfy](http://dulfy.net), [EZMode](http://sithwarrior.com/forums/Th%E2%80%8Bread-DPS-Craft-Warriors-Knights) and [Kray](http://sithwarrior.com/forums/Thread-Kray-s-Powertech-DPS-Simulator-v1-2-FULL-RELEASE) for helping with some of the item data..

Problems as of Dec 7th:
* No grace period
* Late shipping on vendors (amazon, walmart, etc)
* No security apps for iOS or Android

Corrections since the 7th:
* Grace period for 48 hours for all sales
* Vendors are shipping/ have shipped product prior to release date
* iOS has an app now; Android will have an app in the next few days

Pre-release has been simply awesome - Not only did it let us get into the full game days before launch, which did the following:
* allow players to start up on different days, allowing us to not have massive amounts of people doing the same stuff at the same time.
* The Pre-launch guild allows you to get with your friends faster and coordinate alts and new members easier into the system

I know without a doubt that the coming weeks will show us more support and make the changes to this MMO
