Hope they read it quickly. I called Amazon and they were great. Angel L. was very polite and confirmed the order tacking. He transfered me to Micah in the Kindle Dept. Micah confirmed what I expected. The device must have been stolen. He immediately bricked it and said he would have to work with his managers about expediting a replacement and would call me back.

**Shortcut to Kindle Store**: Alt+Home -- Brings you to the kindle store. 

**Games**: Alt+Shift+M= Minesweeper -- Then press G to play GoMuku. M to switch back to Minesweeper.

**Browsing (image) files**: Add a folder in the root of the kindle. Eject kindle from PC. Press Alt+Shift+Z to refresh listing. New folder should appear directly after your collections. **Update**: I haven't tested with other types of files such as word documents or the like but it should work... Hmm. 

**Screenshot**: Alt+Shift+G -- [Example](http://i.imgur.com/6H86M.gif) **Update:** I've tested the screenshot funtion, it seems to not record anything that contains personal information such as the (now added) Alt+411 screen. 

**Screen refresh**: Alt+G **OR** Shift + Alt + H -- I prefer the second option so you don't mix it up with the Screenshot option.

**Easy Numbers**: Alt+Top row= Q to P are now 1 to 0 -- Less use of the Sym key? I'm all for that!

**Getting today's date**: From the Home screen type Del and then type ""date"" (no quotes) and hit Enter. First result on your search will be today's Date.

**Calculator**: Yes, this even has a calculator. From the Home screen Del and then type the calculation using / for divide, * for multiply and ^ for creating exponents. I tested, square brackets ""[ ]"" and braces ""{ }"" are ignored and cannot be used. Use regular brackets ""( )"" instead for your more complex mathematical projects. Or just use a real calculator.

**Kindle Control and Info**: Go onto the Settings Tab (Menu-&gt;Settings) and then press 

 - Alt+311 Use this to manually switch 3G network providers. I don't recommend doing this and leaving it at the default with switches based on signal strength.
 - Alt+411 Gives you info about the wifi network or 3G network you are connected to, as well as some info about the Kindle.
 - Alt+611 Gives you a wealth of information about the 3G phone number that your Kindle is using, modem info, etc. 
 - Alt+711 Gives you info about the Wifi you are using.
 - Alt+911 Doesn't work, I tried. 
 - Note, you cannot take screenshots of these screens.

**Bookmarks**: [Alt+B](http://i.imgur.com/rO0gk.gif) -- Add or removes bookmark.

**Play music/audiobooks**: Alt+Space plays/pauses music in your music folder from any menu or place in your kindle. (Thanks Mintz08.) To skip to the next track: alt + f (Thanks to meleva)

**Launch/stop Text to speech**: shift + sym (Thanks to meleva for that tip)

**Barcode Shortcut**: alt+shift + . (Thanks meleva. I can't add a screenshot for this as like all confidential info it looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Z5WmB.gif).)

That's it for now, I'll update as I find them. (Screenshots to follow.)

(Using Gill Dyslexic),122,13,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/n0jn0/this_is_how_i_made_a_dyslexic_friendly_kindle_for/,"How to create a Kindle friendly custom font out of Gill Dyslexic Font.  I do not wish to take credit for things that are not my creation.  The maker of the Gill Dyslexic font is a redditor, without him this would not be possible.  I originally created this tweak/hack so that I could give my bride a special gift on our wedding day.  A book she could finally read (and be relaxed) on our honeymoon.  And not just any book, EVERY book she ever wants.  No one had done specifically this before (that I knew of) so I had to pretty much figure this out.  This is what I did.  Below I will condense these instructions so they are as brief as possible especially when numerous guides and information already exist. 



Step 1: Jailbreak your kindle - start here: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004
Step 2: Install the custom fonts hack on your kindle : http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004
Step 3: $20 Purchase the Gill Dyslexic font from : http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ 
Step 4: Create a Gill custom font that is kindle ready, then install it!

the following files need new names (they come from the archive you will receive after purchasing the Gill_Dyslexic Font)


Gill_Dyslexic_Bold.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Bold.ttf

Gill_Dyslexic_Bolditalic.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Bolditalic.ttf

Gill_Dyslexic_Italic.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Italic.ttf

Gill_Dyslexic_Dyslexic.ttf &amp;amp;amp;gt; Serif_Regular.ttf

Now place these files into the \linkfonts\fonts folder on your kindle.  You should back up the original files that will be there so that you can replace them if you want to un-mod your font. You will choose to overwrite with these new ones.  The last step is to reboot your kindle after adding the font.  I am not an expert at modifying fonts so I'm not 100% sure that this is the easiest way to do things, but this definitely works.

Edit: A secondary tip: She says that raising font size and making line space bigger also make a huge difference. (she didn't have a kindle before this hack so these other advantages of an e-reader add to the experience for her)",,False,self,t5_2qudz,True,,,True,t3_n0jn0,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/n0jn0/this_is_how_i_made_a_dyslexic_friendly_kindle_for/,

One of the things that's really kept me reading every day is the fact that the Kindle indicates just how much time it should take to finish the chapter I am currently reading. I think I used to avoid reading paperbacks for so long because the sheer number of pages could seem so daunting to my subconscious, whereas defining chapters in terms of minutes is a real confidence booster.

However, all of a sudden, I noticed that my Kindle's estimates were really off.  Chapters that would previously take 20-25 minutes were now estimated as 5-6 minutes.  This was discouranging, and I was wondering if there was anyway to re-train the Kindle to judge my reading time accurately again.

I did some seraching and apparently this is a common problem. However, it seems that the solution is very easy and not too well-known, so I thought I would share it with you on this subreddit.

You can reset your Kindle's reading time estimates at any time while reading a book. Bring up the menu bar (the one at the top of the screen) and tap the search icon.  In the search field, type the following:

    ;ReadingTimeReset

This is case sensitive, and note the leading semicolon. When you execute the search and go back to the book, you'll see that your reading pace is being recalculated.  When I did this and reached the next chapter, my reading time estimate was properly re-calibrated.

I only have experience with the Kindle Paperwhite, but I would be interested if this works with other Kindle models.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_1dxr1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1dxr1h/how_to_fix_kindle_reading_time_estimates/,

It also uses [Readability](http://www.keyvan.net/2010/08/php-readability/) to make some articles look better- like the Kindle browser's 'Article mode'.

I've been reading all my novels on the Kindle (Sony Reader before that) for the past 3 years, and it's only recently struck me that I almost never remember the title of the book I'm reading while I'm reading it, or the titles of books I've read. I'll remember that it was a recent book by a certain author, but only rarely will I remember the title.

The reason for this: I never see the book cover, or I see it only once, and the title does not appear on the reading page of the Kindle. With paperback novels, every time you pick a book up or put it down, you look at the cover - you see the title as well as the cover art.

**Some useful websites that format very well on the Kindle:** 

  * Google.com!
  * Gmail.com.  Mobile gmail use to work, but now doesn't...hmmmm
  * Hotmail Mobile -mail.live.com/m
  * BBC News Mobile -bbc.co.uk/news/mobile
  * Google News Mobile -news.google.com/news/i?dc=organic&amp;source=mobileproducts
  * NY Times Mobile -mobile.nytimes.com
  * Ebay Mobile -m.ebay.com
  * Wikitravel Mobile -m.wikitravel.org/
  * Facebook Mobile -m.facebook.com
  * Weather Underground Mobile - m.wund.com/  (weather.com mobile doesn't work very well)
  * Wikipedia, especially with 'Article Mode'.  Mobile wikipedia does *not* work
  * Kindlequest.com (text-based adventure games).  
  * Kindlemap.net (Google Maps reformatted for Kindle screen):  [Thanks to this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/dntan/kindlemapnet_uses_google_maps_to_show_you/)

**Play Minesweeper, 5-in-a-row:**

  * Press Alt, 'up arrow', and 'm' simultaneously

**Use Kindle to view photos (little buggy):**

  * Navigate to your Kindle via your PC or MAC.  Create a folder in the kindle titled 'pictures'  Within this fold, create a folder with name &lt;whatever you want&gt;, and put your photos there.  Exit to home and press Alt Z.  &lt;whatever you want&gt; will then show up as a book that can be opened. 

**Search all your books instantly for specific terms/search wikipedia quickly/etc:**

  * Use the 'search' command in the main menu.  Seems like not a tip, but I'd ignored it until recently - makes searching Wikipedia/Google *much* faster. 

**For viewing regular websites (e.g. not mobile versions):**

  *  it often helps to switch the view to landscape mode.  And it very often helps to utilize the 'article mode' via the browser menu. 

**If you have unprotected files that Kindle can't read - or just can't read well (Many PDF's).  You can email [files of these types](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_navbox_recognize_200375630?nodeId=200375630&amp;#recognize) to Amazon, via:**

  * &lt;YourAmazonUsername@free.kindle.com&gt;.  They will email the file back to you.  Or, if you have wifi available - download it over that, apparently.  
  *  &lt;YourAmazonUsername@kindle.com&gt;.  They will send it to you over over 3G wireless *for a fee*.  Higher fee if you are physically outside the US. 
  *  If you're sending a PDF though - you need to put ""convert"" as the subject line
  * You can send multiple files for conversion in the same email
  * if any of those multiple files are PDFs, then again - put ""convert"" (no quotes) on the subject line. 

**For free ebooks:**

  * Amazon.com has many free (old) books instantaneously available.  When available, it's more convenient than searching Google and/or using other websites.  Many dislike Amazon's free-book formatting though. I think it's great, but may be in the minority.  

  * Torrents can be your friend for some books...if even the file is sometimes in a non-compatible format.  Either send it to Amazon to convert, or do it yourself with software. 

**To quickly type numbers:**

  * 'Alt' + Q = 1.  Up arrow + W = 2, Up arrow + E = 3, etc. 

**One slightly shady tip?**

  * If you register as living outside the US you can only access Wikipedia &amp; The Amazon store in the browser when using 3G (for wifi everything works).  Say I'm an American and I travel to Japan - I get free 3G internet.  If I'm a Japanese living in Japan, or a Canadian in Canada- no such luck.  To fix this: 

  * Go to your account [here](http://i.imgur.com/no8Yo.png), and change your nation to the US.  The effect should be instantaneous. No idea the risk, I imagine it's very small to non-existent.  I'm not certain the logic of denying it to all non-US customers.   For instance, - the Koreans pay much less for data download over cell than Americans, yet they can't access the web with their Kindles...


**Minor things:**

  * Alt-Home opens the Kindle store immediately
  * Pressing menu anytime displays the time/available space on the top of the screen (I'd missed this for quite a while).  
  * Probably best to leave the wireless off when you're not using it.  It cuts into battery life quite a bit, and the more your battery is discharged/recharged, the faster it will ""age"" (lose capacity).  In the long term, it could help.   Anyone know if it's best for battery life to turn the Kindle on/off several times a day, or just put it in sleep mode?
   * To take a screenshot: Alt-Shift-G It will save to your Kindle. Access it via USB.

**Last note for anyone who hadn't realized it:**

  * For 3G version - You get *free* pervasive wireless internet in over 100 nations.  That means you can check your gmail/respond(slowly), whilst on a bus outside Cairo!  As well as look up things to see on wikitravel mobile, read the news, or wherever.  For free.  That's amazing. 

  * If anyone wants to tether their Kindle to their laptop for free 3G internet - don't try to.  Seriously.  Free 3G internet on the Kindle is amazingly generous.  Don't take *that much* advantage of it by multiplying your data usage by 1000x and thus ruining it for the rest of us.  

These were the tips I thought were best/not horribly obvious.  I've already sold two friends on the Kindle, so I'd rather write this once then go over it piecemeal which each one when I see them.  Maybe it can be useful to someone in this reddit as well, or maybe not.

After several hours of frustration, I discovered that the solution is a combination of things found online. I think it's worthwhile to combine them here.

The reason I ended up with a google books ebook is because I have a required reading for class that isn't available on amazon for the kindle. I purchased it on Google books with the assumption that I'd be able to work out a conversion, then researched it. Using this and similar methods opens up a ton of book options. My first stop will still be amazon for ebooks, but if they're not available I'll search every other ebook store I can find. Conversions *are* available, if frustrating.

Following instructions are given assuming users are on Mac OSX. It shouldn't be too different for windows.

-----

**1)** Purchase the book and download the "".acsm"" file. 

**2)** Download and install [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/). 

**3)** Double click the "".acsm"" file. It should open into Digital Editions.

**4)** Navigate to /Users/[your username]/Documents/Digital Editions in finder. You should see your purchased book with a "".epub"" file extension

**5)** Download and install [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), as well as the [combined tools package](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/hello-world/). Unzip the combined tools package.

(Following instructions are from the tools package creator's [blog](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/ebooks-formats-drm-and-you-%E2%80%94-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/), with edits by me to reflect changes since he published)

**6)** Run calibre. Click Preferences. Click “plugins.” 

**7)** Click on the “Load plugin from File” button

**8)** Navigate to the tools folder unzipped in step 4

**9)** Open the “Calibre_Plugins” folder

**10)** Select one of the zip files in that folder

**11)** Click on Add (or the button may say “Open”)

**12)** Click on the “Yes” button in the warning dialog that appears. A Confirmation dialog appears that the plug-in has been installed.

**13)** Repeat steps 4 to 9 for every zip file in the Calibre_Plugins folder (five at present). 

**NOTE:** If you want to do conversions other than for Google Books, you may have to configure the plugins. This is not required for EPUB, but it may be for ebooks purchased elsewhere. Alf's [blog](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/ebooks-formats-drm-and-you-%E2%80%94-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/) provides full instructions)

**14)** In Calibre, click add books. Navigate to 11. /Users/[your username]/Documents/Digital Editions, and open your .epub file

**15)** Highlight your book, click ""convert books,"" and select ""mobi"" under ""output format.""

**16)** Once complete, the cover should be visible on the right side of Calibre. Underneath it, click to open the path. Connect your kindle and drag the .mobi file into ""documents.""

-----

What's going on:

There are plenty of guides out there for converting epub to kindle already. These, however, are all DRM-free epub files. If you *purchase* a google book, the file you download is not the book itself. To read it offline you have to use adobe digital editions. Digital editions quietly accesses the true file and generates an epub, albeit one with DRM. Opening this in Calibre will result in [this](http://i.imgur.com/QH7T3.png) message, unless you install the plugins mentioned above. 

These plugins strip the DRM from the file, allowing Calibre to convert it to a format kindle recognizes. 

**Disclaimer**

    The ebook industry is flawed. Consumers should not have to jump through hoops to read a book on whatever
    device they choose. THAT BEING SAID I am NOT advocating that ebooks being ‘pirated’. The goal of this list
    of instructions is to help people liberate books they have purchased. ""Dedrmed"" ebooks should not be shared
    or uploaded for distribution.

[Here's the link to the book.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TPZ7XO/)

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US, presented as a series of vignettes.

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:


[On whether teachers become attracted to students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k858y/teachers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_fallen_in_love/c2i8xq4)

[On teaching evolution in a rural southern high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/q0ee4/i_aint_even_mad/c3try9d)

[On a student who threatened to accuse me of sexual harassment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62u4)

[On a time where I tried to hold a lazy kid accountable and failed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62v2)

[The story that led me to quit teaching](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6ags)

People read these posts and encouraged me to write the book.  So I did.  Now it's free if you want to read it.

If you're reading these words, you can read the book.  [Here are all of the free Kindle apps you can use.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000493771)

If you download the book and read it, consider leaving a review of the book on the Amazon product page or over at Goodreads, so other people will know whether it's worth the investment.

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know, and thanks for reading!

If there is better subreddit let me know. I bought a Black Kindle Keyboard 3G from craigslist on August 19. I went to register it, but found out the kindle has been blacklisted on July 31st 2012. 

After searching the web as to what i should do i realized that either i can report to the police or find the owner myself. Amazon's policy does not allow for me to return the kindle via amazon to the owner. I am content with the fact i will never be refunded my money, but i still want to return the kindle to the respective owner. 

So if you live in the Cincinnati / West Chester area and you lost your kindle please let me know. The only other clue is that kindle came with a blue M-Edge case with Red ribbons. 

Just PM the registration code and once verified I will send it to you. If there are better ways of doing this please let me know

At first I just figured it was around somewhere, but then I couldn't find it. I tore up multiple rooms in the house searching for it. I searched the vehicles probably twice each. I retraced my steps to every place I had been in the past month, asking people if I had left it there. This included a few restaurants as well as some people for whom I did some computer work. Maybe it had fallen out of my backpack.

I know that when you lose your Kindle, you're supposed to deregister it so that they can't buy books with your money. I didn't do this, because it was the only connection I still had with the device, as inconsequential as it may have been. Maybe if I saw books being bought, I could look at the purchase history to get some clues as to who was doing it.

I decided to send myself a message in a last ditch attempt to convince whoever had it -- if anyone had it -- to return it to me. This is the message:

                                             
&gt;Hey. I would really appreciate it if you would return my Kindle to me. If you took it and choose to return it, I won't be mad or anything. Just do the right thing and let me have it back. 

&gt;My phone number is [phone number]. Call me and let me know where I can meet you to retrieve it. 

&gt;This message was sent on July 3rd, 2011.

Well, last Thursday, I got a response. Someone at a restaurant called me and said he had found my ""electric book."" He didn't speak very good English. I had called the same place weeks before and they said they hadn't seen it. The man said something about how he had played around with it a bit trying to figure out what it was and who owned it and whatnot. Thing is, there weren't any open wifi access points near the restaurant. He probably had taken it home, messed around with it some, and eventually figured out how to make it connect to the Internet. Once he did this, my message came through and I guess he decided to do the right thing.

I still look at the Kindle sitting on my desk and am pretty much amazed that I actually got it back. Sometimes people will surprise you, I guess.

I know these things are easy to lose, so I was posting this in case anyone else was in a similar position. Just be smart about it, check everywhere you *may* have been, and don't deregister the damn thing. If I hadn't sent that message, I would have never seen my electric book again.

Then back on the GoodReads page I noticed a ""download ebook"" button.  When I clicked it, it gave options for mobi, epub and pdf.  I clicked the mobi link and it downloads and opened in Kindle for PC.  Thinking it must surely just be a sample/excerpt I checked the size ... over 5000 locations (about the size of a novel).  Checking through the first pages there's a Creative Commons Licence attached to it.

I've used GoodReads for a while but had no idea they offered e-books at all.

A little further digging into the options I could even tell it which model of kindle I have and provide the kindle's e-mail address so it can send the books directly to my kindle.

I think everyone who took my questionnaire is just as curious as I was to find out the results.  

The base measurements are:  

Appromiately 22% (~1/5) of Kindles broke in some way shape or form. This is a very high number.  

About 19% (again, ~1/5) users will had at least one such device. 29% (~1/3) of those unlucky people are very unlucky, and  had at multiple device failures.    

* Definitely favour a hard case over a sleeve, skin, or nakedness.  
* Your device is safest (in order): At home, in your hands, in your vehicle, in a side-carry bag, a backpack, in a pocket. However, there is no strong correlation between how many days you bring out your Kindle and how likely it is to break  
* The devices were more likely to break in the first year than later.   
* The most recommended book was the Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, on which the television series Game of Thrones is based.

Surely, e-books would be cheaper. The distribution markup is minimal. Let's be honest: _how could they not_ be cheaper?

This seemed to be true at first, although I did find books i would normally buy on a Kindle simply to be too expensive. But over time - even this evening - as browse Amazon.com I become more and more disappointed at the cost of Kindle books being too expensive: simply too many are the same price as their physical cousins. Some are even more expensive.

The Kindle is a closed market. The publishers seem to know this, and price their books accordingly.

It's true the Kindle gives independent authors a shot at making it big. But with publishers pricing their books oddly high, I can't help but just consider buying the paper version from now on - and not upgrading to the next version of the Kindle.

""Fairfield is a quiet logging town that is slowly fading from memory. When a strange object falls from the sky and crashes down in the woods, it is one of the most exciting events to happen in recent history. Two young boys decide to track down the fallen object, and unwittingly unleash a terrible darkness.

Sinister forces spread through Fairfield, invading the minds of the citizens and transforming them into mindless drones. Sam Gibson, disinterested slacker and soon-to-be high school dropout, finds himself thrust into the leadership of a ragtag group of survivors that includes a juvenile delinquent, an elderly shopkeeper, a young teacher, and his own mother. Together, this unlikely team must battle for not only their survival, but for the future of the human race. As they struggle to free the town, they will discover a horrifying truth about the nature of their enemy, and will have to face a terror from beyond the stars.""

It's pretty much a B-movie in book form, full of gunfights, explosions, and mindless alien zombies. If that sounds like your kind of thing, please download it! If you actually read it, feel free to leave a review on the Amazon page.

I thought I would post it here for anyone that doesn't like browsing the Kindle Owner's Lending Library books on their Kindle.

1. On Amazon.com, click on the left button in the search bar that has the word ""All"" &amp; a down arrow. Select ""Books"".
2. Click on the right button in the search bar that has the word ""Go"" (that's right, you're leaving the search criteria blank).
3. Under the Format header, click ""Kindle Edition"".
4. On the left hand menu bar, towards the bottom (you'll have to scroll), click a radio button that says ""Prime Eligible"".

Viola! You have a list of the Kindle Owner's Lending Library books.

As crazy as it sounds, there is no way to do this by navigating the ""Shop by Department"" menu, or by entering ""Prime Eligible"" as search criteria.

Without hesitation he told me they would be sending me a brand new Kindle because it should have survived a fall from that height.

The screen made a cracking sound and only a corner continued to work.


Tonight, I called Amazon to see what my options were for a replacement. I was informed that my method of screen destruction was not covered by the warranty, but I could get a cheaper replacement ($65). However, with shipping ($20) and the possibility of a customs fee (~$45), it was not a real great option. I asked if there were Kindle retailers in Colombia and the Amazonian put me on hold. When she came back, she offered me a one-time free replacement with all of the shipping and customs fees covered. Additionally, it will be here by next week.


 I am so happy. I had heard tales of Amazon's customer service, but didn't imagine it would be this incredible.

I just canceled the factory reset and voilá, it booted up again fine.

so, in case you ever come across this... here's what you can do.

1. Initiate hard reset, Hold power button for 30sec.
2. Hold [Home] key, after 10-60sec Kindle will show prompt to reset Kindle.
3. Enter ""RESET"" word on keyboard, and you Kindle will reset to factory defaults.
4. If it not help you, you need to ask support from Amazon or use Serial adapter to restore Kindle.

[Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/nrwxp/is_it_possible_to_get_several_reddits_like_rnews/)

Download and install [calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download).

After installing you'll be asked for your kindle email address, to find this out, go to amazon in the top right ""your account"" then on the right ""Manage Your Kindle"" then on the left of the next screen click ""Personal Document Settings"" under ""Your Kindle Account"" your kindle's email will be under ""Send-to-Kindle E-Mail Settings""

**ADDING THE FEEDS**

2. When you have installed calibre, launch it and in the top right corner, click the arrow next to [""Fetch news""](http://imgur.com/0F9yf) 
3. Click ""Add a custom news source""
4. On the right, you'll see a box and below that ""Add feed to recipe"" and below that two text boxes, one that says ""Feed title"" and another that says ""Feed URL""
5. In feed title simply type the name you want your kindle to display for the section. E.g. /r/news, News
6. In feed URL, use the following URL
    http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?RedditRedux=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2fSUBREDDITHERE%2F.rss&amp;_id=ebd66161e6d27407fa14c27f1f6e60b1&amp;_render=rss
7. Replace SUBREDDITHERE with the name of the subreddit, e.g. for [/r/worldnews](/r/worldnews) it would be worldnews or the full URL would be:
    http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?RedditRedux=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2fworldnews%2F.rss&amp;_id=ebd66161e6d27407fa14c27f1f6e60b1&amp;_render=rss
8. Paste this URL in the ""Feed URL"" section. The reason you need to use this long URL is because otherwise, the feeds would be sent to your kindle with the proper title, but the contents would be that of a random comment in the thread, the yahoo pipe fetches the contents of the linked article and uses that instead.
9. Click ""Add feed"".
10. Back to the top now, set ""Recipe title"" to reddit
11. Set ""Oldest article"" to 1 days
12. And leave ""Max. number of articles per feed"" or turn it down to say, 10, so you only get the top ten from each reddit.
13. When you are finished, click ""Switch to Advanced mode"" at the top.
14. Paste the line below into it like [this](http://i.imgur.com/cFrCp.png).

     masthead_url = 'http://i.imgur.com/389h7.png'
15. After that simply click ""Add/Update recipe"" on the left.
15. Exit this window.

**SETTING THE FEEDS TO AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE**

1. Go back up to ""Fetch news"" click the triangle next to it.
2. Expand the option ""Custom"" on the left.
3. Click ""reddit"".
4. Check off ""Schedule for download"" then ""Days of the week"" and the days of the week you wish to receive the feeds.
5. Set ""Download after"" to whenever you wish for the feeds to be downloaded and sent.
6. At the bottom set ""Delete downloaded news older than"" to ""1 days""
7. Click ""Download now"" at the bottom of this window.
8. Exit this window.

You have now set up calibre and as long as it's running it will send feeds to you from your favourite subreddits everyday.

Some examples of feeds you can use: http://pastebin.com/Jui87RHG

I've read more since I got this than I have in a long time. A little while ago I was taking one of my dogs out and set it on a table next to my door and, in my dog's excitement to get out, she knocked it off of the table, causing it to land face-down on the floor. I do have it in a case, but the case was open when it fell.

It still works, but in the middle of the screen there's a nick, almost like when a rock hits the windshield of your car, and there's pixels that appear to be stuck on, making a dot about 1/3 the size of a letter in the middle of the screen. The Kindle still functions, but this dot is horribly distracting... it looks like a few of the e-ink pixles were damaged. 

Just for amusement, I contacted Amazon and after walking me through resetting it, to no avail, they're sending me a replacement via 2-day mail. 

For something that was totally my fault, Amazon is replacing my Kindle, no questions asked. THAT is how you get a customer for life. 

**EDIT** For anyone who's curious, [here's a picture](http://imgur.com/yP3Tz) of the damage. When the screen blinks during page turns the spot turns white, then back to black.

I normally read 3-5 books a month and have no problem paying for my hobby.

However recently i have noticed a very disturbing trend in E-book prices...They are getting more expensive every day.

For example on Jan 20 2011 i bought ""Game of Thrones"" for $5.00...now just a few months later the  price is $8.99, the same price as the Paperback...why? there is no reason why an E-book is as expensive as a Paperback that was released in 1997.

Another example is ""The Hobbit""..$9.99 while the paperback is $7.99...


My dilemma is this...i feel like im being taken advantage of by publishing companies...here i spent $189 on a device to read books in a nice compact file that is really convenient. However i did give up a few things in the process, such as being able to lend out my books and possibly even shop around for a better price...not to mention trade/selling my used books. 


Once you buy a Kindle...or any other E-reading device..you become trapped by the ridiculous prices being set forth by publishing companies as of late...

Or take 25 min and download a Torrent with all the books i could ever want, but in the process possibly destroying the very format i have grown to love.

Turns out changing the title tag via Calibre was not enough - the kindle uses special exth tags that need to be changed.  I also found a couple other interesting tags out, like the ASIN (amazon book ID) that will make the 'Book Description' option show up in the menu and link you to the book description on Amazon.com if you click it (like any book you purchase through the store.)  I also did not like how Calibre, by default, was re-encoding the MOBI.  This solution, by default, changes nothing.

*Note*:  I am sure Calibre can do this but I did not want to go through and find all the options, and have to de-select everything else to keep it intact.  When I changed the title and saved the file on Calibre, it cut the file size to 75%.  This was not what I wanted.

Follow [these](http://www.ehow.com/how_5993830_edit-metadata-kindle.html) instructions to step 12.  Then, you need to add to the following 3-4 tags to make the Kindle think the MOBI is a book (to edit these, you need to click the tag in the EXTH dropdown, fill in the data, then check the box, and click convert, one at a time.  This could be streamlined with a batch, I bet):

*     113 - ASIN     Paste the ASIN from the Amazon page for the kindle version here
* 501 - cdetype      Paste the letters 'EBOK' here
* 503 - updatedtitle     Paste the title you want  (if you want to change it.)
* 504 - ASIN     Paste the ASIN to this tag as well.

That's it - now your MOBI should behave similiar to the AZW files you have on the kindle from Amazon - same menus and options.

If anyone has a simpler solution than this, by all means let us know - I am looking into making a batch to bypass the usage of the GUI so I can drop MOBI files on it and have the tags automatically populated.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_qk62x,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/qk62x/how_to_edit_the_tags_in_a_mobi_so_your_kindle/,

I have since done the usual review and complaint. I did not ask for a refund, I expresed my disdain that this is a widespread issue across many publishers and that if given enough attention will become a larger issue. 

Personally I hope it does become an issue. I hope it gets the attention that it deserves that if we're going to pay the same price for an ebook as a paperback, that we expect the same proofreading standards.

I wouldn't say things are perfect though, and the screen is still too small IMHO for reading books with graphs, equations, etc.

I few more things regarding PDFs:

* multi-touch is a bit choppy, mostly because of the slow refresh rate of the e-ink. Panning is much smoother than zooming though.

* The initial zoom step seems to be fairly large, but afterwards you can zoom in further almost continuously. Here's an example of what I mean:

1. [initial view of a page](http://i.imgur.com/hHEcV.jpg)
1. [first zoom (smallest possible pinch)](http://i.imgur.com/YBYJ0.jpg)
1. [continuously zooming to this point](http://i.imgur.com/RrApf.jpg)

* Notice that even when you zoom in there's still a blank border around the page. Not sure why the Kindle doesn't use the entire screen.

* Low-res scanned PDFs are fairly ugly at the default zoom. Maybe a bit of anti-aliasing would help.

So, information being inaccessible, I set out to research, write, and apply a guide on how to tether the Kindle Keyboard 3G.

After completing the guide, having worked on it for several weeks, I had instructions on how to tether, for OS X and Windows. I thought: ""Wow, people will find this really helpful!"" And so I posted the guide to a well-known e-reader forum.

I wonder why I expected something different.

Immediately, I was met with the same insults and responses as everyone else had; it could even be said to be worse: this time I had been giving out the information instead of requesting it. Met with a swift permaban, I left the forum.

Then I turned to Reddit, doing research on the general attitude on tethering. Two requests, both met with hostility and downvotes. The only positive reply I had seen was stevez's. This made me sad. Reddit praises its view of tolerance and acceptance, yet topics like these are shunned and hated.

I was reluctant even to post *this* reply, fearing for my karma. But, it's something that really bothers me. 

The forum has long since removed the link to my guide, and for some reason, I can't be indexed by Google. ~~If you want the link, PM me.~~ If you feel the need to downvote me simply for offering this link, then there's nothing I can do about that.

**tl;dr**: The Internet's hating on tethering the Kindle 3G. Reddit's hating, too.

**Edit**: There seems to be a lot more interest than previously thought: so here's the link outright: [Guide](http://lickitung.it.cx/page/tether.html)

* Custom fonts
* Custom screensavers (I'd like it to be the cover of the current book I'm reading)
* Better collection management, including via a web or computer interface.
* Progress bar- just so much wasted space down there for something that doesn't show much info. I don't see why the % needs it's own line.

**The book**
*A Shock to the System (The Chance of a Realtime)*

**Description**
Almost 20 years after the events chronicled in the Shadowfast Supercar Driver Logs, former road warrior and outlaw Jerry Staute is busy shepherding a secret project hidden within a larger industrial contract in Boston Massachusetts, when he one day finds himself the victim of a most unusual mugging. His assailants manage to do something extraordinary to his mind, which leaves him virtually deranged for some days afterwards. Once he regains his senses, he realizes he now possesses fresh new memories of strange events which supposedly occurred years before, during his college days. Events that he is certain never took place. And yet now, he recalls them as if they did!

Concerned for his sanity-- as well as baffled by who would want to do this to him and why-- Staute soon realizes his only clues to the mystery may be within the false memories themselves. And so he begins to examine them from the beginning.

What he discovers there turns out to be a mind-boggling adventure of literally historic proportions; mind-bending people and events, which become only more fantastic the deeper he goes-- while at the same time becoming ever more believable as well. To the point that Staute begins to both hope-- and fear-- that these were real experiences on his part; experiences that he somehow had been forced to forget, until now.

She was telling me about all the books she's been reading. She powered through the ""Diary Of A Wimpy Kid"" series and even started reading Twilight (yeah yeah .. I know .. but at least she's reading.)

When I was growing up my parent's always encouraged me to read. When times were good they'd always buy me books. When times were not so good they'd always drive me to the library.

I want to pass this onto my niece and was thinking of buying her a Kindle. Here's how I'd like to see it work:

I buy my niece a Kindle and link it to my Amazon account. From the Kindle (or through Amazon's site directly) she can add books to a wish list. I am able to see her wish list and buy her books any time I want. The books, obviously, get sent directly to her Kindle.

Has anyone done something similar? I checked Amazon and they seem to have a large selection of kids books.

My niece is very mature so I am certain she'll respect the Kindle and not break it.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I spoke with my sister yesterday and she's overjoyed about me buying my niece a Kindle. I set up an Amazon account (not associated with a credit card) for my niece to create a wish list. I ordered her Kindle yesterday.

We live less than a minutes drive from each other so when I get the Kindle I will take it over and explain how to use it... though she'll probably figure it out herself.

I mentioned to my sister that there was no real way to lock her Kindle out from buying books on my account. But she said as long as we tell her not to .. she won't.

I often also buy ""in advance"" if I find an author (fiction) or topic (non-fiction) I like. For example I bought all of Alan Furst's books and ration them out to myself one every few months. Why?  Because I love them. 

I also travel a fair bit and after years of resisting it, I bought a Kindle a while back. I have to admit that the number of ""hard copy"" books I am buying has fallen significantly, but I still have a huge backlog of titles on my shelves that I am eagerly looking forward to. As I have a young family, my trips away on business are often my best opportunity to catch up on reading. Nothing like 14 hours on plane to get through a book!

What I have found, though, is that I sometimes want to read a title I already own, but without taking the actual physical book with me.  I've found myself buying the Kindle version for my trip even though I already purchased the hard copy. 

I dont really know how I feel about this. I do ***not*** pirate (let's not go there; it's a personal moral choice), so I feel OK about not grabbing a copy off some BitTorrent site, but a part of me thinks I should be allowed to read the content in whatever format I want, once I've paid for it.

1. Crop your PDF using [briss](http://briss.sourceforge.net/).
1. Use [k2pdfopt](http://www.willus.com/archive/) on the newly cropped PDF. I used the default values for the Kindle. You will obtain a PDF with smaller margins and a overall much more readable text.
1. After transfering the PDF to the Kindle, adjust the contrast to make the letters more readable

The logic went like this ""Studies show that children become readers when there are a lot of books in their home - with eBooks, there is no physical presence.  Will somebody please think of the children?!""  It was a little hard to stay quiet, but I did.

It was inane.  Firstly - any such studies were likely performed before the existence of eReaders.  Secondly - I (and other bibliophiles, I'd wager) still don't think ideal readers exist for kids, for picture books, comics, visually based reference, art or illustrated books, magazines etc.  At least not at a pleasing scale and/or accessible price range.

I've encountered a fair amount of freaking out about the death of paper publication.  The logic that ""if you really love books - you don't use an eReader"" floats frequently through discussion. I even felt that way a few years back.

My reasoning is that if you love _reading_ you would be foolish not to consider doing so digitally.  The benefits outweigh the drawbacks in spades.  In a little while - fisher price indestructible eReaders with an 11"" screen will make a child's giant picture book library into an appealing item they can sit on their lap and drop in the baby pool.  Devices will start getting comics and graphics magazines right, too.

At that time, there will still be paper book lovers.  They will have to pay more, and may not have physical stores they can browse - but I doubt anyone is going to kill paper altogether.

I don't think I've seen a technological transition up close like this before - where people are so completely freaked out by change.  I guess the transition away from vinyl records was like this for some people, I just wasn't aware of those people like I am the book people.

I'm unashamedly tossing shelves and shelves worth of books into boxes and putting them into storage.  They'll go out the door after I'm certain it is the right choice for me (having collected them for most of my life).  For now - give me 1300 in the palm of my hand, and another 2400 on 2 or 3 discs (fully aware that I'll only ever read 30% of these in my life)... and I'm good to go - with no worries that my kids will feel any differently than I do about reading.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_pk0er,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/pk0er/ebookaphobia_care_to_share_your_experiences/,

My experience, which we'll use as the performance test, was as follows:

I added 900+ books via USB to my kindle 3, and from the time it was unplugged, my battery dropped down to 1/4 in a stretch of only about 12 hours.

However a large percentage of the reading for my course as been scanned by the apparently drunk on-site faculty, and not converted into a single page format nor OCR'd at any point in its miserable little life, so I couldn't convert it to kindilized goodness like you can with most ""official"" journal articles. All these ghetto-scanned articles were a nightmare for readability. 

I soon discovered the excellent [briss](sourceforge.net/projects/briss), which helped a little bit, but I was still left squinting at badly scanned, poor contrast ""text"" on a screen that was too small.

Bored in the library one day, I discovered Abbyy Finereader 10 lurking on the system and thought I'd give it a go. All I can say is that it has changed my feelings about the kindle- it is basically an OCR program that reads your scanned PDF, I then strip headers, footers and margins and output to a word document, which I save an email with the convert option to my kindle. It sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but the process takes probably 5 minutes max. The accuracy is astounding, I had fiddled around with OCR 6 or 7 years ago and wasted my time- but things have apparently come a long way. 

If anyone else out there is struggling, squinting at badly scanned PDF's check out FineReader (or another non-partisan solution).

Just for fun, [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/171693/ltwk7-graeber.pdf) is a pdf that sucked to read on the kindle (it's only been run through Briss) and [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/171693/ltwk7-graeber.azw) is the azw that I ended up with. 

Also, protip: TTS is another godsend, I sometimes get distracted if I'm reading something quite dry, but with TTS you're forced to keep up- and you can read and take notes at the same time. And the Kindle's TTS is surprisingly neat- it parses things like 'e.g.' as ""for example"" and ""1984"" as ""Nineteen Eighty Four"".",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_fsvsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/fsvsh/students_of_the_world_and_anyone_else_that_has_to/,

I don't understand why you would turn the paperwhite light up brighter when it's bright outside.  Isn't one of the great features of the original kindle that it was a solid surface that light reflected off of?  If the paperwhite works the same way, then it should be the opposite; it should be that you would turn the light DOWN in bright light, not UP.

This makes me wonder if paperwhite is not really a true e-ink ... or perhaps it's different in some way, and bright ambient light doesn't reflect off of it well.

While surfing, my brain is starved for information and instant gratification (yes, this was even before I discovered reddit). :) Since the arrival of the internet my reading of fiction has significantly lessened and also my reading focus/quality has become worse. I rarely finish whole articles before I'm off opening new tabs and sites. It's quite compulsive and even mixed with slight anxiety and so I yearn to get back to that meditative peacefulness which (real) reading used to bring me. However I don't want to give up the newest articles on certain subjects, so quitting the internet altogether wouldn't work for me. :) I'm thinking I need to break the whole ritual of mindless surfing by getting an ebook reader so that I can:

1) Use instapaper and read all articles on my kindle.
2) Use the kindle to browse the web (when possible), no matter if it's a bit clunky and limited (in fact, that might be an good thing in my case). 
3) Get back into to reading more fiction (by staying away from my computer in the evenings)

So, can anyone relate to this and has getting an ebook reader helped you with such problems in any way?

Thanks. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful replies. What I'm getting from them is that an ebook reader can indeed help in certain cases, but you have to have the willpower in the first place.

Amazon also conveniently 'pre-registers' new Kindles purchased from Amazon.com, so not only is my brand new device just asking to be stolen, but the potential thief can then download whatever they want onto that Kindle, automatically charging my credit card.

Theoretically, said thief could order [a $6000 book of some sort](http://www.amazon.com/Nuclear-Energy-ebook/dp/B001C2TPWO), and next thing you know I'm broke.

Now I understand that this probably won't happen in most cases, and Amazon/Ontrac/your bank will probably make it right... but why risk it?  Is Ontrac at fault for being careless, or is Amazon being careless by pre-registering the device and branding the packaging?

As the only one in my family with this sad affliction, road trips were filled with envy and longing as everyone around me enjoyed a book.  I tried audiobooks, but it just isn't the same, you know?

Well this Christmas I received my Kindle 3.  I thought I already was in love with it, reading it for many hours a day while I was home visiting my family.  Then, earlier today, I had a 9 hour drive on the way to a wedding.  I decided that there was a slim chance that enlarging the font may make things readable for me.  I don't know the reasoning behind this really; I guess I figured less eye strain could only help.

So I switched it to the third largest font and put it in landscape mode and gave it a shot.  It felt kind of weird to see so few lines of text at once, but that quickly passed.  It had always taken a few minutes before I started to suffer, so I read on, and lo and behold, half an hour later I realized that I felt perfect.

**Clippings file**: every time you highlight something, or type out a note, it is copied into a file called MyClippings.txt in the Documents folder. If you plug your Kindle into your PC, you can cut and paste the contents of this file into your school notes, personal notes, favourite quotes/passages list, or just reread stuff to trigger your memory. 

**Cloud/mail service**: If you go to Manage My Kindle on the Amazon website, you'll see an email address they provide for you, something like *amazon_48282@kindle.com*. 

Any file -- HTML, ePub, MOBI, whatever -- you send to this address will be converted to a Kindle-suitable AZW3 and delivered to your device, as if you had purchased it. The default email address involves a charge for 3G delivery. If you add *free* to the email address -- as in *amazon_48282@free.kindle.com* -- you won't be charged for anything, but will only be able to download it over Wi-Fi.

Every document you send this way will also be saved within your Amazon account, until you hit the 5 GB limit (which is a fuckload of books). You can download them from Amazon.com using your browser, or use your Kindle (or Kindle app on another device) to re-download them again at any time by switching to the Cloud menu.

If you use Calibre, you can set this email address as the default sharing option, letting you send books to your kindle by pressing a Cailbre button, not needing to plug it in. 

You can also grab the [Klip.me](http://www.klip.me/sendtokindle/) send to kindle browser extension, which identifies the main body text on a webpage, strips it of formatting, and sends it to your Kindle email address.

I don't have hardly any books on my kindle fire and I'm looking to add a bunch for a low price.  Preferably under $1 or so, but if it is something really worth reading I can pay a little more.  (I'm just really broke right now).  Fight Club and The Hobbit are pretty much the only books I have on my Fire at the moment but here are some other books, series, and authors I have enjoyed reading-

- Robert Jordan's *Wheel of Time* series

- Stephen King, though I mainly read a lot of his stories (like Salem's Lot, Desperation, The Green Mile, and his short story collections) back in high school.  I haven't read any series' he's put out or really any stuff from the last 5 years for sure.

- Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit*.  I also started the *Silmarillion* a couple times but don't own it anymore so I've never finished it.

- Briane Keene's *The Rising*

- *Fight Club*, I was wondering if Palaniuk had any other 'must read' books.

- George RR Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* and *Dunk and Egg* tales.

- R Scott Bakker's *The Prince of Nothing* and *Aspect Emperor* trilogies.

- I've also enjoyed reading a lot of short stories and older books in college classes, like *Ender's Game*, *A Clockwork Orange*, and *The Canticle of Leibowitz*.

I'm looking mainly for 'dark', epic fantasy or sci fi stories (similar to Martin's and Bakker's series'), but any suggestions are appreciated!  Thanks!

Oh and I can't believe I forgot to mention Michael Crichton.  He was one of my favorite authors; I loved Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Prey, The Andromeda Strain, and a lot of his other work too.

New Kindle owner here (Xmas present).  I've mostly been reading free content, but there are two books I've actually purchased from Amazon.  Both have left me severely disappointed with publishers.

The Myth of the Rational Voter, by Bryan Caplan: chapter 3 consists  of charts and their analysis. In the print edition, the text and charts are both visible at once.  In the Kindle edition, it's something like:

    +-----------------+   +------------------+   +--------------+
    | blah blah...    |   | blah blah blah   |   | Fig.1 ****** |
    | In Fig.1 we see |   | more about Fig.2 |   | ************ |
    | blah blah.      |   | blah blah blah   |   | ************ |
    |                 |   |                  |   |              |
    | Fig.2 shows     |   | Now see Fig.3    |   | Fig.2 ****** |
    | blah blah blah  |   |                  |   | ************ |
    +-----------------+   +------------------+   +--------------+

...in which you see a reference to figure N, which is 2-3 page clicks ahead of your current position.  Lots of back-and-forthing ensues. The obvious fix is to reflow the content such that you see Fig.1, then its text, and so on.

The Crossing, by Cormac McCarthy: yeesh. printing errors galore. It's like someone OCR'ed it and didn't bother to proofread:

    1049   Yd tie him up (should be ""I'd"")
    1065   John? Stetson hat (should be ""John B"")
    1358   Mejor no hay.  Es feroz?

(That last one shows a missing line break, which treats that as one line of dialog from the same character.  The second sentence is in fact a response. That one was so jarring that I immediately realized something was wrong, and it only took a few seconds to figure out what.  But is that acceptable in a professionally published book?)

I wrote to Amazon suggesting a Kindle-edition-only rating system (""thank you for your feedback.""). I see it as in their best interests to follow up with something like that, because potential lost sales should be offset by improved customer satisfaction.  I also see that as a way for them to pressure publishers to get their act together. And if this happens to me again, I'm asking for a refund.

What other options are there?  Suggestions? Ideas? How do we protect ourselves from this, and at the same time (wishful thinking) nudging publishers toward cluefulness?
 
TL;DR: some Kindle editions are sloppily thrown together and not worth getting. How to know before spending money?

I was going to buy the original kindle for $89 without ads, but after reading about the paperwhite I really thought it was worth $20 more to get that with ads than saving $20 and getting the original without ads.

What sold me on buying the paperwhite now versus waiting another month is that I learned you could purchase the ad-free upgrade at any time.  

So I figured I would just ignore the ads for a few weeks til I could justify spending money on the ad-free upgrade. 

I'm someone who uses adblock plus for web browsing and won't watch regular TV (or even hulu) because I hate commercials.  So I was expecting the worst...

Fortunately I rarely even really notice the ads; they don't get in the way of using the device.  I am pleasantly surprised.  And although I don't plan on ever buying anything directly from the device, some of the ads I have looked at even seem relevant.

So I'd recommend that if you want to save a bit of money try ordering the one with ads first, and see if they really annoy you enough to justify spending the extra money on the ad-free version.  For me now it's hard to justify paying $20 for the convenience of no ads when I just could get two new books to read.

$20 is $20; it's not a lot of money I admit, but I have other things I'd rather spend that money on at the moment, and the savings prompted me into buying a paperwhite instead of the regular one, and for that I'm happy because I really love the paperwhite.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_1anbzh,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1anbzh/i_cringed_about_the_thought_of_buying_my_kindle/,

You write a few phrases, pick some small projects, get a few cents for a few seconds worth of work.

What if amazon put this to use with kindle books? Sign up to be a proofreader through mechanical turk, for every error you find, you get credit toward the kindle bookstore.

The best part here is, you could use the highlighting feature to flag mistakes, but instead of a highlight.. users who sign up to be proofreaders get an option to submit a correction.

People who buy kindle editions early could be motivated to submit corrections, because then they can use the credit towards the next purchase.

Hey /r/kindle,

Due to a CC# change, my Kindle magazine subscriptions (2600 and 'Fantasy and Science Fiction')  that I had been enjoying for a few years expired.  I went online to renew them this afternoon and noticed that I only had the ability to access to the current issue. 

I opened up a chat with their support team and was told:

""...with regards to past issues with your subscription. You no longer have or access on the past issues due to the cancellation of the subscription when the card used lapsed, BostonEnginerd. However what we may do is to refund you for the past issues. ""

I received a refund in Amazon credits -- which are only usable on things that Amazon sells directly, but I don't think it was in the amount of the total money I've spent on the subscriptions.

But it is even more awesome than you may know! Sadly, amazon is terrible at advertising it. 

If you want your case to function like an iPad Smart Cover (that is, whenever you open the case, it automatically turns on, unlocks and opens directly to your book), you need to opt out of ads. Otherwise, it will turn it on but you will still have to unlock it. 

 Its totally worth it for a really seamless reading experience that makes it feel more like a real book.

In my teen years I went through a neo-luddite phase when I wanted to smash all medical equipment because I was sure that a person could do it better. Then I did a 180 and wanted every electronic thing I could get, and to have them on me at all times.

Now I'm slowly starting to flip, again. I hate my cell phone, can't stand facebook, and wish I didn't spend so much fucking time on the computer. Whether I'll flip again is uncertain, but there is one thing I think I'll never grow weary of: the ebook reader.

Notice I didn't say kindle. I haven't tried other brands of ebook readers, but I am sure they are good too and in a pinch I could learn to love them. I try not to favor brands too much.

I've read my whole life. My earliest memories are of my parents recording my first words read aloud. I've gone through reading phases, too. I resisted the ereader for a long time, then finally broke down when I found out I could potentially download all of Project Gutenberg for free and read it wherever I want. That was almost a year ago and since then I've read nearly every single day.

I don't always use the ereader. Sometimes I can't find the book, or I don't want to risk damaging or losing it. But it feels like since I've owned it a new love has grown in me for knowledge. Everything just feels like it's in reach and waiting to be read. All I have to do is search for a few minutes and a book that I could never find would suddenly appear. Would I have read so much of [Halldor Laxness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halldor_laxness) if it wasn't for the best of his books being sold for the ereader? Probably not.

I've also had the urge to share rare books with other people. Even if a book is out of print and rapidly falling into obscurity, it's possible to scan and digitize it and introduce a whole new generation to the book without ever having to make another physical copy.

The ereader to me seems like the most efficient way to shovel information into my brain with the minimal amount of pain. I love physical books. I love the smell and the feel, and the sheer joy of seeing rows upon rows of unique books, but I just love information more. My dream is to digitize every book ever written, regardless of quality. Just think of what could happen if every citizen had access to such a bevy of knowledge. Can the ereader alone do all of this? No, but just like all new technological advancement it is slowly opening new doors. Some will ignore it, some will benefit, but the net outcome will be positive.

I'd gladly throw all of my electronics into a pyre if I could just keep my ereader loaded up with all of the books I'll ever need.

Amazon claimed new releases would always be $9.99, and older books would fall somewhere below that. I thought that was a great pricing scheme. Eventually I stopped using the Kindle in favor of borrowed library books and used hardcovers. The reason for this was the the price increases once publishers had no limits. I really have been missing ebooks for all the normal reasons, but the whole thing really bothers me.

I *want* to support the authors I read, and the publishing industry as a whole. But I am just not going to spend 13 dollars for an electronic version of Catch-22 when I can get a perfectly good hardcover used for a little cheaper shipped. Even a brand new softcover is cheaper. The silly thing is I want to buy the Kindle version of that book even though I already own a used paperback version, just for the convenience. 

Once this started I sent an email sharing my concerns with Amazon and got a canned response. Does anyone buy ebooks that are insanely priced? I'm guessing people do, and see the rising cost as a ""convenience fee"". Or does it lead you back to the dead tree version, pirating, or just skipping the book altogether?

1363182043.0,23,self.kindle,1a7px4,Guide: How to make a folder which sends documents automatically to your kindle. Windows/Mac/Linux.,31,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1a7px4/guide_how_to_make_a_folder_which_sends_documents/,"Firstly, I'd like to point out what u/Dekoded reminded me: that Amazon actually has a program to download called 'Send to Kindle' which can send files to your kindle from your windows computer via an installed program which adds 'send to kindle' to the right click context menu. Personally I remember rejecting this program because my right-click context menu already has a *lot* of options on it, and if I can avoid having extra programs running constantly, taking up my resources, I do so. This official method is much easier to set up, however, so I understand if people feel that way is best for them. It's available [here.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle)

If you're using mac, linux, or don't want to install Amazon's program to do this, then read on!

**Accounts Needed**

To create this automatic kindle-sending folder, you will need to sign up for the following accounts. All are incredibly useful in other ways, so even if I wasn't making this guide I wouldn't feel bad about recommending you sign up for them.

www.dropbox.com : You should really be using this or something like it. It's creates a secure folder which syncs across all your computers automatically. It's a fantastic backup utility. IFTTT will only read your public folders, so this is no security risk.

www.ifttt.com : a crowd-sourced scripting service which connects to hundreds of other internet services. Basically it can connect to your dropbox's public folder, become triggered upon finding a new file, and email it to your kindle address.

www.gmail.com : My apologies - I thought any email address would do when I first thought about showing people my method, but it turns out IFTTT can only speak to gmail. Just make any old account, you won't ever need to sign into it or even think about it ever again after this.

**Instructions**

1) Go to Amazon.com, and in Manage Your Kindle &gt; Personal Document Settings ensure that the relevent gmail account is added to your ""Approved Personal Document E-Mail List"". For UK readers that setting is [here.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/digital/fiona/manage?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=gno_yam_myk&amp;#pdocSettings)


2)Sign up for IFTTT. Then go to [channels](https://ifttt.com/channels) and activate dropbox and gmail. If you're logged into both of those services already, it should only be one click each.

3) Click [here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/83822), scroll down. Under **action**, type your **KINDLE EMAIL ADDRESS** under *to address*. This is the email address amazon give you to send documents to your kindle directly from email, and is available form the same page you added your gmail account to just now. It should look something like ""***********_30@kindle.com""


Scroll down a bit more and click 'use recipe' at the bottom.

4) Click [here](https://ifttt.com/recipes/83823). Do the exact same thing - add your **KINDLE* email address to *to address*, scroll down, and click use recipe. You're now done.

**Use**

You have a dropbox folder now, wherever you decided to place it when installing, and inside is a public folder. Inside this public folder are now two other folders, ""sendtokindle"" and ""sendtokindleconverted"". Files placed in these folders will quickly end up on your kindle. If you ever find it going too slowly, you can login to IFTTT and under 'my recipes' you can click the relevant recipe and click 'check now', but in my experience it is quick enough not to need this.

Yes, the method is fairly complicated, but it works. Anyone with a better method please feel free to add it below.

[r/ebooks post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/rg61m/hey_rebooks_im_looking_to_start_a_business_around/)

And here are the main topics discussed in the comments:

* There seems to be a lot of hate toward DRM and any sort of rights management
* International availability seems to be another hot topic
* Indie authors being available on *only* Kindle is an annoyance for non-Kindlers
* Many people wish e-books were cheaper, many reasoning that digital distribution costs close to nothing after initial production costs
* Time-based valuation of books was a great idea brought up by several people, higher prices with the release of hardcover, and much lower prices by the time mass market paperback comes out
* E-books costing more than paperbacks gets a lot of hate, as does the high prices of older e-books
* Internationalization of books is a market that is yet to be tapped (I think)
* Well formatted e-books are better for consumption, and is sought after

There was also a fantastic (albeit lengthy) comment on the dangers of lowering the price of e-books, in the sense that they will harm the publishing industry as a whole. Here it is, in all its glory:

&gt; E-book pricing is a really complicated issue right now. Amazon pricing e-books at $9.99 out of the gate put us in danger of lowering the public's expectations for what a book is worth, and most people don't realize that places like Amazon, Wal-Mart and Costco actually sell books at a profit loss because they make up such a small part of their business. Consumers see $9.99 for an e-book, and then think $30 for a hardcover book is outrageous. But (at least in Canada), book retailers strong-arm publishers for deep discounts (usually 50-60% off the cover price) and even then do not pay for stock until a customer has made a purchase. So consider that a hardcover book straight from a publisher costs a retailer $15, and they profit the rest of the cover price - not the publishers.

&gt; On the publisher's side of things, all the jobs and expenses going in to making a print book have a digital equivalent. Just because they aren't producing a physical product doesn't mean it costs drastically less to produce. I'm not sure what kind of impact e-retail has on e-book pricing, but honestly, $15-$17 for an e-book is an incredibly fair deal. Especially if e-booksellers begin windowing, which is the process of dropping the price over time, or with different formats (ie, a hardcover comes out for $30, after some months of sales they release a trade paperback for $20, if it does well then a mass market edition for $10). This could be done with e-books: offering an enhanced version for slightly more money, a regular version for an average price, and then dropping the price after a number of months.

&gt; My concern is that people shouting about high e-book prices could damage the publishing industry. I think it is important to communicate to consumers what an appropriate price for a product is, and I'm afraid things like Amazon's $9.99 books will adjust the public's perception of what both print and e-books are worth. There is more going on here than just price wars, and I think it is important to protect/support the publishing industry. If they need $15 for an e-book to pay wages for the staff who created it and royalties to the author who wrote it, it's still a lot more affordable than buying that same book new in hardcover.

&gt; Readers have plenty of options to save money on book buying (buy used, wait for clearance sales, wait for windowing copies, borrowing from friends and libraries), so I can't sympathize with people who say e-book prices are too high. They just aren't.

Thank you everyone for helping me out with the research for my business idea. I think my original mission of ""showing publishers that it is economically beneficial to set lower prices for e-books"" will have to go back to the drawing board. The discussions over the past 24 hours have contributed a few alternative ideas, and I'd love to explore those as well.

===========
**UPDATE:**
I was not expecting this much interest, but to capitalize that let us get this thing off the ground!
The first order of business would be to select a book for us to start on.
First here are a few sources to find free (legal) books to browse/select from/download

* [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/texts)

+ [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/)

*  [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page)

*  [Many Books](http://manybooks.net/)

*  And of course--[Amazon's selection of free books](http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1292447706/ref=sr_st?page=1&amp;rh=n%3A133140011%2Cn%3A!133141011%2Cn%3A154606011&amp;bbn=133141011&amp;sort=price)

**If you find a book that interests you please post it here!**

Next order of business would be the formatting for the discussion threads--I like [/bookclub's](http://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/) way of splitting it up for chapters, but as Kindle users we could break it up more evenly by using locations--three or four a month should be adequate for us to get through most books.

The next issue I see is using this reddit or the subreddit RarneyBubble created http://www.reddit.com/r/kindlebookclub/.  I would prefer if we were to use the /kindle reddit because it could attract more attention and a few threads a month would not create too much clutter, but I message wcalvert (the mod for this reddit) for his input on that as well as yours.



*Now for my nomination*
[Theodore Roosevelt and His Times](http://www.amazon.com/Theodore-Roosevelt-His-Times-ebook/dp/B002RKRU4U/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1292448662&amp;sr=1-8)
I know nothing about this book, but I know a decent bit about the man.  He was the youngest President to serve (JFK was the youngest elected). Performed admirably in the war in Cuba.  Survived an assassination attempt.  Was pivotal in the creation 150 national forests and 5 national parks.  He was also a writer, hunter and is widely considered to be one of the nations best Presidents (see Mt. Rushmore).  The cat had the life I could not even dream of living.


**Oh and as a side** I feel it would be awesome to have a side section for short pieces.  Some of my favorite pieces of media have been short stories such as Harrison Burgeron, The Tell Tale Heart, Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Runaround or Guts.  I will work on putting a collection of these together if anyone is interested in this as well.



Please continue to provide any and all suggestions.  I think this could be a great group--especially with the internet savvy I can safely assume most of us have.

AMA",29,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/rn71n/followup_results_from_the_study_you_participated/,"About a month ago, [I posted here looking for people to participate in an online research study which was part of my PhD dissertation](http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/qem8d/study_of_kindle_users_15_minutes_or_less_and_you/).  I promised that when the study was complete, I would post a description of the research and answer any questions anyone had.  Here I am.

First, thank you to everyone who enthusiastically participated.  I exceeded the number or participants I planned to recruit and did so faster than I expected.  I can also say that those who participated in this study were among the most thoughtful and conscientious participants I have worked with.

**Who participated?**
I posted my announcement for participants on four website for approximately the same 2 day period at the beginning of March.  243 people participated and they found the study through these sites (with # of participants):

* 153 from reddit.com/r/kindle
* 53 from mobileread.com
* 34 from kindleboards.com
* 1 from kfireforum.com

* Geography: 39 US states represented plus 61 participants from outside the US
* Gender: 184 Male, 59 Female
* Age:  Mean = 33.76, reported ages ranged from 18-92

**What was the research about?**
My dissertation is about the process of negotiation and how the arguments a negotiator makes may unexpectedly influence his or her attitudes and beliefs.  This builds on work in social psychology on self-inference (or self-perception, or cognitive dissonance) which describes how we tend to observe our own behavior and reason, “well if I just did X, then I must be a person who believes in X / feels positively towards X /etc.”  This can result in interesting shifts in a person's attitudes or beliefs if their behavior was influenced by something outside their control.  In a classic study, the experimenter randomly assigned people to give a short speech either in support of or against a certain political position.  Their beliefs afterwards had shifted towards the argument they were assigned to make.   Negotiation is an interesting context because good strategies often require us to make strong arguments in support of things we may not have felt strongly about before.  In order to bargain down the price of a house for example, it would make sense to argue that the neighborhood is going down hill and that you should get a discount accordingly.  My research asks the question:  Do you now feel more negatively about the neighborhood than you would have if you hadn't made that argument?

Feel free to ask me questions here, but if you want the unabridged story, you can [download my dissertation proposal here](http://swift.cbdr.cmu.edu/files/SwiftDissertationProposal.pdf).

**How was this study designed to test those ideas?**
In this study, there were two conditions.  Everyone saw the same information about the e-book Mile 81.  Everyone was told that they would like to request a lower price from the seller.  Everyone then sent a simple request to the seller, “""Dear BookSeller234, I am interested in the book you have for sale, but I would prefer to pay less … ""  What was different was that half of the participants had the opportunity to support this request with a persuasive argument and were told to “Emphasize why you think the book is not valuable enough to justify the asking price.”

I compared these two groups (I'll call them Argument and No-Argument) on a few different measures.  First, everyone answered questions about the quality of the book and other impressions they had during the survey.  Second (and this was the main purpose of the study), was how many people from each group bothered to save the link and return to claim their book three days later.

I chose to use e-books for this study because they were engaging enough to be interesting yet cheap enough for me to give away (and because I'm a kindle owner), and then observe people's choice to download the book.  The choice of Mile 81 was arbitrary except that it had a good mix of positive and negative reviews.  I am not in the Stephen King marketing department as many people suspected.

**What was the hypothesis?**
My hypothesis in this line of research is that the act of making value-oriented arguments (i.e. “why the book is not valuable enough to justify the asking price”) results in less positive feelings about the value of the product.  This study was designed to test for that difference in people's ratings of the book as well as in their behavior: whether they returned to claim their copy of Mile 81.  I hypothesized that those in the Argument condition would rate the book more negatively and be less likely to claim their copy.

**What were the results?**

*First, a sample of overall results:*

* How do you think Mile 81 will compare to Stephen King's other books?  mean = 3.7 (out of 7), just below “Average”
* How boring or entertaining do you think Mile 81 will be?  mean = 4.89 (out of 7), just below “Somewhat entertaining”
* How excited will you be if the seller accepts your request and you get to download Mile 81?  mean = 2.42 (out of 5), between “Somewhat Excited” and “Exited”

* How many people bothered to claim their copy of Mile 81 after the 3 day wait?
* 92 out of 243 (38%) requested their copy of the book
* 74 of the 92 (80% of requesters, 30% of initial sample) downloaded the book from amazon
* 13 of the 74 had at least started to read the book when I followed up 2 weeks later

*What differences were there between the conditions?*

* Did those in the Argument condition rate the book more negatively than those in the No-Argument condition?  There was no difference!  There were not generally any statistically significant differences between the ratings by the two groups.
* Were those in the Argument condition less likely to request their copy of the book?  Nope, they were more likely to request their copy!  People in the argument condition were more likely to request their copy of the book (45%) than those who were in the no argument condition (30%).  This difference is statistically significant.

*So what happened?*
This is the fun of science.  You design a test of your hypothesis and see what the data have to say about it.  I have two theories that could explain why the results did not support my hypothesis.  

* A “selection effect”.  More people dropped out of the Argument condition mid-study, presumably because they saw that they had to write an argument and decided it was too much work.  This could mean that the groups were no longer the same on average.  If No-Argument condition has an average mix of people, but the Argument condition was left with only hard-workers, that could explain why the Argument folks were more diligent about showing up to collect their book.
* A difference in engagement with the study.  Because the Argument folks spent more time in the study and wrote a paragraph about the book, they may have been more engaged, and more curious to find out about the book.  This could be balance out or negate the process in my theory.

It's ok though, I have more detailed analyses to run (using the actual text in the arguments), and other studies with more supportive evidence.  This data has added to my overall understanding of my theory.

**And finally, most importantly, Who won the Kindle?!**
I randomly selected one participant from among those who completed the study and contacted the winner on 3/31.  I will post their username if they consent.  I can say that the winner came to the study from reddit.  If they don't reply to claim their prize in 7 days, I will select a new winner.

**Edit** 
The winner was reddit user CM_Crusader who chose the Kindle Touch.  Congrats!

Here's a little script I wrote. It's not perfect, but seems to be working properly. It searches for submissions above determined number of upvotes and adds it to your Instapaper ""Read Later"" list (which can be later downloaded as a mobi file or send directly to Kindle).

All you have to do is download, unzip, change your Instapaper username and password, subreddit and upvote limit. Then just run it with   
&gt;     $python reddit2instapaper.py

It should download submissions from last three days and add those with your upvotes limit to Instapaper. Every next time you run it it will download stories that were added since last time you ran the script.

For every question, suggetion or proposal don't hesitate and write to me : ) I'll answer every message or email.

PS. Script is totally free, but I you feel like being open-handed, here's my [shameless pay-pal link](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=RGN4AE3ZG3NQQ). : )

My question is, how does this work? Is there an app we have to download? Or do we have to be physically in the library? Or do we have to download to the computer, and then to the Kindle via USB?

Also, I heard that Amazon will give access to the books in their own format. Will my local library be supported if I ""borrow"" the book from them? Or is this like Google Books with one central location to download books?

**EDIT:**

Today our library had the ""Ebook Mobile"" come to the library, and all my questions have been answered.

**How it works now:**
* iPad/iPod/iPhone/etc. have an Overdrive app. You download books via the browser (not sure how yet) and it goes into the Overdrive app. 
* On ebook readers (Nook, Sony are the demo's I saw), you have to download via your PC and then sync. 
* The local library *is* supported with each ""check out"" of ebooks/audiobooks. The same way that they are supported when you check out a physical book.

**On the Kindle:** The Librarians/Overdrive rep did not know the answer to those questions, but suspect it will be the same.

My hope is that the Kindle will have an Overdrive app, and we can borrow books the same way that we can buy them from Amazon. But we will see. :)",,False,self,t5_2qudz,True,,,True,t3_j27r6,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/j27r6/about_that_library_lending_via_overdrive/,

[MrFairladyz](http://www.reddit.com/user/MrFairladyz) wrote this instruction on how to run this script on Windows:


&gt;1. Install Python, then (probably not necessary) [add the Python command to cmd](http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=960000&amp;fromSeriesID=96)
&gt;2. Unzip the attached, edited zip [file](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17033732/spark2kindleWindows.zip)
&gt;3. Download [kindlegen from here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621), extract and take the exe and place it into the folder with the python script.
&gt;3. In cmd, navigate (cd) to the root of the folder with the script, and run the script:
&gt;spark2kindle.py http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/anna/
&gt;4.  Profit! The mobi shows up in the directory of the book name! 


**Sparknotef2Kindle for Linux:**

1. [Download](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17033732/spark2kindle.tar), untar
2. [Download kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621), put exec in directory with script.

-



The touch screen is not as sensitive as the iPad's, and sometimes I have to ""click"" something twice before it opens. Frankly I have found this to be true on most of the droid phones and tablets that I have played around with. The screen itself looks great. It didn't blow me away like the first time I saw an iPad screen, but it is certainly better than some of the cheaper tablets.

-

The 8 hour estimated battery life seems pretty accurate, after about 6 hours of use I still had juice.

-

The jury is still out on the Silk browser. When I first started using it, I noticed (like every other droid device I have played with) that the pages with a lot of thumbnails don't scroll nearly as smooth as they do on the iPad. Supposedly the more people use Silk, the more intuitive and faster it will get. After about an hour of browsing Reddit, I actually felt that it was going faster than when I started.

-

Conclusion: The Fire is not an iPad, just as a Honda Accord is not a Lexus. If anyone wants the best tablet on the market, I don't think there is much debate that the iPad is a way to go. But it's difficult to argue with the value of the Fire, and based on the comparable tablets like the BlackBerry PlayBook ($349) I can't imagine that in the near future there will be anything under $300 that will compete with the Fire. 

For me, who already owns 3 computers, I just didn't feel it was worth it to spend $500 on something that is basically just for entertainment. But for a device that I can lounge on the sofa with, to watch videos or do some light web surfing, I think the Fire was a worth-while purchase.

It was bought as a Christmas present from Dick Smiths I think, and they sent out a replacement and it arrived today, only a few days after reporting it. The only bad thing is that seeing as it was bought from a shop I have to pay to ship the old one back to the returns place in the US. 

So the big tip is buy it online with Amazon, even if you wait a few days, they're bloody quick at sending them and you'll get free return postage if it breaks.

But if you were wondering the process (which kept me a few days from doing anything) just go into manage your kindle and go to the help page and put the problem and go to live chat. Took all of 20 minutes even witha  little hiccup (in me finding it) in trying to find a country specific version of my model. 

I'd heard a few rumblings that they didn't really give good customer service outside the US, but found out that's completely wrong. 

Another tip - if you have sites like Readability and klipme set up to send to your kindle, go to the same help spot and get them to change it (your new kindle will have a different email address than your original). They swapped mine in no time.

I've had Kindle For PC, and I have about 1500 items listed there.  
It stores the files in a directory named ""My Kindle Content"".

I have Calibre software (version 0.8.50) installed on my PC.  
I just have about 40 public domain titles in there.


1\. What's the easiest way to clean up title &amp; author info for several books that are listed in ""Kindle For PC""?  

2\. If I create collections in Kindle For PC, and drag-and-drop books into those collections,  
    will the collections get synced when I start to use my Kindle Touch?

3\. Can I move just specific books to the Kindle Touch, or will it automatically sync them all?  
    Does it transfer them from the PC (so it would get my edited titles)  
    or will I need to go to the Amazon web page and do ""Deliver to [my new Kindle device]?""

4\. Is there any easy way to determine which filenames in the ""My Kindle Content"" directory  
    correspond to which titles, or vice versa, other than opening up each file?  
    (I'm thinking of putting the very small files, which are more like articles,  
    or the very large ebooks, into their own categories)

5\. Do you have any advice about organizing ebooks into collections?  
     I have a spreadsheet that lists most of my Kindle orders  
     so I'm going to decide on the collection names before I begin.

6\. Do you have any tips for what I should do as a new device owner,

2) After couple of days on Touch, KB feels clunky and heavy :)
 
Touch cons:
1) Not very comfortable to hold and not enough space outside the screen, which results in accidental page turns.  This has been the biggest problem.  Hopefully, it is a matter of getting used to.
2) Have to turn off the device before closing the case, or else page flips happen and you will end up on same random page in the book. 
3) Contrast is slightly worse than KB.  Hard to notice unless you place it side by side.

This is very early version but I need feedback to know how to develop it into something that will meet eveybody's need.  
I'll be really grateful for every piece of feedback or opinion or request and I PROMISE to answer everyone and implement every good idea : )

**How to test:**

**A)** Unpack.

**B)** First of all you need a file(s) that's a list of url's to reddit posts ([example](https://raw.github.com/HGrzywacz/rsp2k/master/lib/links.txt)). You can either make it by hand or using get_top tool (name is misleading):

    $ python get_top.py kindle 10 new
    $ python get_top.py 60 day askreddit
    $ python get_top.py controversial 321 all worlds_news
will get you 10 newest r/kindle submissions, 60 top askreddit submissions of the day or 321 most controversial submissions of all time on r/worlds_news respectvely. Just type out anything you want to get, essentialy. Or don't type anything - that will get you 20 top voted submissions of all time of r/askscience.

If you want files to save in directory called 'lists' just create such directory.

**C)** Download kindlegen for you platform from [HERE](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621) into directory with the app.

**D)** Run rsp2k on prepared list, example:

    $ python rsp2k.py askscience_top_20.txt
That should get you a directory called *askscience_top_20* with a *book.mobi* file inside it - ready for putting on your kindle.


**Few important things:**

1. I'm not at all happy with formatting - that's why I need your comments and suggestions.

2. Tested on Python 3.2 - so probably won't work on Python 2.*.

3. If you know html, css, kindle formatting, python - any help will be extremaly appreciated. Just pm/mail me : )  
(even if you don't know any of this subjects but want to help and you speak good english you can help with writing Readme - i'm not a native english speaker : ) )

4. NOT tested on Windows - but theoretically should work. *crosses fingers*

5. If I'm not answering for few hours that's just timezone differences : )

6. Once again: any comment, feedback, opinion, suggestion will be really appreciated and I promise to answer and consider them all.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_kerbm,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/kerbm/reading_reddit_posts_with_comments_on_kindle/,

It really is a nice device and I'm sure I'll get tons of use out of it.  If you like physics based games (Fantastic Contraption, Spaghetti and Marshmallows, etc) then you MUST get **X Construction** for the Fire.  It is ridiculously good fun, and wait until you see (and hear) what happens when your bridge fails!  Also, favorites like Angry Birds are easily three times more fun on a screen which is three times the size of my phone's screen.

The device is hefty when compared to a Kindle, but it's 2/3 the weight of the lightest iPad.  The vast majority of the time I will use the Fire for playing games and browsing the web and watching streaming video, so for my usage an iPad has nothing more to offer than the Fire.  My initial impression on unboxing it was that it was a little smaller than I had imagined, but I found that it can be extremely immersive, and its perceived size is much greater when you're using it.  It is only slightly larger (width/height) than my K4, so it fits nicely into the interior pocket of my jacket.

I will say my #1 gripe with the device is the carousel.  Between my K4 and my wife's K3 Keyboard, we have lots of books in our Amazon history, and they are ALL right there in the carousel.  That book on how to perform amazing oral sex?  Yup.  The wife's romance novels?  Oh yes, with all their *colorful cover art* too.  Oh, and whatever page you were last browsing on the internet, that's up there too, whether it was /gw or the front page.  It will really make you think twice before letting anyone touch your Fire.

The device is VERY dependent on having a WiFi connection.  If you don't have a wireless network in your home, the Fire probably isn't for you.  I'll be using WiFi tethering on my smartphone a lot more often now.

Reading on the device is as expected.  It is not an e-ink Kindle, so I shudder to think about reading novels on it, but it is definitely a nicer experience than trying to read on a cell phone or computer screen.

From a technical perspective, it is definitely an experience that will quickly improve over time.  I am sure they will work the kinks out with updates as people report bugs, but I saw some force-closes on apps and a few sluggish spots, but nothing that really inhibited by enjoyment.  Overall, the device is slick and responsive.  The Silk browser works well, and if it really does speed up over time as people utilize it more, it could be great.

This device REALLY needs a reddit app!  I use 'reddit is fun' on my phone, and I am hoping they will update it for the Fire.

Well, those are my first impressions, feel free to ask if you have any questions about the Fire.",,False,self,t5_2qudz,False,,,True,t3_mekq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/mekq9/playing_with_fire_sharing_your_smutty_books_with/,

1) For the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite or any other Kindle that uses a touch screen, are fingerprints an issue? It would be a pain trying to read something that has fingerprints all over.

2) Can you not read the Kindle/Kindle 3 when it is dark? Does it read like paper? And for Kindle Paperwhite, is reading easy on the eyes?

3) If I decide to get the Kindle Paperwhite, is there still the option of turning off all the backlight so that I can use it like a Kindle?

4) Kindle Paperwhite vs. Kindle vs. Kindle 3? Pros and cons

5) Even though I live abroad, can I still access the main Amazon store? Or can I not get the same deals as in America? 

6) Could I, technically, use hotspot on my phone and use the wifi from there on my Kindle if I get a Kindle without 3g?

7) If I plan to not use apps or games or anything, I shouldn't consider Kindle Fire, right?

8) Is not having a button on Kindle Paperwhite an issue? Or is it doable?

If you could answer one or more of these questions, it would be greatly appreciated!

These are not books that are esoteric or relatively unknown either.  A couple of examples where I found these sorts of complaints are Robert Heinlein's ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" and Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"".  My question is this:  Is this a fairly common occurrence?  Are these reviewers mistaken?

This is a ""horror game"" in book form, with an effort to make it as simple as possible. It is nothing more than a description of a task accompanied by various thoughts to consider while you perform it.


The ""game"" is to see if the thought-prompts can make the task uncomfortable, disturbing, or even terrifying for you, then see if you can make it all the way through the task as it is described. 


The episode is called ""Brushing Teeth in front of the Mirror.""

Here is an excerpt:


&gt;Start at the side of the mirror. Make sure you cannot yet see your reflection.



&gt;Begin the stopwatch or timer to see how long you are able to play this episode of Mind Seed.



&gt;Get ready to walk in front of the mirror, but do not move yet. Look at the space where your reflection will appear. Be certain that your reflection is not there. Tell yourself that the reflection will not appear until you walk in front of the mirror. Tell yourself everything will be okay.



&gt;Look away from the mirror and get your toothbrush and toothpaste. Hold your toothbrush in one hand and the toothpaste in the other. Do not look at the mirror. Instead, look down at your hands.



&gt;Carefully inspect how you are holding the toothbrush and toothpaste. Ask yourself if this is how you normally hold them. Let them feel strange in your hands.



&gt;Be certain that the toothbrush is your toothbrush, and that the toothpaste is also yours. Make sure there is nothing odd about the toothbrush or toothpaste.



&gt;Breathe. Feel the awareness of your cells as they stretch their senses around you, searching for danger. Ask yourself if you feel you are being watched. Do not look up to the mirror. Do not look behind you. Look only at your hands. Count to three.



&gt;Check the mirror and be sure your reflection is still not there. If your reflection has suddenly appeared in the mirror without your moving over, stop playing Mind Seed now and get out of your house. Otherwise continue.

I bought the Kindle from a local retailer sometime in the summer of last year, and I knew they wouldn't take it back. I thought I was stuck with a dud, when last week, a redditor told me to call amazon, despite the fact that I didn't buy it from them.   
  
I didn't think they'd be able to do anything, but I've read so many great stories on here about amazon's customer support, it was was worth a go. I called them, talk for about 10 minutes, (turns out it was still under warranty) AND THEY REPLACED IT FOR FREE.  I printed off a sticker, stuck it on my broken kindle's box and set it off on Monday. Today, my new kindle came in the mail (astounding, considering I called only Friday) and I am falling in love again.  :)  

  Now for my question: On my old kindle I had a hack where when I clicked alt-Aa, it would give me a bunch of spacing and font options. I would have thought it was the font hack, but that just changes the default fonts, and doesn't have as many options. It would be great if any of you knew what this was called. Cheers!

1321727807.0,19,self.kindle,mi84b,My Fire experience so far (long),30,11,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/mi84b/my_fire_experience_so_far_long/,"I received my Fire on the 16th and have been using it pretty much non-stop (except for work and sleep) since then.  I purchased the Fire because of the price and I wanted something small to surf the web on while watching TV or otherwise indesposed.  I'm already a Kindle owner as well as an Amazon prime and Netflix subscriber so I thought that I might get some use from those services as well.  My wife owns an iPad and I consider myself reasonably tech-savvy.

So far I can say that I've really enjoyed it and it's served its purpose well.  I have spent most of my time surfing the web, listening to Pandora or Rhapsody and a little bit of time reading.  All of those experiences have been good.  Some observations:

**Silk Browser:**

* I like the tabs on the browser and how easy it is to open new pages in new tabs (especially compared to an iPad)

* I don't like the fact that you can't seem to control the next tab viewed after you close one.  If you close the far-right tab, it takes you back to the far-left one; not to the very next tab on the left.

* Saving bookmarks is easy.
* There doesn't seem to be a way to organize bookmarks except by giving them custom names as they are sorted alphabetically.

* In general, the double-tap to re-format the page for better reading works (but not always - I chalk that up to the page itself, though).

**Launchers (Default and 3rd Party):**

* I quickly replaced the default launcher with Go Launcher Ex.

* I wasn't a fan of the carousel (one reason is because it shows EVERYTHING which is just makes a weird mix of stuff)

* Built in launcher wasn't very customizable

* Go Launcher Ex is way better but it takes some work to customize and there are some Font issues (you can't control the size of the Font in the App Drawer which makes it wrap in the middle of words).

* While you can make shortcuts in Go Launcher to Videos, Music, the Browser and App Store, you can't make a shortcut to your books!  So, I still have the default launcher (carousel) as a shortcut in Go Launcher Ex.

* You can't (at least I haven't figured out how) set Internet Bookmarks as launch icons in Go Launcher.  That's the worst thing so far.  I'm guessing that Go Launcher just doesn't know how to access bookmarks in Silk so nothing happens when you try to create a shortcut.

* At some point, I hope people make launchers specifically for the Fire or, at least, with the Fire in mind.

**Browsing Reddit:**

* I tried BaconReader (have to download this directly from the site and enable non-Amazon apps).  In general, I really like BaconReader but you can't change the text size (it's too small for older eyes) and links don't always work inside post so for now I'm going to not use it and hope that it gets better.

* the .compact version of Reddit seems to work very well in Silk and that's what I'm using now.  

**Battery life/General Usability:**

* Since I've been using the device for long periods of time (and, to be fare, much of this time has been in tweaking and exploring and not so much in consuming) the battery life kind of bugs me, especially compared to my Kindle.  However, I think that will change as I use it fewer hours (i.e. for reading/media as opposed to just experimenting).

* It's a nice size but you do have to re-size web pages a bit in order to get the text a readable size (at least for me!)

* I can hold it with one hand while reading and use my thumb to advance pages so that's nice.

* Not all apps/things rotate when you turn the device around (e.g. Angry Birds).  That is really only a problem when trying to orient the power/headphone jack to a more comfortable side.

* I really enjoy surfing the web or reading while Pandora or Rhapsody is playing in the background.

* I have not missed having a ""Home"" button or that I have to click that ""Settings"" icon to get to volume or brightness or whatever (at least not yet).  They are not that hard to get to.   I can see the need to a Wi-Fi on/off shortcut as I'm guessing that will save battery life if you are not streaming anything.

* While it's portable, it's not super portable in that you have to really be somewhere where you can connect to Wi-Fi to get the best experience out of it.  I took it to Jury Duty yesterday and fortunately they had free Wi-Fi so it worked out really well.

**Wishlist (not just Fire wishes but app wishes as well):**

* A way to customize the tabs in Silk more.

* A way to add internet bookmarks into a home page in Go Launcher Ex

* Improved Reddit apps (more of them)

* HBO Go for the fire (I subscribe to that already)



Overall, so far, I am very happy.  It serves my needs and fulfills the reasons I purchased it for.  I think as long as you understand what it does and that fits what you want, you wont' be disappointed.

I know it's the publishers' doing, rather than Amazon's, and there must be something I'm missing.  Either publishers haven't cared what people to do with their physical books or up until this point they simply had no means of control.  I'm beginning to think the latter, as industry greed becomes more apparent.  

When I buy a book, physically or digitally, it should be mine.  If I have the ability to share a physical book with friends, I should be able to do the same thing with an e-book...not ONCE for 14 days with select books.  Publishers cannot be concerned with losing money were e-books truly shareable because the expectation of physical sharing is already there: if e-books didn't exist, the book would likely be shared at some point anyway.

In fact, there are many ways in which publishers SAVE money by going digital

* Moving away from physical objects – The number of times a physical book is shipped, handled, stored, warehoused, inventoried is ridiculously high.   
* Book Successes having to pay for Failures – The Internet allows for crowd intelligence, faster feedback, and a lot of other means to reduce the number and cost of failures.
* Book Returns – Every 4 copies of a book that are sold have to pay for the 1 copy that has to be returned (not to mention the returned book’s shipping, warehousing costs).
* Amount of Manual Labor – There are a TON of people involved in the book creation, distribution, and sales process.
* The fact that a book takes 16-18 months after being acquired to get to stores.
