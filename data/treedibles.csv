1364964071.0,92,self.treedibles,1bkhsv,My Cannabis Oil Process (Long and Extensive with Images),107,15,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1bkhsv/my_cannabis_oil_process_long_and_extensive_with/,"Let me start by giving some background information about myself:

I am a biochemistry student, and I love and respect cannabis greatly. For the longest time, my main method of enjoyment was through vaporizers. I would be able to enjoy the taste and potency more fully and efficiently. 

Unfortunately, 8 months ago I had a spontaneous lung collapse. I was hospitalized for around 3 weeks and had to have lung surgery to prevent future collapses. I have found now that if I try vaporizing, I will experience a lot of discomfort in that lung, and being high and feeling chest pain of any sort is never fun.

Instead of giving up, I turned to a new form of using cannabis that I had only briefly explored: edibles. Fast foward 7 months and many many failed/test batches. I feel like I can safely say that I can make high quality cannabis oil by focusing on enhancing efficiency. 

Even though only ~30% of the THC is processed by our bodies, it is broken down into several cannabinoid metabolites, the main one being [11-Hydroxy-THC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11-Hydroxy-THC) which has been shown to be **4-5 times stronger** than normal THC. This is why people regularly report experiencing ""trip-like"" effects/visuals from having larger edible doses.


So here are the **essential tools and the ones I use:**

* [Coconut Oil](http://www.amazon.com/Nutiva-Certified-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B000GAT6NG): Coconut oil is the best choice for our cannabis edibles for several reasons. The first is that it consists of 100% saturated fat, which is exactly what is needed for cannabinoid absorption. Coconut oil also consists of ~66%[Medium-Chain Triglycerides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride) which are the perfect size to be easily absorbed by our bodies without additional help from our bodies. For example, Long-Chain Triglycerides need to be broken down first, which takes energy.

I use the Nutiva brand mostly because it is by far the highest quality that I have been able to afford. I used to use a brand from wal-mart, and I have noticed a significant difference when I switched.

* [Crock Pot](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Crock-Pot-4-Quart-Slow-Cooker-Black/14922959) and Oven/Freezer Safe Tall Dish: This allows for consistent low heat, which is what we are looking for. Note: Do not put the oil directly into the crockpot unless you plan to make serious bulk. Often times using a smaller oven/freezer safe dish is much easier to handle and creates less waste. [Souffle dishes](http://www.amazon.com/BIA-Cordon-Blue-Souffl%C3%A9-Dish/dp/B0000DE20I) and [egg dishes](http://www.amazon.com/BIA-Cordon-Bleu-White-Porcelain/dp/B006H5V82Q/ref=sr_1_36?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365000668&amp;sr=1-36&amp;keywords=egg+dish) for larger/smaller amounts respectively are perfect.

* [Soy Lecithin](http://www.amazon.com/WillPowder-Soy-Lecithin-Powder-16-Ounce/dp/B00250UC92): Soy lecithin is an emulsifier that increases the bio-availability of the final oil, which essentially means that its easier for your body to absorb it in higher quantities. This is really optional, but there is definitely a noticeable difference in potency.

* [Coffee Grinder](http://www.amazon.com/Proctor-Silex-E160BY-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B00006IUX5/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364962223&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=coffee+grinder) and Small Brush: Our goal is to grind the cannabis as finely as possible such that it nearly becomes a kief-like powder so that most of it literally dissolves into our oil. You'll need a brush to minimize waste, and it's actually very fun to meticulously brush cannabis powder into your container.

* Aluminum Foil, Sheet Pan
* Of course, our lovely friend cannabis. I'm using a half oz of the finest cannabis that I could find for this.

**Procedure:**

**1. Decarboxylation**

First we must decarboxylate our cannabis. In raw cannabis, THCa is found in much larger quantities than our friend THC, and unfortunately it is much less psychoactive than THC. This is why eating raw cannabis does not produce much of an effect unless eaten in extremely large amounts. Our goal is to remove the Carboxyl group from THCa and convert it to THC by adding a certain amount of heat. The only other way to do this is through time itself, but it takes a tremendously long amount of time.

It is a misconception that decarboxylation is unnecessary due to the heat provided once the cannabis is actually in the oil. Unfortunately, the carboxyl-groups fall off at a much slower rate once the plant matter is heating in the oil, slowing the rate of decarboxylation dramatically. This is why we decarboxylate beforehand, ensuring that most of our THCa will be converted by the end of the process.

In order to do this, break your cannabis up into small popcorn-sized nugs and place them in your oven-safe dish. You'll be using this dish for the entire process so treat it well. Preheat the oven to ~225F. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place on a sheet-tray for easy entry and removal. 

Place it in the ~225F oven for 20-25 minutes, depending on how brittle the cannabis originally felt. Afterwards, allow the cannabis to naturally cool down for ~10 minutes. Then we get ready to grind.

**2. Grinding**
Example Picture: [Before and After Grinding](http://imgur.com/a/CCIv2#0)

Your goal is to grind the cannabis as finely as possible. We grind after decarboxylating to ensure an even finer consistency. **I strongly recommend taking your time with this step.** It really pays off to focus on minimizing waste. There will be kief on the cover of the coffee grinder, and there will be powder in the nooks and crannies, but take the time to use your brush to get as much as you possibly can into your dish. Even if you only increase the overall potency by 2% for your work, remember that 2% is multiplied by 4-5x due to the nature of 11-Hydroxy-THC.

In the example picture, the ground up cannabis may appear to have clumps. This is from the cannabis being so finely ground that it is sticking to itself and forming temporary clumps which dissolve on contact with the oil.

**3. Adding Lecithin and Oil**

After grinding, the next step is to add your lecithin and oil. The soy lecithin depends on the ratio of the oil. I use a 3/4 **tsp** lecithin to 1 **tb**sp oil.

As for the oil, I figure out what I'm going to be using the oil for ahead of time and work from there. For example, for a batch of muffins, it takes 1/3 cup oil. Out of my half ounce of cannabis, I can make 2 7g batches of muffins, so I will add 2/3 cup oil, and use 1/3 in each batch.

**4. Processing**

Place your dish inside of the crockpot on low for 3 hours. Keep in mind that crock pots take a good ~20-25 minutes to actually get truly hot, so it is wise to turn it on before this step to allow it to pre-heat. Make sure you keep the lid on the crockpot for as long as possible to keep even heat. This will keep your oil at around ~195-210F which is what we want.

After 3 hours, remove the dish and allow it to cool for ~20 minutes, and then place it inside of the freezer for a minimum of 2 hours. 

To understand why **freezing is important**, we need to visualize the plant cells within the cannabis. They are essentially globules of liquid containing cannabinoids that we want to extract. Freezing them **forces that liquid to take on a crystalline structure, piercing the plant cell walls and releasing the goodies**. This even further increases the bioavailability of our final oil.

After freezing, allow to reach room temp again for about ~15 minutes before placing back in the slow cooker. I suggest turning the slow cooker on after placing the dish back inside of it to let them slowly rise in temperature together. This lowers the risk of damaging the dish.

Heat inside the slow cooker for another 3 hours. I start the 3 hour countdown once the oil has liquidified again, as it will take about 30 minutes for it to no longer be solid.

Follow this by another 2 hour freeze. Afterwards, heat the oil again for another 3 hours and then you should have something resembling this:

[Final Oil](http://imgur.com/bZjbsxN)

It should be **black enough to reflect the rim of the dish**, like you see in the picture. It will be slightly thicker, and extremely potent. 

While straining out the plant matter, you should notice it is significantly less than what we started with. 

Be extremely careful with this oil as it is very potent. 

Smaller doses are also possible. I can use an eighth of cannabis and make a personal batch of potent edibles that will last me for 24 days.

Basically, when I make cannabutter or weed vegetable oil for cooking, I use a mason jar floating around in boiling water as opposed to a traditional double boiler.

**Items Needed**

* large pot to put water in
* water
* stove
* weed (quality/quantity up to you, I usually use ABV and make it up as I go, consider prebaking if using green bud)
* butter or oil, depending on what you're cooking
* glass mason jar
* coffee grinder (optional)
* shit to strain with (also optional)

**Method**

* fill your pot with water (I try to fill it up so much that my mason jar will be floating so it doesn't come into contact with the bottom of the pan)
* boil it
* put your weed in the coffee grinder, grind so it looks like a powder
* or get your marijuana into small pieces some other way
* put weed + butter or oil into mason jar, seal tightly
* throw that shit in hot water and let it ride
* you may want to shake it from time to time, not sure if this actually helps or not, but it feels helpful so I do it
* when you can't wait any longer (shoot for at least 30 minutes, I usually try for 60-90, someone correct me if this isn't the best) pull the jar out (use hot pads or tongs or something, that shit is hot)
* once cool enough to touch, open your jar and filter if desired

And that's it. No more waiting for your butter/water mixture to separate, just start baking. Thus works well because the water will never be &gt;212 F, so you don't have to worry about burning things, and there's little to no smell while cooking! I;ve also used this method to infuse a glass jar of organic peanut butter with weed and make space peanut butter. Try it with all types/amounts of weed into whatever fatty substance you want, find something that works for you! I think my next experiment will be putting weed into heavy whipping cream, then whipping it to put on pie or something, but it may be a while before I try.

Enjoy!

1365382516.0,60,self.treedibles,1bvxtr,The Ultimate Marijuana Tincture,68,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1bvxtr/the_ultimate_marijuana_tincture/,"This is a project I've been working on for some time. I was inspired by the lack of consistency found in marijuana tincture and green dragon recipes all over the web (including those in the sidebar). After long hours of research and much trial and error I finally feel confident enough in my knowledge to write up this recipe. If you're looking for qualifications I can't provide many, I'm just an undergrad chemistry major, but hopefully the effectiveness of this recipe will speak for itself. If this post proves successful I intend to re-write it and include pictures. 

**The Ultimate Marijuana Tincture**

**Step 1: Gathering the Supplies**

You're going to need the following items:

 * 1 ounce of high quality Buds 
 * A bottle of high-proof, clear, grain alcohol (150+)
 * Mason jar - 8 oz. or larger 
 * Access to an oven with stove top and vent hood 
 * Baking sheet and aluminum foil
 * Kitchen thermometer (must read up to 225°F accurately) 
 * Coffee Grinder (preferred) or herb grinder
 * Cooking Pot
 * Cheese Cloth or fine metal strainer

Substitutes: 

 * Other high-proof (150+) alcohols will work, but clear, grain alcohol preserves the essence of the cannabis without adding extra flavors
 * The mason jar is my go to, but really any container you can both reliably seal and immerse in boiling water will work
 * Forgoing the thermometer is not recommended, but possible if necessary
 * In place of a grinder one can use a cup and scissors, again not recommended

Before I continue I would like to note that using an oven is a necessary step in this recipe, and in doing so the house/living space you are in *will* smell strongly of cannabis for a few hours. Take this into consideration.

**Step 2: Decarboxylation**

Decarboxylation (decarb.) is a chemical process by which a carboxyl group is removed from a molecule. In this case we are decarbing THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) into THC. This is accomplished by the removal of a carbon group from the THC molecule through exposure to heat, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide. This step ensures that we are working with the maximum amount of THC and minimum amount of THCA that can reasonably be reached in a home kitchen. We do this because THCA is much less psychoactive than THC and has very low efficacy as a prodrug to THC. 

There is talk of another chemical process in some tincture recipes I've seen that is called isomerization. In theory, a strong acid could convert some species of major cannabinoids  into THC through isomerization, a process where one molecule is converted into another made up of the same constituent parts (converted into an isomer of the original molecule). I specifically found discussion surrounding old research where methanolic acid was used to convert CBD into THC with success. This process is unreliable unless in a *controlled laboratory environment* and may result in some unwanted and even dangerous isomers of CBD. I *do not* recommend it in *any* case when making tinctures. 

The Process:

 * Begin by preheating your oven to 225°F 
 * Next, grind up your bud into a near powdery consistency, brushing all the left over weed-dust from the grinder into your pile of reefer
 * Take the baking sheet and wrap aluminum foil over it, then spread the ground buds evenly over a central area of the foil
 * When the oven has preheated, bake the ground bud for 20-25 minutes
 * As the weed cooks you'll begin to notice a distinct smell of vaped marijuana, don't fret, this is only aromatics from the plant being vaporized, not THC
 * Near the end of cooking the weed will be slightly browner than before and have a crispy texture, this means it is done 
 * Remove the aluminum foil, taking care not to spill the decarbed buds and set aside

**Step 3: Mixing up the Potion**

This is the most crucial phase of the recipe. Failure here will mean failure on the whole. 

- Take the empty mason jar and, again with care, pour the decarbed bud into the jar
- Fill the jar up with alcohol until the weed is completely submerged, do not add more alcohol unless you desire a more diluted final product
- Seal the jar and shake for a couple minutes to agitate the solution

Done!

**Step 4: Collecting all the Goodies**

At this point we have a more or less finished marijuana tincture. Congrats! However, this is the ultimate recipe and so we will try to reach ultimate levels of potency. This step calls for heating the solution in order to raise the amount of solute that our solvent (alcohol) will accept. NOTE: it can be dangerous to heat high-proof alcohols if proper care is not taken, please follow *all* of the steps below to ensure your relative safety.

- Place the mason jar gently inside the cooking pot and fill the pot with water until the water is level with the alcohol solution in the jar
- Remove the mason jar from the water, remove the lid from the mason jar, set aside
- Bring the pot of water to a roiling boil, remove from the stove top and allow it to begin cooling, place underneath the vent hood
- As soon as the water has stopped boiling place the mason jar back into the pot, WITH THE LID REMOVED (it might explode otherwise) 
- While the pot is still under the vent hood watch the solution carefully and gently stir, make sure the vent hood is now turned on
- The alcohol solution will reach a slight boil momentarily as the water cools to below 175°F, during this stage some alcohol vapors will escape (which are explosive) and so the vent hood is essential to this step
- Once the alcohol stops boiling you can stop stirring and set the entire set up, water bath and mason jar, aside to cool

Personally I use a kitchen thermometer to measure the heat of the solution throughout this entire process (mine doubles as a stirring stick) and try to add more boiling water in small amounts to keep the temperature as close to 170°F as possible for up to an hour. The above steps are designed to keep you safe and get the job done without needing to use a thermometer. The choice is yours. 

There are many viable variations to the above steps, but I find this to be the safest and easiest method. For those who doubt the necessity of this step I can only say that it absolutely will raise the potency of the final product, and your motivation to do so is something I cannot control. 

At this point you can strain the solution and remove any solids from the mixture. Drape some cheese cloth over a separate container and dump the mixture into the cloth, squeezing out all the juice you can afterward. A metal strainer and bowl also work just fine, but layered cheese cloth will do the best job. 

**Storage and Dosage**

Once the above solution has cooled down to about room temperature (if it's slightly warm and you can't wait any longer then no worries) you can return the lid to the mason jar and reseal it. The solution should be stored between 70-85°F in a dark place (the spice cabinet works great) to prevent any loss of potency over time. The solution should keep for a year or more if stored properly, but I haven't tested this and can't say definitively.

You're best off figuring out the proper dosages for yourself as everyone metabolizes things differently, but as a general guideline consider 1 tsp a low dose. I've tried small and large amounts of tincture created using this recipe, a tsp will leave you feeling relaxed, a shot glass full will send you to space. Take care, this is a very potent tincture.

I see alot of interest in a solid method of cooking cannabutter in a jar of some sorts in order to keep the smell down, so I decided to do some denial and error in order to provide you folks with the know how!

At the bottom of this guide, I have my most recent ideas of how to make this better, and I also welcome you to input your thoughts as well. If I post something that is wrong, let me know. If I post something that I say I am unsure of and you know it's correct, also let me know!


**BEGINNING OF GUIDE* (General Information, Required Materials, Quantities, Techniques)

So basically, the biggest risk with cooking in a sealed container is that the pressure can build up inside the container, and perhaps maybe even to the point of your jar exploding, which is not ideal at all. I cannot guarantee that your jar will not explode when you make butter, however if you follow some of the tips in this guide it like help reduce the chance of it happening. I have never had this happen to me, but I cannot guarantee that it will not happen to you. However, I have came up with some preventative measures to keep this from happening so that you can cook some pretty badass butter without the smell. 

Also, I find this method to be great not only because of the reduced smell, but also because of the greater control you have with the temperature. On a stovetop it can be easy to burn the butter, and overheat the cannabinoids causing them to vaporize. If you could care less about the smell, or would like the smell use a pot for every step where I say to use a jar and you will have yourself some mighty fine, easy to make and instantly ready to use cannabutter.

Alright, so just some general knowledge before I get into the step by step.
First off, make sure you have all the required stuff to make the butter. I will make a little list for you and explain some of the stuff.

* Butter and weed


* A mason jar 

A note on the jar: Jar size is pretty important here. You want a jar that has a capacity of about twice the space that the butter and weed will take up. Also be sure to use a mason jar, as it is stronger than a typical glass jar such as a empty pickle jar. You can often buy these jars at craft stores such as Michaels (in Canada).

* Cheesecloth or ~~Pantyhose~~ Clean Pantyhose (to strain the weed from the butter)

Cheesecloth can be bought at most grocery stores. It is usually with the cooking gadgets.

* Rubber Gloves (the jar will be a bit hot, and rubber gloves give you enough protection, as well as some grip)

* Rubber Band (to tighten the cheesecloth around the jar)


Lets talk quantities. You should be using about 1 ounce of average grade cannabis for every 1 pound of butter. So if you are using shake, stems, or AVB you will have to use more in order to have the same potency. I would imagine using 1.5oz of cannabis for every 1 pound of butter would do the trick. I doubt people are making butter with some dank aeroponic mindblowing stuff, but if you are lucky enough to, maybe use 3/4 of an ounce of cannabis for every 1 pound of butter. 


Lots of recipes for cookies/brownies etc call for 1/2 cup of butter, so that would mean you would use about 7 grams in order to make that amount of butter. 10.5 grams of shake. Or about 5.0-5.5 grams of dankies.

Also keep in mind here that if you actually feel like enjoying a full cookie/brownie and you dont have a high tolerance, you will want to use maybe 3/4 of the amounts suggested above.

Next tidbit of info that you should know is the importance of decarbing your weed before you mix it with the butter and start cooking it. Decarbing is done by using heat of about 215F to turn the THCa into THC, which basically just makes it bind to fats more easily. By decarbing your trees before you cook it with the butter, it will basically just make sure that more of the cannabinoids will bind to fats, making your butter even more strong.

The reason why I chose 215F, which is on the lower end of the scale of cooking temperatures is because of how an oven actually works. The temperature in an oven is not kept at a constant temperature. It is more efficient for an oven to heat up to above the set temperature, and then turn off until it drops a certain amount below the set temperature. This fluctuation is then repeated for the entirety of the cooking time. By setting to 215F, it prevents possible vaporization of any cannabinoids. Also, this keeps the pressure in the jar under control. Using the information from [this](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/543218-Specific-boiling-points-and-roles-of-cannabinoids) thread, we can see that the lowest point of vaporization of a cannabinoid is ~246F. This means we have plenty of cushion to prevent vaporization. Also note the THC content graph a ways down the page. If we were to imagine that the graph continued for more time, this shows that at ~223F it would take about 2 hours to reach a maximum THC absorption.


**IMPORTANT**: Since we are heating the jar and it is completely sealed, pressure will build up and can cause the jar to break/go boom. To reduce this chance, do your very best to always handle the jar gently. This means don't vigorously shake it in attempt to mix it really well. Dont drop it. Dont play football with it. Dont reenact 1 guy 1 jar. Also I highly suggest buying a new jar, as it will have a lower chance of having microscopic cracks that could initiate a blowout.

**Decarbing** 
To decarb your trees, start with grinding them up as fine as you possibly can. The best way to get it as fine as possible is by using a food processor, but clearly not everyone has one of these readily available to use. If you have one, super! If not, a grinder, credit card, or scissors should suffice. PROTIP: While grinding, preheat your oven to 215F.

One it is as fine as you can get it, put in your jar, and seal that thing up! Put it in the oven for about 20 minutes at 215F, and shake it occasionally. At the 10 minute point, it might be a good idea to open up the jar slowly and ""burp"" it (let out any pressure that may have built up). Also, to keep smell down, you can take your jar outside to burp it. I would highly suggest to NOT do this if it is cold outside, being that the quick temperature transition could lead to your jar to break/explode. Once you burp it, put it back in for the remaining time. Once the 20 mins is up, your weed is ready to be mixed with your butter! PROTIP: Leave the oven on at 215F as you will be putting the butter and weed back in soon.

**Cooking Process**

Next step would be to take your butter and melt it. I did it by chopping up my butter into smaller pieces, putting them into a bowl, and microwaving it for about 45 seconds. This was for 1/2 cup of butter. WATCH THIS CLOSELY! First time I did it I put the butter in for 2 minutes, and I checked on it about halfway through and the butter had boiled all over the place in my microwave, and was annoying to clean up.


So now your cannabis is decarbed and your butter is melted. Now all you have to do is put the butter into the jar with your decarbed cannabis, and put it back in the oven for about 2-3 hours at 215F. You can cook it for less or longer, but I think this is a pretty good amount of time as proven by the THC Absorbtion Chart [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/543218-Specific-boiling-points-and-roles-of-cannabinoids)

While it is cooking, be sure to give it a  **GENTLE** shake and a burp about every 20-30 minutes. This will maximize THC absorption, and keep the pressure from building up too much in the jar. I personally didnt burp it at all, however, when I opened it after the 3 hours of cooking, there was quite a bit of pressure released when i opened the jar and it caused the butter to froth up from the rapidly escaping air and some of it spilled out. So I would suggest to just burp it every time you shake it (lol). If you are super concerned about a blowout, you *could* screw on the lid of the jar while the jar is in the oven, which would mean that the air inside would expand less then room temperature air. However, the chance you burn yourself by doing this might not be worth the preventative measure that this prevents.

So now your butter is done cooking, and you are ready to strain it. Once you take it out, let it cool for ~5 minutes and pour it into a different container. This is where you are gonna use that cheesecloth or pantyhose, as well as your elastic band. This is what you should you should set up, except in this picture I don't have the elastic around the jar to secure the cheesecloth. Also, don't use a dryer sheet like I did in this picture. http://imgur.com/8Cbqev2

So basically just slowly pour the butter into the the ""strainer"" and let the butter drip through. Once you have it all poured through, make sure you squeeze the butter out of the cheesecloth or pantyhose!


**BOOM**

You are done. You have the nectar of the ents. Go ahead and mix this in with anything that calls for butter. Many people use a store bought premade mix that you just add butter to, and that works really well. I personally used [this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/) recipe. I also used half white chocolate chips and half normal chocolate chips. Chocolate is a great way to mask the strong flavour. 


That's it! If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I hope you are successful, and let me know how it works for you.

I actually haven't tried any of my cookies since I am on a break because I have job interviews, but a buddy said he ate a full cookie and was at a [9].



Edit: Formatting, spelling, and grammar.

Feb 25 2013: I was just doing some research about the dangers of exploding mason jars. It appears that when people can fruits or whatever in jars, the temperature must reach at least 240F. I am also tempted to try making butter with an oven bag (like for cooking turkey). Unfortunately I am unable to at this time, but if someone feels like trying something in the name of science it would be super awesome!

Feb 26 2013: Included explanation of cooking temperature, changed cooking time from 3 hours to 2-3 hours.

Another thought I had was that when cooking, you might only need to burp it once or twice right at the beginning since it is already hot and by quickly releasing the pressure inside and putting it back in the oven the pressure won't build up quite as much. Please let me know if this sounds plausible, or any other ideas to make the best smell free method!

Also changed my suggestion to take it outside to burp it, because if it is cold outside it might make the jar break because of the quick change in temperature.


April 13th 2013: Was doing some thinking the other day. I thought that if you were to completely fill the jar with butter, there would be no air to expand when it heats up. Therefore the pressure wouldnt build up. I might ask one of my professors if this thought is true, or will the liquid expands and create pressure. Will update as soon as I know.

Also does anyone now how I can space out the paragraphs more so it is less of a text wall?

You will be off your ass with this.

Take a cereal, such as Apple Jacks, Cheerio's, Frosted Cheerio's, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Captain Crunch, Honey Combs, etc.. (anything poofy / with structure / not flaky) mix in 3 parts nutella and 1 part peanut butter. (PB optional) 

Basically, you want enough Nutella / PB to completely cover the cereal and you want it to be a cereal bar basically. Sprinkle your finely ground herb on top, cover in wrap in aluminum foil, and pop in the oven at 320 for 18-22 minutes. 

Eat Hot or Frozen. Either way, I can almost guarantee you'll hate making brownies after this.

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure, which has been lost in my archives for well over a decade. It happened exactly 15 years ago today, to the *minute* (I’ve timed this to publish exactly at 12:15…you will soon see why). 

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, right in San Francisco where it all happened, but I had no idea what I was in for. It turned out to be my first experience with edibles and my first glimpse at the elusive level [11]. Bear in mind that I had thought at that point that all my drug use was way in the past, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), and posted it on my blog/website (yes, some of us really had them even back in those days), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, I remembered this story as one of the best things I had ever written, and a classic example of someone writing under the influence of cannabis. But I couldn’t find it anywhere, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, other than fixing broken links and removing/changing names and such, except the original psychedelic background, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet, but [this is the closest I can find](http://www.hempire.co.uk/showthread.php/45797-Ganja-Goo-Balls-anyone-know-the-recipe?p=815917&amp;viewfull=1#post815917) to what I remember from the ingredients used.
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever,
Old Hippie

P.S. Dedicated to D.T. and all good daddies everywhere.

I have never been as high from an edible, as I was from the single hash cookie I ate. 

Which was made with 6 grams of BHO, split between two batches, resulting in potent, and delicious delicacy's.  

This pastry of dank was ingested about 8:45 AM, when I ate a little less than half. The half I ate, surprised me about  30-45 minutes later with a strong body-high. Within about a half-hour, while I was reading 'The Tao of Wu' by The RZA, I realized the meaningless of religion, and had an in-depth discussion with a dude I've never met before. The stranger and I talked about the similarities between Islam, and Christianity. 


A very zoned out, 3 hours later, and I was still at a stable high, munching down on some delicious pastries.  

1 hour later, and I'm nearly sober. In order to delay this eventuality, I felt it necessary to consume the rest of the cookie. By this time, I have began to feel a quite severe crash from my lack of sleep, and earlier ingestion of THC. Leading me too drink a red-bull, this burst of energy nicely complimented my zoned out high, and tired body. 3 hours after the fact, I quickly came down, ending a great day of being blazed.

Hash Cookies, cook them motha fucka!

*I'll tell you exactly what I did. You know; for science!* 

* 8g medium grade weed, finely ground (Magic Bullet works great for this)

* 1/2 cup + 2 Tbs sunflower oil (the extra 2 Tbs is to make up for volume lost through the process; the final result will be aprox. 1/2 cup of canna-oil)

1) Weed &amp; oil were mixed in a pan.

2) The mixture was kept on very low heat (about a 2 on a dial that goes to 10). Didn't even bring it to the point of simmering; just got it really hot.

3) Left it like this for about 2.5-3 hours. The weed had a thoroughly vaped appearance at the end; it was dark brown/blackish. 

4) The hot mixture was poured into a glass container and covered.

5) The weed-oil mixture was allowed to sit for 3 days at room temperature. It was stirred once each day. 

6) The weed was then strained from the oil using cheese cloth (cheese cloth works great because you can really squeeze out every last drop of oil-be sure to use a few layers of cheese cloth when straining to ensure your finely ground weed can't get through the holes). The used weed was discarded.

7) The oil was used to make 2 boxes of [Betty Crocker Frosted Brownie](http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/brownies-and-dessert-bars/products/betty-crocker-frosted-brownie) which was baked in two equal sized pans (1 box per pan). Each pan was cut into 8 pieces so each brownie contained 0.5g worth of weed. Read on to learn about the importance of eating only half of one of these brownies, waiting an hour to see how you feel, then eating the rest. 

WARNING: THESE ARE *VERY* POTENT!!!

**RESULTS/CAUTIONARY TALE**

I baked these brownies for a friend's new year's eve party. As a daily toker I have a pretty high tolerance and every time I bake brownies, I try to make them as potent as possible. I never really thought they could be 'too potent' but apparently my new year's eve brownies crossed that line. 

Of the 6 people who ate the brownies at 11pm, 3 of us were still in good condition at midnight. The survivors were myself, a fellow daily toker, and a guy who used to smoke as much as us. We reached a solid [8] and had a great time. The others? 

First one down was an occasional smoker who at first explained to us that he felt like Sulley from Monsters Inc.; it was like he could feel soft fur extending from his skin and gently waving as he moved. But by 12:30am he sat silent, unmoving and very very pale and remained that way for a good hour before slowly recovering. At 5PM the next day, I got a text saying he *finally* stopped feeling high. 

The second one down was also an occasional smoker. She was less descriptive of her high but she ended up throwing up and going to sleep by 2am. 

I felt really really bad about the third guy. He pretty much never smoked and he did not want to reach the [10] that he got. Just after midnight he pulled me aside and I realized just how high he was. You see kids, if you're going to be that high, you need to not have things to worry about. This guy was worried because it was his house and some of his non-smoker friends were in attendance. He kept thinking about how high he was and how *not* high they were and how this made him a bad host. In the end, he hid it well from them, but internally he panicked. He described how he kept thinking in loops that  kept leading him back to how not high his friends were and what they would think if they knew what was going on in his head. His girlfriend was in the room and he tried to communicate this to her...telepathically. Funny enough, she figured out something was up and sent him to bed. Unfortunately he was too high to sleep and just kept panicking. After his sober friends left, he came back to the party to inform us between raucous laughter and panicked tears just how high he was and just how high he didn't want to be. He woke up still stoned out of his head the next day and had to call in sick to work. It's been 24 hours and I still haven't heard if he ever came down.

**TL;DR:** My less experienced friends got much higher than they wanted; one went comatose (not literally) and was still high for most of the next day, one threw up, and one freaked the fuck out and was stuck being high for an entire day causing him to miss work. 

**The Moral?**

Unless you are a seasoned stoner, **eating half the brownie, then waiting an hour to see how you feel is** ***really really*** **good advice.**

Things you will need:

Either vaporized trees, or trees and an oven.

High proof alcohol. You should probably have a minimum of 70% alcohol. Make sure this is the type of alcohol that is safe to drink, we don't want to be using rubbing alcohol.

Coffee filters

A double boiler system

An extra jar or cup or really a glass container of any sort


1. Ok so first thing is first. THC will not do anything to get you high if it hasn't been heat activated through a process known as decarboxylation. If you are using pre-vaped weed, you've already done this, and can skip this step. If you are using fresh weed, grind that shit up and throw it in an oven at 315F for about 5 minutes. You don't want it to get hotter, because you don't want to vaporize the mind altering chemicals.

2. Take either your cooked or vape weed, and put it into the top part of your double boiler system. Pour in enough of your high proof alcohol to cover your trees. 

3. Obvious if the top of your double boiler is alcohol and trees, the bottom part of it should be water. Make sure that the container with the alcohol and the trees NEVER touches the heat directly. 

4. Boil down the alcohol until it's maybe 1/4 or so of what you started with. The amount that you boil it down to now is irrelevant, since you will be boiling it down again.

5. Strain out the alcohol using your coffee filters into the separate container. You want to leave as much plant matter in the original container as possible, as you well be using it again.

6. Pour more high proof alcohol into the top part of the double boiler (the container with all of your plant matter) and repeat step 4.

7. Pour out the alcohol and filter it with a coffee filter into the same container as step #5. This time though, you want to get ALL the alcohol out from the plant matter. This means that you should be basically dumping it all out onto the coffee filter and squeezing out as much alcohol as you can.

8. Take the container with all of your alcohol sludge gunk stuff, and use it to replace the other container on your double boiler. I'm basically saying that this now container is now the one that you want to be boiling down.

9. Boil it until you have a concentration that you are happy with. 

Congratulations, you now have high concentration green dragon. Achieve a [10] my frients!

Decarboxylation is a big word and in layman's terms it means heating up your bud to the point and for the duration that the maximum amount of THC acid is converted to psychoactive THC. The practical importance of this is to increase potency of the bud you will be cooking or making essential oil extracts with. Decarboxylating doesn't do a whole lot for smoking, however, as the heat from your flame does *most* of that work for you.
http://michiganmedicalmarijuana.org/topic/35900-the-importance-of-decarboxylation-in-edible-making/

My favorite way to decarboxylate is to use my oven. Putting your dope in the oven at the precise temperature and time allows the THCA to convert without vaporizing anything.

The first step is to get your dope.

http://i.imgur.com/y38QVPm.jpg

I use fresh bud straight off the plant. (Week 7 flower of an 8 week cycle so they're just about ready anyway) You can do this with dry bud as well, but it's **essential** to do this to fresh bud.

I like to fashion myself a little tinfoil boat with a hat to put my dope into. I don't know if there are alternatives to using foil but it works pretty well for me. Notice that I don't cut my buds up beforehand. I'm not sure if it matters though, since the buds I use are such tiny popcorn nugs. If you are using bigger buds, chop them into tiny pieces.

[This guy](http://forum.grasscity.com/incredible-edible-herb/780718-theoracles-oven-decarboxylation-technique-sativex-patent-derived-data.html) found data about what temperatures and times produce the best THCA to THC yield. The two best times are **220 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 hours**, or **250 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes**.

I prefer 250 degrees F for 30 minutes because I'm impatient and edibles are really strong in the first place.

After the time is up, remove the tin boat and see your crumbly bone-dry dope ready for cooking action. You will know when your weed is properly decarboxylated when it crumbles to dust with light touch.

The Antidote

To counteract any unpleasant side effects resulting from overindulgence, such as severe paranoia, cold fresh lemonade with plenty of sugar is suggested.  Also any form of vitamin C, and bed rest with warm blankets until the feeling abates.  Hot drinks increase the effects of hashish and make the onset more rapid.  Heavy food slows it down.  The liquid drinks (Bhang or kif Tea) work faster, while the solids may take well over an hour. The effects last for from several hours to two days.

1332187281.0,25,self.treedibles,r3wwe,Our attempt at making the Canndy recipe. (x-post from /trees),27,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/r3wwe/our_attempt_at_making_the_canndy_recipe_xpost/,"My girlfrient and I made a batch of canndy using the [recipe that has been posted multiple times here](http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/r3wwe/our_attempt_at_making_the_canndy_recipe_xpost/), and I thought I would report in with our results.  We made a couple of minor tweaks, but nothing too major.

After reading a few of the other reviews we decided to use 5g of trees (instead of 3.5g,) so that the canndy would last us a while longer.  We used very fresh trees; 2.5g of Three Kings and 2.5g of G13.  As it turns out this change makes it so that pretty much two pieces will do the trick.  

Against the advice of the original poster we used a gas stove which we understand is VERY DANGEROUS when working with 190 proof alcohol.  Whenever I was stirring or adding the jar to the flame my girlfrient was standing eight feet away with a fire extinguisher, just in case.  We couldn't find any Everclear, so we used another 190 proof grain alcohol called Graves and it seemed to work just fine.

When we got to the second part everything seemed to be going fine, but the corn syrup/water/sugar mixture heated up a lot faster than we thought, and we had to trash it and start over; luckily, no trees had been added yet.  As for the heating/boiling times of the sugar mix this is what we experienced:


+0'00"" Start

+15'00"" Hit 250-degrees; added four drops of coloring.

+19'30"" Hit 300-degrees; removed from heat.



When we added our extract/flavor mixture I was wearing eye protection (sunglasses) per the instructions to protect against splattering.  I poured the extract/flavor mixture into the cooked sugar mix but it did not splatter so I removed the sunglasses.  AS SOON as I started stirring it started splattering, so I put the glasses back on.

It didn't smell badly of trees or anything, but the alcohol scent/vapor was strong enough to burn my eyes a bit, even with the exhaust fan, along with every other fan in the apartment running full blast.  No harm done, it was just uncomfortable while I was stirring.	

When we were at Hobby Lobby buying the oils (the only place we could find them other than on Amazon.com or LorAnn's website) they were out of stock on hard candy molds.  The ones Hobby Lobby and other craft stores sell for making chocolate lolipops and candies specifically says ""DO NOT USE FOR HARD CANDY MAKING.""  Instead, at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, we picked up four of the small ice cube trays that make 0.50"" x 0.50"" x 0.50"" ice cubes.  We sprayed these down with Pam before starting the boil, and once we had everything mixed we poured the mix into the trays.  As you can see from the picture below we overestimated the amount of molds we would need.

After pouring I left them in front of an open window for two hours, but they were still a little soft.  After leaving them out still overnight they were still tacky to the touch so I placed them in the freezer for about thirty minutes.  I took them out of the freezer and the canndy pieces all popped out easily and without breaking or crumbling after having smacked the back of the tray four or five times.

I wrapped up the candy in foil wrappers that we also bought at Hobby Lobby in doses of 1s, 2s, 3s, and a couple 4s, (as you can see from the picture it made about 80 pieces.)  While wrapping I ate broken chunks amounting to about 3+ pieces of canndy.  Forty-five minutes later I was starting to feel it.  After ninety minutes I was passed out asleep.  

I later ate two and the high was much nicer.  Nice body high and slight head buzz.  However, they are still slightly tacky to the touch, not rock hard, and cannot be crunched down on in your mouth like a Jolly Rancher.  As they are sucked on they turn into an almost taffy-like consistency.  

If I make this recipe again I will probably use 1.5 Tbsp or even 2.0 Tbsp of the recommended Tart &amp; Sour mix (1.0 Tbsp is the recommended amount) in an attempt to better mask the tree flavor.  Although these taste better than any other edible I have had you definitely know what you are eating.

I've spent the past couple days researching into the chemical properties of THC and other cannabinoids with the intent of forming a scientifically sound recipe for a tincture. I want maximum potency, minimal loss, etc. 

I'll be using a bastardization of Mrs. Bliss' tincture recipe as a reference. (actual recipe can be found [here](http://www.blissedibles.com/blog/3))

I have a light chemistry background and am currently in an undergraduate Biochem program, but most of my research has been independently conducted. In other words, I am **not** a professional. 

The major inconsistencies I found between claims of different recipes are:

* Use of Decarboxylated Buds vs. Buds with the carboxyl group attached (THC vs THCA) 
* Cooking Temperatures and Times (If heating is even involved) 
* Validity of Ethanol as a solvent
* Potency and Purity of final product 

My research has led me to conclude the following bits of information: 

* Decarboxylization occurs at 222° F 
* THC will bond to organic solvents between 325°-355° F
* THC boils at 355° F and above, Major cannabinoids between 390°-425° F
* Pure THC has a flash point of ~300° F but will not boil in normal atmospheric conditions until higher temps
* THCA readily bonds to polar solvents, THC to non-polar solvents although this is very subjective
* THC/THCA/CBA are all hydrophobic and will not bond with water when heated

This being a tincture, I'm going to ignore any possible solvents beside ethanol. Ethanol as a solvent carries some unique characteristics:

* It has both polar and non-polar ends
* It has a low combustion temperature when heated
* Ethanol will boil at 173.1° F 

Knowing the above I've come to create a tincture recipe that I will post below in the comments. My main goal is to discuss the above information and find inaccuracies in my research, but criticism/commenting on the recipe will be greatly appreciated.

1374379521.0,22,self.treedibles,1iqfm2,Results of first attempt at OldHippie's canna caps recipe,25,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1iqfm2/results_of_first_attempt_at_oldhippies_canna_caps/,"**Background**: Up until recently, I'd never tried trees in any form. After having half a dose of medicated chocolate at a friend's house, I decided that it was an experience worth repeating. I decided to try to make canna caps because the up front investment was much less than buying a decent vaporizer. I worked from a combination of /u/OldHippie 's [recipe](http://beyondchronic.com/2011/01/how-to-make-your-own-canna-caps/) and /u/EdibleOnly 's recipe from the sidebar.

**Ingredients**:
8g of Blueberry

Store-brand organic coconut oil

A bit of powdered soy lecithin

**Procedure**:
I'm not going to repeat the obvious from the recipes mentioned above, so I'll hit the high points. (See what I did there?)

Decarbed in a preheated mason jar in the oven. (Preheat oven and jar, insert trees, put lid on, screw ring on partway.) This contained the odor pretty effectively; I wouldn't have wanted anyone to walk into my apartment while I was doing it, but my HEPA filter unit cleaned the air up pretty quickly.

I did the oil extraction in a different mason jar inside a crock pot. The thermal conductivity was pretty poor; it took a long time for the mason jar to reach the goal temperature. (I have a temperature gun that I used for measurement.) While I'm a bit skeptical of EdibleOnly's claim regarding cell wall breaking through freezing, because I would assume that all the water would escape during the decarb, I put it through a few freeze/reheat cycles just for the hell of it.

In the end, I removed as much oil from the mixture as I could, and ended up with a tiny amount. I put the oily plant matter back in the jar, added more oil, and then separated it out again. The oil produced this time was much more diluted but still far from clear. I ended up with enough oil for about 40 capsules, meaning each had the equivalent of about 0.2g worth, give or take.

The filling was a bit sloppy; I'll do better next time.

**Results**:

I took one. No effect for two hours, then a pleasant body high...briefly. After a short while I realized I was getting too high and decided to lie down for a bit.

While walking down the stairs I blinked and, for a split second, saw what I can best describe as a cross between Tron and the Android ""Neural Network"" live wallpaper. That was when I realized that my afternoon was not going to be a particularly pleasant one.

I ended up having mild auditory hallucinations, similar to a song that gets stuck in your head, but much more so. I spent a lot of time on the phone with one of my best friends, constantly unsure whether I'd actually said something or merely imagined saying it, while waiting what felt like an hour for her to reply to each thing I said. Meanwhile, I experienced something reminiscent of the ""eternal waking"" scene from an early issue of Sandman: I'd fall partway asleep for a second or two, start dreaming something, then wake up and immediately fall into another one, repeating over and over. It sucked, frankly.

**To do**:
Break up the capsules and dilute. By 3-4x or so. This is going to be a pain in the neck.

**Lessons learned**:
I didn't do the typical newbie mistake of taking another one when the first one didn't work immediately, but I should have tried half of one capsule's worth first, *before* filling the rest. (Or less than half.)

1367507649.0,22,self.treedibles,1djz15,My First Experience... Cosmic Caramels! Thank you reddit!,23,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1djz15/my_first_experience_cosmic_caramels_thank_you/,"Hello All!  This week I just finished up my first ""bake"" for edibles.  This was not only my first experience making edibles, it was also my first experience eating them.  I was incredibly nervous considering the amount of money I invested, but thanks to all the helpful and informative articles on reddit and on the web, I was able to get it done!  I felt like I should share my experience here in the hopes that it may help some wayward cyber traveler in the future sometime.  If you'd just like an overview of the results, skip to the bottom of this post.  If you're interested in an in-depth review of my process, feel free to read on.  

So I chose to make ""Cosmic Caramels"" as I believe they are called.  The reason being that I'm going to a huge 2 day rock concert festival this weekend and I wanted to be covert as possible.  I needed something that may keep in my pocket, but not take up much space.  As well as not draw too much attention when eating it.  The concert promoters sent me an e-mail recently saying something along the lines of, ""in light of recent events in Boston, we will be working with local police officers to ensure public safety.""  Which I am guessing means, we're gonna be busting people for weed.  Well, I can't have that.  

So after some research I choose to follow [this method](http://www.420magazine.com/forums/cannabis-edibles/37701-cannabutter-7-easy-steps.html) for my weed butter.  

I also was using fresh nuggetry, so I did research on decarbing and loosely followed [this guide](http://www.marijuanagrowershq.com/decarboxylating-cannabis-turning-thca-into-thc/) for decarboxylating the buds.    

And my final goal was to make treats using [this recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-soft-chewy-caramel-candies-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-180832) for my caramels.  


So I began by seeking out a quarter of kind(or is it kine?) bud.  I paid 110 for right at 8 grams of [bud](http://imgur.com/XKqF6jc.jpg)    

I popped the bud into a coffee grinder and pumped the button about 3-4 times to grind it up [quite nicely](http://imgur.com/gyGp5o6.jpg)
Notice the scale says 7 now.  It had been jumping from 7-8 both before and after grinding it.  If I had included the bag it came in, the weight would have stayed right on the 8.    

Next put your bud [on some tin foil](http://imgur.com/jOe4q7r.jpg).  I was almost out of tin foil as you can see.  I bought some more before the end of this.  I then preheated my oven to [230^o](http://imgur.com/r9sHPPx.jpg) and left it in there for 30 minutes.   Once every 10 minutes, I would take a fork and push the bud around and mix it up to ensure even heat distribution.   

Once it was done, the bud looked like [this](http://imgur.com/hJghTND.jpg)  


Now I was done for the day unfortunately.  I had a small window of kitchen time usage for this sort of thing.  So I took this opportunity to [practice](http://i.imgur.com/PLixpof.jpg) the caramel recipe.  I did two practice runs and still had trouble getting it just right in the final result.  I really suggest you try a few times unless you're already good at candies or caramels.  

Fast forward to day 2 and I start making my butter.  I feel like this is the area I second guessed myself the most on.  I just felt like I was going to ruin 100 bucks worth of awesome bud.    

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/t2hWvJG.jpg) was the first thing I second guessed.  The recipe says boil the water.. THEN add the butter.  I just put the butter in.  This freaked me out for a while because I had added my butter and water at the same time and boiled it.  I eventually added a tablespoon more of butter to make myself feel better. (it probably didn't matter) After the butter melted, I put the water on low.  Once calmed down it's boiling, I put in my bud.  


[This](http://i.imgur.com/8cwLtiA.jpg) is what it looked like after I added my bud.  I worried alot about whether or not it should bubble at all.  I adjusted my temperature a lot between having tiny little bubbles appearing steady, and having no bubbles at all.  After re-reading the instructions multiple times I decided that it should be on the lowest setting possible  (no bubbles).  I also made the decision that next time I will likely use a crock pot or something along with a thermometer to ensure I have exact temperatures evenly.  But in the end this method did work.   

This mix had to sit on the stove for 3 hours.  I stirred it every 30 minutes.  Now is a good time to [pause for the cause](http://imgur.com/AqLRDpw.jpg).  Afterwards I got kind of artsy with my picture taking of some [scented candles](http://imgur.com/LXXolKe.jpg) and [air freshener](http://imgur.com/n2nz0Nx.jpg).  You most definitely want to make sure you have both of these when decarbing or cooking weed.  Otherwise your home will stink for a day or two.  (I like glade candles and spray)  

Now is a good time to [prep your container](http://imgur.com/j39OK2B.jpg) for when the butter finishes.  The recipe calls for 4 layers of cheese cloth rubber banded to the top of some Tupperware.  I was also almost out of cheese cloth... so I used this skiny one.   

[This](http://imgur.com/bz9LvtL.jpg) is what my butter mixture looked like when it was done...  Kinda gross.  You will then [filter this through your cheese cloth](http://imgur.com/EZBXoCy.jpg) making sure to thoroughly squeeze the juice out of the cheese cloth.  There will be alot in there.  [This](http://imgur.com/ozc4AJ2.jpg) was what it looked like once I was done pouring it.      

Once I was done with that, I [opened my cheese cloth](http://imgur.com/guKx19U.jpg) and thought,  ""Holy fuck, I hope I didn't just go through all this trouble to just throw 100 bucks away.""  But you must remain vigilant!  I also took this time to [enjoy a brew and lick the spoon clean](http://imgur.com/lXy3rqd.jpg).  The butter has to sit in the fridge overnight to settle.  So my day in the kitchen was done.  

[This](http://imgur.com/OscYDdi.jpg) is what I found waiting for me in the morning.  Being that my containers were so cheap and I have about 30 of them, I decided to just [drill holes](http://imgur.com/PNSDpzO.jpg) in my container to get the water out.  Once this was complete, [this was my finished product](http://imgur.com/718y01U.jpg).     

So... now that the butter is made, I could finally begin to make my caramels!   

[First](http://imgur.com/2Ku0uzP.jpg) I had to prep the mold pan by lining it with either wax paper or tin foil.  I ended up using tin foil because the wax paper seemed to melt when I poured the caramels in it.  Also, spray that foil...  Spray anything and everything these caramels touch.  They like to stick.   

[Second](http://imgur.com/iFSbLHQ.jpg) combine your butter, salt and heavy cream in a pan and melt it.  My recipe called for half a stick of butter, but my cannabutter recipe made a whole stick..  So my solution here it to add extra salt.  I read somewhere that salt helps the butter bind to the sugar, helping it set later on during the cooling phase.  So rather than a quarter tsp of salt, i used a little less than a half.  When it's done, it should look like [this](http://imgur.com/kJ6Il60.jpg).  (If you're using regular butter, this mix will be white.  Once the butter's melted, just set that to the side to add to the sugar later.   

[Third](http://imgur.com/eTEMoY0.jpg) mix your sugar, water, and corn syrup together to make a white paste in another pot.  You will also have to take a brush and brush all the little sugar crystals off the walls above the surface.   

[Fourth](http://imgur.com/jajQGG3.jpg) you cook the syrup.  After a certain temperature, it turns clean while it bubbles.  Here I cooked mine up to a pretty high temperature.  Probably about 310.  Which I did because I wanted my candies to be a little harder... which my hopes would make them less likely to melt in your pocket when outside at a hot music festival all day.  But if you were going to enjoy these for home treats.  I wouldn't heat it that high.  I think that if you wanted nice delicious texture, you would probably want to cook it to maybe... 280 degrees.  Also adding more cream makes the caramels softer according to ole Emma the caramel lady.  


[Fifth](http://imgur.com/zO5PQTo.jpg) You will whisk in your butter cream mix into the sugar syrup mix.  Then heat it up kind of slowly to 250 degrees.  This whole process(from step 1 of the caramel until now) probably only took about 10 minutes with a good stove.  

[Sixth](http://imgur.com/5c8KUkd.jpg) empty your caramel mix into a pan.  I noticed mine has a lot of little bubbles in it.  Those little bubbles later looked like little cannabutter bubbles. I'm not sure what's up with that.  I suppose maybe that happens when you have funny colored butter and heat the caramel to hard rock.  


Once you are done, just leave that caramel out to harden for 2-3 hours.  Mine hardened in about 2 hours.  If you're making soft caramels, it may take overnight before it sets.  If you fucked up it may never set all the way.  In that case pour that caramel sauce on some ice cream or into some coffee.  That shit will be delicious and get you fucked up.   

Also, if you act fast, you should be able to get a few good [spoonfulls](http://imgur.com/c1w8Lfd.jpg) of caramel off the bottom of the pot.  I got 3 about like that one and ate them.  It was a delicious way to test the product.  And thankfully after about 2 hours, I found myself at about a [4.5](http://imgur.com/YYDQsFH.jpg).  I was so happy!  I didn't fuck up!    

After the caramels cool, [chop them up](http://imgur.com/vfAetQ6.jpg) into [little squares](http://imgur.com/2Xmwe0h.jpg).  I attempted to keep mine about the same size, but eventually gave up.  So they do very in size a bit.  

The final part is optional, but I did it because I need to transport them.  So you could just put them in a bowl and eat them out of there, but I choose to wrap mine.  I put them in a bowl and [threw some powdered sugar](http://imgur.com/e4cNHOD.jpg) on top of them to keep them from sticking to each other and later to keep from sticking to the wrappers.  This was way to much powdered sugar, so I had to get a little brush out and brush them off before wrapping them up.  And it took me about an hour to wrap every single candy up in wax paper.    

**THE FINAL PRODUCT!**   

I ended up with [68 pieces of candy!](http://imgur.com/LKyWYyl.jpg)  

[Here is a close up of an individual candy.](http://imgur.com/fExvc2m.jpg)  

And [This](http://imgur.com/crFjFFs.jpg) is how I am storing them until time for the show.  I put 20 in each large grocery bag and kept 8 out to gauge tollerance.  

What I've found is the 2 will get me to about the same as my 3 spoonfulls did.  About a 4.5.. My girlfriend says she was definitely at a 5.  But she does weigh about 120 pounds less than I do.  (I'm a big guy)  I would expect 3 to take me to a 6 and maybe 4 could get me to a 7 or 8.  I have not fully tested yet, but I do know 2 pieces to be good for a buzz very similar to smoking a joint.  They take about 45 minutes to kick in for me, and last about 2-3 hours.  

I did some quick cost justification.  It was 110 for the bud, and I ended up with 68 pieces.  I say 2 of them equal a joint... so, I ended up with 34 joints for 110 dollars.  Which is about 3.23 per joint... which is a decent deal.  So I feel like all my trouble is worth it.  Plus the best part is these candies are pretty much completely incognito!  Which should make for a better time at the concert this weekend.  

If you took the time to read my post, I hope you all enjoyed it.  I hope that I was able to help someone out who may be cooking or studying for their first time.  And if any vets out there wanna give me some tips on how to improve my recipe, feel free!  And thank you again reddit for all your help!

Recipe:
-tea bags
-1g bud
-1/2cup milk
-1tbsp butter
-hot water
-honey

-Open a tea bag and put ground bud into bag and reseal. Stapling it closed works well.
-Heat up milk and butter in the microwave until the butter is completely liquid. We did it on a lower power and stirred it a couple times over a period of about 2 minutes.
-Soak weed tea bag in the milk/butter mixture and then microwave. We did it for about a minute on a lowish power. Use your best judgement.
-Add 1/2cup hot(boiling) water to weed tea bag and milk/butter mixture and let steep for 15min.
-Brew 1/2cup regular tea stronger than normal.
-Mix regular tea with the weed/milk/butter mixture.
-I started with 1/2cup of regular tea and added 1/2cup of the weed/milk/butter/water mixture then brewed about another cup of regular tea and mixed it in since I wanted a more tea like taste.
-Add honey to taste.

I left the tea bags in my cup in hopes of getting the most from them. It's been about an hour since I started drinking the tea and I'm at a [4] and I'd say I have a decent tolerance built up. It gives you a nice body high. I doubt this is the most efficient way to do this, but it worked. I'm open to any advice or questions anyone has.

So I followed the post here by [loonybinjones](http://i.imgur.com/TnVHR.jpg), with some slight alterations.

I've never made hard candy before, but I'm familiar with caramel, toffee and other sugar creations so this his tutorial was really pretty easy to follow. 

First, I didn't have access to quite the same stuff he had, but close enough.

I used about 7 g of ABV, instead of fresh bud. 
I used Golden Grain instead of Everclear (Coke/Pepsi difference)
I couldn't find the flavorings he used so I just used a flavor extract(alcohol based, mine was artificial cherry).
I went the cheap route and got the plastic candy molds, they work, but not near as well as silicon, plus they were harder to pour.
I didn't have tea bags or cheese cloth, so I used a few coffee filters.
I bought a more expensive thermometer that's mounted on metal and clips to the side of the pan. This was a major hassle, as it only clips on a big pot, and while you can just stand it in the middle of the pan, the thermometer is mounted to high. This is a fairly small recipe, and towards the end the thermometer wasn't always fully submerged. I've cooked sugar down before so I recognized the stages. 

The only thing I think, is the second batch I made, I got a new pan, and was getting a more accurate temperature reading. When it got to 300 I added the liquid in 3 batches,(On/Off heat) and when that was done, It was almost too thick to work with, even after heating. I think that you should add the liquid around 275 in batches, then work up to 300, that would prevent so much seizing up at the end, and make sure all the alcohol is gone. 

That being said, my first batch without the tincture was awesome. They tasted great and the texture was just right.

The second one, is OK. I simmer my alcohol mix for 45 minutes, and I don't think it was enough. There is still a slight alcohol twang. You don't know what it us really unless your told. The ABV is also very noticeable. I would not recommend ABV in candy, it just to strong, go with cakes or extracts.

The strength? Ehh, Well I smoked a bowl, and had one trench a couple hours before injestion. I ate bout 2(1 whole one and some scraps). I took a shower for work, and there was a definite body high when I got out. Ate another on the way to work(it was dead tonight, and my last night), and I was good all night[6](high tolerance). Very hungry(which is OK, I work in kitchens), great mood, bouncy and pretty fun.

Well, that's just my take on this recipe. I wanted to help fill in some holes, or answer some questions that didn't get answered in the first post. Thanks a lot to loonybinjones for this awesome recipe.

Sidenote: For easier clean up(all the syrup not in molds, will turn to candy, on EVERYTHING). Take all your tools and put them in the put, fill with water to the near top and simmer/boil for a little while, bout 5, 10 minutes. It will soften all the candy.

After doing a bit of reading I have decided to steep herb and stems for 14 days before boiling off half the volume. 

What ratio of herb to alcohol is best? I have about 6 grams of stems, should that affect my ratio?

What is the best temperature and duration to decarb? I have heard that cold decarbing is possible, can someone please explain this?

I have heard that steeping in the freezer is a good method because the trichomes freeze, become brittle and break off of the plant matter. Other sources say to keep it room temperature, some say warm. What method is better? How long should I steep for?

Is there a way to minimise chlorophyll taste? I am using Spirytus Polish alcohol because Everclear is not available where I live. I have read glycerine is better for taste but not as potent/concentrated. 

What does soaking the herb in distilled water do? How long do you need to dry after soaking to decarb properly?

- Add it (ground up) to half a liter of vodka
- Leave the mixture in a dark place for a month
- After a month filter out any non-liquid material

i made some of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/o0261/extracting_with_bacon_grease_instead_of_butter/) a few days ago.  i used about 1 cup of bacon fat and 22g of decent shake (a nice gift from my supplier &lt;3). 
i let the water, goob, and bacon fat simmer for 2.5 hours and then strained using a fine mesh strainer and put the resultant *very green* bacon fat in a glass jar in the fridge. 

for the last several days, i have been using the fat to cook my eggs or to make fried rice; it's FANTASTIC. just 1-2 teaspoons gets me pretty good for several hours (4-5) (and i'm kind of experienced when it comes to treedibles).

Thought I would share my experiences with my first batch of tinctures.  I made it by using a combination of the three recipes in the side bar.

My Method:

* Put ~3.5g of green in oven @ 160c / 320f  for 5 minutes
* Crumble with fingers into jar with 60ml of Bacardi 151
* Simmer in water bath for 20 minutes at 75c / 167f
* Pour through Chux, squeeze Chux thoroughly
* Done!

To take I use a dropper to put 1-3ml into a shot glass, fill with water and shot.

* 1ml puts me at a [2] for a few hours
* 2ml puts me at a [5] for a few hours
* 3ml puts me at a [8] for 5+ hours

I find it a very different effect to smoking, but enjoyable in its own way.  It's fantastic to take before heading out to the pub/dinner and it kicking in an hour later.  The SO much prefers taking it this way than smoking.

The floral flavour is very strong, can even taste it if using coke instead of water in the shot.  Might try it with darker rum instead next time in case that changes the flavour.

* Anything else I could try different next time?
* Anyone else had similar experiences with their tinctures?

My buddies and I are going to be experimenting with edibles this weekend and we have decided to go with some brownies.

Although we have done a lot of research, some questions are still unanswered.

Questions:
1. Do we have to Decarb our trees in the oven before we add it to the oil mixture? 
2. How long should we let it simmer for? (I have seen as little as 20 minutes, and as long as 6 hours.)

I am trying the 'syrup' in everything, and it is nothing short of magical. I've also been brewing my own kombucha for about a year now. Naturally, I want to put tincture in some of my kombucha. 

I would imagine it would work fine if I mix the syrup in a finished bottle right before drinking, but what would happen if I put it in at different stages in the brewing process? Would the bacteria and yeast break down the cannaboids? 

For those unfamiliar with how kombucha is made, the basic idea is that you mix sugar-sweetened tea with the kombucha culture, which is made of bacteria and yeast. The culture 'eats' the sugar and ferments the tea into a sweet, tangy, fizzy, probiotic treat. To flavor the brew and to increase the carbon dioxide, I do a second fermentation, where I bottle the kombucha with fruit puree, and it eats the new sugar but in a closed vessel (main kombucha brewing happens with a cloth or paper towel over the top to allow the culture to get fresh air) so carbonation builds up. 

I know that glycerin is sweet, but it's not a sugar that the kombucha could eat, right? 

Another intriguing idea is viability of using kombucha to extract buds initially, since kombucha has a very low (.5%) alcohol content. Any ideas, redditors?

This is how I've been doing it:

**Ingredients:**

- 2 Tablespoons of ABV ground into a fine powder.

- 3 Tablespoons Peanut Butter (as fatty and natural as you can get it).

- 2 Tablespoons of Nutella (optional for taste but I strongly recommend it).

- Whole Milk (Whole Chocolate Milk if you prefer)

**Steps:**

1. Put all ABV, PB, and Nutella in a bowl and mix it up really well.

2. Put the bowl in the microwave for 2 minutes on 70% power.

3. Let it cool off for a while. Otherwise the shake will taste all gross and warm.

4. Put it in the blender with Whole Milk. Remember that you want as much fat as you can get so I have used Chocolate Milk as well.

5. Pour it out into a glass and enjoy!

**End Results:**

Before I start I just want to point out I made my shake with Chocolate Milk, not very good peanut butter (some weird Skippy's brand) and very dark brown ABV.

I drank the milk shake (couldn't taste the shitty ABV at all) on a mostly empty stomach, around 6pm after a small breakfast and almost no lunch. 

45 minutes after ingestion I started feeling a little high, maybe a [2]. 15 minutes after that I'm at a [6] and rising quickly. An hour and a half after taking I was leveling out at a [9] this being the highest I had been in months.

Watched Life of Pi and I was still a [9] at the end of the movie (around 11pm) but barely awake. Then I passed out and slept for 14 hours. 

It's 2pm the next day and I'm still feeling a heavy ""after glow"" (where you aren't high but stuff like music is still amazing and you just feel good in general.

10/10 would do over and over again.

I highly recommend this.

I'm new to the sub but have been doing brownies for about 10 years.  I was surprised to not see anything about the double boiler method on the sidebar.  There is a link that says double boiler, but it  links to the water mixed in method and the simmer method.

So I did my research a long time ago and at the time decided the double boiler method was best combination of simple and fast.  

Here is what I do.  Chop up 3.5-7+g trees really fine (started with chef's knife, have moved on to coffee grinder).  Add this to two sticks of butter in a metal bowl.  Set the metal bowl in top of a pan with boiling water.  Let this go for about 1-1.5 hours, stirring every ten minutes.  Strain (or not if you want stinky but more potent), then make brownies like normal, though I substitute both oil and water for the butter.

Anyways, my question is this method out of favor?  The mixing it with water method seems popular now, but I wouldn't have the patience to wait overnight for that.  I can see the simmer method work, but you'd have to be very diligent to not burn the butter.

IMO the double boiler method hits the sweet spot between the safe of the water method and the speed of the simmer method.

Thoughts?

- Salt/Pepper
- Other spices (I like garlic powder)
- Siracha (optional)
- 1tsp or so of AVB

Heat 1tsp oil in nonstick pan. Add AVB, stir a bit. As soon as the oil warms up add your spinach. Sprinkle salt/pepper/garlic powder on the spinach. Toss spinach in the hot oil until the spinach starts to wilt. Add a few squirts of siracha, toss spinach. Put spinach on your serving plate (or bowl). Add a bit more oil (enough to cook the eggs). Cook the eggs until the whites aren't runny and the yolk has started to setup again (i.e. standard over easy eggs). Put eggs on top of spinach.

1. decarboxylate in your oven at 225-250 F for 15-20 minutes.
2. Add decarbed weed to room temperature food (such as yogurt) and eat! Or, simply eat the weed!

Why wouldn't this method work?

I can eat AVB straight and get a nice psychoactive effect, so why can't you decarb fresh bud and eat it?


OTHER QUESTIONS

Under what circumstances do you need to add fat to marijuana to make it orally psychoactive?

Has anyone tried Miss Bliss's sidebar Tincture recipe (where you shake your tincture for 3-5 minutes ONLY) with decarbed weed, then taking it under the tongue? How did it work?

What's with all of the people saying that you cannot cook with alcohol tinctures.

I made a nice batch of cannabutter and it's pretty potent.  One of the things I like to do with my cannabutter is to drink it with a cup of coffee in the morning.

However, this is always a less then perfect way of getting the goodstuff into my system.  I simply put a dosage of butter (think about 1/2 a teaspoon, maybe a little less) into my hot cup of coffee and stir it around until it's melted. Then I add milk (no sugar).  The butter always settles right on the top of the cup, obviously because of the properties of matter density and oil/water separating.

So my question:  Does anyone have a better way of doing this? Is there a process I could use that might bind the butter and the milk together so that my coffee has a more consistent flavor? I want the butter to be evenly distributed throughout my drink, and not just settled on top where it hits me in the face during my first couple sips.

Another question: Is there some way to get most of the THC out of a lot of plant matter? I'm thinking of extra stems / leaves or AVB. In the past I have just used lots of butter (a few sticks) along with a ton of plant matter and then ended up with something mild.

1 scoop or half portion protein powder to flavor and amp nutrition
2 cups fresh brewed coffee
 
Blender
Shot glass
small pan with inch of water for shot glass
Ice

Put ground bud .5 gram into shot glass with Two tbls virgin Coconut oil, and place in a small sauce pan with about an inch of water. Bring to a rolling boil for 5 minutes.

While oil is heating make 2 cups of coffee.

Take your blender (I use a nutrabullet) put in  half scoop of protien powder ( and half tab of organic unsalted grass fed butter if you like a smooth texture and bit of froth). set aside.

Take the shot of cannabis oil (wear a glove or use good tongs) and pour it into the blender and pour the still hot coffee over the shot glass and then blend all contents.

Blend in a bit of ice to cool it and drink away.

What do you think?  how could i improve on this?

Found it doing historical research. 

From ""The Hashish Cookbook"" Ira Cohen (as Panama Rose) Gnaoua Press 1966 

Place a half a cup or so of clean kif in a dry, heavy iron skillet over a slow fire. Toast to a golden brown, turning constantly with a knife so it doesn’t burn.  Pound the kif to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle: Add:

1 cup finely chopped dates
½ cup raisins
½ cup each ground almonds and walnuts
1 cup chopped figs
1 tsp. freshly ground ginger
1 tsp. cinnamon
1 whole grated nutmeg
1 Tsb. ground anise seed
½ cup honey

Mix all ingredients and cook together with about half a cup of water until the fruits have softened and blended together, then let the water evaporate. Melt 2 Tbs. butter in a skillet over a low flame. Add the mixture and stir for five minutes. Taste. If the majoon is not sweet enough add more honey and heat again. Let cool. Stir in ¼ cup orange flower water.  Store in an airtight container. A heaping Tbs. per person should be enough.  Serve with hot mint tea.

The next day, we melted the butter again to extract the plant matter. We used the butter in a brownie recipe.

(suggestions/help please),13,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1gyoa3/double_boiler_method_of_cannabutter/,"Ok to start off I have made Cannabutter a few times using a double boiler method.  A real double boiler method as in pan in the bottom filled with water (boiling) with another pan fit snug above it to make all the heat from the bottom go to the top.  I have then cooked the butter at a temperature of 250 +- 5 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 hours on the first attempt.  It came out good but not THAT strong as what i hear it can be.  The second time I have made cannabutter I used the double boiler method again and cooked it at 250 +-5 degrees Fahrenheit this time for a total of 10 hours.

The first time was a lot lower of a time due to the fact that it was the first time making some type of cannabutter and i wanted to make sure i had a good first batch so i didnt want to push it too far, that way i had at least a starting point.

The second method did come out a lot better but it still didnt seem strong enough.  For the first time i used 1/2 of weed with 2 bricks of butter and the second time i used stems (didnt weigh them out) and 1/2 of weed with 2 bricks of butter.  I did put the stems in the butter for an hour before adding the weed on the second time.

Both times the finished product (pot apple cinnamon bread from scratch and pot pumpkin bread from scratch) came out good and i was able to get the taste for the apple cinnamon bread the way i want but it didn't seem that strong.  The pumpkin bread came out bad because i didnt realize how weak the pumpkin flavor from a pumpkin is :/

ok so the suggestion/help section...

  Is butter the best lipid solvent or would an oil work better/worse? (if better which oil would you suggest that wont alter the overall flavor of the canna-lipid. 

  Using the link for the [boiling points and more in depth isolation](http://forum.grasscity.com/apprentice-tokers/1055642-scientific-brownie-boiling-points-oils.html) from the side bar i got to the [boiling points of the chemical compounds](http://www.stonerforums.com/threads/specific-boiling-point-and-role-of-cannabinoids.4853/) and saw that i am way off on the temperature for cooking, so i was wondering around what temperature you normally keep your butter at while making cannabutter. Based off the information on the second link that i referenced it seems that i could increase the temperature of my butter to around 305+-5 degrees Fahrenheit.  At this temperature though the butter will burn
&gt;Butter is used for sautéing and frying, although its milk solids brown and burn above 150 °C (250 °F)—a rather low temperature for most applications.  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter#Storage_and_cooking)

This is why I am trying to see if there would be a better solvent to use such as an oil which would allow me to have it go to a higher temperature because of the unsaturated lipids not being able to bunch up nicely like the saturated lipids such as is in butter.

Any other suggestions as to how i can make my cannabutter stronger using the double boiling method (i find it to be the safest method to keep the temperature in check and consistent) is much appreciated.  I have seen the other methods and i dont like them.

Also i am someone who understands chemistry and am a chemist in training (well in school for Chemistry) which is why i dont like the links on the side because I was looking for a method that would give temperatures with it and if my next batch (to be done sometime this week most likely) comes out well I will write up my process in a way that will help others.

Thanks for the help i know you guys will give.  :)  Also sorry for the wall of text but i figured it would be the best way to get help would be to explain everything i have done so that way you might be able to spot an error in either my method or my thinking.",,False,self,t5_2t3z8,False,,,True,t3_1gyoa3,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1gyoa3/double_boiler_method_of_cannabutter/,

My aim is to achieve a dosage that will help with severe pain (period pains, cramps, migraines ect) while not getting the user too high that it is noticeable to others.

Have not tested yet but will post test results later on today.

----------------------

My log so far; 

AVB Tincture

Required
* Glass Jar
* Thermos 
* 3 teaspoons AVB
* 2 shot glass vodka (Smirnoff 38% used would have used higher but didn't have any)

Placed ingredients into glass jar and shook
Placed jar into a thermos with boiling water half an inch below lid of jar
Left jar sealed in thermos for 8 hours
Removed jar from thermos and shook aggressively
Left jar in back of dark cupboard for 5 hours
Retrieved sample dropper labeled X1

---------------

I will then place the jar back into the thermos with boiling water as before and leave for 12 hours hopefully doing a water change at least once and then test this batch too.

Edit1: tested x1 and as I expected it did not work. I will leave the dropper lid off so it can evaporate and become more concentrated. Not expecting much from this one due to it not sitting longer.

I vape my AVB to a nice brown, no green but not black.

TL;DR How much avb should i mix with chocolate to get some not so regular users to a (6)? Should i heat mixture or is there no point.

So far, I have focused on testing lecithin effectiveness, having tested 4 small batches with outside participants - 2 with and 2 without soy lecithin (at 1:2 and 3:4 ratios of lecithin to oil). All batches were made with the same amount of trees, oil, and using this [recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1bkhsv/my_cannabis_oil_process_long_and_extensive_with/) with a few minor alterations. Tests have been done every 7 days and under similar circumstances and environments. I labeled the equal batches and have dispensed to testers blindly, so that only I know who is testing what. Each test, all participants are being influenced by different batches. I have not been partaking as I fear I would skew the results. Usually the following day I call them up and see they're thoughts.

I wanted to ask you guys on your thoughts on a couple of concerns I had. 

* Should I be offering the same batch each time I test? Since participants are testing together, and because of differing tolerance level, I fear that using the same batch per test could skewed results due to varying opinions. Additionally, these opinions may introduce potential placebo effects.

* Since this is a long-term study, I know that participants will not be able to do this every week for months. Should I shorten the length of the study or switch out participants, requiring a specific number of times to test (i.e. 3 weeks in a row, each tester trying one lecithin and one without, etc.)?

* In future batches I want to start playing with the decarb temperatures, and I plan to make two batches for each temperature (with and without the lecithin, with lecithin at the 3:4 ratio). OR should I make this a completely separate study?


Any help or thoughts would be appreciated. Additionally, if these tests/studies have been done before, I would greatly appreciate a link or two!

Hello folks! For a few weeks smoking is a no-go for me, so I have decided to dip my feet in the wildly exciting world of edible cannabis. Now, I am about the least talented of chefs, my greatest achievement being not-ruined hamburgers, and my most common ""dish"" a bowl of rice cereal. As such, I decided to take it slow, and start with the quintessential starting point for aspiring edibles connoisseurs: firecrackers. Unfortunately I've had a less than satisfactory experience.

The first time, my process was:

1. Prep: Slather two saltine crackers with a quarter centimeter of non-organic peanut butter each. 
2. Sprinkle/mix .4 evenly between them. 
3. Sandwich them both with an additional cracker each. 
4. Cover with aluminum foil (enough to wrap twice).
5. Preheat oven to 250°F.
6. Bake for ten minutes; let cool for one minute
7. Eat!

The crackers surprisingly didn't taste bad, but they *definitely* tasted like weed. Unfortunately, nothing ever happened. I stayed completely sober the rest of the day.

Figuring I probably just did it wrong, I tried again earlier today, with this procedure:

1. Prep: Slather two saltine crackers with a **half** centimeter of non-organic peanut butter each.
2. Sprinkle/mix **1.0** evenly between them.
3. Sandwich them both with an additional cracker each.
4. Cover with aluminum foil (**enough to wrap once completely**).
5. Preheat oven to **295**°F.
6. Bake for ten minutes; let cool for **eleven hours**.
7. Go to work. 

When I came home from work, I joined the trees IRC channel and asked whether this setup would get me any more luck, and was met with mostly positive response. Someone informed me that 10 minutes wasn't long enough, so I tossed the crackers (still in foil) back in for twenty minutes at **345**°F and let them cool for ten minutes, then ate them.

It's now been three hours and if I'm high at all, it's *maybe* a [1]. I feel tired, but it's also running into the early hours of the morning... Plus, the amount I put in would normally be enough to shoot me to a [6] or [7] if I smoked it, so I'd figure firecrackers would send me even higher than that. Since I'm not there it makes me kind of suspicious that the very small 'buzz' I do feel is just the placebo effect.

What did I do wrong? Have I wasted a gram and a half? If it matters, I am very lightweight, and the first time, I ate on an empty stomach; this time I ate about two hours after having a small lunch.

I have made lots of brownies, cakes, popcorn butter(not very good) etc but have not tried making CannaCaps due to one thing.

I can not figure out how to properly figure out the concentration of THC in the oil. Would a dose fit in one capsule? 

I have read(and used) BadKitty's guide for different things, but at the moment would like to use bud as opposed to hash. This might not make a difference but who knows. 

At the moment, i use 1/4 cup oil for 1/4 oz bud. I have found great success, and as far as I'm aware am not losing any to over saturation of the fat. In order to get this.


1 Size ""0"" capsule holds ~.7ml


With my current dosages/ratio, 1/4 Cup(60ml)= 14 doses = 4.3ml per dose.


4.3ml/.7ml =  ~6.1 Caps.


This is obviously a bit rediculous, and not practical for capsules. Since Badkitty gets a whole dose into her caps, does that mean that i am not fully saturating the oil with THC and could lower the ratio for both brownies and cannacaps?

My plan is to use this method [here](http://www.420magazine.com/forums/cannabis-edibles/37701-cannabutter-7-easy-steps.html)

I also do not own a vape, so I will be purchasing about a half of some decent nuggetry just for the purpose of cooking.  Not mind blowing, but pretty good stuff.  

Based on this recipe, I'll suppose I'll end up with about 2 sticks worth of butter.  

Its possible I may break it down to do a quarter and one stick, since I am a novice at this.  I'm a bit nervous, so it would be good to start slow.

The reason I'm baking is because I have a concert coming up, and I hate smoking in a crowd.  It freaks me out something fierce.  I'm thinking of making cookies or brownies.  Not sure which.

What I'm looking for are recommendations on what I should try.  I am a good chef normally, so I don't think I'll have a problem with any recipe assuming it's not super complicated.  

Also, I have very little experience in even eating edibles, so I can't help but wonder what kind of effect I can expect out of these.  (how many i need to eat to reach say a... 7) and how many the recipe will produce.   The concert will be a two day festival, so I'd like to have enough to keep me up along with a couple friends for the duration.

I'm trying to come up with a recipe for peanut butter cups/balls to give to my boyfriend for valentines day =)

I've never made edibles before so I'm going into this with no idea at all.

Anyway this is what I've come up with roughly:

1. Mix in a quarter cup of crushed graham crackers, 50grams of confectioner's sugar, 1/2 cup peanut butter

2. Melt 1/8 c butter in low heat and add ground up cannabis

3. Combine butter and PB mixture, roll them into balls.

4. Melt a bar of semi sweet chocolate, double boiler method.

5. Coat balls with melted chocolate.

6. Place on wax paper. Chill until it hardens.

expected yield is only about 4 balls because i don't know how long its shelf life is. I am not sure how long I could keep it in the fridge for, before cannabis loses effect/potency.

My questions are:

    
* How much cannabis should i use? Would 1 heaping teaspoon be enough?

* Should my butter be salted/unsalted? Will it matter?

* Will it be better to mix the cannabis with the butter or with the chocolate in a double boiler?

* Do I have correct ratio on ingredients?

* Exactly how long should I be cooking the weed for?

I really hope i will be doing it right, suggestions/comments/criticisms on my recipe would be highly encouraged and greatly appreciated.

I work out of town and only have weekends in town, I'll be making the butter with my girlfriend who also is busy with work on weekends... question is, can I start making butter (simmering for a couple hours or whatever) then put it away for some time (hours? overnight?) then heat it up and continue simmering later on?

Closely related question, I have seen websites &amp; guides suggest a simmering time anywhere from 3 hours to 24 hours... I assume the longer the simmer the more potent, but is there a point where it doesn't help anymore?

I have decided that I am going to try making cannaoil, which is more difficult to burn than butter and would be easier to work with. I am going to attempt two methods, each using 3/4 oz of mids which cost $20 each. I believe that using higher quality bud is not worth cooking, since I can mess up and lose lots of money, and as long as I match the amount of THC, any weed should work. I will attempt, smell-free, cold extraction and heat-applied extraction.

First, is it a good idea to clean my mids? THC is not water-soluble, so would it work if I boiled the weed and strained it about three times? Or would this make it lose potency somehow?

Next, I will decarb the cannabis by putting it in a ziploc bag and placing it in the oven at 220`F for 25 minutes, letting it cool for ten minutes afterwards. 

Now I will do cold extraction. I will grind up the weed, but not too finely, and dump it into a dark bottle (because light will make the solution lose potency). Afterwards, I will pour MCT oil into the bottle. Coconut oil works very well because it has 60% medium chain tryglycerides, but using 100% MCT oil should yield the best extraction. Also, you can't cold extract with coconut oil well because it is solid at room temperature, and a liquid solution will ensure the most contact. I will then leave this MCT/cannabis solution in the bottle for three days somewhere, shaking occasionally. Finally, I will strain the cannabis using a cheesecloth and see how potent the oil is.

The second method I will use is heat-applied extraction. I will mainly utilize EdibleOnly's recipe http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/1bkhsv/my_cannabis_oil_process_long_and_extensive_with/
with a few minor changes: I will use MCT oil in this recipe instead of coconut oil, and I will be doing the heating and cooling slightly differently. I'm going to put the solution in a mason jar and put that in a crockpot with water on ""low,"" and then I will wait for the jar to return to room temperature and freeze it accordingly. 

Any more suggestions or comments before I begin tomorrow night?

Recommended dosage: 1 oz shake (or 7-10 g bud)

Prep time: overnight + 20 mins

Cook time: 20 mins

Ingredients:

* 1 cup bourbon
* 1/2 can tomato paste (3 oz)
* 1/4 cup cider vinegar
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tsp soy sauce
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 onion, minced
* 1/2 tsp crushed mustard seed (can substitute Dijon mustard)
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
* Salt

----------------------------------------
1. Start by soaking your cannabis in the bourbon for at least 24 hours (longer is always better) in a cool, dark place.
2. After the soaking is complete, strain out the cannabis, and discard.
3. Combine ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
4. Bring the heat down a little, and let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes (or until it becomes the desired consistency), still stirring every so often.
5. Let it cool.  You may blend it for a smoother consistency if desired.  Bottle it up, LABEL IT (so people know what they're getting themselves into), and keep refrigerated.

I want to share my recipe too – maybe someone else will find use from my experimentation. I post it mostly because it is easy and I use metric measurements (the imperial system features a lot on Treedibles!) 

Decarboxylating makes me nervous (nothing like forgetting what you put in the oven!), so I decided to just vaporize with care, and use the AVB. Not black, not brown, just a light green/beige colour AVB. 

**So here is what I did, this ratio of oil/trees worked exceptionally well:**

9g AVB

1g Regular 

100g Coconut Oil

All ground up together in a Pyrex measuring cup, in the oven, at 120° Celsius

For 5 hours

(Do not burn the oil by making the oven too hot. The oil goes dark brown.  It will still get you high but it fucking stinks)

It smells like coconut oil and a bit of trees.

Press through a coffee or oil filter with a squeeze thing.

That’s it. When it solidifies, I just break off teaspoon chunks and eat it. A teaspoon works in two hours on an empty stomach.

Other facts: about 5 grams of the AVB  was a Sativa, and the other 5 a mix. I never felt tired!

To help him cope I suggested he tried smoking pot, at which point he revealed to me that he had tried it when he was a teenager but could not enjoy it as his chest became very tight and he had trouble breathing. He decided to try it again but his chest still bothered him. A month or two later i got a vaporizer and he then tried that and felt the same effect.

absolutely new to posting stuff in this subreddit, am totally new to world of ""hemp-cooking"". I ate a cookie once in 11th grade and never again since then... until i found this subreddit and the firecrackers receipe :-)

I tried it once now i have to say that i think it did not work. I brought together what i read in other receipes and tryed to prepare a cracker with nutella.

Sadly i could not actually feel an impact 

So i have 2 quick questions to improve my beginners-beginner-game:

1. I have a rather shady supply of hemp, it is usual quite dry when i get it... And the quality, lets say i am in no position to complain. How much of an difference does this fact make? I get a decent high with tobacco or damiana but i the idea of cooking with it is sooo much more appealing in general :D

2. I heated to oven @120°C (~250°F) for 30 mins... The nutella was melted, but just a little. I remember that i read somewhere that it has to be actually kinda dry... Should i heat it more @150°C or sth?

When I was in college I made canna-oil by adding about 14 grams of low quality herb to the amount of oil called for in two batches of brownies.  I let it simmer on very low heat for about an hour while watching very closely(turned down the heat the minute we saw a boil bubble).  After that we strained it through 3 or 4 different coffee filters, added it to the batter and baked.  Now the results were AMAZING.  Unfortunately two light weights in the group actually passed out after eating them and were having a really bad time (low blood sugar and low tolerance are not a good combo with brownies).  

My question now that I can no longer cook like that because of the apartment I am in, is can I use a crock pot like a double boiler? I am interested in making butter this time.  I have a crock pot that I can not put weed directly in because it is the crock pot my wife and I use to cook frequently in.(she cant enjoy our lovely THC due to work)  My question is can I make cannabutter by using half a pound of butter and about 8-10 grams of moderate herb in a mason jar and place the mason jar sealed in the crock pot with water?  If I left it like that for 2-3 hours would that work?

Basically the method would be add water to crock pot, put on low setting (read that its about 200 degrees so the water will come close to boiling but not full boil).  Then add herb/butter to mason jar and seal.  Place sealed mason jar in crock pot and let sit in there for 2-3 hours extracting the THC like a double boiler.  Strain melted butter to remove pieces of herb and let harden.  Enjoy butter on all things!

The first time I followed the recipe to a T, second time around I used more AVB (8 grams) and 3 tablespoons of oil (just enough to cover the AVB).

So I followed the post here by [loonybinjones](http://i.imgur.com/TnVHR.jpg), with some slight alterations.

I've never made hard candy before, but I'm familiar with caramel, toffee and other sugar creations so this his tutorial was really pretty easy to follow. 

First, I didn't have access to quite the same stuff he had, but close enough.

I used about 7 g of ABV, instead of fresh bud. 
I used Golden Grain instead of Everclear (Coke/Pepsi difference)
I couldn't find the flavorings he used so I just used a flavor extract(alcohol based, mine was artificial cherry).
I went the cheap route and got the plastic candy molds, they work, but not near as well as silicon, plus they were harder to pour.
I didn't have tea bags or cheese cloth, so I used a few coffee filters.
I bought a more expensive thermometer that's mounted on metal and clips to the side of the pan. This was a major hassle, as it only clips on a big pot, and while you can just stand it in the middle of the pan, the thermometer is mounted to high. This is a fairly small recipe, and towards the end the thermometer wasn't always fully submerged. I've cooked sugar down before so I recognized the stages. 

The only thing I think, is the second batch I made, I got a new pan, and was getting a more accurate temperature reading. When it got to 300 I added the liquid in 3 batches,(On/Off heat) and when that was done, It was almost too thick to work with, even after heating. I think that you should add the liquid around 275 in batches, then work up to 300, that would prevent so much seizing up at the end, and make sure all the alcohol is gone. 

That being said, my first batch without the tincture was awesome. They tasted great and the texture was just right.

The second one, is OK. I simmer my alcohol mix for 45 minutes, and I don't think it was enough. There is still a slight alcohol twang. You don't know what it us really unless your told. The ABV is also very noticeable. I would not recommend ABV in candy, it just to strong, go with cakes or extracts.

The strength? Ehh, Well I smoked a bowl, and had one trench a couple hours before injestion. I ate bout 2(1 whole one and some scraps). I took a shower for work, and there was a definite body high when I got out. Ate another on the way to work(it was dead tonight, and my last night), and I was good all night[6](high tolerance). Very hungry(which is OK, I work in kitchens), great mood, bouncy and pretty fun.

Well, that's just my take on this recipe. I wanted to help fill in some holes, or answer some questions that didn't get answered in the first post. Thanks a lot to loonybinjones for this awesome recipe.

Sidenote: For easier clean up(all the syrup not in molds, will turn to candy, on EVERYTHING). Take all your tools and put them in the put, fill with water to the near top and simmer/boil for a little while, bout 5, 10 minutes. It will soften all the candy.

I did some research today and found two people who say you have to heat the oil to 300°F+ to achieve the best results.

[**rsjrv99** over at Cannabis.com](http://boards.cannabis.com/recipes/190691-fed-up-edibles-not-working.html) seems to have really experimented until the best recipe was really nailed down. rsjrv99 had the same problem that I do until it was fixed with this recipe. The posted solution is towards the bottom of the first page. Worth reading the replies and taking a look at a chart **mc1548** links to.

Also [Miss Bliss](http://www.blissedibles.com/blog/cooking-cannabis-oil) suggests heating the oil to 300°F  and then taking off the heat immediately. 

Considering active ingredients do not vaporize until 365°F no one should worry, or add any unnecessary steps to trap the vapor in.

Stir gently for a good 15 minutes and watch your glassware ooze tasty weed oil into your concoction. use tongs and periodically remove your glassware for inspection. when it's sufficiently clean, remove glassware, rinse under HOT water -don't wanna crack the glass-  and leave it on something to cool. Next, pour your milk out into a coffee mug or two and add chocolate syrup. this can be cut with cold milk and served cold, though I prefer warm.

I have been making special brownies for years, with no problem. I used to make the oil in a crock pot, until my crockpot broke. I recently got a new one and tried to use it to make brownies. Everything seemed to go fine, the oil looked and smelled like it always does, but the brownies had no effect. I had only used my stems and abv so i thought ""oh well I  will try again, I just didnt add enough stuff.""

So I tried again the next day. This time, my friend and I nuked these brownies. we had nice regs/ mids (good looking bud) and we ground it up and tosssed it in. My guess is that there would have been at least 1/2 g per brownie. Made the oil in the crockpot and again in the crockpot for about 8 hours, the brownies were non potent. no effect :( 

So Then I said ""it must be the crockpot"" (even though the crockpot only reaches about 190 degrees F) so i tried using the stove to make the oil, keeping the oil to a low simmer (about 200 degrees F). I reused the weed from my second attempt, thinking maybe the THC hadnt been released using the crockpot. I also added about 2 Gs of good bud and ALL my kief, about a g. And guess what?

my brownies don't fucking work.

I have made brownies successfully many times but I just failed for reasons I can't figure out, 3 times in a row. Anyone have any ideas as to what went wrong?

I owe some friends money plus have a bunch of useless brownies that only taste like they will get you high.

How to make special oil, or, how vegan ents make edibles.",2,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/treedibles/comments/njze6/typed_this_up_for_rasktrees_how_to_make_special/,"I used to be a vegan ent living in a house full of vegan ents, so I have vegan ""special"" cooking down, man. Most of the vegan butters have too low of a fat content to absorb the THC very well, so the best bet is to use cooking oil.

1. Grind up your bud and spread it over the bottom of a smallish, shallow pan.

2. Cover the bud with your favorite cooking oil (I liked olive or peanut). You don't need a lot; just enough to completely cover the bud. 

3. Here's the crucial part: you want to get the oil hot enough to reach a LOW simmer (not boil), but not so hot that ANY smoke or steam rises. Any smoke rising will most likely be lost THC. Our stove went from 1-10, and I found that it worked best on about 4, though you'll have to see what your own stove does. The trick is to try and get it to stay RIGHT at the point where little bubbles begin to rise without it boiling.

4. Let simmer like that for a couple hours, stirring occasionally. You can do this for as long as you want, but I found two hours to work great.

5. AFTER LETTING IT COOL (found that out the hard way lol), strain out the weed, preferably with a cheese cloth. Coffee filters work in a pinch, but tend to absorb a little bit of the oil.

6. Mix that weedy green oil into any recipe requiring cooking oil. You can find some vegan brownie/muffin mixes that only require oil and water; no eggs. Another way to go is use an egg replacement: one banana and 1/4 cup of applesauce both equal one egg, or you can get a [store bought option.](http://www.ener-g.com/egg-replacer.html)

My friend taught me this before I left for college where cooking is scarce and ingredients even more so.

Ingredients:
1 box cake mix (Your choice of flavor)
1 box instant pudding mix (Once again, any flavor)
1 stick of butter
1 ~ 2 cups of milk

That's it! 4 items! Two can be stored at any temperature for any length of time. The Cake mix acts as flour for the cookies, while the pudding mix is everything else you'll need solid wise. I suggest combining tasty flavors like chocolate and strawberry, or Vanilla and fun-fetty. You can also go crazy with whatever you find.

Process:
Set oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Melt butter.
Mix cake mix and pudding mix in a bowl.
Add butter and stir.
Add milk until mixture is of a batter consistency and not powder or runny. It will be VERY thick at this point that is perfect.
Put about a tablespoon amounts on cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 minutes on a lower rack, then another 10 on an upper rack.
Let cool and enjoy!

It takes some practice to figure out the timing and temp for the cookies as my original recipe had neither and I still mess around. 15 minutes on a single cooking rack should be long enough, just make sure you check your baking so they don't burn. Great for birthdays and giving to friends!
