**Edit**: Wow, did not expect this thread to blow up so much. AskMen/AskWomen has sort of turned into, ""How do I get this girl/guy to like me...?"" sort of thread.


Thank you guys so much for your stories. In case you didn't notice (many have not), I am a girl. Recently I've had close male friends of mine confide to me, even though I know they have closer friends than me and it just really made me think that something with our gender roles must be screwed up. Even if they do talk about it, it's always very straight, to the point, and sometimes a bit awkward with them expressing themselves.


I am very glad I made this thread if for no other reason for men to be able to express themselves and what they are going through and to open people's eyes to this phenomena. I have a decent handful female friends who think it's a turn off if a *male* shares his emotions and I think that that gender expectation has got to change.


Thank you guys for opening my eyes even more to a this hidden problem. If anyone would like to PM me, I would be more than happy to talk or let you rant or anything.

I disagree.",1299,275,743,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1dorzq/girl_tried_to_play_me_i_rejected_her_my_roommate/,"Basically, met this girl at a bar. We hit it off, I had to leave, we exchanged numbers and that was that. I get a text out of the blue a few days ago from her so we get chatting and set up a date for dinner last night. This is when I specifically said that due to my belief, we should split the bill. I stated that at this point we were two strangers and this wasn't a romantic date. She completely agreed, multiple times, that she was fine with it and we'd split the bill. 

Date night rolls around, we meet up a few blocks away from the restaurant and decide to get a cab. I've been the victim of the ""I left my purse at home/in the car"" line before, so I asked her if she had everything before we got in and she said she did. The meter comes to $8, so I asked her since I only had a $5 if she wouldn't mind paying the other $3. She agreed and did so by card. So we're in the restaurant now and she is constantly ordering the most expensive item. I mean constantly. When asked what to drink, she orders the most expensive bottle of white, saying ""I've never tried this one before! and giggling."" I'm cool, we're splitting the cheque. No issue. She orders the most expensive starter, followed by the most expensive main (as well as a glass of red to compliment the meat) and finally a dessert. 

The total comes to around $180. My food and half of the bottle of wine came to around $50, while hers came to $130. But you know, that's cool. I'm gonna stick by my word. I put down $100, more than half but that's all fine with me. She doesn't look at it or anything. After about 10 minutes of her obviously avoiding the subject, she asks, ""uh, I think the bill was a bit more than 100."" I smirk, tell her that we've agreed to split it, at which point she asks me if I was ""actually serious"" before saying ""I don't have my purse on me anyway."" I see what's happened. I smile at her, tell her I apologise for bringing it up, and say that I've left my card in my coat so I'll go over to get it. I pick up the $100 from the table. I walk over, grab my coat, and tell the waiter that I've pulled over that I need to leave and would like to pay for my half of the bill for the table I was at, and pay for the $90 half of the bill. I leave the restaurant, walk the other way to avoid her seeing me from the window, and get a cab back home. 

This is followed by multiple texts and missed calls from her calling me a jackass, I'm ""everything wrong with men nowadays,"" and that she'd ""file a police report if she ever saw me again,"" which was greatly juxtaposed with her texts agreeing to split the bill just a few texts up.

My roommate called me an asshole because I left her there, but I told him that she'd payed for the $3 in the cab anyway so it couldn't be as if she had no money whatsoever. Idk, I just wanted another opinion on this. 

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect this kind of response. I showed my roommate this and we both couldn't believe the amount of different people's perspectives that we garnered. My roommate does see my side of the argument but still sticks by his, and I'm fine with that. I still think I did the right thing.

1375133375.0,755,self.AskMen,1jaysp,"So my girlfriend has been using a dildo molded from her ex-boyfriend's penis, and freaked out when I confronted her about it. Am I in the wrong?",991,236,730,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jaysp/so_my_girlfriend_has_been_using_a_dildo_molded/,"I've been with my [23f] girlfriend for almost a year now.  I knew her a little bit before we started dating and hooked up with her pretty soon after she became single.

We have a pretty good sex life.  She wants it almost as much as I do and usually our foreplay includes toys, and sometimes we use them while fucking too.  Her favorite toy as long as I knew her had been this particular dildo that she'd always had as long as we'd been together.  I didn't really think much of it.  Sometimes when things were getting hot and heavy she'd hand me the toy and have me thrust it inside of her while I attended to other parts of her body, as this was the best way to make her orgasm.  At the time I really thought nothing of it as I know a lot of girls can't cum from PIV.

Full disclosure I had always known my gf kept in touch with some of her ex boyfriends that she was still on good terms with and had been friends before and after their relationship ended.  This one guy Tom I knew after hanging out with him once or twice when we were all drinking together, and since she never spent any one on one time with him really I had no problem at all with them getting in touch as I still occasionally talked with girls I dated in college for instance.

One day recently though I saw on her facebook page that she had been tagged in a photo with tom from another mutual friend in some photo from when they were all together + friends from two years ago.  I was reading through the comments when the mutual friend said something along the lines of ""omg u guys were so cute together!!1 :)"".    Well Tom replied to it with ""lol haha well at least [my gf's name] still has something to remember me by ;)"".  I thought of course at the time they were just talking about the photo, but when I checked again a few hours later, the comments were gone, all of them, which weirded me out.  I asked my GF what Tom had been talking about, about what he meant with the something to remember me by comment.  She didn't know what I was talking about at first but then told me about the dildo.  Apparently, when she and Tom were still together, they had the idea together to make a mold of his cock using one of those dildo molding kits so that my GF would have something to use when she went to study abroad for the semester.  And the dildo was the very same favorite one that we used during our foreplay.  I'll admit i freaked the fuck out at the time and told her to get rid of it that instant, that I can't believe she wanted to be fucked using Tom's cock while we were having sex.  She yelled back at me telling me that I was acting like a jealous child and that it was just a dildo in her collection and that i was trying to control her.  So yeah that convo didn't end well and we kinda cooled off a bit separately.

We had sex since the argument a few days later though we hadn't used the toy.  When she was in the bathroom I looked at it again though and started feeling mad all over again.  I never really thought about it before but it is bigger and thicker than I am so to speak which of course brought some feelings of inadequacy.  I talked to her about it again bringing it up and told her how I felt about it, that I couldn't help feel that in my mind it was like she was preferring tom's cock to mine.  She told me it was just plastic to her and that the only reason she had it was because like I mentioned earlier she has a really hard cumming from anything else but somehow the shape of the dildo was the best thing at making her cum compared to any other toy.  She said of course my oral skills are even better but that when she is by herself pretty much the only way is using that dildo and not to take it personally, that it's nothing about Tom and all about giving herself the best chance of cumming as possible.  I didn't really want to start another fight so I just kind of kept my mouth shut about it.

Still, inside i'm still pretty pissed.  Am I just acting overly jealous like she said though?  I don't want to come off like those girlfriend's who won't even let their guy watch porn because i've been in one of those relationships and I totally get the control angle.  But goddamn it makes me feel like shit knowing that sometimes when she's by herself she is using that dildo to get herself off.  Like, is she thinking of me, or Tom?  I know she said she thinks of me and what can I say, that she's lying?  Ugh.  So what should I do cause I don't want to start resenting her for it but I don't want to start another fight.

I'm just waiting for the plumber now -  on my porch because it's not good inside. Thanks /r/askmen I know this probably isn't the usual topic you gentlemen get around here so thanks for bearing with me. &lt;3

**plumber is here** He just shook his head and is going to try and fix it from the roof? Anyways. ughhh fuck. Should I offer this guy a sandwich? Or something to drink? I told him about the bathtub backing up :/

**welp If it makes you people happy** *I just got lectured for 5 minutes* about how important it is to own a plunger and why I should buy one as soon as he leaves. I asked him if it was bad. He just stared at me and said this is the worst thing he's had all day. But he looked away when he said he's seen worse :( 

**okay the plumber left** and it flushed!!! Yayyyy all the nastiness gone :) He kind of scolded me about trying to snake it myself and said that I was doing it completely wrong? I told him thanks a bunch, made him a glass of water and he said that he would give me a break on the price because he cleared it so fast. So $125 later and my bathroom doesn't reek of horrid shit anymore and now I'm going to move on to clean.

So my ex-fiancé  came back to his house unexpectedly about two hours ago. Upon seeing me, he started apologizing profusely and begged me to hear him out. I told him I didn't want to hear it and that I wanted out but he was adamant, so I listened.

I really wish I didn't. Turns out, he cheated on me three times two months ago with his best friend while I was away visiting my sick father. His reason for cheating was that he knew I was ""the one"" but he wanted to play the field because he felt like he missed out on a lot of women. According to him, after cheating on me, he had a moment of clarity that he really did want to be with me and that sex with others wasn't that great (so apparently you need to have sex three times with the same girl before you can reach that conclusion -_-).

So after listening to this, I felt like my heart had been ripped out and that someone punched me in the gut. But I was still confused. If I was ""the one"", why did he dump me last night for her?

She's pregnant. After hearing that, I was dumbfounded. My ex found out when she called him with her mental breakdown.

So, there you have it. After hearing everything, I calmly asked him if he used protection and he said ""no because she said she was on the pill"". Great. Thats fucking wonderful. NOW I have to go get myself tested. 

I was shaking with fury. I was so angry with him I didn't even cry. I'm still shaking right now as I type this. I pretty much told him off and then told him that I wish him the best of luck with his new family. 

In a way, I'm relieved. Now I can just move on with my life. I don't need to deal with that mess. His best friend is keeping the baby so I think it would be best for everyone: me, his baby and his best friend, if I just stepped out of their lives for good. I don't need such a dishonest selfish cheating fiancé. 

I also wanted to thank you guys. Every single one of you that took the time to read what I wrote, then replied and kept me sane. I love this subreddit because a lot of people here have a cool-headed rational way of thinking and you guys are awesome.

So, for the common questions:

1) I like a guy, I think he likes me. What should I do?

A) Fucking tell him.  Don't beat around the bush either.  We guys suck at taking hints and we can rationalize almost anything to mean the exact opposite of what you say.  If you like a guy, the correct answer is to tell him ""I like you, and I would be interested in going on a date with you.  Do you want to go out?""  

""Date"" is important here.  Make sure he knows it is a date.  

When in doubt, fucking tell him.  

Quasi-edit 1: 

Do guys like girls who make the first move/ask the guy out?

Yes.  It takes the pressure off of us, we feel flattered, and we possibly get a date or free drink out of it.  Just do it.  

In my experience, the guys who are against it usually have low self-esteem and feel like the **""MAN""** must make the first move.  Not true for most of us.  I prefer when the girl makes the first move.  It is easier on me, and anything that makes my life easier is A-OK in my book.  

2) How do I flirt with guys?

A) Again, we are not great with hints.  We are generally very receptive to flirting though.  Flirting guide:
(i) Talk to him

(ii) Laugh at his stupid jokes.  (We are guys, stupid jokes are in our DNA)

(iii) Initiate physical contact.  A touch on the arm goes A LONG way.  

(iv) Pretty much done.  Show interest through positive communication, and hope for reciprocation.  Should it not come...

(v) Be blatant.  Guys miss a lot of hints.  Say what you mean, and be obvious about it.  

3) Do any guys like X type of girl?

A) Yes... there is always somebody who like a certain type of girl... Don't worry about it.

4) Being friends with guys?

A) Most guys are not initially looking to be friends with a girl.  Keep your intentions clear without being insulting.  If you feel friendzoned, lady up and get out.  Be transparent, don't be overly eager, don't lead him on.  Be friends with him, it is possible.

5)  I like this girl. Now what?

A) Ask her out...

5) But what if

A)No, ask her out

5)How?

A) Hey, (girl), I was wondering if you would like to grab coffee with me on (date/time).  I'd really like to get to know you better.

That was bad, but the point is, you don't have to be Shakespeare or Keates.  Just ask her out!

6) Friendzone!

A)Go away


TL;DR
Relationships are not that hard... Guys are generally easy.  We don't pick up on hints well.  Be obvious.

Girls are also easy, if you like them, ask them out.  On a date.  Make it clear that you want a date (this goes for both sexes).  

This is not rocket science.  Be kind, clear, and concise.  The rest will generally follow.  


EDIT: Respect yourself as much, or more than you respect the other person.  Don't let them push you around, don't let them use you, don't be afraid to walk away.  


EDIT 2: Billy Joel was nice enough to remind me that I missed a few things.  

Blow jobs? 

Yes.  We like those.  How do you do them? Put your mouth on my penis.  DON'T BITE DOWN!!!! 

As much as I may say that you are the most important thing in my life, the truth is CFCFR Jr. is more important.  Be careful with the teeth.  A little can go a long way.  Don't overuse them.  Also, mix things up.  If you really want to impress us, be creative.  

Do I facebook stalk my exes? 

Abso-fucking-lutely.  Why? Because we are masochistic assholes, and we like to suffer.  But in all seriousness, we all do it.  We don't like to admit it.  As far as frequency is concerned: as little as possible, but realistically a couple of times per day at first with an exponential decrease as time goes by.  


Because it feels relevant: 

Getting over a girl (or guy, we don't judge here);  the best way to get over someone, in my experience is to learn about yourself.  Take some time alone, realize why you are so fucking awesome and why she (or he) is missing the fuck out.  Additionally, spend time with friends.  Be careful with the alcohol, but realize the healing properties of straight whiskey or tequila when used responsibly.  Keep busy, pick up a hobby, and love yourself (This does not mean masturbate, but yeah, fucking masturbate a lot too).  


Edit 3: Good catch by the Grand Poobah: I'm a virgin, now what?

Don't fucking worry about it.  The people who mind don't matter, and the people who matter don't mind (thank you Dr. Seuss!).  

Realistically, it could be a problem, and admittedly I would not go for a casual hookup with a girl if I knew she were a virgin.  That said, as far as relationships go, don't worry about it.  We don't usually care.  ",,False,,t5_2s30g,1359449435.0,,,True,t3_17hhan,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/17hhan/the_answers_to_most_of_the_questions_on_this/,

",823,182,448,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/17y08n/im_sexistafraid_of_men_and_i_need_help_please/,"WARNING: I am going to be brutally, brutally honest about my fears. Please understand that I *know* most men are not like this. I know that this fear is silly and irrational. I know this all. I'm going to try to explain how I feel and I can only hope that I get helpful responses. I've wanted to ask for help from you guys for awhile now because I was afraid I wasn't going to get any helpful responses. I figured since this is a throwaway it's worth a try. 

All my life I have been told by my dad that men are pigs. He told me over and over again that if a boy is being nice to you he's trying to get in your pants. He told me to stay away from men and that they only do things for sex. He told me countless stories about how his friends treat women like shit and that men are terrible beings. He'd go on about how men think with their dicks. He scared me. Of course, I wasn't afraid of my own father or brothers. I love all the men in my family. They're great people, but what my Dad taught me stuck with me till this day. I still can't get all his lectures out of my head. I think he was just trying to be protective.. but it scared me. 

I've been afraid of men for years. This fear is so stupid, I know all men aren't creeps. I know most men are good people, but for some reason I'm *so* afraid of men.

I'm afraid of their strength the most. Any man would be able to take me and do as he wishes. I'm a very, very small girl. It would be incredibly easy for him to rape me. There's an entire subreddit dedicated to rapists. The fact that /r/rapingwomen is a subreddit scares me. 

If I am alone in a room with a man, I will go through scenarios in my head of what I would do if he tried to rape me. I don't assume all men are rapists, but I do accept possibilities and I am always on defensive mode about it. 

I'm afraid of men's sexual drives. Most pedophiles are men. Most rapists are men. I'm afraid of these facts. Most men that get raped, are raped by other men. 

I hear countless stories from females about their rape experiences, how a guy groped them, how they've been drugged for sex, molested by their brother, raped by their father, etc. 

I'm afraid of how men treat women. Sexism on reddit is very obvious, and before reddit I honestly thought most men weren't sexist. Reddit speaks in upvotes, and it's not irregular to see sexism on the front page. It makes me lose hope. I don't want to believe that men are like this, and I fucking hate seeing things like that on the front page, because it just confirms my fears/sexism. 

There are so many creep posts made on reddit about men jacking off into their sisters shoes and creepy perverted stuff like that. I'm afraid of this. 

Please help me. I want to get over this. I don't want to be a sexist bitch but for some reason I have this terrible fucking view of men and it's making me feel terrible. 

I know this is going to get downvoted a lot, but even one helpful post could change/help me. I really need this. I 100% do not want to think this way. It's ruining my relationships with men in my life and I just want to stop living in fear. I want to be able to breathe again. 

**EDIT: I did not expect so many kind, sincere responses in such a short amount of time. You guys are amazing and proving that my views/fears are silly. I feel a lot better already.**

**EDIT 2: I'm absolutely blown away by all this support. I can't begin to explain how much this has helped. I've read every comment, and since I can't reply to every single one I just want to say Thank You! I think I will begin to seek therapy. Making this thread and reading these responses just proved that not all men are like that. I wish all of you the best**

**FINAL EDIT: Alright guys, I'm hopping off of this throwaway for good. I'm leaving with a much better perspective and understanding. I will be seeing a therapist. This felt so good to get off my chest, and the amount of supportive and helpful comments was amazing! I love you all! Goodnight :)**

Er... what? I love my girlfriend; I've been with her for almost 6 years, live with her and she's definitely the girl I'm going to marry. But you know what? Her boobs are kinda small and I find big boobs attractive, and her nipples are a quite big and puffy and I prefer smaller nipples. So fucking what? I still absolutely adore her, no one can be perfect; I'm certainly not. I bet she'd find me more attractive if I had a little more hair on my head and more muscles but that doesn't make her a bad person and I'm not going to scold her for having different tastes, and I certainly don't feel like I'm a terrible person for having my own either.

But if I ever came out in one of these topics and said 'actually, I prefer light, pink nipples compared to dark ones' everyone jumps down my throat and calls me an ass hole. It's like we have to lie to women and frankly I find it quite demeaning towards them. They're people too, y'know, and I'm sure they can handle the fact that not everybody will find them perfect; they don't need to be shielded from this, it's natural.

And what's even worse, is when guys come out with 'we're going to be so happy that we're seeing you naked that we won't even notice your _____', as if we're all a bunch of sex starved idiots who are incapable of making opinions as soon as the prospect of sex is dangled in front of us. Fuck that, when I used to sleep around I very much did notice the details on my partners body. Some times I'd be really attracted to them, sometimes I wouldn't; it was never the end of the world.

His creepy levels have been increasing over the years.  

It started with simple stuff, one night around 4am after a party he was talking to me and a girl (I was hooking up with in front of him)...I got up from the makeout and he mentions that he might still have a chance with her and its why he hasn't left my living room.

He plays a ""fake drunk"" sometimes.  We run out of alcohol at 11pm and he gets more and more drunk by early morning.

A girl talked to him for 5 minutes, later to fall asleep in my little brother's room.  She locked the door because he was being creepy.  He paced around the hallway for over 2 hours.

He spends countless hours of early morning on facebook, desperately messaging any girl he has ever crossed paths with asking them out or on casual hangouts.  These messages are sent sober after the hours of 2am.

He does have some type of anxiety problem nowadays.  I don't know if lack of sex caused it.  Every conversation is a way for him to reassure me and others he isn't gay...last night the question was if you made 1million per year, would you sit courtside at game 7 of Spurs / Heat for $50,000....his answer was i'd rather spend $50,000 on fucking 100 of the hottest supermodels.

So do i hire a prostitute?  I'm slowly watching him get worse and worse.  He is a decade away from either pedophile or rapist or super isolated creepy.  


edit:  Just to clarify:


1.  this isn't highschool level mindset, virginity isn't the cause of all weirdness.  Our friend group actually has a couple virgins over the age of 25 and they are perfectly normal.  

2.  He is averagely attractive (according to my GF and other girls who know him)

3.  He is very social, almost too social.  Its like he is socially aggressive, the more you get to know him the more weird you believe him to be.  His chances with a girl diminish every minute he talks to them.

4.  He has had opportunities to sleep with women, however he wants that ""first love"" ""girlfriend"" experience and I believe its too late in life for a ""high-school"" sweetheart.  We find he targets younger girls or virgins.  I assume its because they would have a similar if not identical amount of sexual experience.  This is why I suggest he is getting towards that pedophile line, he has checked out very very young girls in public.  Like ""damn look at that chick""......which i respond ""dude, she looks 14 maybe""  If we went the prostitute route, it would have to be elaborate....like wanna-be-actress meets hooker kinda of girl.  She would literally have to play him through the first couple days if not weeks.

5.  Gay?  Very interesting but as a close friend I highly doubt it.  Back in high school we used his computer without his permission.  Tons of porn, normal porn with the girl as the focus.  Just from my social interactions with him, gay doesn't seem to be it.  He has a seemingly true desire to find someone female.


More odd examples:

We both met this girl (my now current girlfriend) at a party, he couldn't find her on facebook, but found her sister who is 15 and in highschool.  Sends he casual chat IMs trying to obtain info on her older sister's identity.  He wasn't trying to date a 15 yr old, but still messaged her at 3am to obtain info. on her older sister.

Group of us went to the beach.  One of our female friends put her luggage in a bedroom (sleeping space was tight) but we figured all the girls in 2 rooms, boys in 1 room and on couches....sex would occur where-ever if need be.  My creeper friend puts his luggage in the one room that had a female's luggage in it.   She makes the joke ""ohh I guess we are sleeping together tonight.""  Clearly a joking comment made early in the day when we arrived.  Fast forward 12-15 hours, its 2am we are all drunk.  Female goes to bed and creeper asks in a complete serious tone ""should I get ready?""  after she clarified she was joking earlier he responds with ""ohh sorry I thought we we going to sleep together or at least share the bed.""  It remained an issure, long after female was in bed and only a few of us were awake smoking cigs outside.  He made comments like ""Whats her problem, where am I suppose to sleep tonight?""  Claiming the couch or any other surface was too problematic for his back, insinuating the only acceptable sleeping quarters we in bed with female. 

We went to a college party where he knew everyone.  Since there we no female strangers he just paced the living room for hours waiting for it to be over.  Claiming all the girls we his friends (he had met them all already) and the guys he sees all the time.  This was a bangin like 50 person party during NFL playoffs.  We had food and plenty of beer/pot.  He didn't indulge in any of it.  He literally paced a 15 foot line for hours.

So, how exactly am I supposed to use a urinal quickly and efficiently? I've just always used toilets because I didn't really get how I was supposed to handle my privates when using a urinal. I understand that my underwear has two openings that overlap and somehow I'm supposed to reach in there, wiggle my penis through the holes and take a piss. The part that I get messed up at once I'm done; I have no idea how to get my penis back into my underwear quickly. I end up struggling with it, and it usually ends up stuck in between the two overlapping pieces of cloth which is really uncomfortable. At this point I end up unbuttoning my pants and reaching down and pulling it back inside. 

This is insanely embarrassing to type out.

I figured I'd also invite anyone else in this thread to ask any embarrassing questions they've been afraid to bring up that are seemingly common knowledge.

Like it consumes them. It's almost as if you can't be happy just being by yourself/single.

Meanwhile, there is no large movement or anything promoting friendships. It's always like friends are overlooked, or relationships are better than friendships. And of course depending on your friends, relationships can be better but vice versa as well. I've seen one to to many times good friends get left in the dust/unfriended because someone has entered a relationship. 

Like suddenly it doesn't matter that you were there when my dog died, or when I needed advice, or was depressed, or were there at the happiest moments of my life, because my new SO that I have known for a month trumps all that you've done. 

And its like they get a pass. ""Oh, well theyre in a relationship."" So? That doesn't give them the right to neglect a good friendship because so and so is getting dick/pussy. 

And then your still expected to take them back when they come crawling back after abondoning you, because then YOU wouldn't be a true friend.
 
This applies to same sex friendships and opposite sex friendships.

I went to college, a really good one. Day jobs weren't for me. I ended up going to trade school and becoming a welder. I love it, it's good work and I'm at the point where I make a great wage. In a few years I can open my own business and start making serious money. 

The problem is, I don't think women find blue collar guys attractive. I've been on dates and when the lady finds out what I do it's always ""oh"" and she becomes quiet and disappointed. The date just goes downhill from there and then it just dissolves. This is the recipe for every single date I've been on in recent memory. I hate to generalize things, but they look at me as not much differently than a guy that mops floors at Taco Bell. It doesn't matter that I've done some underwater wielding either, it all sounds boring to them when it's the exact opposite.

I don't know what to do about it. I don't want to lie and tell a lady I'm a doctor but at the same time I can't tell a woman I make $85,000 a year between two jobs either, because one is false and the other is off-putting and arrogant.  

Any advice? My job isn't glamorous or terribly interesting to outsiders but I like what I do and I'm not changing careers. It does irk me though a guy can go to a crappy law school, be saddled with six figure debt and not even get a job, and yet be more attractive than what I do.

I would recommend that those of you who responded in that manner reevaluate your relationships with women and the way that you regard them, because some of those comments offended me as a man.

I have more roast beef than a deli- and before you link to the Great Wall of Vagina, none of those women come close to the amount of junk I have going on.

I almost think I'm holding out for the perfect girl at times, which I realize if I did I'd be alone for eternity. I know what I want in a relationship, I've had a lot of time to get to know myself, and what I want, and need from someone else. I've always figured if I can't get my needs fulfilled by someone why be around at all?

**Original Post**

Ok, so bear with me here. I'm in a Womens' Studies class with my (likely short term) girlfriend at my college. I don't need or want the grade, but I've added up the points that I can lose for bombing this assignment, and even if my instructor gives me a zero, I'm still going to pass. It's practically impossible to fail this class.

Anyway, my instructor is of the belief that the only thing that gets men hard is *women*. I was going to protest but my girlfriend gave me one of those death stares, and I shrugged it off. The instructor has proven to be one of the most closed-minded people I've ever met, but she doesn't really hate men all that much. She just really, really, *really* loves women.

However, I intend to do an in-class presentation about no reason boners, or perhaps just **no woman** boners. There's a presentation assignment anyway, so I feel like Reddit will be the ideal place for me to get some source material.

I'm thinking the top 6-7 posts in this thread will go into my presentation. Have at it, gentlemen. My presentation is either tomorrow night or Tuesday night. Procrastination ftw.

**EDIT:** I'm not looking for ""porn"" or ""women"" or any of that stuff. I'm specifically looking for non-human causes of boners.

**EDIT 2**: The rest of my presentation is completely legitimate. Peer reviewed studies and the like. I am doing 3 slides on ""NRBs"" and the ""suspected"" reasons behind them. It will only last for maybe two minutes.

**EDIT 3:** Wow thanks for all of the responses! I've got so many things to work with. To answer a few questions:

* She's only my short term girlfriend because she's moving away. It's explained somewhere. We've thought about it like adults. I don't know why I included that information in my post.
* This isn't specifically about women, it's about the object of arousal pertinent to each individual. She very briefly, after some class input, discussed how gay men fit into her grand scheme of things. Basically I'm looking for non-human sources of boners.
* I'm not being ignorant or **solely** trolling. I'm giving legitimate information, followed by a lengthy discussion of ""reason"" boners, followed by a legitimate conclusion. Yes, I am trolling.

1371116908.0,312,self.AskMen,1g9c3u,Am I alone in finding relationships to be not worth the work?,416,104,313,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1g9c3u/am_i_alone_in_finding_relationships_to_be_not/,"I'm not necessarily looking for advice. Agree or disagree with me, share stories, share advice, share jokes, rant, rage, cry, come out of the closet, confide in me or others, I don't care. I just want to talk completely candidly. 

I have been burned a couple times on long term relationships. So I am pretty sure that my opinion is biased. I am also a pretty strong introvert. But basically, what I have determined, is that life is a sin wave of happiness. Living by myself and focusing on work (military at the moment) puts me at, what I would say, is a solid 7. I'm not rich, but I have a nice car and can afford some toys for myself. And my life stays pretty solid at a 7. Sometimes I get behind on bills or other responsibilities, and it's a 6. Other times I get to see new parts of the world and it's an 8. I firmly believe that if I was in a relationship, my life could be a 9, or even a 10, at some points. Only missing large amounts of money (to share with my significant other) and/or my dream job. But I also feel that fights and separation would bring my life down to a 4 or 5. And if the relationship failed for something big, like cheating, it would be a 2. I don't feel like a 2 or 3 (or even a 4) is worth a 9. 

Right now, any problems I have are directly my fault, and it's up to me to fix them. In a relationship, there will be aspects of my life that are not directly my fault that I can't fix. Whether it be a fight between us, or a problem in her life that I am obligated to help with. Now, make no mistake, I understand my role in a relationship and would not hesitate to do everything in my power to help my significant other. But that's still two lives worth of life problems that I am now involved in, instead of just one. 

I am not trying to attack women and say that they ruin everything, everything negative that I have seen can and has been performed (not the right word, but you get my point) by men. But I'm not dating men, so the capabilities of a female to hurt me are all I care about. And I'll be honest, the many failed relationships that I have seen have been the fault of the woman (adultery). But not all women are the same, so I try to not judge the gender based on the actions of a dozen. But it doesn't help convince me that I'm wrong (which I may be). 

Relationships just seem like such a big risk. I share the most intimate details of my life, my finances, my privacy, my free time, my happy moments and my sad moments. And there is still a chance that she'll leave me after I retire and she can take half of my pension (seen it). There's no way to guarantee that the woman I pick to spend my life with will stay faithful and loving for 50 years. I feel it's just human nature. A portion of the population (a good portion it seems) are unreliable. Is sharing every aspect of my life, and connecting myself to this person forever through children, really worth the risk? 

My hormones say yes. The desire to date and make babies is strong. When I see a happy relationship, I feel that pang of loneliness that reminds me of the good times I had with my previous girlfriends (and we had some really fun times, sensual and not). I meet a coworker who is responsible and attractive, and I imagine a relationship. But in every case, I think about what I've said above, and I return to my life of 7 level happiness.

I just can't get past the odds of it all. I am not a gambling man. When I go to Vegas, my goal is to play as long as possible on the money I've allotted, not expecting to win (and I never do). That mentality doesn't carry over well to a relationship. A 50% failure rate in marriages, and much higher in dating relationships. And I feel like ""winning"" doesn't return a massive payout like a slot machine, it returns a life better (but not drastically better) than the life I had. In other words, I wouldn't bet half of my income and belongings for the next however many years for a return of ""you get to keep those things, and sometimes be happier than you are now"" at a slot machine. 

I think my rant is over. I know I sound bitter and depressed, and I won't fault anyone for agreeing. Respond how you see fit. I will consider everyones posts equally, no matter how retarded you think I am. I even promise not to get mad, because I feel that my opinions are on the radical side, and I will listen to reason. However, I will respond how I see fit, with no insults intended.

My wife, same age, has been in and out of depression over the past 11 years of our marriage. It has been a strain on our relationship, especially in the intimacy department. I like to be intimate, everything from a hug to a hot night. But all too often, I'm met with rejection. 11 years of it in fact. And it has eaten away at me. Recently, it's gotten worse.

My wife spirals out of control at the slightest sad point in her life. She's gained 3 pounds, someone at work said something, fight with her mom. I do my best to talk her through it and be supporting but I'm really at the end of my caregiver rope. Hell, I even have my degree in Clinical Psychology. ""If anyone could handle it, I could"" is what I keep telling myself. But not so much anymore. I find myself looking and flirting with other women a lot more. My need for intimacy is not being met. I haven't acted on anything and try to distract myself in activities and being with the kids but the need is still there and won't go away, no matter how much fapping. I don't want to cheat on my wife because I respect her more than that. I am considering divorce but I really don't want to do that to my kids. She won't go to counseling. I'm stuck. Last night I just walked out, after being rejected for the 1 millionth time, and spent the night in a hotel. Just to get away from her.

My questions for my bros are thus; Has anyone been in a similar situation? Can you dispense some sage advice? Would you recommend working on it with counselling, if I can get her to go? Is that a lost cause? Divorce? Am I a bad person for leaving my depressed wife?

His father elected many years ago to not be a part of his life so approaching him for help or advice isn’t an option.  A coworker told me about this large forum so I thought I’d give it a try. Read all the rules first, but excuse me if I accidentally break any rules as this is my first post.

It’s been a rough couple of months for him lately. Just generally depressed, temperamental with me and isn’t being as social with his friends as he was earlier in the school year. I haven’t wanted to nag with a lot of questions because usually I get a total denial that anything was wrong at all. 

But it’s been bothering me more and more. So Saturday evening I wrote him a handwritten note and left it on the kitchen counter for him to find the next morning. I just expressed that no matter what was going on he could talk to me. No judgments, no punishments, just unconditional love. I also told him how upsetting it is for me to see him when he’s not happy and I’d do anything to make it better. 

He kept to his bedroom all day on Sunday. Late last night he finally came out of his room, sat on the couch next to me and started talking. To sum up our conversation; He’s jealous that a few of his friends have started getting girlfriends. He feels left out of the group now. He thinks because of the way he looks he’ll never get a girlfriend either. He’s really troubled that he’s skinny and not bulking up. My son is already 6’1 and still growing. He’s got a medium frame but he currently weighs around 135 lbs. apparently his friends are planning on spending a lot time camping and swimming out at the lakes this summer. So he plans on spending the entire summer alone because he’s embarrassed about taking his shirt off in front of others. 

How can I help him gain self-esteem? Is this something a Mom can do for a young man? The same coworker that suggested this forum gave me the advice of finding him a male personal trainer to help him with his diet and putting on muscle. Is this a good idea or is he a too young for this approach?  He eats A LOT, like my food bill has doubled this past year. But I’m sure he’s not eating the right things to add muscle.

From a mother prospective I know that he’ll grow into his height. I’m not at all concerned with him getting a girlfriend, I’d rather he wait till after high school. But I’m worried that his poor self-esteem now and isolating himself could lead to long term issues down the road. I want him to feel confident enough to go swimming and hang out with his friends.

So I guess to end this long ramble my main two questions are this. What else can I be doing to improve his self-esteem? Is he too young for a personal trainer or does that put TOO MUCH emphasis on appearances? 

Any advice from personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Then at the bar, he kept touching my arm and leg, and calling me sexy and cute. Then he kissed me good night- like a pretty long kiss. I texted him good night afterward and mentioned the kiss. He described it as a kiss between friends. I told him I don't do friends with benefits. He told me that's not what we are. ""We're friends. We kissed. It was a great kiss. End of story."" 

Any insight? I feel like what this guy did was pretty jerky.

Thank you to all who post here.,376,87,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1j2w0u/guys_youve_changed_my_life_for_the_better_really/,"I am a mid-forties female. I have spent my whole life thinking I was unattractive. The teen girl icons of my time were Brooke Shields and other models like her (google her- as a teen she was around six foot, no boobs, no hips- basically she looked  like a man). So as a fairly short girl with big boobs and an ass I thought I was unappealing, and because of the household I grew up in (all female and my mother was a religious fanatic) there was no one to tell me what men really liked in a woman.

So fast forward a couple of decades. My marriage is over (it was an abusive marriage but I didn't have the confidence to leave for a very long time- my insecurities about my looks playing a large part in how long I stayed) my kids are grown and no guy has given me a glance for about 25 years. So I am thinking I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. 

Then I find Askmen, and suddenly I understand what makes you tick and what you like! I realise that my 128 pound curvy hourglass figure might be an asset instead of a liability.

So I have changed the way I dress and present myself. Gone are the loose clothes designed to hide my thighs and hips and boobs. Today I went out in my tight black bootcut jeans and clingy blouse with my long blonde hair curling in loose waves and a light spray of a nice perfume to finish.To be honest the jeans were a bit outside my comfort zone- I am not used to wearing tight clothes that cling to my thighs and ass- I felt a bit naked but thought what the hell I'll wear them and see what happens

I had to pick up something for my car, so I stopped at a car accessories shop. There were four guys at the counter serving. I have been into this shop before and no one bothered to offer help. But today, as I was scanning the shelf looking for what I needed, within minutes all four guys had come over to offer assistance. Suddenly I am no longer invisible! And then outside a different shop some random guy spontaneously started a conversation with me and was trying to find out more about me. Today was a really good day!! All is not lost- I might now be a mature lady but maybe I will find another man to keep me company! 

 The things I have just found out about how to present myself to attract a guy must be so obvious to you guys (and probably a lot of women)- but I honestly didn't know until recently that many of you liked thick thighs and a decent ass (mostly thanks to the media and fashion industry who are clearly not run by straight guys.) Thanks a million guys!!

Ever since I hit puberty, I had the desire to be with girls. In a way, the pursuit of women defined me and drove most of my actions. This really hit a climax over the past 2 years, starting with my longest relationship (8 months) wherein I lost my virginity. 

Once I got to college this year, me and her broke up and I fooled around with some other girls, including a brief 2 month relationship, a month long FWB situation, and a few hook ups here or there.

This is where the problem comes in: over the last month or two, I've lost almost all desire to be with girls. I've done a few hookups, but those were more to say I could than for any particular desire to get laid. I just find that hookups are very hollow and unfufiling, but at the same time the idea of a relationship seems really stressful and more work than its worth, not to mention I haven't felt strongly about a girl since I broke up with my last serious girlfriend.

I still find girls attractive and want to have sex with them, but that's on a more biological level than any particular affection. To top that off, my sex drive has kind of fallen to the way side; I haven't fapped in weeks and I find that even when I'm doing a hook up its less about sex and more about proving to myself that I can get girls (something that was a problem for me in the past).

Ultimately, I just feel like women don't have much to offer me besides sex. I feel like any kind of committed relationship will just be me putting in all sorts of work for low returns, and I feel like I couldn't be open around my partner for fear that she would lose her desire to be with me. I just don't really see the value in being with a girl, and I feel like the dynamic between men and girls is so asymmetrical that my needs wouldn't be really met. Since my sex drive has kind of fell, I don't really see the point of pursuing girls at all.

Is this a normal thing? Anybody else ever experience anything like this?

Edit: just so everyone knows, I am reading every reply. If you don't get a reply from me its because you made a solid point. You guys have given me a lot to think about.

Edit 2: So, more than one person have commented on the point of ""I feel the only thing a girl can offer me is sex"". Allow me now to address this, by rewording it. It should say ""I feel the only thing *girls offer me* is sex"". 

I've always had a relatively high desire to have an honest, open, mutually loving relationship type deal. But it seems to me that most girls aren't really interested in getting to know *me*, disregarding my emotions or shitting all over them when I open up (and keep in mind, this isn't me just randomly dumping my thoughts. I've had girls nag me into opening up, just to disregard my feelings or even attack them). 

So what I am saying isn't ""the only thing a girl is good for is sex"". What I am saying is that I feel like I am expected to be emotionally supportive and loving and such, but the only thing the girl offers back is sex; I don't receive the same level of acceptance or support.",,False,,t5_2s30g,1367248282.0,,male,True,t3_1dbgfy,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1dbgfy/has_anyone_else_lost_their_desire_to_chase_girls/,

------------------------------------------------
My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years. 

Today his ability to predict my monthly flow has really astounded me. 

He's been able to do the same before, but it was usually because he can keep track by using the once-a-month calendar (or so I thought). 

My next scheduled period wasn't supposed to arrive until mid-June. This morning he casually asked me if I was on my period. 

Then when I said, with a little too much hostility perhaps, ""NO! Why do you ask??"" He kind of glanced around, bought himself some time, and said, ""you weren't as horny as usual yesterday?"" 

*I have a feeling he was going to say that I was more hostile than usual, which was true. But the good man he is, he went with the safe answer and dodged a bullet.*

As of this morning, no period. I go to gym, then I head to work. First bathroom break at work, hello period. It's **two weeks early**. 

I don't know how my boyfriend was able to predict something that is inherently unpredictable, solely based on my moods. ASTOUNDING. 

-----------------------------------------

End of work day Edit: Holy crap, I can't believe all of the things I learned today about you guys!! I'll list some of the ones that interested me here:

- Some of you can't tell at all because your girlfriends are awesome girlfriends who remain perfectly logical during monthly haunting. You all get a gold star. Try to divide it amongst yourselves equally, please.
- A lot of you actually pick up on the little tell-tale signs like heightened sensitivity and shit. 
- Some of you can **smell the blood** (oh sweet mother of science, I'm so sad that I know this now). 
- Some cats can tell when women have periods. 
- Some of you can't tell at all--are those of you who gave this input in a younger age range?

So I (29F) have been wondering if I should contact this guy (34M). I know the advice usually is ""just do it!"", but there are some factors that I'm afraid will set off some alarms or red flags with this guy.. I came to wonder if women (specially at my age) have to be careful not to seem desperate or the crazy in ""don't stick your dick in crazy"". 

My question is basically if you've ever been approach by a girl in unusual circumstances (ie. not in a bar or cafe), and you just said no or didn't respond merely because something seemed ""off"" with the way it happened? 

To put in perspective, this is my situation: About three years ago I had a female friend. Around the time we met, she got herself a boyfriend (let's call him Thomas), who was a quiet nerdy guy. When she and I met we always talked a lot about relationships and men, and so I came to hear a lot about Thomas. And because he and I worked within the same narrow field and had many of the same interests, my friend often talked to me about what her and Thomas talked about, and I got the impression that she also talked to Thomas about what she and I spoke about. I never met him, though. But from what I heard about him, to me, he always seemed to be a truly sweet, decent and intelligent guy.. but my friend was somehow always really unhappy with everything. In the end, Thomas broke up with her sometime in 2011. About half a year later, she and I stopped talking (for reasons unrelated), and I have not spoken to her since. 

Fast forward to now: I have been single for 6 months after having ended a long-term relationship, and I found myself thinking a lot about this Thomas guy. I think I would like to get to know him. From what I have been able to find about him online, I _think_ he is single. And still really sweet-looking. 

We have no common friends anymore, but on LinkedIn we have a shared business connection (let's call him Paul). I think that Paul is also Thomas' friend. I talk to Paul once in a while and have a good relationship with him. Our relationship is strictly professional.  

So my question is: would it be weird to contact Thomas given the circumstances? I would love to just email him, but I do not have his address, and I do not want to write to him on Facebook. And I am of course too chicken to call him. I was thinking maybe to ask Paul for Thomas' mail address. And I am afraid this is when the alarms go off, no? Wouldn't it seem desperate? I have no idea ho to approach this situation without seeming desperate of crazy. Maybe I should just forget about it all? 

TL;DR: I would like to get to know a guy, who happens to be the ex-boyfriend of an ex-friend of mine (who I haven't talked to in a few years). I have never met him. I don't know if, or if so, how I should contact him without seeming desperate.

Would you consider a relationship with these girls, or maybe just fuck them? Why/why not?

Would you consider a bigger girl if she had something extra (for example she was tall, short, had wide hips, etc)?

Do you have friends who prefer these women? Do you know why?

Do you or someone you know absolutely think all women above a particular size are revolting?

Does personality have any merit in your decision?

I have always been interested in knowing about this, if the whole weight stigma for women is a social construct that makes men afraid of thinking about these women in some sort of romantic way, or if they really are that unattractive to you.

Please listen to as much as you can before posting. Or you can speak generally and/or personally about Anti-Male culture

I thought it was a pretty interesting and in-depth overview of the modern male experience. 

[Dr. Helen Smith on how American society has become anti-male](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/amyalkon/2013/06/03/dr-helen-smith-on-how-american-society-has-become-anti-male-1) 

&gt; As Men on Strike demonstrates, men aren’t dropping out because they are stuck in arrested development. They are instead acting rationally in response to the lack of incentives society offers them to be responsible fathers, husbands and providers.

[Men on Strike: Why men are boycotting the American Dream, Fatherhood, and the American Dream - and Why It Matters](http://www.amazon.ca/books/dp/1594036756)

The show is pretty long and touches on dozens of topics. Here are some quotes to get this going. 

* The wrong question to ask is ""where have all the good men gone?"" - The right question is ""Why have the good men opted out?""

* Coverture in the past used to be a father's privilege. He had control over the family unit. Western culture has spent the last 50 years reversing that order. Women now hold the power. 

* Most men aren't poor communicators. They just have a different style. Most men in my experience will open up, it's just that no one is listening. 

* Some men feel like they have no control in their lives. They feel like they can't compete, control or master things in real life. In some cases they're told that doing these things is simply wrong or childish. Naturally video games are the perfect replacement.

* Government has slowly started replacing men as the providers. Women see the government as their daddy. 

* Both men and women lack empathy for other men. We are too focused on women's rights and issues. Some men see speaking out against this as being unmanly. 

* Paternity fraud: If a man finds out his 3 year old child isn't actually his he can still be liable to pay child support

* A boy may be accused of sexually harassing a girl, and then he will get kicked out of college because the college was more concerned with protecting itself from Title IX liability. [Preponderance of evidence](http://thefire.org/article/15014.html)

* Book mentioned: [Media and Male Identity: The making and remaking of men](http://www.amazon.ca/Media-Male-Identity-Making-Remaking/dp/023000167X)

&gt; in a post-industrial era of economic, technological and social change, research shows mass media are projecting and propagating new images of male identity from Atlas Syndrome workaholics and 'deadbeat dads' to 'metrosexuals' and men with 'a feminine side', with potentially significant social implications. This book presents a landmark in-depth study of how mass media contribute to the making and remaking of male identity.

Some information: I'm 27, soon-to-be husband is 27 as well. I say soon because our wedding is... *soon.*

I realized Monday morning I was late, got some tests, all 12 were positive. Managed to get a gyno appointment, and I'm about 12 weeks. With all the wedding craziness, and just being a little stressed, I didn't notice my period being a no show.

My best friend was with me at the appointment and told me I should wait. I don't think this is a good idea, I want him to know, and since I'm almost 13 weeks, I don't want to wait even longer.. 

I also don't want to just randomly drop it in casual conversation. I honestly don't know the best way to say it or where to tell him, or what to do. Any opinions guys?

I know I can't be the only one out there.  Every time I've told any of friends they all laugh and joke about it They think it isn't possible for a woman to rape a guy.  I didn't think it was possible either.

This past New Years I got black out drunk.  I woke up to this woman that I would not have consented to had I been sober, and didn't consent to even while hammered (I kept telling her ""no"" and ""stop"" etc.) with her hand down my pants.

If it had been a man trying to do this I would have just punched him but apparently there is a block in my brain preventing me from punching a woman even if she's raping me.

I was able to push her head off of me and button my jeans but then she tried mounting me.  She sat on my stomach/chest and squeezed nearly all the air out of me.  It took all the strength I had just to push her off of me and fight her off the rest of the night.

I didn't remember any of this until later on the next day when I noticed my lip had been cut.  Then I remembered her biting my lip hard enough to break the skin and wake my drunk ass up and it all came flooding back.

She apologized to me the next day about my lip but she supposedly doesn't remember raping me, or even me saying ""no"" and ""stop"" every time she said ""come on"" and ""why not?""  I haven't talked to her since and thankfully she was a friend of a friend who lives out of town so I'll never have to see her again at least.

So the boyfriend[M28] of 5 months and I[F32] were watching The Hangover the other day, and the topic of bachelor parties came into conversation.  He pretty much ended up telling me that if/when we get married (we are not engaged or anything right now, but things are more than likely headed that way) that he is going to want a bachelor party and at this bachelor party he would like to sleep with another women, one last fling before marriage and that he wouldn't have a problem if I did the same.

I was pretty upset about this, to me it is unthinkable.  Of course I don't want him sleeping with another women, one last fling or not.  And I certainly have no desires to be with another man, especially if I am engaged to be married.  And honestly, the fact that he wouldn't be bothered if I slept with another man hurts as well, even with his knowledge/permission. 

When he saw my reaction, he told me not to worry about it... that he was just testing the waters and since it would upset me it wouldn't happen.  But it is clear, that if I allowed it, he would hands down have a one night stand before our wedding if we were to get married.

He has been married before and he and his ex-wife had this same arrangement, but their marriage didn't exactly last either, which was a point I was sure to make.  To him, this is typical, normal behavior that happens at bachelor parties all the time.  But is it?

I trust him and know that he would not cheat on me, or do anything behind my back if we were to get engaged &amp; he had a bachelor party and what not, that's not really the issue.  I just want to get a broader perspective on the topic.  So, is wanting to have one last fling at your bachelor party normal behavior? I live in ND where people generally are conservative with typical midwest values. Wild bachelor parties with strippers and hookers like you see in film are not the norm up here. At all.

It seldom comes in the form I might prefer.  What is wanted vs what is needed.

It is a particular thing, to be a man having lived through  many years' worth of sexual abuse as a child.

Particular here means that most of the language, resources, counselling, fora - are geared toward women.  Statistically this is perfectly understandable.

But there is a place where understanding breaks down.  

As an adult man who lived through more than a decade of sexual abuse at the hands of an adoptive father, with a violent and emotionally closed and distant adoptive mother lending tacit approval by non-intervention, several things might be observed, from personal experience only, YMMV.

- Guilt, or I Enjoyed It I Must Be Evil.  It seems that no matter how many times some well-intentioned person informs me about nerve endings, perpetrator/victim dynamics, the social (and particularly empowerment) implications of having been a child at the time...the guilt and associated shame remains.  

- Vox, or Let Me Get This Off My Chest.  As with the above, no matter how much I have paid for therapy nor how many times I have tried, attempts to re-enter this part of myself have never been met with anything other than sexual politics or a narrow framework of understanding.  *fucking listen to me - I enjoyed it - why can you not hear what that means to me, how it makes me feel?*  This plea, uttered in many ways and to many well-intentioned friends, lovers, professionals - does not get heard.  I suspect it makes others uncomfortable, so it must be silenced.

- Relationships.  To say my relationships with women are difficult is to vastly understate the matter.  How do I express that I know what it is to be entered, pursued, desired - for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time, by the wrong people?

How do I move from frozen, old stories based in traumatic incidents, long-ago completed, which continue to affect and define my love, needs, sexuality?  Yes, I am damaged goods, but I am unbelievably beautiful, if you dare to look beneath the rough exterior to the...well...rough interior I suppose, ha.

- Guys.  I do not understand them.  They bore me, with their arrogance, their competitiveness, their swaggers and their use of others.  I fucking despise professional sports and must consciously, deliberately refuse to hate the men in groups who use this spectacle as a vehicle for bonding and drunken revelry.  With just this one aspect of 'guydom' being something on the order of that scraped from the bottom of a shoe (IMO), I find myself isolated from the majority of my sex.  In many other ways such people bore me - and most of my closest friends are other men.

These are a few issues I face, or believe I face, which is approximately the same thing and as easily changeable...theoretically.  I grapple with these things as I fall asleep at night.

What is your problem?  If you are in any way similar and want to share, please do.

I would hear from other men about your own story, what you've learned, what you've discovered, what remains to be done.

tl;dr If you are a man and are struggling, you are not alone.

**edit:  I ought to have mentioned a few things:  1.  that throwaways are welcome, considering the subject matter, and 2.  that length of story, response, comment is not an issue.  Walls-of-text are as welcome as brevity, for each tells their story in their way.  Also and perhaps most importantly I am reading these responses and will do my level best to respond back, if at all appropriate.  I am genuinely moved by the courage of all who have written here, and thank you most sincerely.**

I start chemo next week, so I have to tell him soon. We don't live together, but I understand how big of a burden it would be on him to have a fiancé who is extremely sick, so I don't want to place any pressure on him to be there when I'm going through treatment, especially because he's recently been promoted in his law firm and works extremely hard. How do you think I should tell him that I don't want him to stress out about me? 

Also, I have 4 male best friends who I haven't told yet either. When telling my girlfriends, there was a lot of tears. However I just don't know how my male friends will take it, or how I should tell them. I've known them for about 6 years and care about them a lot, yet, just like with my fiancé, I don't want them to treat me any differently once all my hair falls out and I'm tired all the time. Should I tell each of my male friends separately and face to face? or should I just send them an individual text message? How would you want to know about a close female friend having cancer? 

Sorry about all the questions! x

UPDATE - I told him. He came over mine and I immediately burst into tears and just let it out. He started crying to and we just hugged each other for some time. He then looked down at me and said 'I'll go call work now. I'm taking some time off for you. We're going to get through this'. :) :) 

I just told my male friends as well - separately. They had varied reactions. One of them started crying then and there, the other two teared up, and one just remained really stiff. But they all told me they would be here for me no matter what, which I am just so appreciative of. One of them even asked me whether he should delay his trip to Paris (next week) to be here with me for my first bout of chemo treatment. Obviously I told him it wasn't necessary, and to enjoy the trip without any worries.

Is this something that's considered negative (story included)?",290,54,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/15qsjd/nice_girl_syndrome_i_feel_like_i_embody_this/,"Well, AskMen, I have a **lengthy** story - we'll start from the beginning:

Over the past few weeks, I (25/F) have started talking again to a previous co-worker (23/M), who I was completely head over heels for.  We used to sit and watch movies, go drinking, talk all the time, but that ended when he started dating another co-worker of ours.  I left the job a few weeks after and did not talk to him for about a year and a half.

Fast forward to now - he starts talking to me out of the blue.  We're telling each other our inner most thoughts, talking sexually, saying deep feelings, the whole nine yards... 

*Now comes the ""nice girl"" issue*:

I have listened to him every step of the way, since he actually started talking to me again while in a weird sort of relationship hiatus with this awful woman (21/F).  Apparently she treats him like shit, insults him, makes him feel awful, etc.  I always listen, make him feel better, give advice that I think would help him, etc.  I have always been the ""nice girl""; people have referred to me as the nicest person they've ever met for as long as I can remember.

I'm there, listening to everything, and he reciprocates by saying I'm ""perfect"", I am ""the kindest person he's ever met"", I'm ""beautiful and he doesn't deserve me"".  He constantly tells me, more than anything, he wants to be with me.

*Here comes the confusing part* - he is still with this woman, and decided to try and make a relationship work with her.  Out of the blue.  It really fucking hurt to hear that, yet I still supported him.  I mean, it's his decision; who am I to tell him what to do?  I have made my feelings clear, I just don't know why he went back.  She is still treating him awful as well, and he is still writing about how much he wants to be with me.

Well, after that gargantuan story, I guess my main question is, are nice girls just not attractive to men most of the time?  I know he wants me, but yet still went with the shitty choice.

AskMen, I am confused.  Or just too nice.


**INSTANT UPDATE EDIT**:  Wow, guys.  I seriously want to thank all of you for the wonderful advice and the huge reality check.  I have read all of your responses, and you're all on point.  I'm not one to mess around, so I went ahead and confronted this immediately.  Want to hear the funniest thing?  Went ahead and, after receiving a text from him, told him exactly what I needed to (we're being inappropriate, I want to be with you and I'm being strung along, and that whatever is going on can't continue).  And the wonderful response of the man who cares oh so much about me?  ""Okay.""  Nothing more, nothing less.  And no further response.

I've known this guy for a while, a few years ago he dated one of my friends. I bumped into him at a party recently and he got my number, suggesting that we catch up.

A few weeks later I get a text asking when and where I would like to meet - I choose a new bar I've read good reviews about and pick a time. All seems well so far!

It's 5 minutes to the agreed time - I'm just about to arrive. He texts to say he's still at work and will be another half an hour, so I sit alone at the bar til he shows up. Turns out he has been at work *drinks* and is a few drinks ahead of me. Not a drama, I buy a cocktail and settle in. 

It starts off all banter and it's reasonably fun, but he always seems to bring any topic back to strong sexual references. I'm not quite comfortable with this and change the subject regularly. 

He suggests we leave. We've been at the bar 1hour and it's not even 8pm. He waives the waiter over and asks for the bill to be split. I would have offered to pay, but I didn't like not being consulted on it. So we split it.

I say ok, lets go and grab something to eat. He's so eager to ""get back to his place"" he's got his hand in the back pocket of my jeans and doesn't want to stop for food - so I stand waiting for him outside a takeaway pizza shop as he gets food for himself, and I stay hungry because he doesn't want to go looking for Japanese. 


While he's inside the pizza shop the penny drops and I think, no way am I sleeping with this guy. I need to get out of this. So I fake receiving a phone call from my boss asking me to urgently come back to the office to fix some some important shipments. 

The guy looks at me like I have trodden on his heart. He actually believes the story about work, but is so disappointed. I felt like such a bitch but there was no way I was going back to his place, puppy eyes or not.

Now, reddit, please tell me. Am I CRAZY or is that considered ok behaviour to get a girl into bed on the first date? I honestly feel like such a bitch. ",,False,,t5_2s30g,False,,,True,t3_1aq4kv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1aq4kv/men_of_reddit_am_i_crazy/,

That is an intriguing question.  We certainly don't let men use the ""but it is only natural"" excuse to justify some of their more antisocial behaviors.   Should we give women ""a sexual inequality pass"" because it is just one part of a natural courtship script?  Or, should we encourage women to make more risky initiatives?  Should men go on a ""risky initatives"" strke? Should we ask women to ""woman up"" --  put their fragile egos on the line, get some ovaries, get out there and start asking out men on first dates?

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-how-and-why-sex-differences/201104/why-dont-women-ask-men-out-first-dates?page=2

&gt;As noted in the histogram, a great majority of the women, 93%, preferred to be asked out -- only 6% perferred to do the asking. The majority of men preferred to do the asking, 83%, while 16% preferred to be asked out on a date.  It is interesting that more men preferred to be asked out (16%) than there were women who preferred to do the asking (6%).   That difference suggests that 10% of men may be waiting quite a while for a woman to ask them out on a first date.

**edit**: oh, I distant myself from the question. I just thought the ""equality"" part was interesting. You see, women and men, become more equal, not only in having equal 'rights', but also with in 'role', i.e. **the generation of symmetry**.  But the interesting thing is, that there is still a kind of a 'role', despite the uprising feminism. The explanation for this role is *natural*. But, as the article tackles it, should we accept the *oh-it-is-just-natural* excuse? We don't accept it from men, but why do we accept it from women? 

Remember, I am just trying to raise an (in my opinion) interesting question. My personal opinions differ from it.

He tried, he loved it, obviously. All was well. 

Then, rather naively he spoke to his best friend about it. She is a girl, but they have been friends since they were about five and he shared his secret with her with the promise she wouldn't tell a soul. She told his whole class that he was a ""weirdo that plays with himself"" which led to pretty much all of his friends surrounding him chanting that he was a weirdo. He came home in tears and cried pretty solidly for the whole of yesterday evening.. My sister has told him he's done nothing wrong, he's not to be ashamed, just to be more careful about who he shares personal stuff with.. It's not making much of a difference, as far as his concerned his life is over and he hates himself. Is this just a blip that hopefully can be forgotten about in a couple of weeks, or is this going to be something he shares on a reddit thread a few years down the line as the moment he lost faith in humanity and became a never nude sexual recluse? 

I have already checked he doesn't reddit so he won't see this. My sister is at a loss though, and really really worried that he's going to be traumatised. Would you have been?

We became very good friends, and I wasn't interested in dating him, and it was clear that his lack of experience was weighing on him very heavily.  He was very hard on himself about it and felt like there was something terribly wrong with him.

So we became FWB.  Like I said, I wasn't really interested in him that way, but it felt like the right thing to do.  I could help, so I did.  I was 100% honest with him about my feelings all the way through. 

His confidence shot way up, and shortly after he had his second sexual partner, and a few months later, his first girlfriend.  They live together now and are very happy.

I feel partially responsible for this happiness.  I feel like I did him a huge favor.  Am I an asshole for thinking this way?  How would you feel in his position?

This came up when I was setting up a date with a girl I met at a bar. When fixing up a time for the date she mentioned she would have to get a sitter. I just ended right there. This is one of the things  (probably the only thing) that I consider to be an immediate deal breaker. I just won't get involved. I'll cut the whole thing off before any sort of feelings can develop. I don't know any guys who have dated girls with kids, and I don't know any single moms. I'm just wondering if my view on this is normal. From watching TV/Movies it seems like every dude is delighted to find out the girl he is dating has a kid. It's portrayed as this huge bonus. 

It's not that I don't like kids. I love them. It's that they make everything more difficult. Like going out. Can't do it spurr of the moment. Have to plan ahead so she can get a sitter.

I'm also not sure how much of this is coloured by my work/life balance at the moment. I currently work about 60-70 hours a week and my schedule is pretty unreliable. I often find out that I have to work late or on weekends without any notice. So the idea of having to plan isn't something I can really do at the moment.

I lived with two of my buddies, and we always had people crashing on our couch, so her presence wasn't really a surprise to me.  I'd been at this really great loft party and was fucked up in multiple directions so my entry wasn't exactly graceful, and by the time I was done taking my shoes off Violet was awake.  We talked for about fifteen minutes and then I went to bed.

I woke up at some ungodly hour the next morning with about an inch of wooden practice sword and tight red underwear elastic jammed up my ass and Violet holding on to the other end thrusting up and down.  I was too out of it to really do anything, so I rolled over onto my back and told her to fuck off.  Apparently she'd come over after a double shift the night before and was super tired.  She had just fallen asleep when I had came in and woke her up, so she thought that the rational response was to take one of the swords out of the sword fight bucket and jam it up my ass a little bit.  I was a little pissed off, but I let it go.  I always knew that Violet was crazy, so this wasn't really a surprise to me.

I knew Violet was crazy because her two favorite stories to tell at parties were; the time she'd held a sword to a guys throat at a party, stole his pants and wore them out, and the time that she and one of her (also too old) friends doubled up on a highschooler.

Fast forward a year or so and Violet and I are throwing a party.  I like to throw a party at least once a month, and since I was living with Violet at the time it was a mix of her friends and mine.  When we threw parties we tried to limit cigarette smoking to my room because I was the only roommate who smoked, and as a result people with weed tended to come to my room to smoke too.  Violet came into the room and smoked up with us, and then, somehow, the conversation allowed her to tell the room full of people the story of the time she had repeatedly shoved a sword up my ass.

Nobody said shit.

She's told that story at a few parties, and no one has told her that what she did was fucked up.  Why is that?  She tells these stories about how she puts men into situations where they are sexually powerless like she's fucking proud of it and nobody says shit.  Why doesn't anyone say anything to her?  Why aren't her male friends worried that she'll do something similar to them?  What the fuck?

EDIT:  We don't see each other any more.  I owed a bunch of money on the power bill and while she was pissed off she made a ""joke"" about, you know.  It actually wasn't until she ""jokingly"" threatened to do it again that I realized that she was threatening to rape me, and that what she had done to me before was fucked up.  In retrospect it effected me a lot more than I knew.  After it happened I stopped going out to parties as much and stopped engaging at the parties I actually went to.

He *loves* anal sex and has been pressuring me to try it with him since we officially got together, though I'd never had it before and made it pretty clear I'm not interested in activities of the anal variety.

Well, the first time we were going to try it, he was fingering my ass and got some... *stuff* on his fingers. He informed me and I immediately bolted to the shower and sexy time was finito. Then we finally actually did it when I was drunk, and I loved it. Today we tried again, though I made it clear I didn't want to, and the first mentioned scenario played out again, with *stuff* getting on his fingers.

As of now, his attitude about the whole situation strikes me as frustrated. He made it clear to me that he's ""never had that problem before,"" which makes me feel even worse about it - and also confused, because he said that he did anal on the regular with his ex and they were together for a couple years, and unless I've got the nastiest ass around, I find it hard to believe they never had any complications.

I can't count how many times I've heard guys say they're going to throw in the towel with dating: disregard females, acquire currency, and wait until the female peers hit 30 and get desperate as their looks (99% of their overall market value) take a sharp decline.

 The following are common complaints I hear. They don't necessarily represent my views. I think many of them are just lame excuses for guys who can't admit that they're not attractive to women.

* **Women are too choosy**. Lots of women give off the impression that they'll settle for nothing less than Mr. Perfect. Guys learn this by getting repeatedly rejected despite their best efforts at self-improvement, and by listening to women describe their ridiculously high standards. 

* **Women aren't approachable.** I agree with this one. The average lady I see during my daily routine is staring at her phone screen and/or has headphones in her ears. It's rare that I see a woman who gives off the vibe that she'll be receptive to a rando striking up a conversation with her.

* **Women have a self-entitled attitude.** They want to be our equals yet they want special treatment from us. They want relationships to be a one-way street where they control us.

Some observations from OP

* Men have feelings too (Gee, men are human too?! Something new learned every day).
* It will be a emotional roller coaster for both (probably).
* It's better to tell the truth than play along.
* Don't hate the man because he can't respond to your feelings (even though it is tempting to act so).

I'm probably transferring to a mediocre university because I got rejected from (so far) six universities I applied to, and the rejection letters are still coming in. I will probably never work at a top tier Silicon Valley tech company or work on cutting research because I'm simply not smart enough. Summer internship hunting hasn't been successful either. I've honestly got nothing going for me.

The thing that hurts the most is that I actually try hard at improving my life, but I keep coming up short. I study a lot, genuinely try to learn about CS in my spare time, and exercise 4-6 times a week.

I've always imagined myself to be this badass guy who went to a stellar university and got a job at a place like Google or something, but I'm beginning to realize these are childish fantasies. The reality is that I'm just an average dude, going to an OK school with absolutely no intern/job prospects at the moment. Maybe I'll accomplish something great one day, but it's hard seeing the light at the end of the tunnel at this point.

I'm not giving up on pursuing my goals. The motivation is still there. It's just that I keep asking myself ""Is this the best that I can do?"" and the answer is almost always ""Yes"". My self-esteem has slowly been decreasing over time, but that should already be obvious.

My distress is further increased by the vast amount of success stories that float around here. It seems like there's so many people here who simply worked hard and became uber successful.

It will be my second marriage (his first), and I have a child from my first marriage. Both very comfortable with the idea, we started talking about rings.

We are both young (20s) and live together in an apartment. We have a good life together, and we aren't poor, aren't rich... we're young, employed, and we're somewhere in the middle.

When the ring talk began, I told him I wanted a ring that didn't have a diamond in it. Aside from the fact that we don't have a TON of money (I'd say the same if we did), I don't like or need to wear a downpayment for a car on my finger. I find it much sexier to be able to put a downpayment on a house someday... help my son out with college one day... or go on vacation someday... I don't need to put our savings into a tiny piece of jewelry. I don't want to marry him for a sparkly ring adornment.

He said he was worried about what other people would think -- didn't want them thinking he was cheap or ""didn't love me enough"" to get me a diamond. He said he felt like I was testing him. I've assured him... it's not a test. I just really place very little importance on ONE piece of jewelry. What if a stone falls out? What if it's lost or misplaced? I don't want something else to have to insure.

So the ring I picked out (and he begrudgingly bought, because he liked the style) is a white topaz ring from Zales. It cost $85, which I told him was more than enough. He hasn't proposed yet... just wanted to make sure I loved my ring when I did get it (the actual proposal is all a surprise to me... he has grand plans, but I have no idea what they are). 

He says this ring will do for now, but he plans on upgrading it. I told him I really DO NOT want a diamond ring. Not now, not ever. He just thinks I'm being modest or trying not to hurt him thinking he can't afford it.

How can I convince you, as a guy, that I really don't ever want a diamond ring?

tl:dr... Talking about getting engaged, picked a non-diamond ring, boyfriend purchased but insists on ""upgrading"" to diamond in the future because he thinks I'm bluffing about not wanting a diamond (I'm not).

When I'm on a date, I tend to ask a lot of questions, and listen really well. I genuinely am interested in what my date is saying. However, if she asks me to talk about myself, or tell her something about me, I blank. Or I give a simple, quick answer. I find it hard to talk about myself.

I'm simply sick of the unequal effort present in dating.

I dress pretty well, I'm not a ""nice guy"" TM either. 

As far as dating, it's always me that needs to start up the conversation, me that needs to ask her out, me that needs to make the plans, me that needs to carry the conversation. When it comes to paying the best case scenario is that we split but most of the time, I'm paying. I'm the one that needs to ask her out on the second date, I'm the one that needs to make the move for the first kiss, I'm the one that needs to escalate physically. I'm the one who needs to initiate sex and her pleasure supersedes mine. Shit is just exhausting. I'm just a dude that's looking to find a relationship or get laid and it seems to not be worth it. 

The advice is always, go to the gym, find interesting hobbies, work on yourself, etc. and then the women will come. I feel like I am already in good shape, have good hobbies, and am interesting and a good conversationalist but the effort to get women is just simply frustrating. A girl less attractive than me, less smart, less funny, in every way worse, can find sex or find a relationship with so much less effort that it's just disheartening.

I rarely find myself in this specific area of reddit, as I am a queer lady in a longterm relationship with another queer lady, and both of us have straight dude people friends, but I've got questions, and something tells me they might not be entirely up front with me.

So I recently accidentally overheard some people in my office gossiping. We work in cubicles with walls, I'm short and this sort of thing has happened before, where someone assumes I'm not around cause they can't see me. I've heard the ""dyke"" thing tossed around a couple of times, but I try not to let it bother me. I otherwise get along with them.

That said, while at my desk, I overheard some male coworkers talking about a female coworker who is definitely overweight, maybe obese. They were saying that it's obvious that she does not care about her body, that she is lazy, and that she eats too much at work. Some of the language they were using (bitch, cow, fat whore, etc), was a little shocking to me.

The reason I came to /r/askmen is because one of the coworkers involved in this convo was male and definitely overweight, and it was explicitly stated at one point ""I mean, women need to realize they can't just not care about their appearance and expect shit to go well for them"" (paraphrased, close as I can remember... also adding here that the person speaking was NOT overweight male coworker, he just agreed with said statement). I guess, as a woman who is overweight (150 lbs and 5'2"") hearing this hate-on got me scared for my career and worried about whether this is something I should be aware of.

This isn't an attack on male/female (or male/male female/female) relationships but I often step back and wonder if society places too much importance on them. 

Just using myself as an example, i'm currently 31, happily live by myself, have plenty of friends of both male and female and have had plenty of girlfriends over the years. Ive had 5 decent LTR's which varied from a 1 year to 3 years. 

Whenever I go home to see my parents, all i'm asked is ""Am I seeing someone"" or ""When will I meet someone"". My brother currently has a new girlfriend he has been seeing for all but a few months (He's a lot younger than me at only 25) and mum is carrying on like they're going to get married ""He's so smitten, he's taken such a long time to select a girl i cant see him getting tired of her anytime soon"".

The thing is a lot of the relationships ive been in havn't been that great, there has been fighting, mutual disagreement, huge incompatibilities.

I have plenty of hobbies and I consider myself content and busy, I actually dont want the hassle of a relationship right now. Its kind of lead me to wonder, as modern people have evolved intellectually, is it possible that some of us will just not really see the need for a relationship or see it as the utmost importance?

",246,68,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/199guw/you_thinking_what_im_thinking_roadtrip/,"So thus it was decided.  The gang would be reunited.  A road trip from Chicago to central Texas was planned.  It wouldn't be all of us, but it would be the ones who cared.  Geoff, Andrew and I would drive down to St Louis, pick up Nolan from Washington University, and just ride I-57 to 55 to New Orleans where we met our buddy Dustin.  Along the way another bro joined in, our Argentinian friend Franz adding some much needed Latin flavor to the dynamic.  Franz and Dustin are both members of the military and we all decided to meet up in New Orleans to stay at a hostel for 2 nights, before 2 nights in Austin and 2 nights back at Dustins place, before a 18 hour continuous drive to Chicago.

And it was exactly what you would expect.  A van full of 6 dudes.  Jerky, sunflower seeds, bottled water, farts,  weed, Simpsons, Seinfeld, Community and Happy Endings.  3 tablets, 5 laptops, cell phones, headphones, spare battery packs, bluetooth speakers and every other toy you can imagine we had to entertain ourselves.  When we got to New Orleans, we immediately made our way out to the bar. Whatever...Friday was fantastic, between the bars and the groddy strip club we accidentally wandered into, we didn't make it back to the hostel until 5, and most of us didn't start sleeping till 8am.

But Saturday.  Saturday was just... * divine*.  We woke up at 11, grabbed some BBQ and went to  the Arboretum for a ""walk and mock"" (aka we lapped the place, acted silly and mercilessly ridiculed everything within sight).  I think it was the only thing we could do to keep from vomiting. Afterwards we went back to the hostel to rest and those of us who smoked well... smoked.  At some point a couple of girls who were staying in another room came up and after talking for a while we all decided to go to Frenchman St together.  

7 hours, 138 dollars, 10 year old bourbons and 10 dollar pool games later, I found myself on some stoop with some radiant woman reciting her poetry to me, telling me about her HBO job.  3 hours after that I was asleep on a chair after attempting to stay awake for pancakes and coffee.  I can barely remember her name already, and same goes for the women who accompanied us.  I don't care (ok I do).  it was an amazing experience.  After two nights in New Orleans I had 4 hours sleep and I couldn't be happier.  Oh there were other fun experiences, the *Friday Night Lights* stadium, depressing trips to a McDonalds that experimented with Dadaism design, or sneaking on the field at University of Texas, or at one point having to drive 400 miles on a spare...

Were now in Austin, and about to finish up at our buddies house.  His wife is transferring to London next year, and him with her.  This is it.  It's not the end of our friendship, but the dynamic is going to change again.  Next time I see him will be years and years from now, and we will be different people.  We barely recognized each other.  I can feel it with the others too.  Our relationships are flowing and changing, and the people I was closest to 5 years ago are not the same I am closest with now.  And that's ok.  But for now we're going to do what we used to do.

We're different people now.  It's clearly not high school anymore.  Husbands, soldiers, engineers and artists.  Balding fatter, drunker or weirder.  Some of us love baseball and others fell in love to youthful women who lightened them up.  But I can't shake it.  I am happy.  Things are changing, and I am growing, and so are they.  Things are weird and things are intense and serious and scary and *weird*.  

I don't know what happened.  It ends soon.  I can't wait.  I am so tired, and sore, and sick, and I just feel gross.  But I am fucking *happy*.  And I am happy to share.

I'm a regular reader/contributor, but this is a throwaway.

I've been with my fiancée for four years. We are great together. No problems and I look forward to a lifetime of happy marriage.

Over time however, I have started to feel a burden of pressure as one of the only friends in her life. Outside of me and her direct family, she doesn't have anyone close to her.

Every other female that I know has a number of close girlfriends where they can pick up the phone and organise lunch, yoga, a night on the town, a massage, hair &amp; beauty spa, football game, whatever.

When I have free time, I can go around to a buddy's place and hang out for hours on end. I don't have a cast of a thousand friends by any means - just three or four close pals I can do anything and spend any amount of time with. She doesn't have that.

The upshot of all this is the added pressure it can place upon me. I feel obligated to do things and to organise things because she has no initiative or desire when it comes to being social.

We're not social butterflies by any stretch of the imagination. Our ideal Saturday night is sitting at home together watching a movie. But the difference is that I can pick up the phone and organise a full day out with my friends, while she cannot.

We have a number of mutual female friends, but nearly of them are ultimately partners of my male friends. She needs someone unconnected to me that she can go out with, talk to and spend time with.

Has anyone else experienced this situation with their wife/fiancée/girlfriend? How did you deal with it?

I love her to bits, but I just wish she had a broader friendship circle so there wasn't so much pressure upon me to be this 100% social and emotional provider (which of course I do my fair share of as it is).

If that's even a word.,255,78,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1dtu94/i_think_im_a_misandrist_if_thats_even_a_word/,"I'm a girl. I can't say this with any authority, and I've never even articulated it in my mind but I'm fairly certain I foster biased notions about the opposite sex. Kinda like, you're a douche bag until you prove otherwise. And I never really.. realised this. Until my friends sat me down and told me, no, drew my attention to how I dealt with guys. Every question any guy asked would be answered with sarcasm, spite, just general snarkiness. And the smart ones after being startled would give it right back which would take me aback, because I didn't understand why they were being so mean to me. The rest usually thought I was just annoying, and walked away, which I didn't understand either.

But in hindsight, after going through how I actually converse with any guy.. it hit me as odd. If a girl asked the same question I'd be friendly. I mean, I'm generally a nice person.

And then, after sort of coming to terms with it, I tried to trace it's origins. And, I'll reiterate, I have no way of knowing and have absolutely no authority to go around diagnosing and  making sweeping declarations but I'm fairly certain it stems from boarding school.

25 boys, 5 girls. I was teased a lot by all the boys, and I kept to myself. The school was kind of anal about keeping the boys and the girls apart what with it being residential and all. So, I don't know. But I do know I despised all my class boys, and thought they were the lowest scum on earth. I went to an all girls for a few years after that, and now, bam, college.

Sigh. There have been so many nice guys, who after maybe a couple month of interaction will just, you know, sort of get exasperated, and/annoyed and go away, and I didn't even know why they did that.

I'm apparently condescending, and I belittle them, and I dismiss them, and when they act the same I get all butthurt. I honestly had no idea. But I would not doubt this at all, because it explains so much.

I really, really don't want to hate men. What do I do?

Edit: Since so many people keep telling me - Misandry is a word. I did not know how to apply it to myself. I suffer from it? I've developed it?

You guys did me a huge favor by providing me some source material. For those of you who don't know what the fuck is going on, [the link is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/169j3k/what_caused_your_last_boner_this_is_for_a_womens/).

Anyhow, I gave my presentation in front of the class, just like everyone else, and wore my favorite suit (I own three, and definitely picked favorites). The presentation was essentially a minute of Freud, both good and bad, a minute of the science behind bonerfication (I did use that word in the presentation), and two minutes talking about all of Reddit's combined no-reason boners. I realize now that they all had reasons, but it's easier to just call them NRBs.

Anyhow, it went off without a hitch. It took me about 4 and a half minutes, and there was a brief Q&amp;A after. My teacher didn't fail me on the assignment (though I did get a lot of bullshit points knocked off) and I'm quite content with my grade after talking about penises in a women's studies class for 4 minutes.

The teacher, despite her ways, did claim to ""acknowledge the information presented"" by each student and would ""take it to heart"" in future lectures. I call bullshit, but eh, it's not a battle worth fighting. She didn't specifically say this after my speech, mind you. She said it at the end of the whole ordeal of our presentations.

As for the boners/information that went into my presentation, they were as follows (from the source thread linked above):

/u/RobotJim 's post of
&gt; Woke up today there it was! May have been bathroom related, had to go pretty bad in the morning.

&gt;...I saw a bed. Not kidding. I was walking down a city street and passed a linens shop, and in the window they had this big bed with a really poofy comforter and a ton of pillows...and yeah. Got a boner.

But when I'm having sex, and ESPECIALLY in the beginning of a relationship, I like to moan and make noises when things feel good to indicate what I like, that I'm enjoying myself, and so that I can get quiet when I don't like something and the guy (in my experience) knows immediately to switch to something else. Unless the guy is into vocal communication at every step (which isn't natural to me) this kind of sexy ""hot or cold"" guidance helps the guy get to know my body very quickly and makes sexual compatibility almost a non-issue from my end.

On the other hand, most guys I've been with don't make much noise (aside from grunts of effort during intercourse). This is really frustrating to me, especially when I'm doing something like giving a BJ where I can't maintain good eye contact and basically have to hope that, beyond avoiding teeth-contact, I'm being ""all that I can be"" in pleasing him.

I don't currently have an SO, and plan on communicating this (however awkwardly!) to future partners - but I'm just curious about whether there's a reason most guys don't make noise in bed.

For silent men: Do you think it's unnatural to make noise? Unmanly? Are you stifling your moans or just not feeling the need to force vocalization? 

As I said, I don't find moaning natural (especially after years of learning to masturbate a quietly as possible... sorry former roommates), but has it occurred to you that it's useful for partners and it's just too weird, or do you just never think about it or not like it?",,False,,t5_2s30g,False,,,True,t3_1f68ib,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1f68ib/why_are_so_many_men_silent_in_bed/,

Not because we want to get sugar coated or deceptive answers. 

I don't claim to know what goes on in the heads of all men, but I grew up with four brothers, and I was a tomboy who has had mostly male friends all of my life. I also work in a predominantly male profession, where I have met and grown close with thousands of men over years. I have been close friends and colleagues with enough guys to know a lot of the answers getting voted to the top are not representing enough of the male population. 

Most of the honest answers I see men give here get down voted to oblivion if they aren't nice and sweet and just what you think we want to hear. I don't know if it is the girls coming in here and down voting answers they don't like, or if it is guys who want to create this noble reputation for themselves, but it is damaging the integrity of this sub-Reddit. The same thing goes on in r/askwomen.

I don't think all men are assholes, or pigs, or insensitive sex maniacs. Quite the contrary. You are just different from us. That is why we come to this sub to get your opinion. So we know what is going on in your head, not so you can tell us what you think we want to hear.

Guys please consider your answers. You should be totally anonymous in here, if not, create a throw away. Don't say whatever you think will make you sound the nicest. Say what you really think. What you would say to your buddies in the locker room. What you wouldn't want your mom or grandma to know. Also, don't down vote other guys who don't share your opinion. Everyone's opinion is valid, even if they are a total asshole. You aren't helping these girls by hiding the truth from them.

Ladies, think about what you are reading. Don't always up vote, just because it's an answer you want to be true. Does the statement align with what you know about men, or does it sound like bullshit? If you think it is honest, even if you don't like it, up vote. If you see a post that is trying to schmooze you over, down vote. If you have been around guys in your life, or browse Reddit enough, you should know all guys aren't always sweet and innocent. Would you really even want them to be?

Also, guys. I see a lot of you disagreeing with other guys' posts, using statements like, ""Not all guys are like that"", or ""Don't group me in with your opinions."" Those responses just make you look like a liar and a pussy. If you don't agree, just give your opinion. No need to berate or down vote other guys for being honest, just because you disagree or you think they are chauvinistic.

**TL;DR:** Take the answers voted to the top with a grain of salt. You might find more honest ones at the bottom of the page. Don't down vote, just because you disagree.

---Hello gentleman. I am a young woman who has lived her entire life with folliculitis and Hidradenitis suppurativa. It is mostly on my buttocks and a little on my groin region. I've been teased by best friends and what not, and I'm terrified guys will run for the hills when they see me naked. 

I have had sex, but always in a committed relationship, in the dark and NEVER doggy style :( I am terrified no guy will be accepting, especially because the ass has become the body part de jure the last few years. My dermatologist has prescribed clindamyacin to help, but the scarring is impossible to get rid of it seems. 

Anyway guys, is this something you could get used to? Or would the majority of men be grossed out? Honest answers are appreciated :)

Honestly, I was upset that I had to even ask him to do this. He normally baths once every 9 days, sleeps in his work shirt then goes to work with the same shirt on at least 3 days a week. We are both smokers so after about 2 days of him not showering the stench from old tobacco smoke, BO and dried sweat start to turn my stomach and make it hard for me to be intimate with him. 

He has been living as a bachelor with roommates for at least 6 years but now we are living together but it seems as if he still thinks of himself as living as a bachelor. This is not a deal breaker per-say but just something very frustrating for me to deal with. I am not a neat freak but I do keep my house and myself clean and all that I am asking from him is to take better care of himself. Is that wrong of me to try and ""change"" him in this fashion?

**TL;DR**
I asked my BF to bath more frequently since he only does it about once every 9 days and he got mad. He showered but he was still upset. Was I wrong?

**edit**
I just want to thank you all for your input. I do realize that 9 days is not normal at all and I knew this before making this post but I do believe that some people do go a few days without showering, which most of you have confirmed. While I am not sure if my bf is suffering from depression I am going to be more aware of things that go on with him and see if I notice anymore warning signs. 
To those of you who say that you would never date anyone who wasn't hygienic please keep in mind that *A) when we were dating I did not know that he was not showering everyday because he never smelled before or at least I had never smelled him.* And *B) When you love someone as much as we love each then there are somethings that you may over-look and you definitely would not break up with them over something like this, you would address it first, just like I have done.* 
I must say that it did hurt to read some of the comments that were made about him being, ""filthy"" ""dirty"" ""disgusting"" ""a bad boyfriend"" or ""he doesn't care about you if he is doing this"" because he really is a great man. He is close with his family which is very important to me because I am not close with mine at all. He is also one of the most talented musicians that I have ever met. He is the guy that knows everyone and if you didn't know him you would want to because he is just that nice. We kick-it like best friends because he is my best friend. No  one makes me laugh like him and there are very few people in this world (living or dead) that know everything about me and accepts all of my flaws, faults and baggage.

Throwaway because (duh) he uses reddit.

So I've (24F) been seeing this guy (23M), super-attractive, sweet, smart, blah blah. I really like him. Fourth date and I hop into bed with him, but he's really hesitant. Most guys would be rubbing their boner into my thigh at that point, but he's so... polite. So I ask him, and yup, he's a virgin and he'd only kissed one girl before me.

Turns out that not only is he a virgin, but I think he's got a pretty bad case of Death Grip. He masturbates a very specific way, and it's way more vigorous than my delicate vagina could ever be. I gave him head (and I give GOOD head, that is an objective analysis, not my inflated ego) and he thought it was only OK. Only when I was hitting a specific spot with a lot of tongue pressure did he really like it.

Add to all that: he's got a bad case of performance anxiety and had trouble maintaining an erection.
Reddit, I'm not that great in bed, and I just know this is going to be an epic disaster. But I like the guy and I want to make him happy. What do I do?

n.b. I've asked him what he wants, and he couldn't really tell me. I asked him what turns him on and he said ""I like science."" T-T Help, Reddit, heeelllp.

Bonus questions for dudes: What helps alleviate your performance anxiety?

We talked for almost three hours. This morning he finally called his doctor and made an appointment, and I was right there with him.

At this point of our relationship, there are no secrets. To me, there is no detail that is ""TMI."" 

He tells me about the shape of his shit. The colour. What he ate during his work hours in order to generate the specific type of shit he takes. 

Okay. 

So today I mention I had my period. I talk about how bloated I am. Then I say something like, ""man I wish I hadn't seen my period, because now I will feel the cramps more--like how a papercut doesn't hurt until you've seen it bleeding."" 

Then this launched a request from him that I don't talk about my period. That I should ""keep that stuff to myself, or to my girlfriends."" He's asked this of me before, albeit not as seriously as he did this morning.

When I asked him to elaborate the reasoning behind this, his response is, ""as your boyfriend, I don't want to hear about that stuff."" 

But what I'm hearing is, ""I don't want to know embarrassing stuff about you because we're **not that close**."" 

Yet we're close enough for me to hear him talk about his shit, literally? 

His reasoning to that is ""we're different, I'm a guy, it's not a surprise for me to be disgusting. **You're a lady** and you should act like one."" 

So............ can you guys help me here? He didn't have a lot of time to explain further as we both had to head off for work. And because--**horray horray**--of my stupid hormones during this time of the month, my scumbag brain won't stop obsessing over the idea that ""maybe he doesn't love me the way I love him--not enough to look past the embarrassing, disgusting nature of human waste."" 

So maybe one of you guys here can explain this mentality better than he can. Or maybe he's just a scumbag boyfriend who makes too many demands. I would really appreciate you guys weighing in and it would really help me to understand this about men. 

Thanks!!! 

------------------------


**Update**: Holy crap! I go to work and I come home to this silly question being top post in /r/AskMen! 

I really appreciate all of the comments, honestly. Though my ""panic"" pretty much dissipated after Release_the_KRAKEN gave some SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME advice early on.

Now I'm more embarrassed that I told a whole bunch of strangers over the internet that my boyfriend and I share poop-details. Some of you were pretty grossed out by that... wells, haters gonna hate, right??

Those of you who feel like my boyfriend is probably sexist. I can honestly say that I have never gotten that impression from being with him for the last 3 years--and this was the only occasion to ever have set me off. In this case, I think the one off-handed comment about being a lady and what not is more of a slip of the tongue rather than him actually thinking that I'm inferior to him. I mean, it's not really sexist to recognize the fundamental differences between men and women as long as you're not saying one is better than the other, right? 

Anyway, thank you all again for the suggestions, opinions, advice, and comments! 


-----------------------------------------


**Another Update (I think you guys will like this one)**:

When my boyfriend got home last night, he immediately apologized. He said he had been rude to me and he must have been in a bad mood. He said that it was wrong of him to ask me to stop sharing even details he found disgusting because it would be a double standard. *I KNEW he wasn't sexist!* 

Honestly, this was a one-off situation, so I'm inclined to believe him when he said it was just a one-off mistake that won't happen again, even though he still finds it difficult to get used to a visual of bloody vagainas. We talked about it some more and we decided a on a middle ground--I'll talk to him about my periods, but I just won't go into as much visual detail as I tend to do (I have the tendency to ""show off"" when it comes to gross things) because we do want to keep our sex life alive and well. 

So yay for communication. I guess this is why we've been together for 3 years in a virtually perfect relationship.

I'm 32F and I feel rather absurd having to ask your advice on something:
I have recently gotten to know a man, who I like very much but who's interest in me I cannot get a handle on. We see each other a lot in group settings, and get on very well on a 1-1 basis.
Recently we've got into the habit of swapping graphic novels. It's his birthday soon and I've hunted down some rare-ish GNs that I though he'd like.

They arrived today and I'm now extremely nervous about giving them to him - I originally thought it would be a nice gift and he'd be touched, but I'm a bit worried it might be a bit much. Everyone else knows I'm really into him, and I think by now if he was into me he'd've found a way to show me. I don't want to come across weird and creepy.

Basically - do I give him an awesome birthday present or not? Will he be embarrassed do you think?
Thanks!

**EDIT: He's getting the gift, as the worst thing that can possibly happen is that he gets a birthday present he doesn't much care for and just says ""um, thanks"".

Lost, scared and inadequate. I have no idea what manhood is - I’ve never seen an example. Never had something to look up to.

I have a father (and I still live at home), it’s just that he is a passive, zombie-like alcoholic. Weak, grumpy, whiny, cowardly and panicky. Without life, happiness, ambition, motivation, initiative, manners and even hygiene. Think about the things “man” is supposed to represent in the family and then change it to the opposite, negative side. All of it in some levels automatically passed onto me. Except I don’t drink. I often think that no example would’ve been better than a bad one. At least he wasn’t aggressive…

My cousins’ (at whose home I’ve spent half of my childhood) father was an alcoholic and died in the streets as a bum. Father of my classmate who I visited a lot is another passive alcoholic. One neighbor in our house is a short-fuse neurotic who screams at his children in a fast, high-pitched voice. Other neighbor doesn’t have kids at all and is of “soft, shy and quiet guy” type.

When I talk to men (be it of my age or older) it feels as weird as talking to the member of the opposite sex for some people. The only type of people that I feel comfortable around are middle-aged women. Probably because I’ve spent the most time with them. Girls? Never had one. Even if I knew how, I wouldn’t know what then to do. I see people my age marrying and having kids, while I still feel like one. I was born when my father was 23. A job? Well, I freelance as a graphic designer, but it’s because I wouldn’t know how to fight for the “real one”.

However, one of the guys I've been with seemed kind of disappointed/frustated when I couldn't, I think he felt like the whole point of sex was for both of us to orgasm, he tried really hard to get me there, and so when he had and I hadn't it was some kind of failing - I'm sure he was just trying to be attentive and gentlemanly but I felt like I was a failure.

Anyway, Ive been with my girlfriend for 4 years now Things are great were both presumably happy, we love each other, But she has this childhood friend... She swears up and down that she would never cheat on me, her family was broken up by her mother cheating on her father, but he and she are *close*.

He knows things about her I dont, they constantly text each other even late at night, he lives an hour away and when he comes to visit they usually go somewhere alone (like on long walks together,yea i know), I think mainly because she knows I dont like him, when he in our apartment and im in another room the whisper to each other, his mom likes my girlfriend, when it time for him to leave its a 20 min 'goodbye session' rather than a 'see you later' and heres the kicker, on the last vist he brought a gun with him just in case I attacked him...


It all sounds pretty sketchy, she gets touchy too whenever I approach her about it saying things like ""a guy and a girl can be friends and not want to fuck each other."" I believe it from her perspective but from his, I dont know. She doesn't seem like the type that would cheat, Ive been cheated on before, and if anything I feel like she having an emotional affair with him. Im inclined to turst her because she despises cheating and I love her. Some advice would be much appreciated.

**UPDATE**

reading your replies really made me think I'm a royal idiot, but here is an up date and answer to questions.

First of all the gun situation: This is the United States, in the mid-west and it was an AR-15 assault rifle a common weapon here.  He never brought the gun in the house, he left it in the truck. The situation of him mentioning it was his mother suggested he bring to protect himself against me, but to me that sounded like he was using his mother as a scapegoat. Perhaps I'm blowing this out of proportion.

For him to feel threatened i have no idea. I don't think Ive ever said anything more than i absolutely had to greeting, salutations, when a question was asked, etc. I'm 5' 11"" almost 300 pounds, I played football as a linemen and practiced amateur boxing, and still lift regularly, so i guess I may be intimidating, to him who is slightly taller than me and very thin, but I never show dominance. I don't own any guns myself but i do have a large knife collection.

Im not abusive at all. She can do what ever she wants when ever she wants, and i never say otherwise. Im in a relationship with her, a significant part of her life, but im not here to dictate it. Its just this is a bit strange and odd behavior I think.


I talked to her about it briefly to day and i suppose i will again later tonight. She was upset. Very upset. she defended all of her behavior as such; *the long walks together* they both enjoy nature, *the whispering* they are right next to each other there is no need to talk loud, *the 20 minute goodbyes* they only see each other once a month or every few months, *the texting* apparently doesn't happen as often as i think, *the discussing personal things with him and not me* she says hes been through similar situations and can relate better than i can.

I told she can keep him as a friend but some of this behavior frankly makes me jealous and has to stop and that i feel like its an emotional affair, at which point she left, she had to go to work. I couldn't really tell if was pissed off or hurt she had tears in her eyes but she stormed off slamming doors and throwing things around. I don't know if i did a good thing or a bad thing, all i know right now that loneliness and the worrying what she maybe think hurts like hell...


**UPDATE 2**


Things got really fucking rocky after she got home. She came home locked herself in the bed room for 2 hour and didn't talk to me. After that she came to talk still tears in her eyes saying that there is nothing romantic going on between them but she does get emotional satisfaction from it. It was never her intention of me feeling hurt and feeling as if she is getting something from another man. She agrees  that from another point of view other than her own her action seemed questionable and she doesn't resent me for questioning them. She then explains that she is ready to end all with him in order to keep me. At this point I feel like shit.


The gun thing... I blew that *WAY* out of proportion, I didn't know but he had just purchased that gun like earlier that day and comment about his mother was supposed to be a joke. I am still going to talk to him face to face because I want to know his side of the story. This post and all I know is very one-sided, I only know my point of view, so take everything said with a grain of salt. I really make my girlfriend out to be the villain in this post, and she isn't. She one of the sweetest nicest women Ive meet, that's one of the reasons i love her.

I'm not leaving her and I'm not going to make her give up her best friend, not at least until i hear his side of the story.

UPDATE: After much contemplating, I did end up telling him. I based this on many different facts and personal opinions specific to my case. I am sure it would have likely been different in a different situation. I told him in person while he was over at my friend's place. Brought it up as casually as I could. Let it be known that I was ABSOLUTELY sure this guy was not going to kick my ass for many reasons, so that is why I did it in person.  I don't want anyone taking my course of action and then getting a broken jaw. I told him that is all I was going to tell him and that I was noping out of the situation right away. It was now his and her situation. He was obviously visibly upset and confused at me, her and himself (for ""being ignorant"" - people sadly blame themselves a lot of times). I made sure to tell him that it would be okay and he would make the right decision.  He left pretty soon after that and I have not heard from either party yet. Thanks a lot for everyone's input.

I always thought that the best kind of love you can develop is where you both just thoroughly enjoy each other's company and you want to grow old with that person and experience each day with them. But from what I noticed from my parents, as well as friend's parents it turns more into a ""we're good/really good friends and we happen to live together"". Sure they will have sex every now and then, or do something special on the anniversary but for the majority of the year they seem more content with living in their own world rather than enjoying it with their SO. Now they are by no means unhappy, but it just feels like an unsatisfactory way of spending the rest of their life. A good example of this is my friends parents. His dad plays WoW all day while his mom likes to sing. Yea he goes to work and support the family, and she does your basic housewife stuff, and they both come up to our house to visit but I feel like it's just so separate. My parents as well don't seem to be lovers anymore just good friends that live together, when I look at them I don't see any kind of a ""spark"".
All this being said I do thoroughly want to get married someday.

I guess my real question is: How do you feel for you SO after years of marriage, and how strong is that initial spark that you still have/lost?

Recently I introduced him to a friend of mine. I made it clear before hand that she had just gotten out of a relationship and it would be inappropriate for him to approach her as anything other than a friend and I would appreciate him not doing so. We all three went to lunch and played board games at a local game store and got along really well. 

Since then (about 4 months ago) he has taken to bothering her a lot. He texts her about four or five times a week and will blow up her phone with messages if she answers. He sits very close to her when he sees her in public (mostly at that same gaming store but he's gone up to the resteraunt she works at a few times). She doesn't feel threatened by him but is hesitant to tell him off because he is so nice and can be overly sensitive.

He doesn't realize it but it comes across really creepy. I'm one of the few female friends he has that is close enough to him to point this out. But he can be so sensitive I'm just not sure how to approach it without hurting his feelings. Is there any nice way to tell him how others view this behavior?

I'm 25/f... I'm also black/African American, so that may have something to do with this situation since most men seem to think they're too good to date us (unless we're biracial or rich, of course). 

Anyway I think of myself as a pretty normal, albeit cultured person. I don't have any money (that seems to be important to most guys these days), but I make enough to support myself. I pay my own way on dates unless he insists. I'm into philosophy and jazz. I'm tall and slim, guys definitely find me physicallly attractive... but I can't seem to find one that doesn't play these ""pua""esque mind games. I've tried different ages... From 18 to 50.

I'm just starting to wonder... Am I just going to have to settle for someone that I can sort of tolerate? I literally just want someone who will be genuine, care about me, be my friend and my lover. I don't care about his looks... I don't even care about his level of intelligence as long as he's sweet and genuine. Why is it so hard to find a guy like this?

Meanwhile the women who have no intellect (but dress fancy and have money or are just not black) get all they guys, who in turn complain about and blame me for... I don't know what to do anymore.

I don't want kids or marriage, I just want to feel loved and to be in love before I'm old or before I die.

So is the trick to just be fake? To pretend I'm a high maintainence sort of girl just to attract men?

I don't know what they want, but somehow I think a major problem here is the fact that I'm black.

I've had guys tell me to my face (non-black and black guys) that they would marry me if I weren't black... It's pretty disheartening. I'm not doing anything else wrong, so it has to be that. I guess this is just my lot in life. My standards aren't too high, I just want a nice guy. He could work at McDonald's on the fries with an IQ of 95 or be a genius CEO... I don't care as long as he is an honest, genuine guy that wants more than my body. I can't find him. I've tried for so long.

I hope you can help me find the best way of approaching this touchy subject. 

I just started dating a guy who'd previously been my study partner and who generally was in my circle of college friends. Foreplay and oral are out of this world, but we've attempted to have penetrative sex about four times now, and each time he goes soft as soon as he puts the condom on. He doesn't bring it up, instead he goes on to make me cum with fingers and hands, so kudos for him. 

I've read the /r/sex FAQ on this very subject, and I have a couple of solutions I'd like us to try. One, I've already purchased some condoms with a larger nominal width than the brand he uses, since he is a bit bigger than average. I also want to suggest that he masturbates with a condom on so that he gets used to it. In the absolute worst case, I'm on birth control so I'm also willing to work towards going no condom + birth control + pulling out. 

The big obstacle is how to bring this up. He definitely seems NOT to want to talk about it, or maybe thinks that I don't notice, because when it happens he quickly goes back to performing oral on me, and when I come, cuddles me and kinda ignores the fact that we were preparing to have penetrative sex. I know he can't feel great about the whole situation, but I really really like him, and I want nothing more than to make him feel as good as he does me.

[Guest: What’s wrong with Seattle’s dating scene](http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2021142903_daniellecampoamoropedxml.html)

&gt; I quickly learned that Seattle men are far different from any other I’ve encountered: shy, timid and seemingly incapable of striking up a conversation, let alone offering to buy a female a drink. The Seattle males’ inability to successfully merge with their female counterparts reminds me of the colossal cluster that is I-5 onramps. Much like a Seattleite merging onto a freeway, our men’s apprehensive tendencies leave them incapable of finding either the open lane or the open bar stool.

&gt; However, Alaskan mating rituals cannot be boiled down to a simple numbers game. The northern, hardworking, truck-driving men of my hometown are born with confidence in their veins and courage in their one-liners.

&gt; It’s true not every man from the last frontier can be described as such. Some still live with their parents, are dealing with their third DUI, or are desperately attempting to relive their high-school glory days. But even those men aren’t afraid of letting a woman know they’re interested. They have no problem requesting phone numbers or purchasing beverages or, when the time calls for it, throwing fisticuffs if it means gaining the attention of that one woman who caught their eye. While some of it may be unnecessary, no one can honestly call them bashful.

I was raised to ask someone out if I liked them, that simple. Recently, one of my girl friends worked up the courage to ask a guy out and it went poorly.  She is really shy and I am much more thick skinned so giving advice was a bit difficult.

I would love your input on a few questions, mostly because girls get very little advice on **how** to ask men out, only the encouragement to do so.

1. If you do not assume a girl would ever ask you out and one does, how would you react? If the guy (or you) freezes up out of surprise, how should a girl react or approach the situation differently to prevent this?
2. I know some guys feel emasculated (from personal experience about 40% openly stated this) if a girl asks him out? If this is how you feel, what would you want us to do instead?
3. If a girl you were pining after rejects you, do you get support from your friends afterward? If so, what kind? If not, how do you personally cope?

I'm sure more questions will come up in the comments. I've asked my guyfriends questions like these before, but I always value a variety of opinions.

I am a 27F and my bf is a 27M who recently told me he wants a prenup. This is something he decided years ago, when he was single and before he knew me, because of how a previous ex-girlfriend screwed him over as far as finances. I understand his logical concerns and fears. I understand the notion of ""plan for the best but expect the worst"". Logically I get it. But essentially what you have is two legal documents, one saying ""I'll love you forever"", and the other saying ""But if I don't, I promise not to screw you over"". Am I the only one that sees the contradiction there? Shouldn't the first trump any other promises made?

I've thought about telling him I'd sign it no matter what, because I'm sure of us. But don't I want to be with someone who is sure of us too? Am I just being naive? Shit happens and people change, yes. Life has taught me this many times over, yet I am still willing to throw all that ""logic"" out the window in the name of ""forever"", if forever exists, because I truly believe he's my best shot at making that happen. Should I hold out for someone who feels the same way? Or is this something we can agree to disagree on?

The more I think about it the more confused I get. Just wondering what Reddit thinks.

We have been together for about 5 years but recently she just got a new job and met a lot of new friends that she goes out with at least once a week. When she goes out it is usually to meetup with these friends at a restaurant and then they go do whatever. They usually end up at someones house drinking or going to bars etc to drink and then she ends up getting a ride home from one of them very late at night.

Here is my problem. She does this every weekend now and at least half of the group is guys. I am always freely available to hang out when she is and I never get invited to hang out or meet these people. In fact she doesn't want me to meet them because she says that they wont like me and that they talk shit about people like me ""long haired metal head"" and she doesn't want me to end up getting in a fight with them. I asked her why she would even hang out with those types of people then and she says because ""they make me happy and I enjoy their company"" etc. I have called her out asking if she is embarrassed of me which she says no but who really knows. All I know is that if I meet new friends or if I have existing friends that she is more than welcome to hang out. In fact I would want her to meet my friends. I am just a bit upset that she is leaving every weekend, sometimes Friday and Saturday night to go out with them and I never get to meet them and it bothers me. I have explained this to her but it always turns into arguing and her saying that she isn't doing anything wrong. 

Also I am not worried about her cheating. I know she wouldn't do that so that is the farthest from my worries. I am more upset about her having new friends that she goes out with more than me and a majority of them are guys that I am not allowed to meet.

She's kind of the always has to have all eyes on her girl. She likes attention no matter what she says to deny it. She's a flirt. But she's also beautiful, caring, and loving which seems to mask her bad side. Now I've struggled with trust issues my whole life. I just can't seem to rely on someone and I don't know what started it. 

Just a little backstory. Before I legitimately started to date her we had this kind of thing going on where we were basically together, but we didn't objectify us as a thing. We still stayed up late talking to each other on the phone, going on dates, the usual when in a new relationship. Then she was at some party and met a guy. I was entirely unaware of this and still thought we were together. She dropped the bomb that she was in a relationship with him and that we were through. She was very sympathetic and felt really bad, but I played it off as no big deal. We still talked for a few months here and there. Then after a little while we started to fall for each other again and finally were in a relationship. I gave her a second chance after cheating on me the first time.

Now to main point. I have had lots of suspicions about her cheating on me for about three months now. She always talks about her exes and other guys she's been with. For some reason she feels the need to tell me all about her past relationships and what kind of you know, ""stuff"" they did. She still regularly contacts her exes and other male friends. I don't stalk her phone or anything, but when I'm sitting right beside her while she's doing it it's kind of hard to miss. Presently, one of exes is LIVING with her. He was in trouble with the police and needed a place to stay. She still lives with her mom, wether that means anything or not. Now, tonight I was talking to her about seeing her tomorrow night and she was saying how it would be much better to do it earlier in the day. I'm alright with this normally until I asked why and she changed the subject. Eventually I got her to speak and she said that it was too late and that I never can just say okay I always have to argue. I was talking about meeting her at 8PM then having her home whenever she wanted. We have done this all the time and now suddenly it's too late?

I started dating a new guy about a month ago, and we have not had sex yet. We've been friends for a long time and are pretty close. I don't want to doom the relationship from the start because of a stupid one night stand, and I don't think he necessarily has a right to know, but I'm not sure if I should tell him or not. In all likely hood it will be over with in a week and I'll be fine. Is it not worth making a big deal about with the new boyfriend?

Also worth noting, everyone is fully supportive of my decision and no one is ethically against it in the situation, so that wouldn't be a problem.

I'm 20 and just finished my second year in college, and to cut to the chase I've never had a sexual experience outside of prostitutes and strippers. I didn't think about girls much at all throughout high school, and was basically the most carefree person imaginable; I didn't really want anything or care about anything, I just sort of did stuff.

When I got to college something changed, I don't know if it was the constantly being around pretty girls or a late dose of puberty, but it hit me like a truck instantly I wanted to have sex incredibly bad with nearly every girl I saw. Suddenly for the first time in my life there was something I desired, honestly I didn't even know what it felt like to want something until then. I started paying for sex about halfway through my first year of college and it's weaned quite a bit since then. I spend summers at home with my parents and don't have a source of income or transportation so it's less of an option now, I really want to do it again at this point as soon as an opportunity arises.

To cut to me now, I haven't gotten over that desire at all. Virtually all I think about is girls sex and intimacy, mostly girls I know at school. I'm basically attracted to all of the girls I know. I really would prefer having sex with any of them to what I do now; there's nothing I want more now than to have sex with a girl who's actually attracted to me.

Occasionally he starts talking about how he loves me, but I cut him short and repeat, that I don't like him in that way.

Now to the necklace... I received it yesterday in the mail with a ""love you"" note. It's a cute silver one with a heart. I haven't talked with him yet and I'm wondering what I should do.

Would it be insulting to return it to him? (I don't have an address however, so would need to ask.) Should I just keep it and thank him? Wouldn't that be a bit mixed signals?

I realize this means he hasn't given up on me and it frustrates me. Would be awesome if I liked him that way, but the only thing in common we have is gaming and truly it seems like he doesn't understand or know me, that he's more in love with the idea of a relationship with someone (as far as I know, he's never been in one).

So men of Reddit... what should I do?

Sent him a text where I said thanks, but I can't accept the gift, because I don't feel that way for him, so could I have his address to return it. Waiting for an answer.

Thats my previous post up there.

My update is, I went on a second date with the dude.  I pussied out on making the move to kiss. we ended up hanging for like 5 hours or so and I ended it with a hug because i felt something was a little off. I had hoped he was just painfully awkward, but then this afternoon I got Friendzoned.  (seriously, a dude from okcupid wants to be my pal) 

his reasons were: 

- I'm too dominating for him 
- I came on too strong

Then i got the whole ""I'm interested in you as a person and want to hang out with you and be your friend."" but then got told I was pretty and had really nice lips...  

Over all, disappointed and glad i did not kiss his face.  Back to OKC for me after I eat this pie and weep softly while playing Pokemon black2.

He lost his job two weeks ago and has been all kinds of depressed since.  He still has plenty of savings and he's started getting his unemployment benefits, so he's not in any immediate trouble, and he's been interviewing since last week.  I think he's doing great, he says he feels like shit.

With this in mind, and since his birthday was yesterday, I figured I had to step up my game to cheer him up.  He told me he didn't want anything, but I know he's wanted a Vita since they came out but he never buys himself any games until they've been out a year or two.  So I bought him one, wrapped it up in a frilly pair of my bra and panties, and gave it to him after Sunday-morning-happy-birthday-nakkies at my place.  

He said he didn't want it.  I said too bad, so sad, happy birthday.  He asked me to take it back, I said no.  He asked for the receipt so *he* could take it back, and I said tough shit, he has to accept that people love him and want to give him shit and I didn't have the receipt anyway (a little lie; I kept the receipt in case I got the wrong games to go with it).

He got quiet, then jumped out of bed, put on his clothes, and went outside and smashed it.  He turned around at me and screamed, ""I told you not to get me anything!"" and hopped in his car and left.  Now he won't answer his phone and I'm just dumbstruck.  

Men of Reddit, what the actual fuck happened yesterday?  Who the fuck is the ungrateful shit who looks and sounds like my boyfriend?

**UPDATE** My boyfriend left a note on my computer chair when I was at work (we have the keys to each other's place).  It said, ""How I reacted was inexcusable.  This should cover the cost of the Vita.  I'll understand if you don't want to talk to me again.""  He also left $300 behind.

I don't know where to go from here.  This is the second time he said he'd understand if I left him; the first was right after he lost his job.  I told him he was full of it, and that I wasn't the kind of woman who would leave someone over that (i.e., a bitch).  He seemed genuinely surprised by that.

I'm so mad and upset?,170,54,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/186q9p/what_should_i_do_the_next_time_im_harassed_by/,"I'm a girl in my early 20's attending university. Yesterday, after my classes were finished and it was the end of the day (around 5:30pm) I was walking through the main building's hallway to go home when a group of tall, intimidating guys (maybe 4-6) were walking in the opposite direction towards me.  Anyway they looked me over as I past them, and then one of them suddenly grabs my arm and says ""hey, you remember me, don't you? Don't you?"" These were all obviously strangers so I was really frightened and said ""no"" and tried to pull my arm away. The other guys were saying things too, yelling at me, but I just remember being so scared and finally freeing my arm. I was so scared I wanted to just bolt down the hallway but I didn't want to run and cause a scene since the hall was not empty -  there were a few people sitting on benches against the wall or walking past me. So I opted for walking really fast away from them instead. I still heard their voices close behind me for a while, shouting at me, and I actually feared they were following me. 

Luckily, they didn't follow me but honestly, I've never been so afraid in public in my life. The fact that it happened in a hallway with other people makes me really uneasy. I wondered why no one stepped in too. :( Am I over-reacting? What should I have done? Or, what should I do if a similar situation occurs in the future? 

This isn't the first time I've been ""harassed"" in public by a guy, but it is the first time a group of guys participated and actually grabbed me. :( I'm still shook up and mad. Are there ways to avoid these situations from occurring again? 

**p.s.** please don't say walk with a friend, since it isn't possible to walk with friends all the time. Plus I don't have many friends anyway (social anxiety makes it hard to meet people and start friendships in university).

**EDIT:** I just got back from work a few hours ago, logged onto Reddit and I gotta say I'm completely overwhelmed by all the responses!! Thank you everyone for your replies. Originally I was going to post this in the Askwomen section but then I was like 'wait, who better to ask than actual guys?'

&gt;
&gt;I can cognitively understand the idea, but in my world (a 20-something woman), male sexuality is celebrated. Advertisements, media, movies, dating, adult industry, books- they tend to be catered to the man getting off, the man being attracted. The woman is the object of desire, 10/10.
&gt;
&gt;In my personal life- sex has generally ended when the man gets off, a woman looks good when she is appropriately ""fuckable"", and the majority of my male friends have never or rarely felt as though their sexuality has been looked down upon or anything similar.
&gt;
&gt;It reminds me of the quote- ""Everything in the world is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power."" -Oscar Wilde.
&gt;
&gt;Thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;Edit: Gentlemen, the reason I don't ask [1] /r/AskMen is they make their opinions on the topic very clear. I am already aware of the general standpoint of the subreddit.
&gt;
&gt;I also do discuss this with all my male friends/acquaintances. My goal is to encourage discussion, not argue.

I'm sure a few people here have browsed the original thread over at /r/askwomen and a few people mentioned asking the question in /r/askmen.

So I'm x-posting since I couldn't find any existing post specifically about it and I'm sort of interested in knowing what we men as a group think (the subject as a whole has definitely been touched on in various ways before).

Is the being-with-two-women scenario one of those things that guys like to fantasize about but don't actually want to do in reality? Or did we just run into some bad luck during our initial search?  Curious to hear from other guys on this.

So I stayed at her place once again last night and we talked about the sex. She told me she does want to do it, but wants to take it slow for my sake. I said awesome. Like I told her before, the ball is in her court and I am okay with whatever decision she wants to make. 

After talking for a while we go to her room and lay down. As I'm laying there she slowly works her hand down towards my dick and starts giving me a handjob. She then proceeded to get up from the bed and gave me a pretty amazing blowjob. The only thing is, I had been drinking all night and had pretty serious whiskey dick at that time. I was hard as a rock but just couldn't make an orgasm happen. While she's going to town, I realized that I was laying there like a dead fish and decided I needed to help her along as well. So I slowly reached down and started rubbing her pussy. She was **WET**. I asked her, ""why didn't you tell me you were so horny?"" After it was evident that my whiskey dick wasn't going to do anything she asked, ""would you want to help me squirt?"" Uhh... does a bear shit in the woods? 

She goes in gets a towel and lays it under her. I put my fingers inside her, asking what she wanted me to do. ""Just go in and out, I'm not picky."" She starts rubbing her clit and I start fingering her pretty fast. Within a minute she was moaning and her body was shaking. Almost immediately after that, she starts GUSHING all over the bed and my jaw drops open. I take my hand away (which is soaking wet) and just look at her and kiss her. 

**TL;DR-** Had an awesome night with her, the sex might still be coming. She told me she wants to take it slow for my sake and not rush it. I had whiskey dick. She squirted. A lot.


I also wanted to say thanks to everyone on this forum for being cool as fuck and honest.

I've read many articles about the rise of the 'man-child' (a term I despise).  These men have apparently made the decision to just enjoy life without the hassle of marriage.

Personally speaking, I've made this decision long ago.  But that was mostly after a careful introspection showing that I am simply not wired to be in a meaningful, committed relationship.  Not because I wanted to play video games and build Lego constructions. (Which I do, but that's not the point.  Shit's cool, yo.)

Why is it that funny women aren't preferred but rather women who laugh are?

It's funny (ha...) that men say they would prefer women with a sense of humor, but this actually translates into ""women who will laugh at my jokes and think/say I'm funny."" The women who can joke around with the boys are seen as friends, one-of-the-boys, and definitely not within girlfriend-material. Apparently the girls who can handle themselves and joke with the guys make their boyfriends more uncomfortable than proud that their girls can handle themselves in a social setting.

Fellas, I'm a M27 and what was promised to be my golden years has turned out to be the most miserable time of my life. I graduated college several years ago and I'm currently working in an office doing a desk job that I'm not particularly crazy about and in recent months I've really just kind of checked out. I make enough money to pay rent, buy groceries, and to go out a few nights a week.

Growing up, I wasn't the most popular kid but I had a lot of friends and was a happy-go-lucky guy. I did well in high school, played sports, went to college, and prepared for life. But you know when you're in school you don't know a damn thing about life? All you know is that tomorrow is the final exam and you've spent all month not preparing for it. Your prime concern was to make friends and pass your exams. **The Real World** was this mystical place that everyone talked about but really had no idea what it was. So you graduate and you trick yourself into thinking it's a piece of cake. After I graduated, I partied my ass off. Clubs, bars, raves, house parties, booze, you name it, every single weekend. I had some money, a car, an awesome core group of friends. Meeting people was so easy it was a joke. Everyone was friendly and open and less judgemental. Meeting women was effortless, *Haaaaave you met Ted?*...literally that easy.

Then I met the girl I was going to marry. How did I know I wanted to marry her? Because for the first time I didn't have to try to be cool around her. I could just be me. She told me she didn't care about my income or my status, she just wanted me. I gave all the partying up. All the good times and the friends and the booze and the long nights, all were on the shelf. I knew what duties were as a man, and I found a job ASAP so I could support us. She wasn't just my lover she was my best friend. A few years later she ended it, saying that I was just too stable and she wanted some danger in her life before she got too old. Essentially I was traded in for a spot on some guest list. This changed **everything**. I was suddenly alone, and very much aware of it. I couldn't understand what happened. I gave that relationship 110%. Hardwork was suppose to pay off right? Nope. Food stopped tasting good. The weather always seemed cloudy. I lost 40lbs in 2 months. She started sending me pics of her new boyfriends, and calling/texting me non-stop. This is still happening today. My parents finally asked me to go talk to a shrink. Recently, I asked her why she decided to burn our bridge, and she said because if she couldn't get a positive reaction out of me, she'd settle for a negative one. She told me she's found someone new who makes her happy, and they might get married. I asked why she keeps calling me then. She doesn't know. Fuck.

That was 2 years ago, and I haven't been myself since. I'm anxious now and distrusting of people, especially women. Remember when I said I had a lot of friends? That's down to a handful, and even less of whom I can really trust. Loneliness is the killer. **ALL** of my buddies are either in long term relationships or engaged or married or have kids, and buying homes, and climbing the corporate ladders, or starting their own businesses, and the one single friend has become a recluse. On Friday night I'll literally go down my contact list and see what people are up to.

When I do make it out to the bars and clubs, I see all the young 22 year old girls hustling all the young 22 year guys for drinks and then later shooting them down. It's not fun anymore. It's like seeing the inner workings of Disneyland. I find that as much as I enjoy partying, I just can't do it to excess like before. When I approach women, I'm suddenly labeled as a *creeper* and I don't even really want to get into their pants, just looking for conversation! I dated one other girl (F22) which ended because I wanted to be with her and she wanted go meet more guys. Can't say I blame her, she was pretty, and I remember what it was like to be 22. Suddenly, I'm concerned with school shootings and recessions and interest rates and credit scores and gas mileage and healthcare.

I've been told that life will significantly improve when I'm 30, but that's still a few years away. I feel that I don't really have a foothold on my life, but I have begun to make serious changes as far as health, fitness, and career (interviewing for new jobs and studying for the GMATs). I'm just really confused about the way things turned out. I feel like those in relationships at my age are too scared to break up because they might end up like me. 

So each morning as I put on my tie and gel my hair I look into the mirror and I force myself to smile. As far as my co-workers are concerned, I'm a happy guy just doing his job. In the grand scheme of things, life isn't awful. I have my health, awesome family, a few friends, my apartment, my car...then why am I still so unhappy? So fellow redditors in my age group: **WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?** How did you guys get through this? Does it get better? It's like I have so much pressure to succeed that it makes my head spin. **Should** I be buying a home? **Should** I be engaged? **Should** I be making 6 figures?

**EDIT**
Some of you have left some fantastic advice for me, both the nice and asshole ones. I think it's time I start putting the pieces together. I've tried before and I just keep feeling sorry for myself, maybe it's time to cut that crap out. It's comforting to know that I'm not the only guy out there wondering why things are so shitty.

I (23/F) have a problem with my guy friends, and needless to say since the only thing they have in common is me I've started to think that the problem might be me. All of my straight male friends have developed feelings for me pretty much since I developed boobs. We start off as friends, everything seems to be going well. I don't treat them any different than I do my female friends (maybe less talks about lipstick or the hot poli-sci professor). A few weeks into our friendship they declare they have feelings for me and when I turn them down (because I have a boyfriend, or because I don't have feelings for them) they get upset and eventually creepy, as in stalking and random 4 am angry phone calls and so on. I keep losing friends and it hurts. I don't understand why this happens, it's not like I'm super good looking or anything, I'm pretty normal. I wonder if I send signals without realizing but I don't think so, I'm pretty obvious when I flirt. I have lost girlfriends because of this too, they get mad at me if the guy they like ends up with feelings for me. Other than a core group of friends that I made as a child I can't keep friends because of this. Is there anything I should do short of beginning my conversations with men with ""I don't find you attractive and while I would like to be friends because you seem decent I will never, ever, ever date you"". Or is this normal and the When Harry met Sally thing is true? Can't I be friends with men? I apologize if this seems like a trivial thing but it is emotionally exhausting for me, and I imagine it's not pleasant for the guys either. 


TL; DR: What can I do to stop guy friends from developing feelings for me?

Each additional point of IQ increased the odds of virginity by 2.7% for males and 1.7% for females. But higher IQ had a similar relationship across the entire range of romantic/sexual interactions, decreasing the odds that teens had ever kissed or even held hands with a member of the opposite sex at each age.

The problem came last weekend, we were hanging out at her place and things started to heat up and we were both really into it when she pulls back and looks kind of sad/disappointed and tells me she really likes what we're doing and me but she is worried about moving too fast and getting intimate too soon, the way she looked left no doubts about it and me, being respectful of her wishes and not wanting to mess a good thing up told her that was no problem. We straightened up and spent a couple more hours just talking and watching tv before I went home. It wasn't awkward and there were no hurt feelings when I left, so I thought that was the end of it. 

The next day she texts me and we're talking normally when she says, ""you know, if you would've pushed for it last night I would've let you have me.""

Basically, I have a tendency to (like most of AskMen, it seems) pine over one or two girls in my extended friend group until for some reason we stop being in the same places at the same time, be it because of different classes, moving away, etc. I tend to like feeling familiar and comfortable around girls first &amp; befriend them before considering them relationship material.

The problem is that really fucks up my relationship life, because while I can be interested in a girl for awhile, I feel like bringing up these feelings would make a friendship awkward... Or at the very least different, like something's off--because the vast majority of the time there's zero sign of interest from the girl, and they're really not attracted to me that way.

So I'm wondering how it is that you actually ""date,"" form relationships, etc., growing essentially from boy-meets-girl, to *bam* boyfriend/girlfriend. What's the deal with this ""non-exclusivity"" and ""exclusivity"" I always hear about? It seems like my relationship-immature mind is missing a few steps between meeting and being ""a couple.""

* boy and girl appear to start talking/hanging out one-on-one for awhile,
* *magic*
* said boy and girl are now a couple.

As with a bunch others here, I'm not one to pick up girls at bars or clubs; they're not really my scene. Plus the personality of girls willing to meet guys at bars isn't usually compatible with mine.

**TL;DR** I know it's kind of a huge question, sorry... Shit, I'll be happy if I can even get just a starting point. I know a lot is just *""confidence!""* and *IDGAF* attitude that I'm still trying to gain, but are there any specifics?

When you're at the club and want to dance with a girl, which of these do you typically do?

I almost always do the first choice, because I feel like it's pretty disrespectful to just walk up and grab a girl without asking her first. If a girl starts grinding against me or something, I'll take the hint and dance back, but I never just walk up behind and grab her without permission. But obviously, you see people do that all the time. Maybe I'm just a sap, but I feel like that's not cool. And as a result, I dance with far less girls than your average guy probably does, haha.

Found a lot asking *why*, but not how much.

So, men of reddit, when in a committed, monogamous, happy/sexually fulfilling relationship, how often do you fantasize (sexually) about other women? I'm not talking about noticing a hot chick and going about your day. I'm talking about seeing a hot girl and then going home to fap to thoughts of her.

How often (percentage-wise) do you fantasize while masturbating? While getting a HJ? While getting a BJ? While having vanilla sex? While having (whatever passes for you) kinky sex?

Personally, from a woman's perspective, i rarely masturbate (because why wank when i can have sex?) and when i do, never think about other men sexually. I have no desire to because i find my boyfriend just *that* damn sexy and fulfilling. I also don't watch porn (hate the stuff, but that's a different topic) and have no desire to start. 

I know everyone will see people on tv, movies, the street, etc and think ""that is one damn fine attractive man/woman"" (hell, i do too!), but i'm curious how often men will then go and fantasize sexually (aka while giving themselves or otherwise pursuing an orgasm), since it seems women generally don't.

The story is relevant to the question, and this post is not for the purpose of me entertaining or impressing anyone, seeking validation, etc. 

I was harassed by a genuine fucking crazy guy on a train station yesterday. I won't go into detail, suffice to say that it was abundantly clear that he wanted me to react to his behavior (which mostly involved pushing me, bumping into me, and yelling ""are you fucking with me?!"" repeatedly and without provocation). I diffused the situation by calmly telling him that I was not fucking with him, and that I didn't know what I had done to offend him. After two or three repetitions of that exchange, he settled for calling me a bitch and stalking off to go do other crazy people things.

I don't think my brief description does the situation justice; I'm reasonably good at reading people, and it was abundantly clear that he was seriously psychotic and desperately wanted me to give him an excuse to hurt me. This was not a dick-sizing contest or an attempt to assert dominance in a social setting. There is no question in my mind that I reacted in the best way possible. Fighting him wouldn't have accomplished anything, and I don't feel that I was too submissive or that I bitched out or anything like that. I steered the interaction in the direction that I wanted it to go, and it worked.

But the whole thing has left me questioning my ability to defend myself. I won't say that I wouldn't have stood a chance, because I have done some martial arts training and I have worked out on and off for several years, but I did not feel that I could control the situation if it actually came to violence. 


So, my question: to what degree do you feel that you could defend yourself in a violent situation? How does it affect your feelings or actions in dangerous situations, and what (if anything) do you do to improve your chances?

Fucking seems to be the much more common case, while making love happens only in unique and special cases. So, what's the distinction? What creates the distinction?

I never really thought that I could have been raped and am still unsure of whether or not it's considered it or not. 

This happened 5 years ago. It was the first week that I started dating my gf, who I am still in a relationship with. She spent the night at my apartment and we were just crazy about each other, having sex as much as possible. One morning I wake up and she was sitting on top of me without a condom. The shock of waking up to a girl on top of you sounds like good fun and it felt good, but a little too good. I was really scared of cumming because it was the first time having sex without a condom on and I knew for a fact that she wasn't on birth control. I told her that we should stop and that I didn't want to cum inside of her. I tried to get her off of me but she held my hands saying that it was okay and that I could cum inside of her. Admittedly this was kind of hot, being dominated like this and being told that I could cum inside. A few thrusts later, I came. I remember it very clearly. The pleasure of the moment combined with the anxiety and fear that came over me when cumming inside of her. I just got her pregnant and she was okay with it because we went to buy a Plan B right after. 

I never really thought anything of it because we were in a relationship and have been for so long now. This happened once, but after a while I actually did get her pregnant and she had to abort the baby because we weren't ready for kids. I question now whether or not we would have stayed together or not if it hadn't happened. Like somehow, I was a prisoner to her sex. Like I owed her my affection because I got her pregnant and had to stay with her throughout the whole process. 

I probably should have written this with a throwaway, but I'm not afraid of hiding this. I just thought it would be good to get an opinion on the story. What do you guys think? 

Edit: Since the majority of you say that this is in fact rape:

I'm confused on the state of our relationship now. What does it mean? that I'm okay with being raped? Should I even be upset about it? If I'm not upset, would that count as consent?

The problem for me is that my financial position has just grown very strong as I get older, and I view marriage as being very financially risky with little upside.

Thanks to everyone who replied and helped me.

So basically, fiancé and I are both 26 and have been dating since we were freshmen in college. We were extremely sexually compatible (both of us had super high sex drives), held the same views, respected each other and loved each other. No major fights or issues. We each did our own thing from time to time (I'm not really clingy). I thought I was the love of his life (or so he claimed).

His female best friend has known him since middle school. He kissed her once in high school but she never reciprocated (he had feelings for her). Fast forward to college, he meets me, we start dating, fall in love. Fiancé still kept in contact with best friend. I never had a problem with it (like I said, I'm not clingy and trusting) because I can't tell him who he can and can't be friends with. Over the summer, we would be long distance and they would hang out. I never had a problem with it.

Fast forward to present times. Fiancé proposed last month and we are in the midst of wedding plans. Female best friend calls him up and claims she is having a sort of mental breakdown. I tell him to go cheer her up. He does and then spends the rest of the week super distant. 

Today, he was out all day, claiming he had to take care of something important. Came back around midnight and told me he has been in love with his female best friend for years and packed up some clothes and left to spend the night with her. 

So, we're over. I tried to make this post without sounding too emotional. To be honest, I have actually been sitting here in shock. I feel completely numb on the inside and no emotions are really registering.

I'm not really seeking words of advice or sympathy. I am just trying to make sense of what happened and whether I was really stupid and naive to be okay with my ex having a female best friend.

UPDATE: You guys have been great. I'm doing okay (chocolates and cat videos help). I'm also packing at the moment and will be staying at a girlfriend's house while I find my own place. I'm hoping to be gone before he gets back and I've decided that I will not speak another word to him or keep any contact.

Feel free to make throw-away accounts if you feel the need, so you can answer openly.

I'm self-identified as a straight man. I'm really open with my body, have very few boundaries, and find situations most people find embarrassing to just be kind of funny. I'm just afraid to ask friends these questions because I don't know what they would think. I would for something to get in the way of the relationships I now have with friends or for something to be known in my friend group that could come back to hurt me.

I dream of being married to a woman, having kids, the ""regular stuff"" expected in our society. When I think of sex, it's with a woman, and I am really not insecure about my body.

I, however, have this thing I feel is an issue... and I only feel it's an issue because I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone about it and need some guidance or maybe validation. I can get turned on by both straight and gay porn. I read it's common for guys who are open-minded enough to not have the immature ""ewwww, gross"" reaction to porn that depicts something they may not want to do, and it's possible to have arousal as a reaction to seeing someone of your own sex being pleasured because you know what you're seeing would feel like. So, I spent a lot of years looking at pretty much whatever porn I came across, and I can get off to it, but I still only desire a relationship with a woman. 

And, here's where it gets complicated. I've acted on this a few times. I won't get in to the details much, but I've gotten a BJ from a gay buddy one time -- late, talking about sex, and it... it happened. I've jerked off with four other dudes, and it involved mutual jerking. Once you bridge that gap, it's kinda like, ""oh, this is no big deal,"" and it's easy to try more. I have zero interest in the person attached to the dick (which is kind of a lie, because I only played around with guys who are around my age and fit?), but for some reason, it's really fascinating to play around with another guy, especially if it's anonymous and safe. I mean, it's just like checking out someone else's... this sounds so stupid, but it feels normal in the moment... someone else's ""equipment."" (If you must know how, I used the app Grindr to find guys who lived in my area, who identified themselves as having the same interests as me, and we only played safe.)

I mean... really... I think a lot more people do this kind of thing, or would do this kind of thing, if anonymity were guaranteed and there wasn't a stigma. And I know the Kinsey report said 30%-40% of all men have had at least one same-sex sexual encounter. But nobody talks about it.

So, please, be honest. Have you ever fantasized about this? Have you played around with another dude? And, biggest question of all... did you tell your future gf/wife about it? (I mean, I could see them not taking it well, because of the stigma.) Or would you just hush up about it, and continue the tradition of not talking about it?

For example, (I'll use a man and a woman for this example) you come home after a long day of work and are very tired. You doesn't want to have full on sex, but you ask your girlfriend if she'll just give you a blow job.

I don't have an SO right now, but this situation has happened to me many times in the past. While I enjoy pleasing my partner, I've never thought to ask for just oral sex for myself.

Have any men done this?

One of the comments got me thinking about this and I really just wanted to hear more about it.

When you're with a girl who seems great in almost every way - laid back, easy going, chill AND you're attracted to her - what is it about that relationship that can sometimes start to feel like dating a *friend* and not a *girlfriend*? Does it just boil down to compatibility or is there something that certain girls lack to make them more girlfriendy and less friendy.

I'm just interested because I often hear people talk about how the people they've found to be ""the one"" to be their best friend as well as their partner. I would also assume that being friends is incredibly important to a successful relationship because once the initial throes of passion die down and you settle into your life together, what you're left with is a solid foundation of trust and well, friendship to keep you going through the years.

I originally posted this in AskWomen, but someone over there suggested I repost my question here. Anyway, here's my situation:

I recently got a job tutoring people who are developmentally disadvantaged. The last question my interviewer asked me during my interview was, 'Would you be at all uncomfortable in a work environment in which you were the only male?' I told my interviewer that that wouldn't bother me at all, and then she proceeded to offer me the job and explain that all of my coworkers would be women. Anyway, what should I expect? In the past, I have only worked in settings with a mix of males and females. Dudes who have had jobs where all/most of your coworkers were women: Should I expect any significant differences in my new job from past work environments? If so, what do you think those differences will likely be? Additionally, is there anything you think I should know and are there any things I should be concerned about, or any ways it would behoove me to act/interact with my coworkers?

Help me out, bros. 

*Update:* Holy shit, guys! At the time that I am writing this, this thread has had 140 responses on this thread and 102 in Ask Women. I did not expect a response like this. Apparently people find the dynamics of how the opposite genders relate to and deal with each other in the workplace to be an interesting subject. Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed. I have learned a lot, and I feel as thought I am prepared for however my work environment winds up to be. If it is a den of catty, manipulative women who are skilled mental terrorists, I'm ready. If it is a wonderful learning environment in which everyone is sane and gets along and is just happy that we have a job where we help people who likely feel disenfranchised and rejected by the world gain skills to be successful in life, then I'm ready for that too. And I fully anticipate that I will also be in charge of killing spiders and carrying boxes of printer paper into the supply room. Anyway, if anyone is late in seeing this, please contribute your perspective to the conversation!

Now if he initiates anything, I get a sick feeling in my stomach and go through with it, feeling empty and disgusting afterwards because I feel like he only did it to make me happy.

He is a great guy, despite the way I described him. Otherwise, I wouldn't be with him. Is there anyway to get over the insecurities? Or should I just break up and be alone forever because I don't think I will ever believe another man if they tell me I'm pretty..

Over the last year or so I've really come out of my shell and have built up a lot of confidence around women. Girls just seem to assume i've had tons of sex (even saying as much), so my virginity isn't obvious at least.

I've just always been picky I guess. I also hate the idea of pretending to have feelings for a girl when i don't, just to get sex.

I don't really have any amazing sex drive that guys always seem to talk about, although I've been fapping pretty much daily since my early teens which might explain it...

I'm considering just losing it and getting it over and done with. I'd just like to know some things:

1. Does your sex drive increase? Does sex become harder to resist? 
Is my current immunity to women's sexual charms (which i'm oddly proud of) something only a virgin could have?
Guys always talk about the psychological effects of going ""that long without sex"" (for example guys in the army etc.), which just seems like an alien concept to me...

2. Does your view of women change?
I'm not a guy to go easy on girls (just for being girls) or to give them any sort of sexist special treatment. Does such an egalitarian mindset become harder to maintain? Do you start seeing women as more weak/vunreable/needing your care?
What about when you fall properly in love? If these urges are unavoidable, can I at least keep them confined to the woman I am in love with? 
Or will I inevitably start seeing all women in this way?

Anything else that changes when you first have sex/a proper loving relationship?
Or am i just over-analyzing everything....

**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for the answers. 
I posted this after reading a TIL thread about women in the army (where there was overwhelming agreement about the supposed unavoidable biology of men's behavior towards women).

1346197394.0,97,self.AskMen,yznk3,"In light of the recent thread about male sexuality, what is your conception of female sexuality?",116,19,391,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yznk3/in_light_of_the_recent_thread_about_male/,"[The original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yx20t/when_did_you_first_realize_women_saw_you_as_a/) was quite eye-opening for me. Although I have had to explicitly explain to men who I have dated that I find them physically attractive, I didn't realize how many men do not think of themselves as having any sort of sexual appeal. It's definitely an issue that needs more recognition and change. The thread brought up a lot of questions for me, but I'll start with this:

On the flip side of the sentiment that men do not think that they are sexually appealing seems to be an assortment of beliefs about female sexuality: 

* [That women do not find men sexually appealing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yx20t/when_did_you_first_realize_women_saw_you_as_a/c5zo4vi)
* [That women have no sex drive](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yx20t/when_did_you_first_realize_women_saw_you_as_a/c5zm75i)
* [That women endure men but do not enjoy them](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yx20t/when_did_you_first_realize_women_saw_you_as_a/c5zkphm)
* [That women find all expressions of male sexuality to be creepy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yx20t/when_did_you_first_realize_women_saw_you_as_a/c5zns2p)
* [That any sort of interest in men is motivated by a variety of factors (money, strength, etc.) but never simply sexual or physical desire](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/yx20t/when_did_you_first_realize_women_saw_you_as_a/c5zmixn)

I realize that these are not universal opinions or ideas of all men; I'm just putting them here as jumping off points. 

So, looking at the other side of the coin: Of those of who you do not think it is possible for a woman to be attracted to you, do you also think that women do not find men attractive? Do you believe any of the above statements? If so, where do you think the belief came from? If you do not, why not? And if you no longer do, what changed your mind? 

Perhaps as another jumping off point, RickySuela answered this question in a thread in /r/AskWomen, and I found [his/her comment about how women's sexuality is misconstrued](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/yyvdf/opinionsthoughts_on_male_sexuality/c600zq7) quite insightful and, in my personal opinion, accurate.

So first off, thanks to everyone for the advice. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to let people know what happened.

It took me a while to get a chance to speak to him alone but we finally got an opportunity last week. We went to lunch, I picked a quiet corner and, as gently as I could, proceeded to tell him how he comes off to a lot of people. I mentioned specific instances of inappropriate behavior with myself and a friend of mine as well as generic statements about girls at a gaming store we hang out at together. He seemed to take it well at first. He told me that another mutual male friend of ours had had almost this exact same conversation with him a few weeks ago. So I thought it was going well.
 
Then the denial started. While he did agree to back off of my friend since he knows for a fact that he has made her uncomfortable he shows no interest in changing any of his behaviors towards anyone else. He says that people from the outside commenting that his behavior is creepy doesn't bother him, that they just don't understand how he talks to people and he doesn't see it as a problem unless the person he is talking to tells him that they are uncomfortable.

I really don't know where to go from here. I want to help him. This stops him from making friends (and it definitely hinders his ability to hit on girls) but if he won't recognize the issue I'm not sure how to address it.

I, of course, denied it, mostly because I was stubborn and angry that they noticed it before I did.  They frequently know me better than I do.  :p


This year, I decided to take charge.  After some major confidence-boosters from my friends, I just grew some ovaries and did it!  It was surprisingly easy.  Once I started, I just said words and he said, ""Yeah! Sure! Definitely!"" before I even finished the question.  :D


After the fact, I was bragging to *everyone*.  All of the ladies I told were really happy for me, but the guys said things like:  
Ugh, *you* asked *him* out?   
Isn't that emasculating him?   
That's his job!
Stop trying to be a man!   
Is your mom okay with that? (This from my dad.)


I thought that guys liked being asked out!  It's kind of unfair to expect the guy to do it every time.  What do you think, AskMenions?

Please forgive me if it's not ): You can just downvote me to oblivion. ~

I must admit, I am very insecure. My boyfriend knows this, and knows why (childhood traumas, lets not go into that). I know, I should love myself before I love anyone else, yadda yadda. But I'm horny, guys.

Anyway, on some occasions he wants to watch porn before or during sex. I must admit, this is pretty rare, less than 3 times a month, maybe. (I'm not a psycho who keeps count I'm just guesstimating.) Last night, it was before and then we put a regular movie on while we fucked. I'd like to think it was just to get himself hard since I had been sucking him for a while without getting him *super* hard. He *had* just cum a little while ago, this was going to be his second load. But the fact that I couldn't get him hard myself made me feel pretty bad.

It makes me feel like I'm not enough for him, and like he'd rather be fucking the chick in the porno than me, like he's imagining fucking her while he's fucking me. Obviously he's going to be attracted to other women but I'd like to be paid attention to when *I'm* the one suckin' your dick, you know? It gets to the point where I don't even want to have sex anymore and I want to tell him to just finish himself off because he obviously doesn't need me there.

I know he loves me very much but I just can't get over these thoughts. I would love some male perspective on this to really understand the situation. Is my insecurity just getting the best of me? Do you watch porn before or during sex? Why? If so, how does your SO feel about it?

Thanks, in advance. You guys are always really helpful. (:

Earlier today someone asked [the same question in AskWomen](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/19rz0w/ladies_if_your_so_asked_for_a_paternity_test_what/). I don't know if I've ever seen such a uniform set of answers. Namely, they would be extremely hurt and many of them would break up with their partners.

On the one hand, I sympathize with the fact that it can feel like your partner is accusing you of cheating to request a paternity test. Obviously I don't see it that way; certainly there are some men who raise children that aren't their own. And there's a $100, non-invasive test you can do to prove that nothing like that happened. It's like insurance, and logically I can't think of any downsides (other than a partners negative reaction). 

So that almost leads to a larger question regarding mens reproductive rights -- why is there such cultural opposition to them? Men already have very little say in reproduction, other than condom use and careful choice of sex partners.

To me, saying 'you're attractive' is objective - like saying 'yes, you live up to society's norms of attractiveness'. However saying 'I'm attracted to you' is saying that you personally are attracted to/interested in them sexually.

I am horrible at relationships and haven’t had a gf in years. It’s due to me not trying and I’m not trying because I’m scared I will end up in a relationship.  The most pain I’ve ever felt is from failed relationships. On top of that I’ve managed to accumulate a large amount of “life” baggage due to my own insecurities and self-destructive behaviors.  Mentally I’ve climbed some huge mountains over the past couple years and I am happier than I have ever been.  I now know what my goals are and I have some realistic expectations out of life.

The point is, I’m beyond trying to figure out how to get into a relationship, I really don’t feel it would be fair to the other person.  I do still have that instinctual drive to find a mate, and it seems no matter how hard I try, the rational part of my brain cannot override it.  I’ve ruined some great friendships with my female friends on account of me developing feelings for them.  Those situations always end awkwardly, with them feeling frustrated at me and confused (understandably).  

I’m happy with who I am now and I want to be happy in the future.  I am pretty popular, do well in college, and life in general.  I would say I lead an upbeat life now (after some very low points), except for the aforementioned.

He doesn't have a very low sex drive, because until about 2 months ago, it wasn't unusual for us to have sex up to three times a day. 
On the occasions that we do have sex now, he's started to treat it as just a way to fix an animalistic urge (there's no build up or anticipation - he just does it to get off), which is a big change as he used to be very sensual and romantic.

From what I read there, men get more insecure about their looks/appearance than I ever suspected.  Recently, it came to my attention that my boyfriend feels the same way you guys do. He is awesome and I think he's freakin' Captain America, but he says he never gets checked out and rarely gets 'chatted up'.  I say that's false, since I see women checking him out pretty often.

Maybe men aren't as perceptive to the checking out?  I've always thought it was a 'known fact' that men are less subtle about checking out women than women are about checking out men.

So, that's all well and good.  Here's why I ask:

As a flight attendant, I meet thousands of people.  When I volunteer at a computer thing/place, I'm surrounded by geeks.  When I'm walking around doing my errands and stuff, there's plenty of people.  

My goal this year has been to ensure that I compliment women because we're always hating on each other - I want to build up self-esteem instead of tearing it down, and I'm hoping it'll spread and we will eventually develop a stronger sisterhood.  

I think my next goal will be to try to compliment men more, because if there are that many who are vocal about being insecure on Reddit, there's millions more who just haven't said anything.  

**How can I effect this practice without seeming like I'm hitting on men?**

I'm happily taken, and don't want to make my man jealous, but I feel that inter-personal social relations would greatly benefit from everyone feeling THAT much better about themselves and their looks rather than walking around feeling fat/ugly/insecure/whatever.

Findings from the research: [Link](http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/08/09/study_iq_linked_to_virginity.aspx).
&gt;Recent studies on sexual activity among adolescents and young adults show that being an ""average Joe"" may have benefits outside of the classroom. The studies show that female and male adolescents with an IQ score either below 70 or above 110 are more likely to be virgins. Adolescents with IQ scores ranging from 70 to 110 had the lowest probability of virginity, according to two researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The average IQ score is 90 to 110. According to the research, an adolescent with an IQ score of 100 was 1.5 to 5 times more likely to have had intercourse than an adolescent with an above average score of about 120 to 130. The CDC states that by age 19, 80 percent of men and 75 percent of women lose their virginity. According to a survey held by Counterpoint Magazine at Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 60 percent of undergraduates at Wellesley are virgins and 47 percent of undergraduates at MIT are currently virgins.

My SO [27,m] and I [26,f] live together. My tablet, laptop and phone are all synced to Google, Facebook and texts/calls. When we first moved in together, his tablet needed to be fixed so I said he can use my tablet. I had no reasons to not trust him so didn't think much into it. However, as you can imagine all my personal and private stuff are all in those three devices. My phone never had a password, tablet and laptop had the same password which I told him with no hesitation.

At one point, he ""accidently"" looked and read emails that were really old [months before him and I even knew each other. Now, these are very personal emails that I don't even dig up and read through and they are never in the Inbox [archived into folders/tagged]. As you can imagine, I was really upset that he went through emails and after chucking a tantrum I let it go.  

I had no reasons to touch his phone either, however he would always use my phone to make calls when he was out of phone credit. Anyway, when he started using his tablet again [after 2 weeks of using mine] at some point I asked if I could look something up on it. He said yes after some hesitation, and hovered behind me to see exactly what I was doing. When I asked to use his phone once, the same reaction. He needed to see exactly what I was doing. 

I feel silly for getting upset that I am so open to him about me and my life, even though he invaded my privacy but he doesn't trust me with his tablet for even half a sec. I feel like this is very one sided. The thing is, even if his phone/texts were there in front of me I would have no desire to read through them. But his behavior makes me think maybe I should be suspicious. We just had a fight over this when I told him how I felt. 

I hope that sums it up. Am I over reacting? What do you guys think? 

Edit: We fought today because I did confront him about this. I wouldn't go through his things, or touch his gadgets without asking for permission first.

I read everything. I think the general consensus is to tell him, so... I think I will do that when he gets home. I'm so nervous I feel like I'm going to throw up. Thanks everyone. Much appreciated.**

Hello AskMen! I've tried to make this short and concise, so my apologies if it's a bit long. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for about 8 months now; we're both really into each other and it's getting pretty serious. 

My boyfriend is very close with his group of friends, most especially with his best friend, ""A"". I really like that he has this awesome, long-lasting friendship and I know it means a lot to him. Now, I get along well with most of his friends but have always found ""A"" to be a bit cold to me, which was upsetting but I figured it just needs time or whatever. 

So, my boyfriend had to go out of town for work unexpectedly this week, which means he had to miss A's birthday celebration thing last night. I went instead and had a good time, but ""A"" got plastered... like completely, falling over, black-out drunk. At the end of the night he asked if we could share a cab since his apartment is on the way to mine. 

So... On the cab ride home he tried to kiss me, and when I stopped him he got a bit... not necessarily physically aggressive, but he wouldn't back off until I ended up getting out of the cab early... and A was acting very annoyed/angry at me as I got out. 

This morning I was obviously really upset by the whole thing, but this afternoon I got a text from my boyfriend asking how the party was and saying that A had told him he remembered nothing of the night because he was so wasted. 

So my question for you all is...... What in the actual fuck? No but really, do I just absolutely tell my boyfriend everything? Could this ruin their friendship? (For some reason I'm still concerned about that b/c I know how much it means to my boyfriend). I know that from an objective standpoint, I need to tell him the whole thing but I'm just so confused and unsure right now. I was hoping to get some male advice on this in particular because the only advice I've had from female friends just seems to miss something.

He is an old acquaintance from high school, and we recently reconnected through Facebook. We started out talking on Facebook a lot, until I finally met up with him on my lunch break one day. We talked and kissed a bit, and when I left, he asked if I would be his girlfriend. 

I told him I am in no position to be anybody's girlfriend right now, that I would be a bad girlfriend (due to family issues he knew about), and that I wouldn't want that for either of us. He knew this, but chose to keep seeing me a couple of times a week. He kept escalating his language of affection, including continual and constant pleas to be my boyfriend. 

Eventually, it got to be kind of heartbreaking and I thought I would give him a chance. I told him that it's possible this could not work out, but if he wanted the title, we could be boyfriend and girlfriend. 

Since that point, he has 

- Told me that he loves me

- Told me I'm ""the one"" 

- Tried to introduce me to his whole family (this started before we were official)

- Written me poems

- Written me songs

I have tried to reject all of these gestures, or tell him that he's getting his emotions confused, or told him to step back and try to focus on my faults, etc. 

I know in the past he has been suicidal- he admitted to attempting suicide 7 times previously. On his birthday, he got really drunk and while I was driving him home, he said that I saved his life, and that if I hadn't come along, he was probably going to kill himself. 

Recently though, he has become unbearable. Now that we're dating, I've been able to be fully aware of his life, and I see that he's an alcoholic. My mom is an alcoholic, and so he knows that excessive alcohol consumption is difficult for me to be around anyway, yet everytime I talk to him or see him, he's drunk or on his way to get drunk (often on my dime). He's a deadbeat dad, I'm discovering, and he just has his life together in no way. I'm slow and deliberate with most life decisions, whereas he throws entire caution to the wind with no foresight or planning. I just can't stay with somebody like this. I already struggle with co-dependency, and aside from not enjoying my time with him, I don't want to fall into familiar habits. 

So I do want to break up with him, but I don't know how to do it in a way that won't result in either being stalked or -primarily- him killing or trying to kill himself. 

Please help me nagivate this situation gently. 

(For some extra insight, I am moving to a city across the country later this summer. He knew it was a general idea, but it was only recently confirmed.

I want a guy's perspective on the situation. 
Background: my bf had somewhat of a traumatic upbringing. His mom was abusive (mostly emotional, occasional verbal and physical). She would threaten suicide, tell him she wouldnt be his mom anymore if he screwed up, slapped him so hard his ear bled, etc. Awful. This has left him quite bitter, angry at the injustice of the world, resentful of the way he was treated, and how others can treat others so badly.


We were watching a movie tonight; he was drinking, I was not. I had already seen the movie, but he hadn't. The movie contained a few female characters who were unlikeable, screwing over husbands and loved ones. He continued to get frustrated throughout, and at a point I laid back down to put my head on his chest and told him we didnt have to continue watching. As I did this, he grabbed my forearm sharply and shoved me off of him, and spat out ""You chose this movie, so we will watch it until the end.""


I was shocked, scared, and was quietly crying. I went and sat in the other room to get away. He came in and began pointing his finger in my face, voice raised, saying it was my fault he was angry, I have terrible taste in everything, that I know he had a difficult time growing up and how could I have suggested we watch it? And finished it with a ""Fuck you.""

Problem is, this isn't the first time he's done this. He has never hit me, but I've felt threatened before. Once, when blacked out, he backed me into a corner, screaming at me for defending the author of Game of Thrones because he was disgusted by a certain scene in the show that we've been watching together for the course of the series. He's gotten this angry maybe 3 times over the past 9 months. 


He doesn't seem to think it's abusive, because he hasn't ever hit me. I just want to make him see it's not ok. His excuse is always that his childhood has screwed him up, and that's why everyone else is to blame; e.g. GoT, my movie choice, etc. He's thrown things (not at me) and punched walls. It happens when he drinks a lot.


He swears he would never hit me, and is disgusted by the idea, but never takes responsibility for the other stuff. One day I'm afraid he'll drink too much and lose control. He says he ""didn't mean to move you LIGHTLY off of me, I'm sorry if that upset you.""


I love him and I wish it wasn't like this. 90% of the time we're wonderful. It's just his spitting rage is really scary.
Should I be more sensitive to things that might possibly be triggers for him? I agree that movie was a mistake. Is there any hope for anger reduction??


I want a male perspective on this. I originally posted in r/RelationshipAdvice, but now I'm just trying to wrap my head around his logic and reasoning, if there is any.

1368838736.0,85,self.AskMen,1ejwn4,Would you (or how often do you) have casual sex with someone you find unattractive?,118,33,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1ejwn4/would_you_or_how_often_do_you_have_casual_sex/,"Yesterday I was talking to a friend, and he asked if I found a mutual friend I had been hooking up with attractive.  I laughed because ""why would I sleep with someone I think is unattractive?""  He shrugged and said it was a legitimate question, and that he had hooked up with a few unattractive girls just because he wanted to get laid.

**Would you have casual sex with someone you find unattractive?**  How do you define that, or what aspects are the most important?  I would assume that physical attractiveness would be key, but is that the case for you?

So, that's the general question, and here's a little more background on me and why I'm asking:

Basically, I'm a college student who isn't looking for a committed relationship in the near future, so I'm a big fan of the casual hookup.  In general, I often feel insecure about my appearance thanks to some weight struggles and body issues, but it hasn't held me back from hooking up with guys who are very attractive pretty regularly.  I'm guessing this has a lot to do with how I carry myself socially, because I seem to have a much easier time finding guys than some of my better looking girl friends.  I'm pretty confident in my ability to approach guys and be charming, so I figure my chances are good if I pass the test of physical attraction to that particular guy.

Simply in terms of my appearance, I get a big confidence boost when I'm with a guy who I think is attractive enough to have fairly high standards for looks.  And I assume any guy who wants to have sex with me at least thinks I'm physically attractive in some important ways, which is comforting during the moments when I feel particularly fat or ugly.  So my friend's comment that he considers a lot of the girls he's hooked up with to be physically unattractive (as the conversation was mostly about looks), kind of shook me up.  I know I'm not the hottest girl, and my size alone counts me out with some guys (I'm not huge or even what most would call fat, but I'm a size 12 hourglass with some chub), but I figured it was safe to assume the guys who seem into me think I look good.",,False,,t5_2s30g,False,,,True,t3_1ejwn4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1ejwn4/would_you_or_how_often_do_you_have_casual_sex/,

Opinions?,112,29,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19kxqk/i_think_ive_figured_out_the_whole_thing_about_men/,"So, there are a lot of women who will advise other women that men enjoy 'the chase'. This leads to things like playing hard to get, false reluctancy, and all that crap.

I think the reason that people have this impression is because it is accurate - for a small subset of the population. That subset is the most successful men with regards to dating, relationships, 'hooking up' and such.

For these people, the mere facts of romantic developments are not exciting enough; uncertianty and challenge are also required for it to be properly entertaining. Why would mere success be enough, when it is easily attained?

By definition, the most successful men in this arena are the most attractive, as an aggregate of appearance, personality, status, etc. And, as the most attractive men also receive the most attention (again by definition) their viewpoints and likings are assumed to be the norm, as they are far more likely to have any individual women be attracted to them, and thus attempt to enage them.

It is odd; many women argue that, as unattractive or romantically unsuccessful women, their existence and experiences are marginalized. It appears that this also works in reverse, with the men who need something extra for an initial approach to be interesting have their likes and opinions overrepresented, as they are more attractive.

It's pretty much the same issue as women noticing that being forward in dating is not so well recieved as /r/askmen would lead them to believe; if the only ones being approached are the most attractive, and they prefer things to be a challenge, then obviously it would be expected that things would not go well.

All of this works only as generals trends and cannot be assumed to be absolute and universal, blah blah blah.

Can't post in relationships subreddit.",105,22,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/14xmfs/found_out_girlfriend_committed_semicheating_act/,"I hope this is at least a slightly enjoyable read. If you just want the semi-cheating act, it's the fourth substantial paragraph. Girlfriend knows I enjoy posting/reading /r/relationships and /r/relationship_advice, not using those right away.

We're both in our early 20's, I'm a dude. As of the past few months our relationship has been long distance. I'm at school, while she's living in another state with a friend to save money while she tried to build up money and figure out what she wants to do (recent falling out with her family, had to leave school for money reasons, I feel I should note that her parents are insane, so distancing herself from them really helped us). I have a year and a half left, she has 1 year left, so theoretically we will finish at the same time if she comes back at the beginning of next year.

Anyway, to make a mildly long story shorter, a lot of this bad stuff happened on Thanksgiving break. This next paragraph isn't totally relevant to my request, but it sets up some back story/insight to my personality. I treat her to a nice night as an early birthday celebration, since I have exams during her actual birthday. While we're driving back from dinner, she's slightly inebriated and I'm sober, she mentions offhandedly that she tried cocaine recently(this isn't the big deal), and didn't find it very appealing. I pretty much get instantly annoyed, and while I know I can't control her actions/desires, a few people in my family were at one point severely addicted to cocaine, and it put a damper on the good feels. I see trying cocaine as dangerous(yes, maybe I'm a prude, but I have a pretty addictive personality), so I felt like she was being reckless with our herself/our relationship. She says she was worried about this reaction from me and is why she didn't tell me right away(2 weeks).

We're talking about it later, like constructive people do. I was annoyed she decided to keep it secret, and I suspected she still wasn't telling me something. So I say, ""If you're still not telling me something, now's the best time to tell me for us to have the best chance of talking things out."" I'm paraphrasing. Got slightly more than I bargained for with that one.

So I find out a few months ago in August, right before this past semester started, she went to a Halloween party with her friends( this part I knew). Basically, during this party she got drunk, and invited an old friend(guy) of hers to watch a show with her(arrested development if you just have to know). During this, they apparently cuddled on the bed to watch (already getting a sick feeling from writing that, yeah I'm sensitive). So she says that he started grabing/touching her, and she responded by ""sucking on his thumb""(no shit). I guess he felt up her boobs/thigh, and she only ""sucked his thumb"". I am having a very hard time believing this, but even after a lot of pressing from me she swears that's all she did. If she had told me months ago, I probably would have been much more liable to believe her. The thing I feel the most annoyed by is how she kept it a secret.

We didn't discuss it for a bit because I had exams and some other academic things to do for the end of the semester, and I didn't want extra stress. She was fine with that, as she is the type of person who hopes things blow over. I'm the type of person where if I'm not sure the relationship is going to work, it takes a backseat to more long term things like school. Exams are over and I'm back at home getting over a relatively bad illness(totally fine). We're talking more, and the more we talk about the angrier I seem to feel. I've talked with some friends about it and some are telling me to run while others are saying it's not a big deal, get over it.

To me, if we do stay together I'm going to treat it as if she did have sex and have us both get tested(not optional for me). I just cannot buy this ""sucked his thumb"" bullshit. I really want to believe this is the only instance where she's done something like this, but I am having so much trouble. I don't know if I'm looking for advice on how to get back into trusting her, or just advice on how people think I'm acting/overreacting/feeling. I'm feeling pretty tired and conflicted. Lying like this just really bothers me. Never thought I'd be in this position with this girl, or so conflicted about my emotions. As a side note, basically all the women I'm related to tend to cheat on their S.O.s, and I'm sure this is effects me. ( I can never remember affect vs. effect).

Over those 4.5 years, he became very very close with one of her best friends (me). I mean, hanging out every day, even if his girlfriend wasn't there kind of close (but nothing sexual).

I am so sexually attracted to this guy I cannot handle it. We still hang out nearly every day and I just don't know what to do. I didn't always feel this way, I swear when him and my friend were dating I felt nothing. He was just my best friend. It's like he was a locked door and I was never going to see what was inside. But now... that lock is gone... and my mind just keeps wandering.

He was absolutely crushed when he found out about his girlfriend cheating on him. I still don't think he is quite over it, which is the number one reason I am so hesitant to bring up my feelings. He *heavily* relied on me for support during the darkest days of the breakup. I am also still good friends with the girl who cheated on him (but I would definitely say we are not as close as we used to be, and definitely not nearly as close as I still am with Sean), which just makes all this so much more hard to deal with. She has moved a couple hours away (out of state), though that doesn't really matter I guess.

I just want to know how an average guy thinks in this situation. If you were Sean, what would you say/feel if I approached you with my feelings? Would you even want me to say anything? I'm not wanting to be his girlfriend. I just can't stop thinking about him and the things we could do and the fun we could have and... I don't know. I guess I'm just seeing him in a whole new light. My thoughts are filled with so much feminine bullshit that I can't even fathom what's going on in his head or what he would say if I mentioned anything to him. Also, I have never been in a relationship that lasted more than six months, let alone 4.5 years. I can imagine how he feels, but in fact I probably have no idea.

So, I am a feminist. I don't know why, but a lot of men seem to think that means I'm a man-hating bitch who wants to throw all men into concentration camps, and in fact think that all feminists are pretty much this way. I'm a feminist because I care a lot about issues like abortion rights and violence and inequality against women not just in the U.S. but in my native country, where most women (including my female relatives who live there) have very little control over simple things like what they can wear, who they marry, whether they can go to school, and how many children they can have. I have a lot of guy friends whom I treasure, and I don't tolerate misogyny *or* misandry.   All of the people who I have met who identify as feminist, both online and real life, were this way. I get men who are indifferent to people who identify as feminist, since, after all, those issues are about women, so they don't have any personal interest in it. I get that. 

But, my ultimate question is, why are there so many guys who seem to simply *hate* feminists? And think it's some kind of evil KKK-like organization of femi-nazi who want to put all men into slavery? I feel like there is a general dislike for feminists on reddit as a whole, and I would like to be enlightened as to why it exists. Thank you.

I only watch the show when I am at home with my parents, so I don't know the guy's name. Anyways, he is the most feminine guy I've seen in a long time. He literally skips around, gets super freaked out when he has to deal with bugs and such, and acts like a teenage girl. Don't even get me started on his wardrobe. He screams gay. He's a real person and acts that way normally, but it is obvious that the show picks a diverse group of people to compete against each other.

 I always have a hard time figuring out quite what people mean by that phrase, ""don't stick your dick in crazy."" The more and more I see it around reddit, the more I believe that crazy has become a label for literally any female that has emotions. But anyway, I'm wondering something more serious.

 I happen to be an early 20's female with Paranoid Schizophrenia. It isn't always severely symptomatic, and I do my best to keep everything under control. It's still a very life altering disease though. Some days it really doesn't come into play, other days it dominates me. Seeing that phrase makes me think that if any potential partner knew about my condition, they would turn and run. In reality I've had some pretty stable relationships (as well as rocky ones, just like anyone else.) I feel terrible when any partner has to see me during the rough episodes, but I'm actually on good terms with all of my exes and haven't managed to really burn any bridges by being ""crazy.""

 So now I have to wonder, when is the right time to talk about this? Should I mention it before I even have a second date, so the guy can turn and run if he doesn't want to date someone with a long term illness? Should I just leave it unmentioned for NSA hookups, or should they know too? Give me your opinions here. Thanks!

James has been my best friend for a number of years, he knows me better than most my family. I've always been under the impression that him and I were strictly plutonic; there's been no sort of physical contact between us in all the years we've been friends, and I've never even sensed that he had feelings for me. 


One day out of the blue, he tells me that he has never wanted me as just a friend. 


My heart broke. 


His brother Mathew and I have been seeing each other since Thanksgiving. We decided that since i'm around the family so much that we would keep it secretive to ovoid conflict with the family not agreeing with our choice and feeling the need to put their 2 cents in. And, we wanted to make sure we really had feelings for one another before we started a relationship that we knew would include the whole family. 

So now i'm stuck. 

Mathew and I were ready to let the family know, but were waiting for the right time. 

That's when James told me how he felt.

First I want everyone to know that I know I made a conscience choice to go behind my best friends back and the idea of hurting him really did make me sick.

On that note, I'd like to add that YES, I feel terrible for hurting James like that but, when all is said and done I still love Mathew. Though selfish it may sound, I had to do what made me happiest.

Mathew and I both told James. I won't go into what he said because of all the vulgar things that came out of his mouth, I knew I deserved much worse. He's told me that he no longer wants me as his friend, and to stay away from him. I told him I understand and would do as he wished*

Are you neutral to stuff like cellulite, stretch marks, occasional pimples on the chest or back or face, keratosis pilaris, and other common skin problems, or are they active turn-offs?

* I am very, very, very conscious of letting anyone - much less women see me cry about anything. It can anything from a family death or a sad movie. No crying in public for damn sure.
* Paying for sex. I know a lot of women consider this a deal breaker and I've done it enough times that it would cause much more bullshit than I would care to deal with so I lie about this when asked.

As for why I don't tell women these things. The reasons are all the same: Telling you has a very low chance of benefiting me and actually has a much greater probability of hurting me.

Now, nothing contained in this post is in any way meant to criticize the op, or bring up her situation for discussion, so please let's keep that in mind. But here's the thing...

I am the before. I am at the exact same weight that she was during the time she had an eating disorder. Except, I am a (mostly) healthy 29 year old woman, and I have always been this way. And since I was a teenager, I have been crushingly self conscious about it. I see pictures of myself and cringe at my arms, I wonder after sex if he was closing his eyes from pleasure, or to imagine someone else.

And after seeing her post, I felt almost worse because it confirmed my fears, solidified my doubts. The majority of men claimed that her ""before"" body type was very unattractive. This little taunting jeer in the back of my mind is becoming a siren.

Should I worry that it will affect his feelings for me?,142,61,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19jc55/ive_just_started_letting_my_so_sleep_with_other/,"My SO and I are in our early thirties and have been together for 4.5 years. We love each other very much and consider ourselves lucky to have found one another.

Even though he loves me and is happy with our sex life, he is starting to feel the constraint of monogamy. During our years together he has foregone many opportunities for casual sex that he would have taken if he had been single. Not too long ago we talked about this, and he was honest about his purely physical/sexual desire to sleep with a new woman every once in a while just for the sake of the variety.

I don't have any desire to sleep with anyone other than him, but I understand that, generally speaking, men and women are wired differently when it comes to sexual desire (males needing to spread their seed as much as possible, females needing to get the best possible genes for their offspring). So his desire to sleep with more than one woman is not something I take personally. I can even empathize with his feeling of missing out. And it bugs me that he has to miss out because of me. I love him and I want to contribute to his happiness in every way I can.

So I did some soul-searching. I've never been the jealous type - I am secure in my attachment style - and I'm pretty sure I can handle it if he has a one-night stand with some random woman and then comes back to me. So long as it's just about satisfying that sexual urge for some variety, I don't think I would feel threatened, and I think I might even find it a little exciting. And so I've offered him to try it and we'll see how it goes.

I am inspired by the Ernest Hemingway quote where he says that his idea of heaven is ""two lovely houses in the town; one where I would have my wife and children and be monogamous and love them truly and well and the other where I would have my nine beautiful mistresses on nine different floors.""

But I rarely hear of an arrangement like this in practice except in the context of loveless marriages where the couple is staying together for the sake of the children, so I'm wondering whether I am being naive in thinking that this will turn out well. Is it riskier than I think to let him sleep with other women? How might it change his feelings for me?

TL;DR: I just gave my SO permission to enjoy some casual sex outside of our relationship every once in a while. Am I naive for thinking he will continue to love me as before?

Edit:

&gt;aren't you concerned about him contracting diseases as he sleeps around?

First, I trust him to wear a condom. I know that's not 100% safe but it's nowhere near as risky as if he didn't wear one. Second, I think it's part of the risk of life. I ride in cars too even though that's probably riskier.

I'm here asking for perspective on how it feels to be a male in a world of expectations. **What myths about being a male do you wish were entirely eradicated from the public conscious**. Why do you believe these ideas are still being propagated? Who propagates them? How do you react when you hear them being repeated? Do you ever try to correct others? Tell us your stories on what it really means to be a male in 2012. 

**Going even further** : Provide evidence/statistics to disprove such myths. 

Inversely, **what are some things you have discovered about being a male that no one ever prepared you for?** How has this changed you?

* Expected to succeed / No recognition of success

* Men as something to fear : Rape/murder/violence/pedophilia/intimidation

* Sex as accomplishment - the idea that there are winners/losers

* Men constantly want sex/hypersexualization of men

* Expectation to provide/protect/step in

* Men are simple creatures - Emotionless

* ""Man Up"" - Men can't ask for help/complain for fear of appearing weak

* Showing emotion = Weakness

* Masculinity as opposite of Femininity(mutually exclusive)

* Men just don't care - ""Don't give a fuck""

* Badass/Real Man/Idealization of male identity

* Unable to have meaningful relationships/afraid of commitment

I use that experience to console guys I talk to about penis size (whether in merely a friendly or more context). If sexually involved with a guy who was insecure about their dick I would make an extra point to comment on how much pleasure their dick gave me and how much I enjoyed it etc.

I can honestly say that penis size doesn't matter to me, I guess there are two ends of the spectrum of course but if I really liked the person it wouldn't prevent me being involved with them (I don't think I could physically take a penis of very much above average size anyway).

I just started working at a Mexican restaurant a couple weeks ago and I've settled in. I like everyone there a lot, and it's a really chill place to work, so I'd rather not quit. The manager in question is close to my age (he's 23, I'm 20) and for a long time he acted like the rest of the staff. However, the past week he started joking around with me, which consisted of holding my hands in front of me so I couldn't move and fake pushing me out of the patio door (he never got close besides holding my wrists) and joking in Spanish. It didn't bother me at all, whatever, people mess around.

However, a couple days ago I was doing the morning shift (only server around) and he was the only other person with me (besides a couple guys in the kitchen). At first, he just messed around a lot more than usual, doing those things. Then he got more playful and tried snapping me with a wet towel (having brothers growing up, I was up for it and even got him good a few times). So we were being goofy, chasing each other around the restaurant passing the time, which I never in my life expected to do with a manager. Then he got more bold, and began holding me again so I couldn't move, but this time he was right up against my back fully pressed into me. He did this a few times and I laughed it off, but began to keep my distance. He got bolder and started forcing me to do things, like sitting while he put ice cubes down my shirt, force fed me hot sauce, and held me and told me to fight to get away. The whole time he was light-hearted and laughing, and that's how I felt at the beginning, but towards the end I was looking forward to the arrival of more servers. When people were around, he stopped doing all of this.

I'm not very up-front or assertive, but I feel like I need to say something to make him know I'm not comfortable with the behavior. I still think he's an okay guy, and I'm not sure if I'm over-reacting, so I don't want to do anything drastic. 

If you were him, what would you want me to say to you if I wanted to ask you politely to stop? Would you feel awkwardness afterwards if you were joking the whole time, but someone misinterpreted your actions? Thanks a lot for any response, tomorrow morning I have to work and I'm not sure if he'll be there.

EDIT: 
&gt; He got bolder and started forcing me to do things, like sitting while he put ice cubes down my shirt, force fed me hot sauce, and held me and told me to fight to get away.

My roommate pointed out to me that the way I described him sounded more malicious than I intended. Even though he did force these things in a way (I said no several times, but I was still laughing trying to avert any awkwardness. For the hot sauce I began to get serious), he was still joking and it seemed like he treated it like everything else, not a big deal.

On the other hand, I've had girls tell me, ""Wow! I'm really impressed!"" once while I was doing push-ups, once while I was playing a sport, and once just while I was screwing around with a volleyball trying to spin it on my finger (unsuccessfully). I was *beaming* when I got those. 

My point is, I've noticed a lot of girls seem to think complimenting guys on our physical appearance is utterly and vitally important to our self-esteem. I was just wondering if this was true for most guys? Honestly if a girl told me I were ugly I wouldn't care a whole hell of a lot.

I'm not worried about the pain of the procedure (I've never met a man who has any recollection of it), I'm mostly worried about making an irreversible decision that could impact his future sexual pleasure. Seems unfair. 

I've heard that sex is more intense for uncut men -- and that makes sense to me. More skin= more nerve endings. And if the head is always covered, then it reasons that things would be more intense when it's not. I do worry about condom use, too. My uncircumcised friend says that he can't feel a thing when he wears one -- it's like 2 sweaters. Is that true?

To be clear: I know it's creepy to be thinking of my future kid getting it on, but I want him to be happy. 

Also, we generally go for the more natural/organic way in all other aspects of our lives, so why should this be any different?

I'm just looking for feedback. Would you do it to your son? Why/why not? 

If you're intact, what's hygiene like? Do you wish your parents had done it to you? Do you think that sex is better because of it?

The question is: What gives? If the gender ratio is split 50:50 how is it even possible that one sex can be surrounded by the opposite gender, while the other has very few?

Last time I saw her, I decided to try and come up with some material for conversation, her college, her previous employer, etc. I went on LinkedIn to look her up since I got her name from the company roster. I was short on time at work so I looked at her profile when I got home. This was all I did, I didn't see her again after this.

Two days later, I get a notice from human resources I need to review the company policy on ""workplace atmosphere"" and am forced to watch a sexual harassment video. Management meets with me and tells me I now have a warning from them and any future action in the same vein will fore them to ""seriously review my level of commitment to my employment"". They were saying if it happened again I was going to probably fired. 

I was so confused during all this, as I had no idea what I did wrong. I don't harass anyone at work and my department is all male anyway.

Now that being said, we recently added another person to our staff. There are now 5 of us in the office, and with the exception of my boss, we all work in close proximity to each other. I think it is also worth noting that the guy in question is in his early 20s, went to school for business, and is quite attractive (until he opens his mouth).

Hes only been here a few weeks but I am so disgusted with his behavior and what he says that is is negatively impacting my mood at work, and after work. What he says isnt playful, teasing, or ""harmless"" stereotyping. I would not be here if what he said was just ""lol women and their shoe-shopping, amiright?"" 

He is VERY clear in his disdain for women. Nearly any time women come up in conversation he has to say something about how we are always after a man's money, or allude to women being less intelligent and incapable of handling their emotions, or being sluts or whatever. He uses words like ""slut"" and ""whore"" and ""trophy-wife"" often. 

Just as an example, we were having a discussion about a high-end clothing brand. Another coworker said something about them selling $500 track suits. I said ""well, money certainly can't buy taste"" and then this guy just jumps into this long rant about how its only ""trophy-wives"" who shop there, and they don't care how much their clothing costs because its not like theyre spending their own money on it. He has also said before that all women who drive SUVs are stay-at-home-moms driving a nice SUV their husbands bought them.

He is frequently going on about how women cant handle their emotions, and has even made comments about how buying dinner for a date entitles him to sex. But in the same breath he refers to women as whores and sluts. I just. I dont even know. I thought that I have dealt with a lot of sexist shit in my day, but I was so wrong.

I would like to point out that the other 2 guys in the office do not encourage him, or agree with him, or even typically respond to what he says in any way. They are also not telling him to shove it either though. I will typically give a quick, short ""no. thats not how it works"" or something along those lines. I am worried that blowing up at him will just reinforce his views that women can't handle their emotions.

Now my boss adores him. And does not hear the stuff that he says. I do not want to make a formal complaint yet because I do not believe it will go well for me. I think I will be seen as a trouble-maker trying to cause problems. So, going to my boss is only going to be a last-ditch-effort type thing.

Now this brings me to my question, is there any thing I can say or do to make him stop that won't paint me as a ""bitch""?

At the start I was taken aback by how overly keen he was (texting long messages morning until night), we then had a date that went really well but he didn't make a move at the end of it, we just pecked goodnight. He continued being sweet and pretty keen after this but over the last week, basically when I started showing interest back, he has really cooled off. Why do guys do this?!

He has said 'let's meet up tomorrow, I'll text you through the day to arrange it' two times in a row and both times did not bother to text. I don't know if this counts as being stood up? The next time he said it I followed up with a day and time that suited so that an arrangement was in place but he text a few hours before we were meant to meet with a crappy excuse about spending time with family, and no talk of rescheduling. Since then he has continued to text me though every other day or so.

My ex-bf recently had his skype account compromised which alledgedly had not changed its password since we broke up, making me an immediate suspect. This occured while I was asleep (I work at 7AM so I am in bed at 10-11PM every night) and while I hypothetically *could* have the motive for making his life sour, I don't in reality. So I was ambushed with these accusations in the morning and he would obviously not take my word for it, threatening to bring in legal.

He also made it very clear he'd turn up at my apartment and ""make it clear to me I'd best leave him and the people he know the fuck alone"". He also put it like: "" I can't wait to see you and fucking wipe that shit eating from your slut face. ""

I urged him to bring in legal, if just to clean my own name and for him to apologise for the accusations and to calm the storm, but I feel helpless and the whole ""guilty until proven innocent"" is making me sick. His threats to show up at my door even when I said I didn't wanna meet him aren't helping, either.

What can I do, on my end, to protect myself from this? I feel harrassed especially since there's no evidence to support his claim. Up till this point, since March, we have had no contact and I've initiated no attempts to befriend or provoke him, I've just minded my own business. 

Men, what do you suggest I do? Just ignore this until it blows over? I feel uncomfortable that he's painting me black to mutual friends, is it a bad move to just distance myself from them? I really find this unsettling. I hadn't paid him a single thought until this was brought up. 

My friend says this is exactly what he wants. I left him because he made me feel shit about myself, I didn't want such a destructive person in my life and now I'm being forced into a feud I never wanted.

My boyfriend and I are both in college, 300 miles from each other and have been going out for about 7 months. We’ve established that we’re committed to each other and see this going long term.

He lives with his parents and commutes to school.  In these 7 months, he’s had a female friend stay overnight at his place a few times, usually when his parents are on vacation. He’s always asked me if it’s alright with me and once she slept over when I was there. She’s a sweet kid, going to a local community college and playing in the wind ensemble where my boyfriend also plays. Her home life seems to be pretty rough, so I don’t see a problem with my boyfriend letting her stay over.

I’m not sure if her sleeping on the couch in his room is a big deal or not when his parents have guest rooms available. That part does seem weird to me, and he said it’s weird as well, but according to my best friend, it’s not concerning me as much as it should.

The reason I’m not posting to /relationships is that I’m not too worried about the relationship; rather, I’d like to know what his rationale could be. Are there different reasons based on a male perspective versus a friend helping out a friend? Does it make a difference whether or not the friend is female or not?

Personally, I think I make an incredible lasagna bolognese.

It's rich and meaty and creamy and crispy and salty.  To do it properly usually takes about 5-6 hours and about $50 in ingredients, but it is sooooo worth it.  If someone wants I could do a solid job of describing my process, but that'd be a fairly long post so I may have to come back to that later when I have more time.

More simply, I also make really good bread using the no-knead method.  Salt, flour, yeast, water, and time can make about 20 cents and 5 minutes of effort into bread better than you can buy in most bakeries.

Bit of background: I am 21, 5'10"", weigh around 275lbs. I'm actually in the process of losing weight (I WAS 336lbs this time last year).

I was made fun of quite a bit, especially in primary school, boys would ask me out as a cruel joke, that sort of thing. I've ended up with the impression that being fat is the worst possible thing that I could be, as a woman.

Objectively, aside from the weight I'm not *ugly*. I think I've got a pretty awesome personality/sense of humour, though that's a subjective thing. To give you a bit of an idea, I love literature (LotR/aSoIaF/Dickens/Austen/Douglas Adams), video games (Diablo/Fallout/Elder Scrolls/Pokemon), I like some sports, film of any genre, aaand am a nerd in general.

I am friends with a lot of guys, get along well with other girls, I've had the ""oh, brohemian_fapsody, why aren't more girls like you"" or ""you're not a girl, you're a cool guy with long hair!"" lines too many times to count.  I've just never had any romantic attention from them--except for men who specifically have a fetish for overweight women. I don't specifically have anything against that culture, it's just not for me.

When I have a crush or attracted to a guy, I'm far too shy/scared to say anything because I know (or I convince myself) I have little to no chance of succeeding. Except, I realize that that attitude might be wrong, at least some of the time. **So, I'd like to know, would I have a chance with you, specifically?**

Let me ask you gentlemen (and ladies) for some advice.

We're in our mid/late 20's. We're coming up on three years now, and we have a wonderful relationship. We never fight, we are very open and very honest with one another, we have good relationships with each other's families, and we have similar life goals. We know we want to be life partners, and have talked about our future together quite a lot.

Now, after almost 3 years, we're going to take a big step and move into a place together. I've been living out on my own since I was 20. He boomeranged out of his folks place at 19, apartment-hopped for 3 years, then moved back home at 23. He's been with his folks since.

We're both older students, finishing up the last year of our degrees, and we will hopefully both be in the public education system come 2015. I have a full-time job and completely independent, though struggling to keep my head afloat. He had a lucky childhood and now has a cushy nestegg that keeps him from needing to work while in school, and can pay his half of the bills.

I'm not sure what he'll be like to live with. He comes from privilege, and may have a different living style than me. I'm very clean, very tidy, though my work areas are cluttered. He's similar, but seems to tolerate a bit more clutter than I would feel comfortable with. I love to cook, and he loves to eat my cooking, so no harm there. We're both coming in with pets. I have a cat, he has a dog. I suffer from an anxiety disorder that causes sleep deprivation. I have a lot of trouble sleeping through the night alone, let alone with another person. He knows and understands this, but we haven't planned for it. At this point, I'm really just listing anything I think might be relevant.

I need tips and wisdom on coinhabitting with an SO. I've never done this before, and I'm nervous that our seemingly perfect relationship might hit bumps. I suppose I've expected us to have differences, but so far in the near 3 years, our biggest disagreement was over where to go for dinner one night. Am I looking for drama where there is none?

Guys, help me be less scared. I want this SO BADLY.

tl;dr: Mid 20's, dating 3 years. Finally moving in together. Laid back people who never fight. Still scared, and looking for advice on how to coinhabit with an SO.

Edit: Wow! You all have really come through for me. So much great advice. And lots of things I didn't think about. We will be looking at perhaps making our office into a spare bedroom as well, so I can have a place to sleep if my anxiety gets the best of me. We have different hobbies that we can enjoy proximal to one another without having to engage one another (he plays guitar, I paint). We're both gamers, so no problem there! I work looonnnggg hours and he has a lot more down time than me, so I'm not worried about him getting smoothered by me and not having his alone-time. I might not be able to, though, but that's okay (I don't need it like he might, you know, *need* it). You all made me realize too that I'm super lucky to be with someone I can speak openly and candidly with. I won't take it for granted, I promise.

It's extra hard for me because I'm so self conscious about coming off as dumb or being boring. That is definitely one of my biggest fears.
So what do you guys think? The confusing part is that I know he really likes me, he tells me he loves me all the time and that I'm the hottest girl he's ever been with.

Not great, not ugly, slightly underweight but out of shape. I get ""cute"" thrown my way a lot. Nerdy guys like me because I'm a ""cute"" nerd. 

So now I have a good looking boyfriend. He's always being hit on by other girls but he chose me and that makes me happy. He does, however, let me know whenever people are shocked or confused as to why we're together. ""She's okay, but..."", ""she's not bad, but..."" is how it always seems to go. And then he tells me that he always says, ""doesn't matter to me"" or ""she's great"" or something.

So now I'm torn. Yay my bf likes me for who I am and not necessarily what I look like. It still upsets me, though, to hear that so many people have doubts. I kinda don't want him to tell me those things. I know he means to show me that he doesn't care how I look, but that's not always how it comes across. I guess a part of me doesn't want to hear ""it's not about looks"", I want to hear ""she's beautiful even if you don't think so"". (becaus it almost sounds like he agrees with them, despite having reasons for dating me)

If you're dating someone less attractive than you, how do you help her confidence? 
If other girls are saying this to you, do you think that they are hoping that they are attractive enough to ""sway"" his decision? (a big fear of mine)
Is it irrational of me to be upset by this/want more from him or should I truly be happy with his responses?
OR as a guy who is less attractive than his SO, do you ever feel like this?

(age range is mid twenties, for reference)

Edit for clarification:

""it made me upset"" does NOT equal ""my day was ruined and I cried for weeks"". It bummed me out for a bit, I shrugged it off. I just came here for your opinions, and I can assure you if this was an abusive relationship I would have dumped him already and I wouldn't be here.

Essentially does it alter the friendship and the way you look at the girl?

Do you guys ever talk about it with the girl or do you generally take it as, oh it happened hush hush till it happens again?

Edit: By hook up I mean anything. Sex or just kissing someone. The general shift of being platonic friends to then realizing the potential to do things platonic friends don't do.
