However, I have lunches for myself and random snacks for them and oh, no! we're late dinners and wtf should I make? dinners and shit, I forgot to take out the chops/to buy that one needed thing dinners - well, basically, no matter how organized you are - families need last minute options. 

After the chicken is cooked, I shred it with two forks and spread it out on a cookie sheets to freeze. After it's frozen, I loosely pack it in a big freezer Tupperware-style container. It's over 4c of cooked chicken. If done correctly, you can remove desired portions as needed. 

Now the fun stuff. There's endless options for readily available shredded chicken. Here's some of my favorites (and the most budget-friendly):

------------------------
1c chicken **3.25**
   
1 can black beans **.75**

1 can of corn (or cup frozen) **.50**

2Tbps siracha or hot sauce.

1c chicken **3.25**

6 celery ribs **1.00**

3Tbls buffalo sauce **.50**

1/4c blue cheese crumbles or blue cheese dressing **.50**

*Mix and heat chicken and buffalo sauce, load mixture onto celery, top with blue cheese. Low carb, easy, and satisfying.* **($.87/rib)**

1 bell pepper, any color **1.00**

I pkt of onion soup mix **1.00**

1/4 olive oil **.50**

*mix all ingredients, throw 'em in a cake or roasting pan and into a 450d oven. Turn everything in the pan at 15 minutes, ready in 25 minutes or so. I LOVE this with an over easy egg on top.* **(Serves 4, $1.71/per serving)**

--------------------------------

1c chicken, thawed **3.25**

1 box of bowtie pasta, cooked and drained **1.00**

1 9oz bag of baby spinach **2.00**

2c creamy ceaser dressing **2.00**

1/2c fresh grated Parmesan **1.00**

*Toss everything together. Serve warm or chill and serve later. Serves 8 as a side, 4 as a main* **($1.15/2.31 per serving)**

The frozen chicken thaws easily for anything you'd usually use chicken for: nachos, casseroles, salads, soup, wraps, sammies, etc. The frozen shredded chicken is a HUGE time saver for me.

1366083477.0,249,self.budgetfood,1cftrp,"Homemade tortilla chips, anyone? Super easy, super cheap, and tastes WAY better than Tostitos.",298,49,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1cftrp/homemade_tortilla_chips_anyone_super_easy_super/,"I *never* buy tortilla chips, I've always made them at home. This method is way cheaper, healthier, tastier, everything. I can't believe I ever bought pre-made chips in the first place. But here we are. 

So here goes! You will need:

* 5 whole tortillas (5 makes enough for 2 people to lightly snack on, use more if you want more, this recipe is for 5 tortillas)

* 2-tbs of olive oil (canola and vegetable are fine too, really any oil will do, so if you're some kind of crazy vegetable oil baron then you're all set)                     

* Whatever spices you want. Despite not having testicles, I use cayenne, chili powder, Tony Chacheros, garlic powder, cumin, and S &amp; P of course. 

* cooking spray (optional)

* aluminum foil (optional)

* ziploc zipper baggie, quart size (optional) 

Okay! So you got everything you need.

0) Before starting, get your cookie sheet ready and line with foil. If you want, spray a little cooking spray on there.

1) Cut your stack of tortillas into triangles, whatever fucking size you want. You like big chips that hold an ungodly, yet somehow admirable, amount of guacamole? Or you like smaller little triangles that you can lightly coat with delicious salsa one after another, in rapid succession because you haven't gotten laid in a while and *oh god* those chips are so good? I'm not here to fuckin judge, cut 'em how you want 'em.

2) Toss your triangles into your ziploc baggie. Obviously the more chips you're making, the bigger the baggie needs to be, but if I'm making a little snack for myself I just need a quart size. If you opt out of the ziploc method (I guess you never bag things, excuse *me* your majesty), it's cool, just toss your triangles on your cookie sheet.

3) Ziploc method: pour about 2 tbs of olive oil into the baggie along with your chips. If you didn't get ziplocs because you're not 8 years old anymore and don't take a PB &amp; J with you to school for lunch anymore, never fear! Just drizzle the olive oil over your chips, but you'll have to hand toss them and arrange them on your cookie sheet for best results. This can get slightly messy, which is why I use the ziploc, and when was the last time you actually cleaned your kitchen, you filthy animal?

4) Ziploc method: toss in whatever spices you want. Go crazy. Go nuts. You like regular salt and pepper chips? Whatever blows your hair back, buddy. You like spicy, fire-from-the-pit-of-hell flavor? Throw whatever you got in there, just don't try to kiss me. This is the time for you to break away from the drudgery of your soul sucking job to get creative! If you're doing it the other way, just sprinkle your spices directly on the chips. 

5) Ziploc method: shake that bag of triangles like your worst enemy's neck until all the triangles are evenly coated. I like to hit my dog in the face with it. Goes over real well. After shaking, place the triangles on your cookie sheet and space them apart as best you can.

6) You can spray them again if you want. I like to do this because I believe that God won't let the chips cook evenly unless I do this. Fucker.

6) Bake at 325 for about 15 minutes. 

7) Enjoy! 

** Note: you can forgo the olive oil altogether and just use cooking spray if you want. I've done this before, and they're still tasty, just not as full flavored. Just arrange your triangles on the cookie sheet, spray liberally (thanks, Obama), and then do your spices.

***Another note: if you want to go all out fattening and greasy and terrible, you can fry these fuckers. Just heat up some canola in a deep enough pan and drop the triangles in for a few minutes each. But that's more time consuming and messy and, therefore, stupid.

So the price breakdown is this:

1-20 count package of tortillas: $1.25 

1-32 oz bottle of olive oil: ~$6 (depending on brand, I'm fine with store brand or low end, I am no barefoot contessa)

Spices-you should already have a decent stockpile of spices from  which you can choose, but if you don't you can get all the spices I listed for &lt;$10, or just S &amp; P for ~$2. 

Cooking Spray- $1.39 (I use store brand; PAM is about $1 more)

Ziploc baggies-Ziploc is actually not the brand I use, I use store brand, and I got a box of 30 for ~$2

So to go out and buy all the ingredients (less spices, but including olive oil) it's $10.64. What I especially love about making chips at home is they're so *easy*, and you can make as much as you want when you want it, and all the ""ingredients"" can cross-over for other cooking needs. If you use foil &amp; ziploc there is literally no mess to clean up, and you can go from being a sucker with no chips to being a winner with lots of tasty chips in ~15 min with only ~3 minutes of prep time.

For maximum enjoyment, you can also write the big tortilla chip conglomerate a strongly worded letter. That'll show 'em.

Also, I have a recipe for a pretty kickass (and frugal) salsa if anyone's interested. 

edit: Hey guys, I thought I would have the salsas up by 5 CST, but clearly that hasn't happened. I am literally working on it now, and it will be up shortly. Sorry about the wait.

edit 2: It's finally done. I should note that while I typed up a bunch of recipes (minus the ceviche, I'll do that tomorrow, I'm tired) my husband made some kickass enchiladas. OM NOM NOM.

That's enough for me, /r/budgetfood-ies, now it's your turn. What are your favourite tips and recipes?

1360596480.0,211,self.budgetfood,18b8fj,"I'm tired of all these crappy pizza ideas here - how about this - making your own great tasting pizza, with your own homemade sauce and dough - for about $2 a pie?",255,44,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/18b8fj/im_tired_of_all_these_crappy_pizza_ideas_here_how/,"I really don't know why I don't see this here - but this is my pick for favorite budget food.  I got tired of my wife ordering out, at ~$15-20 a pizza, for shit pizza (especially compared to pizzerias here in the tristate) - so I decided to start making my own like my dad used to.  Takes a few attempts, but it's worth it, and cheap.  My wife loves it so much she will never order out again and asks me to make it all the time.

**Disclaimer**: the only thing you really should buy is a decent pizza stone(s). Unglazed tile used to be sold at like every Home Depot and Lowes for like $.50 - $1.00 a tile, but not anymore. I got 2 mexican unglazed stones from a mom and pops' tile store for $5 a piece. Beats buying (an inferior) ""pizza stone"" at the store for $30+. (you need unglazed)

Also, the great thing about making dough and sauce, is that when you make it - you might as well make more.  Whenever I make it, the sauce will fill up a small mason jar with the below recipe (enough for ~10-20 pies) and keep it in the fridge for ~a month.  I also make enough dough for 3-4 pies, use enough for one that night and freeze the rest individually.  It isn't any more work to make more than 1 serving - especially with the sauce.  Even if you cut the sauce recipe in half, it's enough for ~3-4 pies.

**Pizza Dough:**

* ~~1 (.25 ounce) package~~ active dry yeast  **edit:** - After making it a lot and taking advice here, I would have to recommend only using a half packet instead, although you *may* need to let it rise for another hour minimum.  Should be able to get away with just 1 hour, though.
* 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
* 2 cups bread flour
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons white sugar

Dissolve yeast in warm water for about 10 minutes. Combine dry ingredients and olive oil. Add yeast/water. Beat until stiff, cover, let rise for at least 30-45 minutes, upwards of a few hours (or days) if you want (I usually make enough for 3-4 pies at once, let enough for one rise for at least an hour and use it that night, and let the rest rise for a few hours before freezing it).

Honestly, this is a really easy recipe for ingredients you have laying around. The bread flour lasts a long time, and the only thing I ever wind up needing to buy from time to time is the yeast. Total cost for the dough? Maybe $1-2? This is enough to make 1 fairly large pie.

**Pizza sauce:**

All pizza sauces have the same main ingredients:

* 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
* 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried minced garlic
* Add a little bit of sugar, about a pinch, this smooths out the sauce a bit
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tbsp Italian Seasoning*
* 1 tsp Fennel Seed

I recommend getting a thing of ""italian seasonings"" (about $3, lasts a long time) This usually covers all the spices

All these spices last a long time anyway. I think the total cost of the sauce (without having to buy the spices) is like $1-2? I always try to get a lot of tomato sauce/paste when it goes on sale for this and other recipes anyway.  Just be careful not to add too much garlic or other spices - and if you do, just cut it down with more tomato sauce.  This is enough pizza sauce to make 4-5 pizzas, so it could last you at *least* a week or two anyway.  I usually cut this recipe in half, as there are a few other recipes I can use the half can of tomato paste for the next day or so (enchilada sauce comes to mind)

Also, the great thing about making dough and sauce, is that when you make it - you might as well make more.  Whenever I make it, the sauce will fill up a small mason jar with the below recipe (enough for ~10-20 pies) and keep it in the fridge for ~a month.  I also make enough dough for 3-4 pies, use enough for one that night and freeze the rest individually.  It isn't any more work to make more than 1 serving - especially with the sauce.  Even if you cut the sauce recipe in half, it's enough for ~3-4 pies.
When the dough rises - don't work it too much!  Use a good amount of flour to keep it from getting sticky.  ""Knuckle"" it just a bit, but if you work it too much, it will de-gas it, and it will not let you shape it/get it too thin without being extremely elasticy.  Takes a few tries to get it right.

I'm still getting good at working with the dough - but I can say this to people who are new to it:  **use parchment paper!**  - I have read many places that a lot of people do this, with no negative effect on taste/crispyness of the crust. 

How I do it, is I flour up the backside of my wooden cutting board, lay out the just-risen dough, kinda picking it up and working it into a circle.  Once it's basically the shape you want - transfer it onto a cookie sheet with a sheet of parchment paper on top of it with corn meal sprinkled on the paper.  From there, just slide the paper and finished pizza onto the stones.  (all of these steps could pretty much be skipped with a decent wooden pizza peel, ~$20) 

Also, I get a brush and brush a light coating of olive oil on the crust around the rim of the pie once the toppings are on.

This really depends on your oven - but I would recommend keeping the stones at the bottom rack, and turning your oven close to as high as it can go and baking for 10-20 minutes (again, it varies) - the idea is to crisp the crust as much as you can before the cheese starts browning and losing its taste.  You can leave the parchment paper in the whole time as well, or take it out about halfway done when the crust is crispy enough. (I am not guaranteeing anything, but I have never had a problem with leaving the paper in, at the most it will brown its edges) - Put a cookie sheet at the top rack to ""block"" the heat from the top burner once it is preheated, this will keep the cheese from baking too fast and let the crust crisp more. (thanks /u/chadcf!)

**edit:** - I may have been a bit low on the price, but once you get it down and find some cheap ingredients from different places, $2 is not out of the question, and at the most $5 is the most you'll spend per pie.  This is all dependent on toppings.  Cheese and pepperoni will never be ""cheap"", as far as I can tell there aren't too many places to get them dirt cheap, but I'm always looking.

Also - This may look difficult, but I really suggest that people, even on a budget, try new things in the kitchen.  I'm tired of seeing ""101 ways to spruce up your Ramen"" or PBJ, hotdogs, etc. here.  You can still eat great on a budget, and I will be posting a few more of my favorite dirt cheap recipes here.   Also - for anyone new to cooking- Watch Good Eats!!!  You will learn a lot from Alton Brown.  In this instance (pizza) maybe not too much - he likes doing it on the grill - so if that interests you, check out those episodes.

**edit 2:** /u/chadcf had some awesome tips in his comment - namely putting a baking sheet on the top rack to keep the pizza (at the bottom rack) from having its cheese bake too quickly.  This was a problem I was learning my way around until I read that idea.  Will be trying tonight, as it is genius.

Make some ice cream, no special machine required.",242,36,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1ifx7a/its_hot_make_some_ice_cream_no_special_machine/,"It might not be THE most budget dessert, depending on where you live, but it's delicious and flexible nonetheless.

1. I use a pint of heavy cream and a small can of sweetened condensed milk. It makes quite a bit, I'd say about 8 cups or so. I already had the SCM on hand, but it cost me about a dollar. The cream was $1.25. Combine the two in a mixing bowl, and use a mixer or whisk to form stiff peaks. 

2. Then add in your toppings. Today I made chocolate banana. I used 3 over-ripe bananas (usually can be found heavily discounted at the store), and an old Easter bunny. *Yes, I still have Easter candy sitting around*...I swear it was super on sale. You could also just use cocoa powder, but I like chocolate chunks. Yesterday, I made vanilla blueberry (homegrown blueberries, but I think they're on sale at Kroger this week, as well). 

3. Stick it in some tupperware, put it in the freezer, and wait. Every 45 minutes or so, stir it up with a rubber spatula or spoon (this helps make it creamier). I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to get to full-fledged ice cream status...I never remember to pay attention...but it's not too long! 

It's cheaper even than buying store-brand, and you can make it whatever flavour you want! Plus you get the novelty of saying ""I made this"".

Menu (with recipes and ROUGH prices [I live in the US]):

½ tsp + 1/8 tsp sea salt

Freshly ground black pepper to taste

½ cup apple, chopped (cored first, peeling optional), and tossed in ½ tsp lemon juice **.50**

couple pinches ground cloves

*Mix all ingredients and let chill for a few hours. Can be done the day before. BIG hit*

**Spinach and Strawberry Salad** (My creation)

The big container of baby spinach **$4**

pint of strawberries, sliced **$2.50**

1/3c balsamic vinigar **$1**

1/3c Olive oil **$.75**

1/3c real maple suryp **$1.25**

*Mix balsamic and maple in blender and then stream in Olive oil. Marinade sliced strawberries in mixture for at least 4 hours (overnight is great). Mix berries and baby spinach right before serving, drizzled with marinade.* 

**Broccoli Salad**

4c broccoli head, cut **$3**

Can of Water chestnuts **$.75**

1c raisins **$1.50**

I've included a spreadsheet below with our menu, what we bought and what it cost. I threw in a small charge for using some basic spices that we already had. The cheese is off to the side and not totaled as it's completely optional to this menu. You can omit cheese in all menu items listed. 

I live in Phoenix, AZ (USA) and my husband and I will be eating this menu as an experiment this week. I shopped at our local Walmart, these are all real prices. In reality, I tend to shop at the bulk store for good deals on whole grains, etc. However, I wanted to make this menu accessible for those that don't have the means, the time or the option to do so. Bulk prices would have made this menu $2-3 dollars cheaper.

We tend to be very extravagant with food (steaks every other night, premium cheeses, wine, organic, etc.)  and are undertaking this to ground ourselves a bit. We will not be eating like this in the long term. However, you certainly could. There are a bunch of other items that you could swap out on my menu that are equally frugal (sweet potatoes, a variety of different beans, lentils, soups, homemade bread or pizza, etc.) 

This most likely would come out around 1700 calories a person, maybe a bit more or less, if all food was consumed. My husband and I are small people and don't need to eat 2,000 to maintain our weight.

I wanted to say ""thanks"" for the inspiration.  I try to eat healthy, and I do cook for myself, but oftentimes it can be a chore given I'm just cooking for one person, and who wants to make full meals when ramen is so much easier?

The last few weeks, I've been shopping with soups in mind...I started making my own ""must go"" soups and bringing them with me to work, and I constantly get comments like, ""That smells *amazing,* what is it?""  or ""I eat 'Campbells' all the time!  What flavor is that?""  It's been a HUGE money and time saver, and today I made two separate soups (16 meals worth!) in about an hour.  Each soup had a dozen different ingredients, including remnants and leftovers and fresh produce, and for the first time I was curious enough to see what it cost me.

Total cost of ingredients I bought today that went into the soup ~$20.  Everything else were ingredients I've had in my pantry and fridge, so I didn't count those in the total cost of the soup since they were odds and ends that ""must go.""  I am SO EXCITED that each ""meal"" costs less than $1.70, and will last me two weeks.

So, thank you for the inspiration to care about what I'm eating, and stop pretending like budget-friendly-but-terrible-for-you meals like ramen were an answer to my hunger.  I love seeing the recipes you come up with, and also love that I'm not the only one out there that worries about the cost of food, and being healthy and sustainable at the same time.

You're all awesome!

You can use any trail mix. Although I would avoid the ones with chocolate. I took the almonds out of this brand because they were too  big.

When someone asks what basics they should have in their pantry, I tend to see a lot of extremely specific answers that aren't too useful to /r/budgetfood. I have a pantry full of niche spices and oils, too, but I know very few people posting here are going to have use for stuff like ground cloves or brown rice syrup, so I'm not going to recommend them for general use.

Therefore, I've compiled a barebones list of oils and spices that will give you a solid foundation for cooking. Everyone should always have these in their kitchen no matter what because you will need at least one of these every time you cook anything in any cuisine:

* Salt
* Pepper
* Olive oil. It's extremely healthy, and a good olive oil can do wonders to your food. 
* A lighter oil for baking, deep frying, and recipes that require a neutral-tasting oil. Canola and vegetable are your cheapest and easiest options, but I prefer using coconut oil. 

So that's our foundation. Here's what I would consider an ""intermediate list."" Here are spices you'll find quite often in most cuisines. 

* Fresh garlic. It lasts a long time when stored properly and tastes a lot better than garlic powder. 
* Red pepper flakes, chili powder, or cayenne pepper. ""Spice that will add heat"" is what I'm trying for here.
* Cumin. You'll find this used in a lot of budget recipes. 

If you want to cook Asian food or basic stir-fries, you'll need these staples:

* Fresh ginger. Lasts a long time when stored properly and can also be frozen for long-term use.
* Soy sauce 
* Sesame Oil


That should give a well-rounded basis to start cooking from. Any spices or oils not on this list are highly dependent on your diet and what types of cuisines you like to cook.

I was wondering if you guys could help me come up with lunches that could be made for less than five dollars a day and can be kept in my book bag while I'm at class in the morning and on my way to work. There's a microwave in the break room if that opens up more options.

___
___
___

**Pantry Goods** 

* Oats. Steel cut, rolled, quick - up to you.
* Rice. Like I've said before, pick yourself up a huge bag of rice if you can. 
* Pasta. Egg noodles are good for casseroles, spaghetti is...well, spaghetti, elbow for some great mac and cheese or maybe a pasta salad.
* Dried Beans. I don't need to go over this, we talk this into the ground around here.
* Dried Lentils. Faster than beans, and you can make some great soups with brown lentiles, or use red for a spicy Indian dinner.
* Breadcrumbs. Preferably [homemade](http://www.makeandtakes.com/homemade-bread-crumbs).
* Saltines. I love to snack on them, and a box is usually under a dollar. Some people find that weird.
* Ramen. How can we deny our good old cheap sodium-laden friend? He's gotten many of us through hard times.
* Flour. It's cheap and it's a main component in delicious homemade [rustic bread](http://www.goodlifeeats.com/2010/09/rustic-rosemary-garlic-bread.html), a [baguette](http://www.goodlifeeats.com/2011/01/light-whole-wheat-baguette.html), or a [pizza dough](http://www.canadianliving.com/food/pizza_dough.php). 
* Sugar. Especially if you like to bake, put it in oatmeal, or maybe just need something sweet in your life. Wouldn't hurt to have granulated, brown, and powdered sitting around.
* Instant Yeast. Buy a bag and keep it in the freezer. Don't bother with those little packets.
* Vinegar. [Here's](http://busycooks.about.com/od/quicktips/qt/vinegartips.htm) a good guide as to when to use which vinegar.
* Olive oil or vegetable oil. I'm not a food snob, I'm not going to tell you you HAVE to use olive oil, especially on a budget. But it's preferred.
* Garlic. Many people buy fresh. To be honest, I keep a huge jar of minced in my fridge.
* Peanut Butter. Great in oatmeal, smoothies, and sandwiches.  
* Green Tea. If you're like me and don't like to drink water, green tea (bagged or loose leaf) is a lifesaver. It's cheap and it's way healthier than soda or juice. Optional: sweeten with honey. Sugar will do.
* Dehydrated Potato Flakes. Are they gross? I think so. Some people like them better than real mashed potatoes. I use them to thicken potato soup if need be. 
* Flour (and Corn) Tortillas. I hear it's very easy to make your own. Try it out.
* Nutella. This is technically superfluous, but to me, no pantry is complete without it, or a cheaper knock-off brand (Nutkao is good, but I've only found it at Big Lots.)

___

**Canned Goods**

* Black Beans. Good for a quick chili, burritos, maybe some Mexican-style rice bowls. 
* Kidney Beans. Chili, and the ever-beloved red beans and rice. 
* Tuna. I've seen suggestions for adding it to rice or to mac and cheese (my favourite), a great casserole, making some tasty [tuna patties](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/tuna_patties/), or a delicious tuna salad sandwich.
* Tomatoes. I make sure to always have tomato paste, sauce, and diced sitting around. 
* Broth. Chicken, beef, or vegetable. If you make homemade stock, more power to you! You rock.
* Store-brand canned or jarred spaghetti sauce. Not the best, but I trust you to doctor it up. 
* Fruits. Is fresh better? Sure. But where are you going to get fresh fruits when the zombies come, huh?! Seriously though, at least having canned pineapple comes in handy. Try it on pizza, in Asian foods, or with cottage cheese!

___

**Spices, Seasonings, and Condiments**

* Onion Powder. Most of these types of spices can be found at Aldi's Kroger, Walmart, etc. for around a dollar.
* Garlic Powder.
* Red Chili Flakes. Kick it up a notch. Especially ramen.
* Cinnamon. Back to oatmeal.
* Oregano. Helpful for when your canned spaghetti sauce just isn't cutting it.
* Cumin. Instantly makes Mexican food better.
* Soy Sauce.
* Worcestershire Sauce. My life would be boring without it.
* Sriracha. Put that shit on ERRYTHANG.
* Tobasco, both red and green. Chipotle is my favourite, it adds a nice smoky flavour.
* Miracle Whip or Mayonnaise. Need it for tuna/pasta/chicken salads, and a pre-dinner snack. [IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klx7qxgurMM)
* Mustard.
* Ketchup, a.k.a. Barbarian Sauce. I never use it, but I know lots of people who drown their food in it.
* Lemon Juice. A large $1 bottle at Aldi's is good for both cooking and for mixing with water and sugar to make lemonade!
* Salsa. Who doesn't love salsa on their eggs or burritos?

___

**In the Fridge and Freezer**

* Milk. If you don't use a lot, buy half gallons. It tends to be more expensive, but it's better than wasting a ton of milk. 
* Sour Cream. Great on Mexican foods, and in chili (and lot of other things, I just love chili.) 
* Butter. To be 100% honest, day-to-day I use margarine. I know it's frowned upon, but I don't mind that much. I use butter for baking though.
* Eggs. Cheap, delicious, and healthy.
* Cheese. Whatever kind tickles your fancy. Except Kraft Singles. That's a waste of precious funds. 
* Cottage Cheese, if it's on sale. I love it with...everything.
* Bags of frozen veggies. Although if you prefer canned, get canned. I keep mostly corn and peas, so I don't have to use a whole can if I don't need it. 
* Meats. As far as this goes, it's up to you. Chicken thighs are cheap, whole chickens, ground beef, on-sale cuts of meat, bacon, sausage, hot dogs, get whatever you want, but as always, keep your frugal budget hat on.

___

**Produce**

* Bananas. Great for smoothies, oatmeal, and sandwiches (if you're like The King.) Peel them, freeze them, and put them in a smoothie.
* Apples. Keeps the doctor away and whatnot.
* Onions. I put onions in *everything*. They're cheap and bring a lot to the table, taste-wise.
* Potatoes. Useful, filling, and cheap.
* Green onions. 
* A leafy green. Pick your favourite.
* Carrots. Not baby ones, those are expensive. Buy a bag of whole carrots and do the dirty work yourself!

Remember, this list is neither entirely inclusive, nor do you need everything on this list. There's a very good chance that I both forgot AND included things on this list that most people would or wouldn't find to be a 'staple'. 
Be creative, and stocking up on the non-perishable items on this list *now* may keep you fed in harder times in the future. Keep the pantry stocked! 

**Tips**

*Make sure you cycle through your goods, you wouldn't want them to go bad, would you? Whenever you notice you're about 1/4 through something, put it on your list. That way if you can't buy it immediately, you still have some left. I hate being out of things I use all the time!
* Some things may not be wise to buy in bulk. If you have the space and you KNOW you're going to use it, go ahead, but don't buy a ton of something you barely use or don't go through quickly just because it's on sale. I don't care if you have coupons, if you don't drink Nesquik mix, don't get it! It'll just take up space. 
* Onions and potatoes are usually safe to buy at least a couple bags, but don't store them near each other. I hear it's bad for both parties, although some don't agree.

* 1 zucchini $0.88

* spices (paprika, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, salt, pepper)
* 9 burrito sized tortillas $1.50 (I live in az and tortillas can be found for cheap)

Basically I just put my rice into the rice cooker.  while it was cooking I sauteed the onion, zucchini (i just had it lying around), and garlic in some butter.  Drained the beans, corn, and one can of tomatoes and added those to the skillet along with the spices.  I used the juices from one of the cans of tomatoes so it wouldn't be too dry, and brought it to a simmer.  Once the rice was done, I just zapped the tortillas with a damp paper towel and put the burritos together.  I ate one last night, and wrapped the rest in saran wrap and threw them in a freezer bag.  They are super easy to grab for lunch at work or a quick dinner at home.  Just throw them in the microwave, or throw in a ksillet to get a bit crispy.

Total cost was about $9.08.  I got 9 big ass burritos plus I have some leftover filling ( I ran out of tortillas)

I dont have a membership or vehicle so my costco trips are few and far between. What are some good things I should stock up on?

Right now my list is just

* eggs
* canned beans / lentils (depending on price)
* paper towel
* body wash
* shampoo
* vegetable oil

**POST COSTCO TRIP UPDATE**

post costo report: if you're in Ontario the boneless skinless chicken prices were shit- $6 / lb!! But the whole / quartered chicken prices were more reasonable. Shampoo was more expensive per bottle than what I could get from Shoppers. Kirkland instant coffee was more expensive than I'd have liked- I generally buy folgers or maxwell when there's sales- it wasn't even close enough to the price I'd want to justify the convenience of not waiting for the next sale on folgers, which conveniently is this week at Metro!

Things I got great deals on

* coke cans are on sale 8.99 for 32 (about 28 cents / can), I bought 96 only to find out today No Frills is selling them 3.99 for 18 (24 cents / can) No regrets though, can never have enough coke and since I dont have a car, 96 cans from No Frills would require numerous trips
* They didnt have the frozen veggies I wanted and what they did have the prices didn't look too remarkable
* Got kirland laundry powder 7 cents / load, like 200 loads
* 16L veg oil for $21
* old spice body wash ~2$ per bottle
* Palmolive jug of dish soap
* kirkland recycled paper towels
* eggs - 30 for 6.99 - 23c / egg, I'm used to at least 24c / egg
* I can't recall how much I normally pay for peppercorns, but I got some there, sea salt seemed pretty reasonably priced. I do my spice shopping at a spice store normally, this was more convenience than savings.

**Thanks for all the tips, everyone**

1/2 lb. - 3/4 lb. ground beef

1 can spicy chili beans

1/4 cup of whatever *hot* salsa is on hand

2 tbsp. Cholula hot sauce (or whatever your favorite hot sauce is. Sriracha would also be excellent.)

1 tbsp. onion flakes

2-4 tsp. cinnamon (true Cinncinnati chili is REALLY cinnamon-y)

1 tbsp. chili powder

1.5 tbsp. Heinz ketchup

3-4 dashes salt/pepper (to taste)


(Measurements for spices are approximations. I usually add dashes of everything until the chili is bold and spicy with a subtle cinnamon taste.)


1) Brown beef in a pot over medium-high heat.

2) After beef is adequately browned, drain beef then add chili beans. Reduce heat.

3) Add salsa, Cholula, onion flakes, cinnamon, chili powder, ketchup, and salt/pepper. Stir chili.

4) IF the chili is a bit too thick for your liking (it's really thick at this point), add water until you reach the consistency you like.

5) Bring up heat to a boil.

6) Reduce heat (again), pour in a bowl, and enjoy!

(Serves 1-2)

To buy everything from the store would be around $20, if you're good. A batch of the chili is only $3-$5.

My prices are for rural northwestern Canada, so I guarantee anyone in the US will pay a lot less.

Fish stew on rice

* $5.00 (it was $10 for 4) - 2 large fillets of firm white fish (I used Basa) cut into 2-inch pieces
* $0.10 - 2 tablespoons olive oil
* $0.05 - 1 large clove garlic, smashed and cut small
* $0.30 - 1 large onion, diced
* $0.50 - 1 green bell pepper, diced
* $0.20 - 3 stalks celery, sliced
* $0.50 - 1 large tomato, diced
* $0.01 - 1/2 teaspoon dried leaf basil
* $0.01 - 1/2 teaspoon dried leaf oregano
* $0.01 - 1 teaspoon salt
* $0.01 - A pretty liberal grinding of black pepper
* $0.00 - 1/4 cup water
* $0.50 - 1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
* $0.10 (I buy a massive bag for $20 and it lasts months) - 2 cups white rice

Make the rice separately, to pour the stew over.

Put everything else except the wine in a slow cooker and give it one thorough stir, but don't break apart the fish chunks. Put it on high for 5 hours. One hour before it's done, pour the wine over top.

Meanwhile in a large skillet, cook chopped bacon until slightly crisp; remove and drain onto paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon fat; add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and heat in reused large skillet. Add chopped onion, and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic, and cook 1 minute more. Add wine if desired; cook one more minute.
Return cooked bacon to pan; add cooked and drained spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or is sticking together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or large fork until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Add salt and pepper to taste (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).
Serve immediately with chopped parsley sprinkled on top, and extra Parmesan cheese at table. Serve with salad and wine*

***Why Lambrusco? Suck it haters, it's delicious. And the sweet is PERFECT for the salty, creamy carbonara. ~~Cheap~~ Inexpensive Lambrusco is just as good as high dollar. Also, this is enough pasta for an army. Fortunately, I LOVE the leftovers for breakfast. 

**Raspberry and mascarpone dessert**

1 package raspberries **$3.00**

4oz of mascarpone cheese (look at your deli day old, I find it all the time for dirt cheap) **$1.50**

6oz whipped cream **$.80**

3tsp of sugar

16 gingersnap cookies **$1.00**

1 bottle of champagne (This is budgetfood, it can be André, you're gonna put fruit in it anyway). **$6.00**

*Grab pretty dessert dishes (clear ones look cool). Crush up cookies in the bottom. Mix the mascarpone, whipped cream, and sugar and spoon evenly into dishes. Top with raspberries (save some to serve in champagne flutes). Garnish with chocolate shavings if you have some around, or a mint leaf, or a few crumbs from the cookies. This dessert is FANTASTIC with Lemoncello, btw.*

**Grand total: $37.35 or $6.22/per person.** Because I was so under budget for my night, I doubled the wine (we like to party). Minus the wine it's $18.35 or $3.05/per person.

Because we had very little money while I was growing up, we ate alot of hot dogs. After awhile we all got pretty sick of the plain boiled or even grilled dogs. So my father went looking for a better way to prepare them so my sister and I would actually eat them instead of feeding them to the pup we had. For years, this was the ONLY way I would eat them. Daddy passed away in Dec. of 2009 but I'm sure he would not mind my sharing this with everyone.

Ingredients:

1 package Hot Dogs (any variety should do)

1/4 cup water

1/2 cup ketchup

1 Tblsp. Brown Vinegar (I discovered it's Apple Cider vinegar)

1 Tblsp. Brown Sugar (light is used here but dark works)

1 tsp. Seasoned Salt

1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce (He used a Tblsp. Adjust to taste)

1/8 tsp. Chili powder

1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped Onion

1-2 Tblsp. Margarine

1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder

Mix all ingredients except onion and margarine. Set aside. 

Melt margarine in a skillet. Add onions and saute for a few minutes. 

Add the hot dogs and roll 'em around for a minute or two. 

Pour the sauce mix over the hot dogs. Simmer for 10-20 minutes.

Serves 4-8.

Variations: If you don't have onion you can use 2 Tblsp. dry onion in the seasoning aisle OR use 1-2 tsp onion powder.

You can also mince 2 cloves of garlic and add that to the onion and margarine and not the sauce mix.

To make the sauce thicker, use a little less water. Thinner sauce, use a little more water.

Suggestion: DOUBLE the sauce mix. I haven't found anyone who doesn't like this recipe yet and he always doubled this for the extra sauce that makes these so yummy.",,False,self,t5_2si9h,False,,,True,t3_17kprs,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/17kprs/my_favorite_hot_dog_recipe_xpost_from_rrecipes/,

onions, lettuce, potatoes, carrots, garlic, bell peppers.

apples, bananas, oranges.

tomatoes, tomato sauce.

granola/almond milk (for a quicker breakfast). I want to try making the granola myself, just by putting some oats in a pot with brown sugar or something.

frozen veggies and fruit.

bacon/ham/sausage as a breakfast meat/protein.

Often times I'm left with leftovers that are un-interesting on their own and end up going to waste (which I abhor).  So, recently I've been trying to plan out several days worth of dinners in advance wherein the recipes use the leftovers from a previous night in some way. Here is an example ""Chain"":

- Night 1:  Whole Rotisserie Chicken (store-bought, hard to beat), Baby Red Potatoes, salad

- Night 2: Tacos (Ground Beef or Turkey), with a can of beans, and a 12oz package of Yellow Rice.  Lettuce and tomato from previous night used as toppings.

- Night 3: Ghetto Paella with some of the leftover chicken (good use for the dark meat or breast meat), also using the leftover yellow rice, and for bonus points, use a chicken stock made from the carcass of the chicken.

- Night 4: Chili, whatever recipe, use the rest of the ground beef (you could either cook all the beef on night 2 and use taco-seasoned beef, or keep half of the beef un-cooked).  Also, I typically make some cornbread and some steamed broccoli.

- Night 5: Pulled chicken sandwiches with the rest of the chicken.  Home-fries from any potatoes left.  

- Night 6: C-C-C-Combo Breaker

I've found that taking this approach allows me to do the vast majority of my grocery shopping once per week and also greatly reduces the amount of wasted food.

For those of you that aren't allergic/abhorent to soy, there's this amazing stuff called TVP, or texturized vegetable protein. Mmm sounds delicious right? I know it sounds a little weird, but I've grown up eating it and it can be cooked into some amazing dishes.

It comes dried, in [chunks or ground-meat style](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X1YnJXRtkOY/To6TqYU_3lI/AAAAAAAAATg/MWcHccLMmNc/s1600/DSC02016.JPG). Usually you can buy it in bulk, and since it is dried it is SUPER cheap. I've fed a group of 8 people with it for under $10 (maybe $15 included spices/sauces/veggies).

Also, it's super versatile. You can use the chunks to make stir fries, stew, and the ground tvp can easily can replace [ground meat](http://vegweb.com/recipes/basic-vegan-ground-beef) (I recommend a little white/balsamic vinegar to add richness- just a tablespoon or two), to make burgers, pasta sauce, sloppy joes, chilli...

Look up some recipes online, but as I said it is really versatile and easy to use, and it also expands a lot once soaked/cooked.

Anyone else love TVP? :P",,False,self,t5_2si9h,False,,gold,True,t3_1b9ast,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1b9ast/tvp_as_a_cheap_replacement_for_ground_meat/,

It's pretty damn tasty and will be feeding me at work for the next couple of days.

http://imgur.com/YKRmjtq

Approx. cost: $15-20

Approx. servings: 8-10

Ingredients:

2 cups (8 oz) brown rice
1 sweet onion
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1 can beans (black or pinto)
1 can corn (unsalted)
1 can diced beets
1 can diced carrots
1 can diced tomatoes
1 package of uncooked pork sausage links 
1/3 bottle of dry white wine
Large assortment of spices and hot sauce of your choice

Also, try shredded chicken breast, more sausage, bits of steak, etc. because it needs more meat.

Directions:

Cook rice as directed on package. Don't burn it like I did on the first attempt. Also, don't undercook it like I did on the second attempt. It should be almost fully cooked but still firm. 

Meanwhile, dice up onions and bell peppers into large squares (1/2""-1"") and cook in a skillet on high until onions start to brown. 

Cook sausages as directed on package. Set sausage grease aside in one of the empty cans of vegetables. Once cooked, dice into tiny bits and re-cook to ensure that all sides of the meat are browned.

Once rice is finished cooking to al dente, add sausage, onion mix, diced tomatoes (with liquid from the can), and all other vegetables (without liquid from the can). Throw on an assortment of spices and hot sauce from your cabinet. 

Mix ingredients well and move to a large skillet. Set heat to medium-low and add a few ounces of white wine and sausage grease to taste. Cover and let simmer for a few minutes until wine is cooked away. Continue this process of adding wine and cooking it off while covered until at least 1/4 bottle of wine or more has been thoroughly cooked into the mixture and rice is soft.

Serve and/or save leftovers for later.

Eat it like a brown bear. Drink the remaining 2/3 bottle of wine.

Edit: I forgot I only used a half can of the carrots and beets. Use your discretion for ratios but a full can seemed like a bit much for this and my pot was getting full.

The one in my area offers free food to just about anybody.  All you need is to provide identification. Their only restrictions are that you're limited to five day's worth of food (based on the number of mouths at home), and you can only do this once per month.  They help you shop, suggest recipes, plan meals, and will pack and load with you.

It's easy to find a food bank.  Just google it, and add your city/town's name.

Most of them are really cheap, too. I was just wondering what r/budgetfood's favorite ramen recipes are. I'll start:

**Ingredients**

* One package of beef ramen (and water for cooking)
* 1/2 lb of ground beef
* 1 egg (hardboiled)
* milk or cream
* one package spicy Chinese mustard that you found at the back of the fridge cuz it was like 3AM and you were out of hot sauce
* Assorted spices (I like to use basil and oregano)

**How to**


1. Prepare ramen noodles like you would if you were just regularly making ramen noodles. Do not mix in the flavoring packet yet. Do not drain the water all the way. Drain the water from the noodles about half way, then add the seasoning packet.

2. Cook ground beef with the seasonings you intend to put in your ramen. Add to cooked ramen.

3. Add however much milk/cream you want. It makes the broth a little thicker. Add until kind of a creamy brown.

4. Add spices to taste.

5. Cut up hard boiled egg. I like to take most of the yolk out of my eggs and just add the whites to my broth.

6. Add spicy mustard on top, so that when you swirl the noodles for the first bite, all the spiciness gets mixed in evenly.

Slow-cooker chicken is scary because it can get dry, so dark meat with bone in and skin on works well here and it ends up nice and tender.  Crock pot recipes are usually super flexible too so don't be afraid to make changes!  Came to around $7 for two people (with leftovers, and it tastes better the next day!) excluding seasonings.  

---------


*  1 small can tomato paste

*  1 can tomato sauce

*  1 can diced tomato (or 2 if you want)

*  1 onion

*  4-6 Chicken Drumsticks

*  Red Wine

*  Salt

*  Favorite herbs (I used basil and oregano, and a little red pepper)

*  Garlic

*  Penne pasta

(Basically, use enough of the sauce to cover all the chicken and season to taste.)


----------

1) Rinse chicken.  Leave skin on and bone-in for best flavor and moisture.

2) Mix all cans of tomato stuff, seasoning, chopped onion, and red wine to taste.

3) Ok this is where I suck at writing recipes.  I like to put some sauce under and the rest on top of the chicken.  So, add enough to cover the bottom of the pot, add the chicken, and use the rest of the sauce to cover the chicken.

4) Cook on low for 8-10 hours

5) Serve on plain penne pasta or rice.  Enjoy!


Chicken cacciatore is supposed to be made with mushrooms too IIRC but I'm not a fan of them so I leave them out.  Enjoy!

I made this a year or so ago and have been getting requests for it ever since.  It's very affordable, simple, and extremely delicious.  

Some tips and virtues: 

* It's very versatile, you can add bacon on top, spice it how you want, add more or less cheese.  The recipe calls for for milk but I have gone so far as substituting it for heavy whipping cream (oohhhh God sooo gooooood).  
* I recommend a shredded cheese mix, or say colby/jack.  I have used cheddar but that comes out too greasy and not as creamy.  Most of the time I use the [4 Cheese Mexican Blend](http://fresh.amazon.com/product?asin=B000SKO936) (be careful as some of these have spice in them, I use the non-spiced but it's up to you!), these are generally pretty cheap and a lot of times on sale in twofers.  
* Use up any pasta you have in your cupboard!  Today I used some cellentani that we've had waiting for use.  I don't recommend spaghetti but hey, whatever works for ya!
* You can pre-assemble and transport it very easily.  For instance, I just prepped the two parts (liquid in one container then the layered mac and shredded cheese in the dish) and am going to take it with me to ""assemble"" before dinner to pop in the oven for fresh mac.  
* The recipe easily doubles if you have a large group (people *will* eat all of this, unless they're cheese haters).

Subject: $2 Challenge

I was on my way home from work, and I had two dollars in my pocket.  I was hungry.  I thought to myself ""What can I do with $2?""  Not too much...I could get perhaps a 99-cent hamburger and a 99-cent soda; or I could get a bag of chips (if they were on sale) and a soda (or maybe a quart of milk).  But while browsing through the supermarket, I was reminded that they often sell chicken at cheap prices, so I looked there.  $1.60 for seven drumsticks isn't bad: take it home, coat it with salt, pepper, and garlic, and microwave it at half-power for 40 minutes.  Voila - a decent meal for one, for under two dollars.

And for no real reason, I'm sitting here thinking, ""What else could I do with $2?""  It occurs to me that there a lot of simple, cheap dishes one could make for under $2...and if you're living on a tight budget (as many of us are), then you've probably learned a few tricks on how to take cheap food and jazz it up to make it more appealing.

I'm not very creative when it comes to cooking, but a number of the folks here on the Net are.  So here's the question: What kind of meal can YOU make for two dollars or less?  The rules are simple: It can be a meal for one person, and it's assumed that you have basic condiments at home.  Any food item is acceptable, as long as it's cheap.  And there's nothing wrong with using the old stand-by that many starving artists and college students live on .

I've tried heaps of different recipes over the years mixing my own spices, using different jars of premade sauces/pastes and combinations of both, but this uses just a cheap basic curry powder mix and I think it tastes better than any other homemade curry I've had.

I don't measure what I add, just estimate until it looks/tastes how I like so measurements I give here are probably +/-25%. Anyway...

* ~1kg chicken. I prefer thighs, but usually use wings as they are cheaper.
* 2 or 3 brown onions diced
* 1 to 2 teaspoons of both Garlic and ginger paste (or fresh if you want)
* ~3 tablespoons curry powder [I use this](http://www.mckenziesfoods.com.au/product/89/Clive_Of_India_Authentic_Curry_Powder)
* ~2 teaspoons chilli powder - I like it hotter so adjust to what you want
* Tin of tomatoes (400g ish I think)
* Small tub of natural yoghurt - I think these are about 200ml
* ~0.5 to 1 cup almond meal. This is the only costly bit of the recipe, but if you buy whole almonds and crush them its cheaper.
* Butter and oil for frying

Fry the onions, garlic and ginger in a little butter and oil. When cooked a bit add spices plus a little salt (I will sometimes add extra spices for different flavours on top of what I listed). Cook for 30 seconds or so then add tomatoes and crush/stir to make a chunky paste. Add the chicken and simmer covered on low heat until cooked. You can eat it now but I prefer to cook it for a couple of hours until the chicken falls off the bone. 5 minutes before serving add the yoghurt and simmer. When ready mix through the almond meal to thicken and cook for a minute or so.

Thats my basic recipe, I usually add frozen spinach at the same time as the chicken to make a kind of saag chicken.

Also I have made this with really cheap frozen fish (basa fillets). When I do this I like to add turmeric with the spices and replace the yoghurt with coconut milk and almond meal with dessicated coconut.

I whipped this up last night and it came out so delicious I simply had to share. And the ingredients cost under $7, even cheaper if you start with dried beans and cut the tomatoes yourself, but I didn't have that kind of time. Here we go:

GATHER:

* 15 oz can of black beans

* 15 oz can of red kidney beans

* 28 oz can of diced tomatoes

* 1 green bell pepper, diced

* 3 jalapeño peppers, sliced into rings (cut them in half if they're bigger than 1"" across)

* 2 small yellow onions, diced

* 3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (minced if you can manage it)

* 2.5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

* 3/4 bottle of beer of your choice, I used Laughing Skull (amber ale)

* Salt

* Cinnamon

* Cumin (optional)

* Sriracha (optional, leave it out if you can't do spicy)

PREPARE:

1. Add 1 tbsp oil to a large pot over medium-high heat. Dump in the diced onions and stir to coat.

2. Let the onions brown; this will take about 10-15 minutes. I diced up my onions and garlic, then cut the peppers while waiting for the onions to do their thing.

3. When the onions are beginning to caramelize, toss in another half tbsp of oil and the garlic and stir. Let 'em mix it up in there until the garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes.

4. Turn the heat down to medium, add one final tablespoon of oil and dump in your peppers, all of 'em. Stir everything around and let it sit for a while. I wound up letting my veggies party it up in the pot for about 20 minutes while I struggled with my roommate's shitty can opener with the beans and tomatoes. Just stir them occasionally.

5. Add the beans and tomatoes to the pot. Reserve the bean juice; use it to thin the chili if you think it needs it. I didn't wind up needing my bean juice, but if you like a thinner chili, you might. Add the tomatoes juice-and-all.

6. Stir that bitch together and let it simmer for a while, stirring occasionally. After about 10-15 minutes, pour in 3/4 of your beer. Drink the rest.

8. Taste and season as you like. I used probably a teaspoon of sriracha, 1-1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon, a dash of cumin and half a tablespoon of salt, more or less.

7. Let it simmer over medium heat as long as you like, stirring every 5-10 minutes to keep it from burning and sticking. I let mine simmer for about an hour and it turned out really well; I could have let it go longer but I was really hungry, haha.

This recipe is highly adaptable (like all chilis), and it would also be very good with meat in it, but that shit is expensive. It makes about 8-10 servings.

hours sometimes (we live in a poor area) and it's in the morning. We have a third shift lifestyle so it's not an option.

If anyone has any ideas I'd love to hear them. It's just me and Hubby.

This chili isn't the healthiest, but if you can get a good deal on the meat (or go veggie), should provide several bowlfuls at little cost.

dutchminnesotan's sweet and creamy chicken chili:

* 1 lbs ground chicken (or shredded thighs, whole breast, turkey, maybe even beef)
* 1 bell pepper, chopped (IMO red is most aesthetically appealing and tasty, but green is budget friendly)
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic
* 3 cans white beans (I've used cannellini, garbanzo, and even black beans)
* 1 can diced tomatoes
* 1 block cream cheese
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp cinnamon
* pepper to taste
* salt to taste

Pan fry the chicken, onion, and pepper ahead of time, then mix everything together in the slow-cooker.  

In my experience, it'll be at it's most delicious after 3 hours on high or 5+ hours on low.  I've got some going right now!  Of course, like most slow-cooker recipes, everything in this is optional and very flexible.

Last night after work, I sat down and made a list of Breakfast, lunch and Dinner plans and recipes and then made my shopping list. My menu currently looks like this(HEC - Ham, Egg and Cheese):  
Monday - HEC English Muffin, Burrito, Soup  
Tuesday - HEC English Muffin, Soup, Chili  
Wednesday - HEC English Muffin, Chili, Nachos  
Thursday - HEC English Muffin, Nachos, Chicken Pasta  
Friday - HEC English Muffin, Chicken Pasta, Sandwhich  
Saturday - HEC English Muffin, Sandwhich, Chili/Rice combo  
Sunday - HEC English Muffin, Sandwhich, Chicken and Veggies    



I was able to get all I needed this week for all the meals for $43.23 so well within my budget. I kind of stayed on the safe side and went through adding $0.25 cents to the price of everything just to make sure I included tax and thought my total would be around $49, so I was liberal with my estimates. I also noticed as I was going to leave the store that I had bought a pound of deli chopped ham for $3.01 and they had 5lb hams for $7.98 so I should of got that instead, but next time I'll keep my eye open.


I also went with some frozen vegetables instead of fresh to save time but looking back I would have got more for the money so will go fresh next time and just cut them up and freeze them. So for my grocery list I got(GV = Great Value):  
1/2 gallon of 2% milk  
GV Cheese - 24 slice  
GV Shredded Cheddar Cheese  
GV Thin Spaghetti noodles  
1lb bag of black beans  
1lb bag of white rice  
1 can of GV Northern Beans  
1 can of GV Refried Beans  
1 can GV Green Chilies  
1 can GV Black Olives  
1 McCormick seasoning packet of white chicken chili  
1 head of Lettuce  
1/2lb bag of GV Frozen Carrots  
1lb Deli Chopped Ham  
1lb bag GV Broccoli Cuts  
8ct GV Tortillas  
3lb bag of GV Boneless/Skinless Chicken Breasts  
12ct GV English Muffins  
1 big bag of Santitas Tortilla Chips  
12ct Medium Eggs  
1 tomato and 1 white onion  


I've already made my chicken stock, burritos, and the HEC English Muffins so I can microwave them for lunch or whatever. This was my first time making chicken stock and it turned out really well, I'll be using it for my soup, the spaghetti and to make rice in. Sorry for this being such a long post but figured I'd throw this out there to help me stay on point, maybe get some more pointers and good recipes utilizing the above ingredients if you have any just in case I overlooked anything and end up having to make something else.

Take a large squash, top and tail it, slice it in half lengthways, and scoop out the seeds. Put peppercorns, salt, garlic, cumin, a chopped chilli, and some oil into your mortar and pestle, give it a bit of a grind, then dollop that over the flesh of the squash. Roast at about 180C until the flesh is soft enough to be scooped out with a spoon. This can take up to an hour, and some parts will soften slower than others, so patience is key.

As the squash approaches the time you'll remove it from the oven, soften onions and a red pepper in a pan, before adding the softened squash, and add some stock (vegetable or chicken, your choice). Add another chilli (if you so desire), season to taste, then blend it in the pan. I add a little chilli powder at the end, just to give it a little more strength, but this isn't essential.

I use standard red chillis for this, but you can use stronger ones if you like. I attempted a scotch bonnet one time, and hugely regretted it.

It keeps well, and makes several portions.

Get all the fresh veg you can get your hands on, I usually use onions, red peppers, mushrooms, sweetcorn, and anything else I have in my cupboard at the time, as well as a couple of tins of chopped tomatoes (important). Chop the veg up, and put it all into a wok (off the heat), with some crushed &amp; chopped garlic, and plenty of mixed herbs, before topping with olive oil, and give it a good mix. At this point, start to cook your pasta, I tend to use either penne or fusilli. 

Put the wok onto the hob on a high heat, frying it off until it all cooks through. When this is all cooked through (keep it moving, it will take a little time), mix in your drained and cooked pasta. Mix all of this together, then add the chilli sauce of your desire. I tend to use a sweet chilli sauce for this, but I'm sure sriracha(?) would also work.

That's it. A simple, healthy pasta dish that will last a few days, and is cheap. Top with cheese, if you want to be a little naughty though!",,False,self,t5_2si9h,False,,,True,t3_13zhn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/13zhn6/two_recipes_ive_been_told_to_post_xpost_from/,

Taco Soup

* 1 15oz can Black Beans
* 1 15oz can Dark Red Kidney Beans
* 1 15oz can Light Red Kidney Beans
* 1 15.5oz can White Hominy 
* 3 10oz cans Rotel
* 3 Stalks of Celery 
* 1/2 - 1 Onion (1/2 is usually enough for me)
* 1 cup broth (Chicken, beef, veggie - doesn't matter which ever you prefer)
* 1 package Taco Seasoning 
* 1 package Ranch Dressing Mix (I get the hidden valley one)
* Optional - Add 1 pd browned ground turkey/beef. 

1. Drain black beans, kidney beans and hominy. Add to large pot over medium-high heat. 
2. Add Broth, Rotel, Taco seasoning and Ranch dressing mix (and browned meat if so desired). Stir together.
3. While that is heating up, cut up celery and onion. Sautee (I like to add a little garlic flavor to the celery and onions at this point)
4. Add the celery and onion to the large pot and mix them in. 
5. Enjoy Delicious soup. I like to top it with shredded cheese and diced avocado. Also good with tortilla chips, or just tortillas.


A single batch will last me almost a week, eating it for lunch and dinner. It costs around $15-20 depending on if I have any of the ingredients and if I add ground turkey.

This way I have a set grocery list and know what i'm buying, how long it will last, and won't get scurvy from lack of vitamins (never happened to me because I like oranges, but I've heard stories)

I've looked and found some that can do one or two of these things, but have never found a good way to do all three.

* Boil water and make a 2-3 servings of any kind of noodle
* (Optional) if you have any leafy greens like spinach or bok choy around, toss them with some oil, salt, and pepper and pop them in the oven for around 5 minutes
* Meanwhile, sautee some chopped onion or garlic in a bit of oil until translucent, then add the can of sardines and sauce, break up the fish with your spoon and let simmer while your noodles and vegetables cook. Once both are done, drain noodles, add to sauce, stir over heat for a few minutes, then top with greens and serve.

It was a tad bit salty, but if you drain the sardines, or buy them in oil or water, then add a can of diced tomatoes, that should mitigate the issue. Adding a bit of lemon juice if you have it on hand helps as well.

Since the fridge was mostly empty I decided to go to the store and test my memory about costs for this big-batch favorite.

**Equipment:**

If you have a large slow-cooker, a stove and a couple of pots, you are set for equipment.  Personally I use a dutch oven (inside a conventional oven) instead of a crock pot, but it works out the same either way.  You’ll need something to store leftovers in too, or a crowd of friends to eat your food.

**Food:**

5-6 lb pork butt, $1/lb on sale, $1.79/lb other days  
2 onions, less than $1  
2 green peppers, $.59 each on sale  
4 carrots, should be less than $1  
1 lb brown rice, $1  
1 lb pinto beans, $1  
Vegetable of your choice, I bought a big bag of frozen broccoli for $3.59  
Sugar, salt, spices

I bought all but the seasonings on a trip to the discount store (Buy4Less here, but there are comparable prices at Walmart and elsewhere).  I bought onions and carrots by the bag, so I’m guessing a bit on the costs.  Rice and beans were both under $1/lb for buying larger bags, but in my area you can buy 1 lb bags of each for $0.99.  The green peppers were on sale, which was lucky for me; but in a given shopping trip you’ll probably find something on sale, right?  Total cost for me was well under $25, but I’ll round up to that to account for seasonings, energy, amortized equipment and all the rest.

Season the meat the night before you cook and let it sit overnight.  You can pick a spice rub recipe that you like, or buy a pre-made mix like Butt Rub (worth it just to have the jar sitting around).  My own mix is this:

6 Tbs brown sugar  
2 Tbs salt  
1 Tbs paprika  
2 tsp cumin  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp black pepper  

It might look like a lot of salt, but it’s going to season both the meat and the beans.  Go for more sugar if you like.  Mix all that up, then cover the meat with the seasonings and press firmly (you don’t actually have to rub) so that it coats all surfaces.  Wrap that up, put it back in the fridge and let it sit overnight.

Soak the beans in water too, according to package directions.  You can do this overnight or the next morning, 4 hours minimum.

The next day, wash the peppers and carrots, peel the onions, and cut them all up into big chunks.  Time to pick your cooking method!

**All-day-while-I’m-at-work method:**  pour the cut-up veggies into the bottom of the slow cooker, then put the meat on top.  It’s okay to move some of the veggies up the sides to make room for the meat.  Pour in water to within an inch of the lid of the cooker, without submerging the meat.  Put the lid on the cooker, turn it on low and let it cook all day (at least 8 hours).

**Slow-cooker-but-not-all-day method:**  as above, but run the cooker on high for 2 hours, then on low for 3-4 hours.

**Conventional-oven-method:**  I use my favorite pot for this, a big cast-iron dutch oven.  I’ve done it in a 5 qt oven, but a 7 qt oven gives you more room for veggies and the biggest cut of meat.  Pour the veggies in the bottom of the dutch oven, lay the meat on top.  Scoop veggies up the sides as needed so that the lid will fit without touching the meat.  Add water to within an inch of the top, but not so much that you submerge the meat.  Put the lid on and place in the oven at 400 for an hour, then lower the temperature to where the liquid is barely bubbling; for my oven that’s 260.  Simmer for an additional 4-5 hours.

So, one way or another you’ve got a cooker or dutch oven full of meat and wonderful soup.  Carefully lift the meat out of the soup, wrap in foil and place somewhere warm.  I put mine back in the oven on the lowest setting.  The last time I did this the meat fell into two pieces, allowing me to extract the bone; if it works out that way for you, keep the bone with the soup.

Now to make your beans!  Pour off the water that the beans soaked in, and put the beans in the soup.  If you used the dutch oven method, just pour the beans right into the dutch oven and put it on the stove top.  If you used the slow cooker, add the beans and the soup to a big pot on the stove.  Turn up the heat to high and let the beans boil in the soup for a few minutes, then reduce the heat to a slow simmer and cook them until soft, usually about 1.5 hours.  I leave the pot uncovered, as I always have more soup than I need for the beans and want to cook off some of the liquid.  If your soup has a layer of fat on top, you can skim that off before adding beans and cooking.  (Personally, I leave it and let the beans soak it up.)

Cook the rice according to package instructions.  I use a rice cooker for this, a nice set-and-forget benefit; but since you are going to have to give the beans some attention while they cook, it’s no big deal to cook the rice on the stove and keep an eye on both.  Start the rice after the beans are simmering, as the rice cooks faster.

For me it seems to work out that the soup veggies have mostly broken down by the time the beans are ready, except for the big chunks of carrot.  If there is still a lot of soup left I’ll take a potato masher and mash some of the beans to thicken it.  Tastes great either way.

When the beans and rice are ready, steam up whatever extra veggies you bought and serve.  I like to put a scoop of rice into a bowl, pour the beans over that, and put big chunks of pork around the edges.

This is a good example of big-batch cooking, where you get a lot of leftovers for your investment.  Last time I made this I portioned out eight dinners, so that’s about $3 per meal.  I always end up with a big chunk of pork that I use for lunch meat or add to a soup or another pot of beans.

Stretch this farther by doubling the beans and rice, there’s plenty of flavor to go around.  Of course you don’t have to eat the same thing all week.  You can alternate leftovers with something else quick and easy, or make three or four big-batch dinners and freeze most of them.

I recently got a little extra cash and I really want to help my mom out. She works 6 days a week and is always exhausted, so cooking isn't exactly her favorite thing to do after a 10 hour day. My dad doesn't mind cooking, so they can eat something more complex for dinner than tv dinners. I'd help out, but I live about 2 hours away.
Even though she works a lot, she doesn't have a lot of extra money. One income for a family of three doesn't go very far.
So basically, I'm looking for advice/recipes and just help in general. I either want to stock up her kitchen with things that can be used for a lot of different things (kitchen basics) or spend a day making a bunch of HEALTHY dinners that can be frozen and reheated. I'd also like to set her and my dad up with a ""eating healthy for dummies"" kind of book with recipes and tips.
I can spend $100-$200 and a day of cooking.

TL;DR: Want to set my overworked, underpaid mom up with a nice, healthy stocked kitchen and freezer to make her life easier.

b)	     Remove ~4 pieces of tomatoes from each can (~8 total) and chop. Add chopped tomato to mixture.
     
c)	     Mince ~2 tbsps onion (I usually do a lot more – depends on how much you like onion) – add to mixture.
    
d)	     Add 2 cups of sour cream to mixture (I usually do a little less).
    
e)	     Cut up the 3tbsps of butter and add with salt and pepper into mixture.

So I'm finally starting to budget now that I have a really good job with plenty of discretionary income and this was the result...

That doesn't include some purchases made while going out and eating and drinking/celebrating (birthday parties last 2 months). I'm categorizing that separately but this is just way too much for regular food consumption, especially when I see posts here ... this could probably feed a family of 4 that was planning smart but I hate micromanaging myself. It's tedious and annoying.

Most of the food I'm eating is shit - it's out to eat, fast food... I know longer term this isn't where I want to be in life.

Now here is my dilemma - I'm lazy and too emotional about this. I'll get all hyped up, go to the store and purchase healthy foods and then I'll cook something, it will taste absolutely disappointing [because I don't know how to cook for myself] and then I become frustrated with cooking and I go right back to buying expensive, easy food because it's easier and less stressful.

1359346583.0,60,self.budgetfood,17erqu,looking for some unique but inexpensive vegetarian meal ideas,75,15,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/17erqu/looking_for_some_unique_but_inexpensive/,"Hey guys,

I was a vegetarian from 6th grade to my sophomore year in high school. Unfortunately though, I rarely ever had a proper meal throughout that time. I've been in a rut of constantly eating really unhealthy foods, and I just feel awful, all the time. So I've decided to try going veg again, but this time actually doing it the right way. 

I'm a decent cook overall and I know how to make most of the basics. I have the ingredients (pastas, beans, rice, veggies, tofu, cheeses, spices), but I'm kinda stuck on what to do with them. I remember being really bored trying to cook for myself when I was a vegetarian back in the day, so this time I want to try to spice things up. 

I'm basically looking for any little gems you have (and are willing to share!) to help me stick to my plan of eating cheap, healthy and delicious food. I don't have much cash to spend on food, either, so that's why I'm writing here. I've looked around on the internet and I find a lot of recipes that require a lot of time and specific ingredients, which I don't have much of at the moment. 

Also, as a side note: I'm especially looking for tofu recipes. I have never known what the heck to do with it. But I bought a pound of firm tofu in hopes of finding an awesome recipe to use it in. I know that stir-fry is a popular option, but I am looking for more! 

Thanks a lot, I'm looking forward to whatever you guys have to share!

Open a can of beer or cider (standard UK can 18oz), drink about a third to refresh yourself. Lower the chicken onto the can until it's balancing on the can and it's wee wings are supporting it standing upright. (Helps if you make porn noises when doing this).

Rub the chicken all over with oil (olive is best but anything will do), then rub salt all over the chicken skin (again, sea salt is best but anything else will do).

Place chicken in a roasting pan and into oven. 2 hours on 180 degrees or until skin is nice and crispy brown and juices run clear when bird is stabbed.

Take out of oven and let it rest/cool. Lift the chicken off the can. Pour the can contents into the roasting pan. (If done correctly this will be a delicious mix of beer and chicken juice - this will be the base for your gravy).

I strip all the meat from the carcass and put aside the leg meat and dark meat for soup.

The white meat I use with gravy or for caesar salads, sandwiches etc - goes for about 4 days.

Take the carcass and skin, put into a large pot and cover with cold water. Add some veg (carrot, leek etc) and some mixed herbs. Simmer on a low heat for 3-4 hours.

Pour though a sieve - this is your stock and will give you about 3-4 pints. Put the carcass, veg etc onto a tray. When it cools you can strip a load more meat from the bones. The skeleton will just fall apart so you can go though a bone at a time to get it all. Put this with the soup meat and bin the remaining bits.

When your stock is cool, skim the fat from the top and discard, then boil the stock for 30 mins or so to reduce and concentrate it - keep skimming as you go.

You'll be left with about 2 pints of beautiful delicious stock which you can freeze and use for soups and such.

Soup: Chop two red onions, two celery sticks and two carrots - your holy trinity of soup bases. saute in butter until soft, then add a palmfull of plain flour, stir this into the veg, then add 1 pint stock and 1 pint water. Simmer this mixture until the veg is cooked through, then shred up all your soup chicken and add to the broth. Season with herbs, salt and pepper. You can add noodles to stretch it further but this lasts me for about 3 days having a good bowlful per day.

Gravy: Take the roasting pan with beer/chicken juice and put over heat. When bubbling, mix two teaspoons of cornflour with cold water. Add a chicken stock cube to the mix to dissolve and a cup of water, let it reduce down and dribble in the cornflour to thicken to your preference, make sure you scrape all the sticky crunchy bits from the pan bottom to add awesome flavour. This can be frozen as well.


you can use cider as well, I avoid cheap lager and tend to use red stripe or similar beer. The beer steams the bird inside so you get a really tender bird and this is the base for a weeks worth of healthy, varied and tasty meals.

**Ingredients:**

* Dry or Wet Jerk Spices ($5-$8 at any grocery store or Jamaican grocer.)
* Skinless chicken breast (I got two for $8.40 at Loblaws)
* Olive oil (I can't remember. $4?)

**Cookware:**

* Tinfoil
* Baking tray
* Optional: Two small plates

**Instructions:**

*Note: You can substitute the small plates for basically anything that won't absorb stuff. When I say ""small plate"" consider making a tinfoil plate or using some Tupperware. Whatever. I hate when recipes restrict you to certain items.*

* Set the oven to bake at 175 C/350 F
* Put a strip of tinfoil over your baking sheet
* Wash your chicken breast thoroughly (I ran mine under tepid water on both sides for a little bit)
* On one small plate pour some olive oil.
* Let the chicken breast take in the oil. Or whatever it's doing. I let the breast sit in the oil on each side for about thirty seconds.
* On the other small plate have some jerk spice ready.
* Place the oiled chicken breast down on the spice and then flip and do that for the other side.
* Rub the jerk spices into the chicken breast. Your hands are going to get gross from the oil and spices, but it's totally worth it.
* Place the breast on the tinfoil covered baking sheet and then put that in your oven (once it's been heated).
* Cook for 40 minutes.
* Remove and enjoy!

I made this tonight and I was surprised by how delightful it was. For cutlets I'd reduce the time to 30 minutes, but I don't think 40 will hurt. 

I wanted to share this recipe because I was sick of not being able to find simple chicken breast recipes in the internet and I just really like putting jerk spice on stuff. If you remove the step about the jerk spices, you can probably still make a pretty fine chicken breast in the oven with this recipe. I made two tonight using 40 minutes, but I don't know if a single chicken breast will reduce that time. Just cut into it at 30 and see how it is.

I'm currently leaning towards the cast-iron skillet, since it seems that so much of the online cooking community has a massive hard-on for them, but is that cookware-boner founded?

Good luck, and let's get some yummy food coming out of this.  I'll give you bonus points (imaginary things that I made up in my head) for including a picture if you make your appetizer this week. 


*On a side note, I’m one of the new Mods of r/budgetfood.  My goal is to have the contests running on a schedule.  Hopefully we can get some interest in these going again.  If you have any ideas for contest topics, please PM me and I’ll do my best to work them in soon.*

1355801296.0,49,self.budgetfood,1516ct,Very cheap fish chowder,63,14,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1516ct/very_cheap_fish_chowder/,"Tilapia or swai are two of the cheapest fish you'll find.  And you kind buy the frozen and cook them from frozen for this.  Few budget food items are seafood... but this counts:

olive oil ($0.10)
2lbs Tilapia (I just paid $8 today)
1 smoked ham hock ($1)
1 medium spanish onion ($0.75)
1 quart fish stock (usually free as you're just taking out their trash)
3/4 pound yukon gold potatoes ($0.75)
dried thyme (1/16th of a $3 bottle)
1 qt whole milk ($1)

We'll start with the fish stock.  Ask your fish market for left over fish bones.  Any decent market will have been asked before.  If all they sell is frozen fish, you're out of luck.  But if they're cleaning/filleting any fish they'll be throwing these bones out.  (you don't really want salmon or tune bones, more like cod, halibut, bass)  They're the secret to many great fish recipes.  Just cover them with water in a pot and simmer for about 30 minutes.  Press them through a strainer until clearish... don't worry about it too much.  This ain't for a Michelin star.

Fish stock can be frozen forever (almost).  I save them in leftover pint containers... as a lot of times you don't need/want a lot of stock.  Clam juice could be used instead, but it's expensive for a small bottle... and this is better.

*Dice up the spanish onion, 
*Soften the onion in the olive oil in a decent sized pot
*add the ham hock... 
*once the onion is softened add the fish stock... 
*simmer for 1-2 hrs, turning the ham hock so it cooks completely
*remove the ham hock, remove the skin, pull off all meat and dice small
*add a bit of thyme to the simmering broth
*dice the potato (skinned or not) and add to broth
*cube up the talapia and add on top of the potatoes 
*let simmer until the potatoes are almost cooked
*warm up the milk in a separate pot (if you add cold milk to hot broth it could curdle on you)
*pour the milk into the rest of the broth... simmer if you want to thicken it... or you could add a roux if you're really in trouble.

Salt.

as it cools it will thicken...

so that's about $12.50 for about 10 servings of seafood chowder

The tilapia will probably shred while simmering.  This gives your chowder a great texture.  If you want larger chunks split the tilapia in half, and add one just before adding the milk.

Lastly, you can freeze the broth + fish just before you add the milk.  That way you can make a large batch and thaw it, just add milk... which you can do when cold and slowly bring up to a simmer... skipping a step.

I'm looking for suggestions to replace the Pasta and Chilli we usually eat since it's cheap and easy to buy in plannable bulk. (aka- 10 Pasta boxes... 10 meals!). 

I will consider derivatives of the above, too. for example, so form of VERY different pasta topping, etc that isn't 'Tomato Sauce' or 'Alfredo'. (I'm tired of both.)

If a list of implements is needed--- we have a Frying Pan. Sauce Pot. Microwave. Various bowls and dishes, the basic utensils  a Spatula, a Soup Ladle, a Sauce Spoon, a Spaghetti Fork. I think we have a small crock pot/slow cooker. 

**We DO NOT** have an Oven. (Efficiency Apartment means just two burners on a hot plate! The Hot plate boils stuff, and lightly frys stuff just fine such as burgers, etc, but it won't get hot enough to 'Deep Fry' things like 'fried chicken' 'french fries', etc.) Also, for the same reason (Small apartment!), making food in bulk to store back isn't a possibility (unless it doesn't need refrigeration), the fridge is impossibly small (Think Hotel Mini Fridge), so it's easier for the things you suggest to be made from scratch regularly easily. 

EXTREMELY Spicy foods (Such as Curry, Heavy Hot Sauce Based Dishes) are off the table, while I can handle them, the hubby cannot--- they'll fuck his stomach up and he'll be sent to the ER.  Also, recipes that are /heavy/ on beans aren't optimal, as neither me or the hubby like them very much.

Food doesn't necessarily need to be 'health conscious'. It just kinda needs to be actual food. ;P.

Suggestions appreciated!

**tl;dr?**: Me and Hubby Tired of Fricken Pasta &amp; Sauce and Chilli most of the time since it's cheap and easy to buy in bulk and repeat. Suggest something else that can also be bought in bulk and cooked easily that isn't 'Pasta and Sauce' or 'Chilli'.

**Unasked for Background Information!:** We usually buy lots of Pasta/Sauce and Chilli (50 cents-1.00 a can of Chilli, depending, to 1.50/2.00 for the Pasta and Sauce combined.) , because it's cheap, and easy to cook and we don't need to rush to eat it, because it won't go bad by the end of the month, or even a few months! The Chilli also goes good on Pasta and /or Rice, too, or on top of Hotdogs But we've eaten it for so long that it's actually starting to taste kinda like sawdust, so looking for a change of pace. :).

**Additonal, EDIT info!**: Our Budget only allows us one trip out to the Wal-Mart where I can use my food stamps without also incurring additional hardship...so I do a months worth of shopping in one scoop, so there's NO other trips down the line---stuff needs to last a month or longer, or could be made to do so, at the minimum in terms of shelf-life. We are mostly looking for stuff at the end of the month, when all the perishable yummies, like the ground beef, and meats and creamy stuff like Milk are gone.

**MOAR EDIT!:** A Chest freezer will never be a possibility for me, sorry guys, only two plugs are rated for things like that here, and one of them is used by the fridge, and the other, is switched between the microwave and hot plate. This is an efficiency apartment ('Efficiency' is the Apartment Class before 'Studio', it means a small room, and no kitchenette area.) , and they keep prices low by pumping two different voltages into the plugs here depending on it's location/load (So if I plug a chest freezer into one of the other plugs here, it will trip the breaker constantly.

1352608457.0,50,self.budgetfood,12zw28,Thought you guys might like my recipe for black bean soup! ,57,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/12zw28/thought_you_guys_might_like_my_recipe_for_black/,"I like to do this thing I call ""jazz cooking"" every once in a while, where I improvise and throw together whatever might be in my kitchen at the time. That way I use things up that I bought too much of, which saves money in the long run. 

Tonight I made up a recipe for black bean soup, and it turned out fucking delicious! It's mostly made up of things that are very cheap to buy, or that any normal kitchen might have lying around.  

* 2 tablespoons bacon grease (I just had this in a jar from the last time I made bacon... I always save it. If you don't have bacon grease, just use some butter or olive oil)

* one medium-sized onion, chopped pretty finely

* 4 cloves garlic, minced (Adjust this for your personal taste... I like things with a lot of garlic!)

* a 14.5-oz (or thereabouts) can of chicken broth/stock

* about 3/4 of a cup of some sort of tomato-ish substance (I used Trader Joe's tomato and garlic pasta sauce because it was what I had on hand, but you could use canned crushed tomatoes or whatever you want)

* a good squirt of ketchup (the reason I used ketchup in addition to my tomato pasta sauce is because ketchup has vinegar in it... adds a bit of tanginess)

* 2 or 3 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce (I didn't measure, but this was probably around what I used)

* cayenne pepper or chili powder to taste (I also added in a bunch of Cholula hot sauce because I like things to be on the spicy side)

* salt and pepper to taste

* 3 15.5-oz cans of black beans, drained but not rinsed (This was basically the reason I made this soup.... I had a bajillion cans of these beans because they went on sale super cheap at the supermarket at one point and I bought a ton)

* some lime juice if you have it

Melt the bacon grease in the bottom of a large heavy pot, and saute the onions over high/medium heat until they go transparent. Add in the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds to one minute). Then, dump in the chicken broth, tomatoey whatever-the-fuck, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper, and chili powder/cayenne/hot sauce. Add the beans, turn the heat up to high, and bring to a boil. Once it boils, turn the heat down until it's simmering, put a lid on that shit, and simmer for around 20-30 minutes to thicken the soup and give the flavors time to meld. Once you've simmered it for a while, add in some lime juice if you like- I'd say I used about 2 or 3 tablespoons. Et voila! Serve it on up... it could be good over rice, or with a dollop of sour cream, whatever tickles your fancy :)

So there you go! Pretty easy recipe, and it makes a goddamn fuck ton of soup for very little money. You could probably freeze the leftovers if you wanted to. Hope you guys enjoy!

My two-fold question is...

1.  For those of you who regularly shop at Sam's, are the prices on meat significantly lower than Walmart (where we usually grocery shop)?

2.  What other types of items would I be wise to purchase in bulk on this trip (based on significant savings), either frozen or non-perishable, keeping my desire for semi-healthy food in mind?

I didn't measure my ingredients, as I almost never do, so you'll have to play around with them a little for your own taste, but i can give you some estimations.

About 4-5 table spoons of natural smooth peanutbutter.
2 table spoons soy sauce
~table spoon of olive oil (for those of you who have sesame oil use that)
~teaspoon garlic powder
pinch of paprika
pinch of pepper
~tsp hot sauce (i used this instead of vinager)
~2 tsp sugar
water until mixture had the texture i wanted
Microwave peanutbutter, water and soysauce together until you get the consistency you want, then add the rest in.

I didnt get to add it this time around as I lacked the ingredient, but ginger should be added into this recipe, and potentially a little lemon juice.

Boil some ramen
and I made a stir fry consisting of
onion
green pepper
carrot
broccoli
with a little salt, garlic powder, soy sauce, pepper, and red pepper.
and when all of it was done i tossed an egg in there and scrambled that up.

I eat probably at least 20 every year. Uses ingredients you've probably got already anyway.

- Ritz Crackers (or off-brand)
- Peanut butter (creamy tends to give better results than smooth)
- Chocolate, melted (She always uses milk chocolate but you can probably use dark)

That's it for ingredients. Spread some peanut butter on each cracker, then dip the peanut butter side into the chocolate. Use whatever ratios work best for you. Let them cool then enjoy! One of my grandma's tricks that I've picked up on is that she puts the salty side of the crackers down (peanut butter and chocolate go on the non-salted side). This puts the salt directly in contact with your tongue when you eat one and makes the whole thing better. The buttery &amp; salty flavors from the crackers and their crunchiness make these just about perfectly balanced.

Not sure if these have been posted before here or not. I would guess so now that I think about it but if not, enjoy!

I need a handful of ideas for really simple, cheap meals for just 2 people.

1 tsp.(i never measure i'm not sure that it matters) of baking powder and
pinch of salt

and that's it, makes about one large waffle. adding vanilla or sugar is optional but i don't think it makes much of a difference. i'll put a little oat bran in for fiber goodness.  this mix can be stored in the refrigerator for a decently quick breakfast, and if i made a lot of waffles i could freeze them and heat them up in the microwave for the week. i'll eat them plain (make an extra one and bring it to work) but for a treat i'll use strawberries, or thaw some frozen fruits... lately my frugal favorite is to add a little cinnamon to my batch and cover it in unsweetened applesauce ( why does applesauce need sugar or high fructose when it already tastes awesome?)

Now you do.,56,10,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1eaib2/ask_and_you_shall_receive_here_is_my_recipe_for/,"This is my great grandmother's recipe that my father and I have modified over the years (for modifications, see the extra budget ingredients). Hands-down, these are the best beans I have ever tasted. I hope you feel the same way. I'll list the original ingredients first since they fit with the theme of this subreddit, and then the more pricey additions/substitutions afterward which give the beans the best flavor possible.

---

Ingredients:

1-2 500g bags of baby lima beans

Cubed onions, optional (I personally leave them out because I hate onions)

Brown sugar

Multiple cloves of garlic (Oh yeah, hope you don't plan on kissing your honey after eating these. Just use more or less depending on how much you love garlic. For me, that's a half a bulb or more if I'm using over 1kg of beans.)

Ketchup

Oil (canola, olive, let your imagination run wild)

Salt

Water

---

Extra budget ingredients:

Cut up bacon (a half a pack to a full pack, depends on how much you like bacon)

Clamato juice (substitute the water in the slow cooker/dutch oven with clamato)

---

Time to get at it:

First you need to toss those lima beans in a BIG bowl and cover them with water. Toss them in the fridge overnight so they can soak up some water. Then, drain 'em and discard the cold bean water.

Now for a little prep work. Chop your onions and garlic (combine them or keep them separate, it doesn't matter) and your bacon if you so choose to have it.

Layer time! In your crock pot (or dutch oven or casserole dish, you can use those too which I'll go into further down), get some layer action going on (bottom of the list goes first, then go up the list for what goes on what):

Water or Clamato

A *little* oil

Sprinkle of salt

Squirt of ketchup

Sprinkle of brown sugar

Bacon

Onions

Garlic

Beans

The more layers you can make with the ingredients you have, the more mixed up it's gonna be and the better the flavor is gonna be. Once you're done you should have a mixture of flavors that'd bring a tear to the eye of the manliest of men. Oh, and the liquid should be even with the beans, maybe even a little extra if you plan on overnighting these babies in your slow cooker.

Get your slow cook on, low and slow. Should be safe overnight, but keep an eye on it. Add some liquid if it gets low. It's done when the beans are tender. Feel free to stir as you see fit after a few hours of cooking.

Or, if you don't have the time for that, put the dutch oven or casserole dish in the oven on a low temperature (350F is good) and keep an eye on it. Same rule applies - add liquid if it gets low, the beans are done when they're tender. I don't usually do it this way, but I'd estimate at least a few hours before you can get your baked beans on.

These beans are my favorite Thanksgiving or potluck contribution, and they don't last very long since everyone loves 'em. Oh, and be prepared to be running to the bathroom after a half hour or so. They're like drano for your bowels.

Enjoy!

I really like this recipe because it's so simple at its heart but you can really easily expand on it and add things to make it your own. Plus it's easy, cheap, takes about 7-8 minutes to get in the oven and is perfect for guests.  
  
###Recipe:  

**Ingredients:**    
(to make 12 rolls)  


* Store bought pre-rolled puff pastry - Usually £1.50, bought reduced at 50p  

* Approx 6 sausages worth of sausage meat (you can buy sausage meat on its own or just take the meat out of sausages yourself) - £2 from the butcher  
* A few tablespoons of milk or a beaten egg - already in the kitchen  
* Optional extras  
  
  
**Method**  

* Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C  (400F, gas mark 6)
* Flatten out your pre-rolled puff pastry  
* [Cut it in half length ways](http://i.imgur.com/Ex6A6)  
* [Cut it width ways so that you have 12 rectangles of pastry](http://i.imgur.com/btKr5)  
* Roll a ball of sausage meat just small enough for the rectangle of pastry to wrap around it and overlap on itself a little  
* Place the sausage meat in the centre of the rectangle of pastry (this is the point at which you can start adding extras, for some of my sausage rolls I had half meat, half stuffing. For others I had some pickle in with the meat. I did a couple with hot mustard: they were delicious)  
* Lightly brush the rest of the pastry with milk or beaten egg  
* Roll the pastry around the meat  
*  Pinch the sides of the pastry together  
* Lightly score the top of the roll with a knife (for decoration)  
* Brush the top of the roll with milk or beaten egg  
*  Bake! They should take approximately 30-35 minutes and go a lovely golden colour

You will need:

* Cream cheese
* STAG chili
* Shredded cheese
* Any tortilla chips
* An oven

***

1. Grab a deep, square baking pan (I use those small aluminum ones, I think they're 8x8 and about 2 inches high for individual eating.) Preheat your oven to 350 while you're at it, too.

2. Line the bottom of the pan evenly with about 1/4 inch, maybe a bit more of cream cheese.

3. Pour in that STAG chili. Make *just* noticeably thicker than the cream cheese layer.

4. Cover evenly in shredded cheese, a pretty thin layer.

5. Put in oven about 10 minutes. Make sure that cheese is all melted up.

And that's my recipe! My girlfriend's family and I (7 total) chowed down on this last night out of a great big roasting pan. Add a bit of hot sauce too for a little heat (My favorite is WhoopAss Hot Sauce.)

The easiest, most delicious and addictive soup you might ever make. So easy to make. No soaking, no broth. Just dice some vegetables and put all the ingredients in a slow cooker and cover with water.

* Ham bone with bits of meat
* Diced vegetables (3 carrots, 2-3 stalks of celery with chopped celery leaves if you have them, 2 onions)
* 2 teaspoons ground savory. (Very important, do not skip)
* Pepper
* DO NOT SALT (The ham is salty and you could easily over-salt, adjust after cooking)
* Water to cover everything (a 5 quart cooker will be completely full)

Cook for 3-4 hours on very very low burner or in slow cooker, not much longer since the peas get very delicate and crumbly. You can use salt pork or bacon. Make sure you put little bits of meat back in the soup. Seriously this soup is like crack.

Now usually the ranch and cheese lasts over a week but I'm wanting something more. I live with two people who don't cook very much and one doesn't even eat vegetables.

1366158663.0,37,self.budgetfood,1chzob,"Salsa, salsa, salsa, some more fucking salsa, there's lots of salsa here",45,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1chzob/salsa_salsa_salsa_some_more_fucking_salsa_theres/,"I hardly ever buy jarred salsa in the store. The level of laziness I have to reach in order to just buy a fucking jar at the store is probably criminal, I haven't checked, but it's definitely not something I would want to call attention to when I'm around the authorities. 

Making your own takes a little more time than [making your own chips](http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1cftrp/homemade_tortilla_chips_anyone_super_easy_super/), but it's less expensive, it yields a lot more salsa, it's healthier (less sodium &amp; preservatives, plus fresh ingredients), and, of course, it's far more delicious, which is what we're all striving for anyway: more deliciousness. If a Republican ran on a platform of MORE DELICIOUSNESS FOR ALL AMERICANS, I would be seriously conflicted before deciding to still not vote for him.

There are a lot of salsa recipes below, because I wanted it all together in one post for easy accessibility (like your mom). You'll find a ""standard"" salsa recipe, which I learned from my mom, and then another red salsa that comes out hot (temperature wise). Also, a creamy cilantro sauce, which is by no means ""healthier"" than anything, but it's really good and cheap to make, and makes for a good dip for a party or when you're crying alone in a dark room because Emma Watson finally blocked your creepy ass on twitter. You'll also find a pico de gallo, which is not only super budget, but delicious, easy, and actually really healthy. Lastly, you will find my husband's kick ass tomatillo salsa, which he claims is more expensive to make than red salsa, but I'm including it because it's awesome and you might get a $5 windfall sometime soon, who knows? Those scratch-off's aren't going to win themselves. 

A warning: I do a lot of ""eyeballing"" in my cooking, so I apologize that my measurements are not exact. I underestimated the amounts because I figure you can add more crap to taste as you're making it. Go to r/depression if you can't get over this, they'll be able to help you. 

So! Let's get started!

**Classic Red Salsa**

*This is a classic salsa similar to what you might buy at the store or find in restaurants. Goes great with chips, and can substitute for fake blood in a pinch.*

Ingredients:

* 3 or 4 whole tomatoes. *Whatever kind you want. Roma are typically cheapest, and work perfectly.* 

* 1 whole jalapeno, seeded and trimmed. *Cut the stem off about 1 inch down, halve lengthwise, and gut the seeds. BE CAREFUL! Don't be a dumbass and wipe your eyes or pick your nose after doing this without washing your hands several times. Vinegar also helps to neutralize jalapeno on hands.* 

* As much fuckin' garlic as you want. *I usually use 5 or 6 cloves, sometimes more depending on how big they are. But if you don't like garlic, I recommend seeing a therapist, because that doesn't sound right.*

* 1 bunch of cilantro. *I like to trim the stems off, my mom didn't. That's up to you, but I find that there's plenty of flavor with just the leaves.*

* Juice of 1 large lime. *If you need me to go into greater detail, then I feel for all the poor souls who were tasked with the daunting task of educating you. There is juice in the lime. Make it so that the juice is no longer in the lime.*

* 1 medium size onion, more if desired. *I am a Texan, and we hold strong beliefs, beliefs like there can never be too much onion in things. I'm pretty sure it's in our Constitution, beneath the part where it says we can secede from the rest of you.*

* 1 or 2 small (8 oz) cans of tomato sauce. *I said 1 or 2 because you can choose your desired level of thickness. I don't like my salsa too thick, so I use one. I also use the sodium free kind because it's better for you, and you get salt elsewhere in this recipe. But if you want to be like one of those poor saps in those lipitor commercials, then go nuts.*

* Chili powder. *Start off with a few tbls, and go from there until you reach the desired level of heat. I usually just dump some in there until my asshole chimes in and says ""Uh....Brat1979? Remember me?"" and then I do, and I stop.* 

* Comino, also known as Cumin. *See above. I would be slightly more sparing with the comino, as it can be overpowering.*

* S &amp; P to taste

I use a food processor, but you can use a blender too. If you don't have either one, then I strongly recommend in investing in one. What are you, an animal? 

There is no crazy science to this. Literally just throw everything into your processor or blender until it's as chunky or smooth as you want. Taste along the way, and if you need to add something, then man up and do it. You don't need to ask the salsa's permission, it's not your mother.

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatoes: ~$1

Jalapeno:10¢

Garlic: 50¢ (for a whole bulb)

Cilantro: ~50¢

Lime: 20¢

Onion: ~60¢ (I get a 4 lb bag of onions for 3 or 4 bucks)

Tomato sauce: 33¢ each

Spices-- I want to reiterate how important it is to have a nice stockpile of a variety of spices on hand, but if you don't you can go to Whole Foods (I know, I know) and buy spices in small amounts for literally pennies. 

For less than 5 bucks (rounding up), you'll have about a half gallon of salsa. Keeps for about 5-6 days.

**Heated Red Salsa**

*This is a variation of the classic salsa with some tweaks, and you cook it on the stovetop, so it comes out hot. Fuck it's good.*

* 4 vine-ripe or 6 roma tomatoes, diced *Roma is less expensive, obviously. I would only recommend vine-ripe if you're using this salsa as some sort of payment or bribe*

* 1 small white onion, diced *see above for my deep thoughts on onions, I'm like a vegetable philosopher, I'm a vegetilosopher*

* 3 cloves of garlic, minced, or you can use a press

* 1 whole jalapeno, seeded, minced *Remember to wash your fucking hands after handling this, moron, touch your genitals later*

* 1 tbl olive oil *I know, this is weird, right? TRUST ME*

* 2 tsp of ground comino *for this specific recipe, I use whole comino seeds and ground them in a mortar and pestle because I fancy myself as an Iron Chef on occasion, it's really quite sad, but regular ground comino works fine*

* 1 tsp cayenne pepper *Now we're talking, you could carry this shit around in your pocket to throw in people's faces Dale Gribble style, and it'd be considered assault with a...weapon, I guess. I don't think it'd kill anyone, unless they were standing on a cliff.*

* S &amp; P to taste 

Throw it all in a small saucepan on low heat. Heat for about 20 min on low heat. If you want it smooth like Barry White, blend that shit up, it will come out like buttah. If not, that's cool, but make sure everything is nice and minced and/or diced. I use a hand blender directly in the pot, works like a hooker in Vegas.

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatoes: Vine Ripened: ~$2.50, maybe $3   Roma: ~$1.25

Onion: ~60¢

Garlic: 50¢ for a bulb

Jalapeno: 10¢

Olive Oil: A low end bottle costs ~$6. Olive oil is pretty much a pantry staple, so if you have it already, this is pretty much free

Either way you do this, this salsa comes out to &lt;$6. Also, it makes a ton. And it keeps for FOREVER. The tupperware thing of it in my fridge is from about a week and a half ago, and it's still awesome.

**Creamy Cilantro Sauce**

*This is exactly what it sounds like--creamy cilantro-y goodness, with a twinge of spice, and an option to add some ranch seasoning to it. This is also the most versatile recipe here as it can be a dip, sauce for tacos in lieu of sour cream, or even as a salad dressing if you thin it out.*

**Ingredients**

* 1 large bunch or 2 small bunches of cilantro *see above for cilantro details*

* 1 Jalapeno *seeded and trimmed. I've reminded you twice to wash your hands, if you need a third reminder, I say let Darwin sort you out*

* 1 block of cream cheese. *You can substitute with Neufchatel if your weight watchers meeting is coming up so you're trying to be ""responsible"". I've been there, buddy.*

* 1 heaping tbl of sour cream *Once again, you can substitute for the low-fat option here*

* Juice of 1 large lime

* 1/2 packet of ranch mix (optional) *Adding this lends it own brand of deliciousness, and we all know how I feel about that, but it also adds a TON of sodium. Whatever, you don't care, you probably laugh at that lipitor guy, you bastard*

* Cayenne--1 tbl

* Chili powder--1 tbl

* S &amp; P to taste

Like the 1st red sauce, blend all this shit together in a blender or food processor until well blended--NO CHUNKS! Pour in your container of choice, cover, and let sit in the fridge for a few hours to set and let the ingredients flirt with, and eventually fuck, each other.

**Price Breakdown**

Cilantro: 50¢ each

Jalapeno: 10¢

Cream Cheese: $1.09 (store brand, regular price)

Sour Cream: $1.39 for 16 oz tub (store brand, regular price)

Lime: 20¢

Ranch-Sodium bomb: ~50¢ (store brand)

Comes out to &gt;$4, makes a medium sized tupperware container's worth, lasts about 5 days (that's what she said).

**Pico de Gallo**

*You've seen pico before. You've seen it at every Tex Mex place you've ever been to. You've poked at it on your plate with your fork, trying to decide if your next bite of quesadilla would benefit from a tiny helping of pico. Answer: it will.*

*Serves 3-4 for a healthy garnish, or hog it all to yourself because you're an asshole who doesn't think other people deserve happiness*

* 2 roma tomatoes, rough chopped  *""rough chopped"" just means that you can leave them in pretty sizable chunks and don't have to worry much about uniform cuts*

* 1 white onion, rough chopped

* 1 serrano pepper, de-seeded and trimmed. *Serrano is like a jalapeno, but would have sex with your sister and then never call her again, but she forgives him because serrano is tasty and doesn't look as spicy as it actually is. Serrano is longer, thinner, and a darker shade of green than jalapeno.*

* 1 whole avocado, diced *use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, it will save you some frustration and avocado throwing because fuck that asshole avocado that won't come out of the skin*

* 1/2 bunch of cilantro  *just use the leaves here, and dice them as small as you can. NO STEMS!*

* Juice of 1 large lime

* S &amp; P to taste

The above is the most standard recipe for pico. Super simple. You just throw everything into a bowl mix it up with a spoon, cover, put in fridge for a few hours for the flavors to meld. 

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatoes: ~60¢

Onion: ~60¢

Serrano: ~15¢

Cilantro: ~50¢

Lime: 25¢

Avocado: ~70¢

This motherfucking salsa's &gt;$3, makes a large cereal bowl's worth, and will keep for about 3 days.

**Tomatillo Salsa**

*This salsa was in our wedding vows. My husband is legally obligated to make this for me. I'm tough but fair.*

**Ingredients**

* 8 tomatillos  *tomatillos typically come encased in a paper-like shell, much like garlic, or an onion. DO NOT USE THESE, genius. Just dice the  fucking peppers.*

* 1 white onion, diced

* 1 jalapeno, seeded, trimmed, and diced

* 3 cloves of garlic, diced

* 1/4 bunch of cilantro *no stems, pick the leaves off and dice*

* 1 small (4 oz) can of diced green chiles 

* 1 cup of sour cream

* S &amp; P to taste

Throw everything except the sour cream together in a medium saucepan on the stovetop, and simmer on low for about 20 minutes. Then fold in the sour cream. Remove from heat. You can chill it first, or serve it warm, both ways are delicious.  

**Price Breakdown**

Tomatillos: No exact number, unfortunately, but it's ~$1.50 for 8 peppers

Jalapeno: 10¢

Garlic: 50¢ for a bulb

Onion: 60¢

Cilantro: 50¢

Diced green chiles: ~65¢

Sour Cream: $1.39

Total is &gt;$6, makes a HUGE amount, keeps for over 2 weeks. This stuff is also really versatile as it's a good dip, as well as sauce for enchiladas and tacos. It can also be a good marinade for meat, which is also something I'm pretty sure she said. Have you noticed she says a lot of dirty things? 



Holy crap that was a lot of typing. I'm never making promises on the internet ever again, you fuckers.

Spicy, meaty, garlicky, salty goodness.

Large recipe, makes about a gallon:  
1lb hot italian sausage, bulk or links  $3.29 on sale  
1 med-large spanish yellow onion  $0.50  
1 jar green olives (spanish are better than manzanilla, stronger flavor.  I use all green olives, you can substitute a mix of strong black and green olives if you wish.)  $1.50 on sale  
1-2T garlic  
Oregano  (I use 2T)  
Bay Leaves  (I use 2 fresh, or 3 fragrant dried ones.  More for older)  
Black Pepper  (20 turns of my pepper mill)  
32oz diced tomato  $1  (I recommend Redpack, but don't get store-brand imo - fewer tomatoes per can, and the flavor difference is substantial.  
32oz crushed tomato  $1

Break the sausage apart into chunks in a hot pan as you fry it.  Get the outside good and almost burnt.  Throw away any rendered fat, and set the sausage aside.

Chop and saute the onion, set aside.

In the bottom of a sufficiently large pot, heat some olive oil and give your garlic a quick saute.  Combine everything except the olives, and let this simmer for an hour.  Drain and add the olives (add some brine if you like the salt), and let this simmer for about another hour.  Add anchovies and nix the sausage to make it more traditional.

And you're done.

Notes:  This isn't a thick sauce, so I use it with something like a shell which gives you a bunch of the juice.  I prefer making it with the big diced tomatoes to enhance the chunkiness.  All items for making it keep or freeze well, so if you decide you like it, there's never a need to pay full price for the component parts.

Been lurking here for a little while because being frugal is in my bones. I love to cook and especially on the cheap. I thought you may find a pasta sauce recipe of mine useful. I don't know if you will like it, but I like it a lot. (I saw this recipe in a local newspaper over 12 years ago.)

**Pasta dish with no name**

* Spaghetti

* 1 can (400 ml) of crushed tomatoes
*  2 yellow onions, sliced (normal sized)
* 1 dl (~1/2 cup) Black olives, each olive cut in half (pits removed)
* 2 dl (~1 cup) Crème fraîche
* 2 (big) cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* Tomato ~~puré~~ paste if you can be bothered 

Oil, salt, peppar 

1. Cook the pasta  
1. Cut the onions in half, and slice each half as thin as possible.
1. Heat a pan with the oil and fry the onion on medium heat.
1. The onion should become soft and a little brown. This takes a little while, like 10 min maybe? 
* If you have tomato ~~puré~~ paste put it in here and mix with the onions and fry it a bit. (Don't put tomato puré directly in tomato sauce since it can become bitter.) 
1. Salt and peppar to your liking, then put the crushed tomatoes with the onions and let it simmer. Just until some water has evaporated and is not that runny. 
1. Throw in the olives and mix. (pasta sauce finished)

* Mix créme fraîche and chopped garlic and blend well.

Put sauce on top of pasta and top it off with the garlic crème fraîche (I like a lot of it.)

It's also quite delicious and you can make it vegetarian (so long as your ok with an egg) or not.  It's also pretty good if you have company.

Here's my recipe down to the bare bones:

Ingredients:

Rice

Shredded onions and carrots

Spinach 

Zucchini 

Egg

Washed shredded lettuce (optional)

Korean pepper paste

Vegetable or Sesame oil (recommend sesame oil but vegetable oil works great too)

Cook the rice.

Now you might have some trouble with the Korean pepper paste, prices of can be generally around $10 - $15, but you don't have to worry so much about it because you actually get quite alot for that price.  I typically water mine down with either some water or sprite soda.  You don't want it watery though, but as long as it's a bit thick it's fine (its really thick by itself, which is why I water mine down).  I use sprite soda because it gives it a slightly tangy kick, my mom used to use Sunny D sometimes.  It'll also last you quite a while as long as you store it in your fridge (I don't think it ever really goes bad when stored properly, I've had the same pepper paste for a year or two now)

You'll be typically using just a small spoonful per bowl anyway.  You can buy it online or go to your local oriental market to find it.

Lightly stir fry or sauté the onions and carrots (can be done together, but I'd recommend separate just so they don't mix in the flavoring) with some vegetable or sesame oil.  Set this aside on a platter.

Blanch spinach in boiling water for about 15-30 seconds (to kill the bacteria and etc).  Immediately after, rinse the spinach in cold water.  It should still be quite green as if still fresh. Gently squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water, you don't want it soggy but you don't want it too dry.  If you want, you can ball it up and cut it in half (makes it easier to mix in the salt). Add just a pinch of salt to flavor it and mix the salt in with the spinach (this also makes it a great side dish for anything you eat with rice).  You can also add sesame seeds but for simplicities sake, just add some salt.  Put the spinach on the platter when it's done

Now onto the zucchini.  You can either steam, stir fry/saute, or boil the zucchini.  I prefer to saute them.  Cut the zucchini into thin slices or strips.  Next put it on a pan on medium to high heat with some vegetable/sesame oil and lightly sprinkle salt on them.  When they're done, they should be a little translucent.  Put this on the platter when it's done

Fry an egg however you want, I'd recommend keeping some of the yolk gooey.  If one's not enough, just cook two eggs.


Now to prepare it to eat.  Get yourself a bowl of rice, put as much cooked onions, carrots, spinach, zucchini, and the optional shredded lettuce on top and around the rice,.  Lastly put the egg on top of it all and put in as much Korean pepper paste as you want.  I recommend with half a spoonful just to get an idea.  If spicy food isn't your thing, you can just barely put any of it in just for the flavoring.  Then get yourself a spoon, mix it all up and enjoy.  You can also add in some sesame oil here if you'd like, not too much though.

If you have left over vegetables, just store it for your next meal.  The vegetables should be fine cold.  Just remember to reheat (except for the spinach).

Now lets say you want to put other things on it?  You can saute mushrooms (Shiitake is highly recommended and the norm), beef, or boil soy bean sprouts (with a pinch of salt) to add to your bowl.  There's actually quite alot of stuff you can add to it, but of course that would also make it a bit more expensive to make.

Here's a link to Maangchi's website, which has a more thorough instructions on how to make it.  You can skip on alot of the ingredients such as the meat, soy bean sprouts, fern brakes and meat.  It'll still taste very good. As long as you have some cooked vegetable and and egg, you should be fine.

Basil

I can get chicken for fairly cheap too, probably other meat (just haven't been pricing that).

My off the top of my head calculation is about $6 per two quesadillas, different cheese can be used, and some items may already be in the house such as butter and olive oil*

Fish Quesadillas

Frozen Tilapia (two pieces) ( $1.75 each.. $8 for 14 fillets)



Two Fajita sized tortillas ($0.25 each  $2.50 for pack of 10)



Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning ( pennies, just using a sprinkle, $2 for 2.5oz bottle)



Mozerella cheese ($1.75 because I used about a cup between two quesadillas, $3.50 for two cups for the kind I got)



Lime Juice (pennies, i just use a splash or two, 4oz bottle costs $1.40)



Olive Oil (unsure of cost, about 2 TBSP should do it)


approz 1 tbsp butter (very low price, its like $1.50 for a ton of butter)


The above list is an approximation, Thaw the tilapia (I put them in luke warm water for about 5 minutes), remove from the packaing. in a shallow pan, put enough oil to give you a little layer on the bottom.  Pat Tilapia dry with a paper towel, cover one side with the dry seasoning. Put seasoned side down in heated oil. Cover newly exposed side with seasoning to your taste. Flip after about three minutes, then cook three or so more minutes on the other side. It is done when white in the middle. 


Place in a bowl and break apart with a fork, add a couple splashes of lime juice, once again to taste. place some cheese on one half of the tortilla, place approx half the fish on top of cheese. Add a little more cheese on top of the fish ( I do this to ensure good stickiness after cooking.)  Fold tortilla in half. place half the butter in a shallow frying pan, let melt, and place folded tortilla in pan. Place a lid over pan to help melt cheese, flip tortilla after approx two minutes (basic grilled cheese techinque here, when starting to golden brow, flip that sucka.) cook other side till golden brown, enjoy.

1316008254.0,36,self.budgetfood,kfcnj,I realized there isn't a chili recipe on here. Here's my take on cheap and easy veggie chili. About $5-10/gallon.,41,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/kfcnj/i_realized_there_isnt_a_chili_recipe_on_here/,"I use dry bulk beans to make it more affordable, but it takes a bit more prep-time to soak. For this recipe, all you'll need is one pot, a stirring spoon, a colander for the beans, a big bowl for the beans, a knife and cutting surface for the veggies, and a plate for the chopped veggies.

With dry beans, it takes about 2 hours, plus 6 hours of soaking prep. With canned beans it takes about 1 hour.

This recipe makes about a gallon of chili, which is nice as it fits just right into a normal sized pot; I make it on the weekend and have it for lunch in the week. You can easily cut the recipe in half or any other fraction if you wish. 


Ingredients:

* 
1 28oz can of diced tomatoes, or about 1qt of fresh diced tomatoes
* 
4 cups dry beans. (This expands to about 10-12 cups. I use 2cup pinto, 1cup black, 1cup kidney, though you can vary this however you like. This is also 6 cans of canned beans if you prefer to save the time; this will raise the price quite a bit.)
* 
2 red onions, chopped
* 
2 carrots, chopped
* 
1 red bell pepper, chopped
* 
2 cobbs of corn (this, as a complement to the beans, provides complete protein.)
* 
1 or 2 habanero peppers (2 will make it pretty spicy, the way I like it)
* 
1 or 2 jalapeno peppers (I usually just use 2 habaneros and skip the jalapeno because the price per capsaicin is better. If I'm making it for friends, I do 1 jalepeno, and 1 habanero, and 1 anaheim for a wider flavor profile.)
* 
6 cloves of garlic, minced
* 
1+ tablespoon salt (if you use salted canned tomatoes or beans, maybe let up on the salt hear)
* 
1+ tablespoon ground black pepper
* 
1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
* 
(I don't like to use generic chili powder, but if you do, you can add a bit here)


Directions:
Bean prep: Soak beans in 3x their volume in water for 6 about hours, then drain. After draining, put beans and new water into pot and simmer the beans for 10min without a lid. After 10min, remove the top layer of foam. Add lid and simmer the beans for about 1 hour. Then drain the beans and leave in the large bowl until later. (If using canned beans, then rinse them, drain them, and leave them in the bowl.)


Now that the beans are in the bowl, clean out and dry the big pot. In the dried out pot, place the oil and saute the chopped onions and carrots on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Go until the onions lose some of their color. Add the chopped peppers and garlic and go for about 5 more minutes or until onions lose most of their color and look clear. Keep stirring the whole time. Add tomatoes, and stir in the salt, black pepper, and cumin. Heat until tomato liquid starts boiling. Then add the soaked and drained beans and stir well. Bring this to simmer, cover, and let sit for about 30minutes, stirring occasionally, making sure it's not sticking at the bottom of pot. After 30minutes, add the corn. (I usually cut it straight from the cob into the pot). Leave over heat for ~5 more min. Ready to eat or put into fridge/freezer for storage!


A lot of the stuff is to my preferences, and it is easy to switch things around or add new veggies. Sometimes I use potatoes, zucchini, or squash. When adding new veggies, put harder ones in earlier with the onions and carrots, softer ones in with peppers. Aside from accidentally under-cooking the beans (skimping time while soaking, or due to altitude), it is really hard to mess this recipe up, so go ahead and experiment. 


This is a pretty solid chili, in that it will splatter rather than splash if you drop it on the ground. I prefer it this way, but you can water it down my using more tomatoes or putting water in when you add the tomatoes.",,False,self,t5_2si9h,True,,,True,t3_kfcnj,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/kfcnj/i_realized_there_isnt_a_chili_recipe_on_here/,

What are your best tips and tricks on keeping under/at budget?

Mine:

1) Bulk is good in the long run, but it can break your bank if you try and do everything at once. I carve out $20 dollars from my monthly budget and buy one or two things in bulk and  then get the rest of my stuff. Every month I get a different thing. It took me a bit and several copy meals, but I can now make almost anything for pennies on the dollar if I were to just have to grab everything from the store right now. 

2) Buying large amounts of vegetables just because they are on sale is usually a bad idea. You can't eat it fast enough and throwing rotten produce away makes me want to cry. Instead if you get a good deal, cut up everything raw, place on a baking sheet in a single layer, and stick in the freezer. Dont open your freezer for 5 hours.

So I'm in a bit of a situation. I'm furloughed until the end of September and we just learned that the factory where my partner works is shutting down in the next 1-3 weeks. Bad timing! Yikes!

We were already living paycheck to paycheck, but we were able to spend more on food and eat keto most of the time. But I'm NOT worried about keto now, haha, just how to keep us full until the furlough is over. 

What we doooo have is a frozen, boneless, 7.6 lb ham. It's fully cooked already, and some of that weight is surely water. 

I can't figure out how to defrost it safely. 

What can 2 people do with this bad boy to stretch it across a week? There's dinner one night, ham sandwiches, chopped ham in salads, ham and eggs, Hoppin John I guess, but I figured you guys were geniuses and could steer me towards success. What would you do to make it last? 

How would you cook it in the first place so that it could match with all sorts of different things, flavor wise. I mean, brown sugar won't work if we're gonna make it with eggs later,  that kind of thing.

* Two cans Coconut Milk
* Lots of Pinto Beans
* Various Pastas

So, what are some interesting things I can add that go a long way? Any fresh veggies I can make last a while? Is getting cheese out of the question (I adore cheese)? I can't have much lactose, is it financially feasible to get almond milk? Are there other alternatives?

 Gluten free stuff could be a bonus, since one roomie is gluten-intolerant and I'd like to cook for them often since I can't pay much.

To give you a general idea of what that means, here's an excerpt from a wiki page on the subject: 

&gt;The food consists primarily of fruits and vegetables with an emphasis on poultry and seafood, grains, beans and pastas. Olive oil the most prevalent fat or oil used in the preparation of salads, marinades, vegetables, poultry, and seafood. Eggplant, artichokes, squash, tomatoes, legumes, onions, mushrooms, okra, cucumbers, and a variety of greens are served fresh, baked, roasted, sautéed, grilled, and puréed. Yogurt and cheese are also major components of Mediterranean cooking. Coastal areas use seafood. Herbs are used in abundance.

So, my SO and I are moving in together in December. We'll be living in Ohio, and we both need to save as much money as we can because I'll be in school for the majority of the time we're living together. 

We've lived together in Sydney Australia (that's where she is from) for  nearly a year, but the cost of living is very different there compared to Ohio.

My question is: how much should we budget ourselves a week for food? What should we spend our money on? Should we plan meals for the entire week, or the entire month? Although we're not vegetarian we have no problems not eating meat for the majority of the week.

We'll also have a slow cooker and a bread machine with us. Is there any other appliance we should buy for the sake of frugality?

MUSHROOM MEAT LOAF

* 6-ounce can sliced mushrooms, drained and chopped
* 15-ounce can Original Sloppy Joe Sauce
* 1 lb extra-lean Ground Beef
* 1 cup Quaker Quick Oats
* 1 Egg
* 1 tsp Italian Seasoning

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Dump 1/2 can of the sloppy joe sauce and all the other ingredients into a bowl and mix gently. Squish into a football shape on the foil-lined pan from your toaster oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Pour the remaining 1/2 can of sauce over the loaf. Bake for 30 minutes more, until the meat is no longer pink. (The secret to moist, juicy meatloaf is to handle the meat very gently).

Makes 6 servings. 281 calories per serving

**Now forget the canned mushrooms, Sloppy Joe sauce and that extra-lean bit**

Fatty meat is cheaper and tastes better, so forget about that extra lean garbage.

Replace the mushrooms with what sounds good to you, whatever happens to be on sale or you have laying around. I've used everything from crushed bacon and shredded cheese to diced jalapenos and granny smith apples. (for reference 6oz is about 1/4-1/3 cup of non-canned goods)

Instead of buying Sloppy Joe sauce, create your own sauce with what you have in the fridge and cupboard. You really only need 1-1½ cups of sauce, half in the loaf and half on top, start out with half of it being ketchup (or use all ketchup if you want). Got some barbecue sauce? Mix some in with the ketchup. Got some Worcestershire sauce? Mix it in there too. Got some Honey? Dump it in there.

You really don't even need the quick oats. Got some stale bread around? Crumble it up and use it instead. Not dry enough to crumble, throw some slices in the oven at 300 degrees for 10-15 minutes and they should be dry enough.

I've used the base of the original recipe to make everything from cheeseburger meatloaf to barbecue meatloaf. 

Below is a concoction that I threw together with what we had around the kitchen that turned out really well.


**Barbecue Meatloaf**

Main Ingredients:

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 cup Quaker quick oats
* 1 egg
* 5 strips bacon
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Sauce: (sauce ingredients are approx)

* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
* 2 tbsp Honey
* 3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 cloves garlic (pressed/crushed)
* Cayenne pepper (to taste)

Cook the bacon until crispy. While bacon is cooking mix all sauce ingredients. Crush the bacon into bits, gently mix in a large bowl with all the other main ingredients plus half the sauce. Take the mixed meatloaf ingredients and shape it on a baking pan so it makes a roughly 1-1/2 to 2 inch high rectangle. Bake for 30 min @ 350F. After 30 min, spread the remaining sauce over the top and bake for an additional 30 min.

Traditionally meatloaf has been made with whatever is laying around the house so experiment and have fun!",,False,self,t5_2si9h,False,,,True,t3_15hx0d,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/15hx0d/meatloaf_simplified/,

Bulghur can be bought in bulk, parsley is fairly cheap (and could be omitted or substituted for cilantro or whatever grows in your garden)... And a can o' tomatoes is pretty reasonable. I dunno. I love it and am eating it right now.

* Chop up the onion, mince the garlic, and season the pork chop. Salt/pepper/paprika is good.
* Heat up about 3 tbsp of oil in the pan on medium heat. Then fry the pork chop/onions/garlic. Once the pork chop is seared, take it out of the pan and chop it into bite-size pieces, then set aside.
* Cook the onions and garlic til the onions are clear, and remove them from the pan and set aside.
* Put about 3 more tbsp of oil in the pan along with the flour. Mix it until the flour integrates with the fat. It doesn't have to be a liquid viscosity, just form it into a paste and it will do it's purpose, which is to thicken everything up later. Add oil if you need to. It may seem like a lot of oil at this point, but in the end it's not.
* Add stuff in no particular order: ~7 cups water, re-incorporate your pork/onions/garlic, tomatoes, beans, rice, chiles, corn.
* Stir everything together
* Add spices: A LOT of black pepper, about enough to cover the top of the liquid in the pan. About 3 large pinches salt. A lot of paprika, similar in amount to the pepper. Cayenne pepper to taste depending on how spicy you want it. The green chiles I use don't seem to add any heat, so I'm pretty liberal with the cayenne. It gets diluted quite a bit with all the liquid.
* Stir
* Cover the pan and cook until the rice is almost done, but not quite done. I use extra long grain brown rice, and cook for one hour. Instant rice probably takes about 20 min.
* Uncover and add herbs, and stir. I use cilantro/thyme but if you only use one, go with cilantro. Let it reduce for about 30 minutes uncovered. Stir every 10 minutes because the rice starts to stick to the pan.
* Serve

Some interesting ways to serve it that I use:

* Smother a tortilla with the rice/beans, top it with a little cheese, sour cream, and greens.
* Replace the tortilla with tortilla chips and add more greens, makes quite a good taco salad.

Enjoy!

Delicious and really easy to make,33,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/msyc1/my_favorite_casserole_delicious_and_really_easy/,"This is a recipe I grew up with and loved it every time my parents made it. We always called it Spanish Noodles (I never really figured out where the name came from), and apparently my grandmother got the recipe off a Campbell's soup can in the '60s or '70s.

**Ingredients:**

1 lb ground beef

salt and pepper

medium onion chopped

About 3/4 lb or 1 lb of egg noodles (I just get one bag)

2 cans of tomato soup 

about 1 soup can full of water (about 1/2 can of water for every can of soup)

Bread crumbs (optional, but I recommend them)

**Directions:**

1. Brown the meat in a frying pan with the salt, pepper, and onion to taste. Drain grease.

2. Cook egg noodles (don't cook completely. should be a little firm)

3. Mix the noodles, meat, soup, and water together. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top.

4. Bake at 325°F for 1 hour

**Note:** This is also really easy to customize. Sometimes I like to throw in some mozzarella cheese and/or chopped spinach as well.

[EDIT]: I never even thought to google it. Googling ""spanish noodles"" gives all sorts of variants of this recipe like [this one](http://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Spanish-Noodles--N--Ground-Beef) made with bacon instead of beef, as well as fresh tomatoes, chili powder, and peppers.

Ingredients:

- 1 ripe Banana (The correct ripeness would be when they start to have little black spots all over.  If it has any green then don't use it.  It won't taste good.  If it is too black then just use it for banana bread, it would be a waste on the licuado).

- 2 Tbsp of peanut butter (I prefer the one that only has two ingredients [peanuts + salt])

- 1.5c of milk or milk substitute (when I was younger I used 2% milk, now I use vanilla almond milk)

- Ice (read directions for amount)

- Few pinches of cinnamon

Directions:

- Put all ingredients except ice into blender

- Put ice in blender.  The amount depends on how you like it and how strong your blender is.  If you have a strong blender and like a good thick smoothie then you can put a decent chunk of ice in there.  Maybe 1/2 to 3/4ths of an ice tray.  If you have a weak blender or like more of a drinking consistency (like me) then you can use just a handful of ice.

- Blend on a medium to high setting.



Price:

- 35 cents for Banana
- 20 cents for Peanut Butter
- 75 cents for Vanilla Almond Milk @ 4 dollars for 8 cups

1.30 total

Variations:

This can be varied greatly depending on the occasion or time of year.  In the summer you might put some strawberries in.  This time of the year you may find mangos on sale.  Check out the frozen section in the winter to see if there is any fruit there that's on sale.  If you want more of a treat you can experiment with adding chocolate syrup and serving with candied nuts on top.

Anyway, hope someone finds this helpful.

What you need!
* Rotisserie Chicken (5 bucks at Wal-Mart, best 5 bucks you'll ever spend)
* Flour
* Butter
* Chicken Bouillon 
* Rice
* Whatever vegetable you want. I used canned green beans.

Rotisserie chickens are awesome. They're cheap, easy, and delicious, and they provide a lot of bang for your buck. You should have flour, butter, and rice sitting around. If you don't, go buy some. They're cheap. Canned vegetables: also cheap. I got 8 cubes of chicken bouillon for 50 cents. 

First, boil 4 cups of water. Add 2 cubes of bouillon to boiling water. Cook the rice (2 cups chicken water 1 cup rice). To make the gravy melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan. After it's melted add 2 tablespoons of flour and whisk away. We're making a roux. It should end up looking kinda like dough. After it looks like that slowly stir in the remaining 2 cups of chicken water. Let it sit on low heat (stirring occasionally) to thicken. I honestly don't care what you do with your vegetables, I just hit my green beans with a bit of salt and pepper to taste. Rip into that rotisserie chicken and make yourself an amazing plate with TONS of leftovers to spare. Assuming you have the butter, flour, and rice laying around you might have spent $1.20 on a couple cans of vegetables, $5.00 on a rotisserie chicken, and $0.50 on the bouillon. You'll probably get around 4 servings from this. Enjoy.

(X-post from r/recipes),32,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/xnsyp/chicken_curry_recipe_hoping_for_feedback_xpost/,"I made this after fiddling around with different recipes for chicken tikka masala and other curries and this what I do on a weekly basis. Wondering if this is pretty similar to anything anyone else does, and open to suggestions for new things/twists!

**My Chicken Curry Recipe**

* 1 tablespoon of olive oil (you really only need enough to coat the onions slightly) ~$3
* 
2 Red Onions chopped/minced ~$3.50/lb  which ends up being 4/5 onions
* 
1 spoonful of Ginger Paste (or 2 teaspoons of grated fresh) You can find it near the garlic or near the regular ginger. $2.50
* 
2-3 cloves of chopped/minced Garlic (1 good size spoonful if pre-minced) &lt;$3
* 
1-2 good size spoonfuls of Patak's Mild/Hot Curry Paste. I have gotten it at Kroger in the ethnic aisle, Meijer has it and indian stores have it. ~3.50
* 
2 cans of Rotel (store brand is tomatoes with green chiles, you might wanna get one of them mild at least) $1 each for Rotel, .65 cents each for store brand.
* 
1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed. .69 cents
* 
1 can of precooked chicken  $3 or less depending on quality
* 
1/2 cup of basmati rice (or more, you can see how much you like in yours, I got a lb of this at Kroger for 3.49)

Total cost of it all ~$23 
BUT
The oil, ginger, garlic, curry paste, and rice will last for more than four of these, so even though they are on the high side, it comes out pretty cheap for something that I can eat about 3 times before it's gone, and you could stretch it to 4 or more servings depending on the amount of rice you use.

Saute the onions in the oil over medium-low heat (setting 4/10 is good for me) stirring enough so they don't stick or burn. When they become almost fully translucent add the ginger and garlic. Mix them all together and cook for a couple minutes, then add the curry paste. The curry paste should cover all of the veggies and you should be able to kind of see it cook, the oil will come out of it. After it cooks for a few more minutes if you have fresh chicken add it now and cook it until it's done, if it is canned chicken add it now and coat it in the curry paste veggie mixture. Once you do that you can add the Rotel and black beans and 2/3 of a cup of water. Feel free to turn the heat up (no more than 7/10) and let the water cook out of it all. When it is slightly more saucy and runny than you want it when you eat it, cover it and turn the heat down to ~3. While the water was cooking out you should be preparing the rice. The most important part of the rice is rinsing it, make sure you rinse it off until the water is no longer cloudy, just fill up a pot of water and add the rice, stir it and pour the water off. After you rinse it just add the same amount as you would normal rice 1 cup of water to every half cup of rice. Bring it to a boil and as soon as it starts, turn the heat down to simmer and put a lid on it. Let it cook without disturbing it for as long as you can, the more you disturb it the worse it comes out. Once the curry cools slightly just add a few drops of whipping cream or plain yogurt, pour it all over the rice and voila! You have cooked some awesome chicken curry! It's easy peasy! 

If you want a vegetarian/cheaper alternative, just add another can of beans to replace the chicken.",,False,self,t5_2si9h,1344238905.0,,,True,t3_xnsyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/xnsyp/chicken_curry_recipe_hoping_for_feedback_xpost/,

1327543318.0,25,self.budgetfood,owyr3,UK Student curry,32,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/owyr3/uk_student_curry/,"As a student in the UK, it's very easy to pick up cheap ingredients, but often laziness prevents/time constraints mean that cooking becomes a quick affair. Now, it's no secret that a curry (like bolognese and chili) is an easy thing to cook and can last a while. I've been experimenting with these simple things for a few weeks and have ended up with a lot of frozen left overs, ready to break out whenever I feel hungry.

This is my curry recipe with prices as accurate as I remember them.

* 2 Chicken breasts (Sainsbury's Basics are normally about £4.00-£4.50 for 4 smaller-than average, but still decently sized, breasts)
* 1 medium onion (I tend to pick up onions as and when I need them and they never exceed 20p for a loose medium onion from Sainsbury's and Morrisons)
* 1 green pepper (80p from Sainsbury's for one, though I have sometimes picked up the budget multi-packs for about £1.50. I tend to stick with the loose peppers since they are always a decent size)
* 1 whole jar of curry sauce (Morrisons and Sainsbury's both do jars of basics curry sauce for under 30p - I think Morrisons still have the 9p jars, but I could be wrong. This is the very basic canvas unto which all other things shall flow)
* 1/2 tin of baked beans (I stick with basics because it's going in the curry and for 30-40p it's hard to argue with the price. The rest of the tin ends up on toast or on a jacket potato. Some among us may prefer Heinz, but I'm not fussy)
* 1 tin of tomatoes - choped or peeled (Sainsbury's have recently switched their chopped tomato packaging from tins to a carton. The whole peeled tomatoes were cheaper in my store, though my mum back home said that the opposite was true)
* Any desired spices and flavourings (I'm working on the assumption that people have spices in their cupboards already. I always have mild chili powder (Under 50p from Morrisons for a good amount), paprika (about £1) and Madras spices (I picked up some ages ago and it just never runs out), as well as black pepper and garlic powder (again picked up ages ago. Lastly, I love to use mint sauce in stuff now. It was about 70p for a jar at Morrisons and it gets thrown about in curries and vegetable dishes.)
* Guinness HP sauce (I'm not sure if this is still on sale, but I picked it up when it was on sale for £1. I like the stuff, but not too much otherwise it becomes overpowering. I use it more for cooking than I do as a condiment)

Dice and slice the chicken as desired. Heat up a bit of oil in a pot and squirt in some HP sauce as it warms up. I don't use measurements, so sorry if you're looking for extreme guidance. Throw in the chicken and let it cook.

As it's cooking chop up the onion to your liking. I like it chunky with big slices.

Just as the chicken is done, turn the heat down very low, throw in the onion and add some pepper and spices. Not too much, just enough to let the smells tempt your nostrils. Mix it, stir it, do what you want with it. Let the HP sauce coat everything. Chop the pepper as you please (again, I like it thick and chunky), throw that in as soon and mix once more.

Now comes the fun part. Open that jar of curry sauce and pour it in. I find that it's thick and gloopy and may take a while to vacate the jar. What I do is open the tomatoes, pour them into the jar, put the lid back on and shake it up. Then pour that into the pot and stir once more. Open up the beans, pour half the tin into the jar, close it, and shake it again. Then pour that into the pot. Again, stir.

At this point the heat should still be very low. Throw in any spices you want, any other nonsense you want, whatever. The point is to let it sit and 'stew' for about an hour, occasionally stirring.

It takes about 10 minutes to prep everything and do the actual 'cooking' and about that time to eat a bowl with some rice. But the amount of left overs is bloody brilliant, and will last a good 3 or 4 days. I normally put some in a container and freeze it right away, and leave whatever I wish in the pot. Then I simply reheat the pot on the hob again when I want some more.

Nothing mind blowing or extravagant, but I thought I'd share so anyone who doesn't like spending much money or time in the kitchen could be inspired.

It's one of the simplest recipes, and just takes a bit of time.

Ingredients:

* 2 packages of macaroni (450g each)
* 1kg of ground beef
* 1 680ml can of tomato sauce

Instructions:

* Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and set it aside (you can leave it in the colander)
* In the same pot, cook the beef
* Add tomato sauce
* Add cooked pasta
* Mix everything together

This is a bare-bones recipe, and you can tweak it however you like. If you're calorie or fat-conscious, you can use extra lean beef and/or drain the fat out.

You can get pork belly at most places but the cheapest is usually the Asian market. Yesterday I bought 2lbs for $6.21. This will be enough for 6 servings. The veggies shouldn't cost more than $4, assuming you don't have any already. This meal works out to about $1.85 a serving. 


**Ingredients:** 

2lbs pork belly, rinsed in cool water and patted dry

1 Tbs Salt, plus more to taste

4 cups root vegetables (carrots/potatoes/onions are the usual, but try out parsnips, sweet potatos, or turnips depending on whats cheapest)

3 Tbs Olive oil

1 1/2 cups water

1Tbs flour

Pepper to taste

**How To**
Pre-heat your oven to it's highest temp. Take your rinsed pork and score the skin with cross hatch slits, now divide into 6 equal portions. Rub the meat rub with 2 Tbs oil and 1Tbs of salt. Place in a baking pan (one that has edges to catch the drippings) and skin side up place in your super hot over for 12ish minutes or until the skin browns and curls a bit. Pull the meat out, turn your over down to 350, toss the veggies in around the meat, drizzle them with the last tablespoon of oil and put back in the oven. Cook for 40 minutes. Once it's finished cooking, drain the bottom juices into a bowl, it's ok if small bits of veggie get in. Gravy: Skim a bit of the fat off the meat/veggie juice and throw in a saucepan (med/high heat) with the flour, cook until the flour turns golden brown and then slowly add the meat juice and water. Continue stirring until you like the consistency. Add pepper to taste. Enjoy!


You can serve as a family meal or if you want you can place a portion of each in a small tight sealing tupperware, make sure to put the gravy on the meat to keep it from drying out, freeze and then just microwave when wanted. 


*When buying pork belly I have noticed the butchers cut it in two ways, a large slab or 1in x 8in strips (roughly). Try and buy the strips as it cuts down on your prep time and doesn't cost more.*

I'm a bit of a lurker here on this sub-reddit, but thought I'd share a recipe my monster-in-law taught me that is fairly cheap. I use this when I don't really feel like cooking or don't have a lot on hand. Measurements aren't all that important - it's very forgiving. I play it by ear but usually make 2x 2qt casseroles with this recipe
What you need:

- 3/4 of a bag of elbow macaroni (more if you want and your casserole dishes are bigger than 2qt each)
- can of diced tomatoes (don't drain)
- cheese slices (like kraft, but I buy the cheap ones)
- milk, can of evaporated milk or cream - whatever you have on hand (I use 1% milk because I have it on hand, but it's intended to use canned evaporated milk to make creamier). Probably about 4 cups or so.
- one onion, diced or chopped (I prefer large onions)
- salt/pepper and any other seasonings you like
- a bit of butter or margarine, about 2Tbsp or so roughly
- optional - any leftover vegetables you have and want to include that aren't overpowering in taste.

Preheat oven to 350F If your casserole dish is microwavable, put butter/margarine and onion in it and microwave for a few mins until onions translucent. If no microwave, saute them in a pan.

Cook pasta according to directions on package. Drain, return to pot. Throw in the sauteed onions, can of diced tomatoes (liquid and all), salt and pepper to taste and any other veg/seasonings you're adding. Mix together and then pour into your casserole dishes.

Pour milk into casserole dishes until about 1/4 to 1/3 depth of the dish (less if you prefer firmer noodles, more if you prefer softer). Cover each casserole with cheese slices on top.

Cook in 350F oven for between 15-20 mins. It's done when the cheese topping is cooked to your liking and warmed through. Let stand about 5-10 mins on top of stove and serve.

Great as leftovers - these 2 casseroles feed my SO and I well for a few days, lunch and dinner. They reheat well in micro - just sprinkle with a little water on top before putting in micro if you like soft noodles.

**Things you might not have handy:**
   
Wrappers. Usually available at regular grocery stores, next to the tofu, at about $2.50.   

 1 lb Pork. You can use ground (easiest), the really cheap 'stir-fry' extra bits of pork (easier), or a hunk of pork (easy). I usually wait till meat is on sale, but this cost about $4 when not.

**Other shit. Most of which you can leave out or substitute depending on how much you care and/or your budget:**

1tsp ginger (dont have or cant afford? leave it out)

1Tbsp Soy Sauce (or one takeaway packet)

1/4 chopped onion (I use green cause I usually stock them, but any onion you have laying around will do just fine) 

1 cup of either water chestnuts, cabbage (color doesn't matter), or carrots... Really any veggie you have handy that is crunchy will do in a pinch.

**How to:**

Throw that delicious pig meat and the soy sauce in a pan. Cook it until you aren't going to die. Done? Excellent. Now take your veggies and meat and chop that shit until your arms are going to fall off. If you are lucky and have a food processor or blender chuck it in there and hold the button until you start to wonder if the bits can get any smaller. Hot damn! You just finished the filling. Drink.

Get out your wrappers and a small bowl of water. For each wrapper put a small Tbsp of the filling in in the middle. Now dip your finger in the water and smear that moistened finger (feel free to double dip) all over those wrapper edges. Fold the wet edges together in any fashion that makes you happy. Repeat until you have filled however many wrappers you want (the filling will keep in the freezer if you only want to do a few at a time.)

YEAH, now you get to decide what to do with your amazing wontons. 

Fry them: a 1/4 inch of oil in a pan, flip when brown. Blot on whatever you have. 

Steam them: in a steamer basket, or if you dont have that fancy shit a pot of water with 2 inches of boiling water. Place a colander on the pot, not in the water, and a lid (or a non-melty plate if you have no lid). Steam 8 minutes.

Bake: throw on a oiled pan, bake at 350 degrees until brown. 

Freeze: really? You should know how to freeze things

edit: I a word

I tend to be extremely busy, and a lot of the faster choices seem carb-heavy. I'm looking to get a bit more fiber and protein in my diet.

What I'm imagining is some sort of recipes that mix beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, grains, and various fruit/vegetables. I know Quinoa is great.  Warm or cold is fine. I'm just looking for something affordable, filling and quick on the go--preferably something that keeps well (~5 days). The plan is that I'd put them together during the weekend and eat them throughout the week.

Any tips on what works well together? Any spices or additions that improve the experience?

Thanks! Your input is greatly appreciated!

**Ideas so far:**

* **Mediterranean Quinoa Salad**: quinoa, chopped tomato, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, olives, garlic, parsley, chives, salt, olive oil. Optional: feta
* **Simple Bean salad**: Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, Black Beans, Corn. Olive oil, pinch of cumin. Salt and pepper to taste.
* **Veggie Chili**: Diced tomatoes, tomato puree, zuchini, chick peas, kidney beans, black beans, onions, jalapeno, chili spice. Optional: mixed cheese (pepper jack, mozzarella, cheddar)
* **Lentil Soup**: Lentils, crushed tomatoes, onions, carrots, zucchini, celery, black pepper, salt, crushed red pepper.
* **Tomato soup**: Crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato puree, onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, basil, salt, pepper. Optional: Crushed red pepper, jalapeno, or heavy whipping cream for a creamy-tomato soup
* **Yogurt Mix**: Greek or Plain yogurt, granola, berries/peaches/whatever.
* **Citrus Cottage Cheese**: Mandarin Oranges and crushed pineapple, mixed in cottage cheese.

I did a search for ""stir"" in /r/budgetfood, and nothing came back, so search must not be working properly for me at the moment. Sorry if you guys get tons of stir fries.

I was wanting to experiment with tofu last night, so I decided the best way to do that would be to use it in a stir fry so that it would absorb flavors. I didn't realize it would end up being such a cheap meal.

- 2 medium green bell peppers (~$1.75)
- 1 medium red onion (~$1.00)
- .75 lbs sugar snap peas (~$1.50)
- 1.5oz soy sauce (~$1.50 / 14oz bottle)
- 14oz tofu (~$1.75)
- 1oz olive oil (not sure price; already had it at home)
- 1 package egg noodles (~$1.75)

Put pot of water boiling, big enough to fit bag of boiling egg noodles.  
Cut the tofu into small cubes, chop onions and bell peppers into chunks. Break sugar snap peas in half.  
Pour olive oil and soy sauce into large skillet, put heat on medium.  
Pour bag of egg noodles into boiling water.  
Put entire batch of tofu and all veggies into pan and begin frying.  
Stir veggies/tofu constantly while frying.  
Egg noodles finished first for me, so I put them in a strainer to let them dry.  
When veggies are fork-tender, serve them over egg noodles on plate / bowl.

Through shopping at Asian markets, buying fresh veggies, &amp; eating with rice and noodles, we got it down to about $21 per person, per week. 

We had a lot of spices and asian sauces, so we don't have to spend on those. 

We also spend about $6 a week on good cheese. 

We avoid canned goods, and only buy meat on sale.

Average week, 

Breakfast,
Pancakes 2x a week, with diced banana and yogurt. 
Cereal &amp; milk 5x a week. 

Lunch,  
leftovers from dinners

Snacks, 
peanuts or fruit

Dinner,
Noodles/rice, Steamed veggies, pan fried meat/tofu 3-4x
Noodle salad, with tofu/other veggies 1-2x
Leftovers the other times


We vary the veggies and spices so it's not bland or repetitive.

We're pretty proud of ourselves, we went from probably close to $100/person/week, and eating not so healthy, to eating much better on less than 1/5th of the cost.

I'm currently studying abroad in SE Asia, and this is a risotto inspired dish I frequently make. Prices for these items may vary for where you are, but the basics should be about the same and there's  room for infinite variations. It comes out to less than SGD $0.50 a serving for me. 

As I don't have much time to cook after school, I like to make a large batch of this on the weekends and use it with different combinations of vegetables and meats throughout the week. Depending on how much you make, it takes about half an hour and only one pot. Here's a rough outline of what I like to do:

**Step 1: Flavors**

- Heat a few tablespoons of butter or cooking oil in a medium sized pot over medium high heat, add in minced garlic, chilies, onions, fresh herbs or other aromatics/seasonings you have at your disposal. Also add a cube of chicken bouillon (SGD $1 for 6 here, and adds great flavor to a ton of dishes).
- Cook for a few minutes until flavors have incorporated well, or garlic is beginning to brown. At this point I like to throw in a can of braised peanuts (around SGD $0.50 here) but this is optional.
- Things should be smelling delicious around this point, and all of your flavors (aside from salt, pepper and hot sauce if desired) should be in the pot.

**Step 2: Rice**

* Add in several cups of rice (stir while adding, rice should be well-coated, but not completely submerged in oil). 
* I like to use brown ""healthy"" rice, which gives the dish a really nice crunchy texture, but any kind will do.
* Cook the rice in your oil mixture for 3-4 minutes

**Step 3:Thicken** 

* While your rice is cooking, use a water heater, kettle, microwave or another pot to heat up (not quite to boiling point) some water. Begin gradually (about 1 cup at a time) adding the heated water to the rice mixture. 
* After each addition stir the rice until it thickens up and absorbs the majority of  the water. Depending on how much rice you added, you should be able to do this around 4 times, and you should be stirring almost constantly during this process.
* After the 3rd addition, crack a few eggs (if available) into the rice and stir in. I find this makes it richer and more satisfying, although you can also wait and top it off with a fried egg at the end.
* Once your rice has reached a thick, yet still creamy, consistency, cut the heat down to low and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow any remaining liquid to cook off.

Remove from heat, add salt, pepper, or hot sauce to taste and eat alone or with any combination of meat and vegetables. Store left-overs in the refrigerator, and add 1-2 tablespoons of water during reheating. Enjoy!

What you need

Beef: I buy mine pre chopped($3USD). If they dont have that, then I buy a chunk of meat, and cut it myself.

Onions

Green pepper/or red/yellow/blue/whatevercoloryouwant.

Cheese: Not needed, as it can get expensive. But it adds good flavor.

Franks hot sauce/sriracha. 

Loaf of bread

---------------------------------------------------

Directions: Toss some oil in the preheated pan. Heat it up. Toss in your meat. Cook it. Wait for it to brown. Throw in your diced onion/peppers. I pour about a half cup of water in the wok at this point, which helps cook the veggies quicker. Toss a lid on it, and wait.

I added a bit of soy sauce at that point as well, throw in some hot sauce in there, and wait for the water to evaporate. Once the veggies are cooked(pour out water if you you have to much), put in sriracha/hotsauce. I load it up. 

Mix it all in. 

Now put your cheese on your loaf(cut like a subway sub), load in your meat/veggies, and put in a preheated oven for a few min, or till the breads toasty.

Voila.

Things you might not have:

1 1/2 tsps active yeast

Everything else:

2 Tbs sugar

6 1/2 cups flour

3 cups warm water

1 tsp coarse salt

Make the bread: throw the water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Let sit 5 minutes. Now toss in the salt, and add half the flour. Stir that mess with a wooden spoon (or the dough hook on your mixer). Now slowly add the rest of the flour until its all mixed uniformly. Cover with a tea towel and place in a non drafty spot (i use the inside of my OFF oven) for 40 minutes. Now punch that dough a couple of times and shape it into a loaf and throw on whatever pan you plan on baking it. Cover. Now wait another 30 minutes. Slash the top a couple of times, about a half inch deep, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes. 

You can use wheat or white flour. Wheat makes it a bit more dense, but at 50 cents or less a loaf do you really care? If you want to add dry flavorings like cinnamon leave out about the same amount of flour. Want to add garlic chunks? Just toss that shit in. Think it needs a wet ingredient like vanilla? Dont.

The first thing I made was 3 boxes of the same flavor hamburger helper, added some peppers etc. That got me 10 good sized portions and they taste awesome warmed up. But I want to make other things that are cheaper, because hamburger helper doesn't go on sale too often.

 **So what foods/recipes are cheap to buy/cook in balk? But also taste good out of the freezer a few weeks later?**

Bastardized from a Jamie Oliver recipe.  Buy a pork loin (£6-£7 at Asda here in the UK - good quality meat). Cut it into three or four equal pieces. Each piece will give one good meal or for two if you pad out with additional veg/yorkshire pud etc.

Take one piece and freeze the rest.

Take a sharp knife and very lightly score the pork in a criss cross pattern all over - cut about a cm apart. Try not to cut into the meat, just the skin. Squeeze half a lemon and mix with some salt, hot paprika and a dribble of olive oil, mix this and slather over Mr Porky, make sure you rub it into the cuts.

Turn oven up to max, put the loin in a high sided casserole dish or tray, put into pre heated oven for 20-30 minutes to crisp skin up.

Remove from oven and set aside. Pour off half the fat from the pan and discard. Add a chopped red onion ( i use red onions or shallots for cooking - much nicer flavour than normal ones),chopped chorizo, some whole chillies or red chilli flakes, some bay leaves and chopped rosemary. Put the pan over  heat and fry in the oil until the onion is soft. If there's not enough fat then add a gloop of olive oil, when onion is soft add a finely chopped garlic clove, some cherry tomatoes, a teaspoon of hot paprika and cayenne pepper mixed and a wineglass of water. Scrape all the sticky bits from the pan and pour in a tin of black eyed beans (33p Asda).

Put the pork back on top and chuck back into the oven at 180 for about an hour. Remove the chillies and slice the loin into medallions, spoon the bean mix over and enjoy!

* 1 can tuna ($1 on special, probably cheaper for you americans)
* bit of miracle whip / mayo ($0.05)

Drain tuna, mix with miracle whip. Add bit of onion / onion powder and 1 tablespoon oil if you want. Salt and pepper to taste. I usually toss in a few flakes of red chilli pepper seeds.

Bake potatoes until soft, scoop out a bit of the potatoes, insert tuna mix. It's nice to add some parmesan to the top, but not necessary.

Put back in oven, let the tuna crisp a bit. 1 potato serves one with a side of rice, 2 potatoes will probably fill you.

Not bad if eaten cold for lunch the next day.

I use the leftover scooped out potato to make mini ghetto Shepard's pies (I re-use the mini pie tins the chicken pies come in, cost $0). Add a tiny bit of ground beef / pork - you can even use oatmeal and spices to stretch it ($0.50) to the top and pour in gravy (homemade $0) or not (1/2 a $1-2 can) bake for 20-30 min.

The leftover tuna juice I reduce and use for tuna-less tuna sushi rolls. (mix the juice with the rice, instead of fish, use 2 sprigs green onion and add a liberal amount of chinese red pepper chilli sauce. Yum.

I'm twenty years old and a sophomore in college in the US.  I just found out that I'll be spending next year living in Dublin to study at Trinity College.  While there, my university will grant me a monthly allowance of $450, which is meant to subsidize my living costs but not necessarily cover them entirely.

Dining Halls and Cafes are available on Trinity's campus but are definitely expensive and definitely outside my price range.  Plus, Dublin is an expensive place to live to begin with, so some of my monthly allowance will have to go expense other than food.  As best as possible, I'd like to stay within the $450 allowance.

So, basically, I'll be cooking all of my meals myself in my college accommodations.  Up until now, I've had a dining hall included with my room/board where I can grab food whenever I like.  I never learned how to cook or what to cook or even how to plan meals in a budget---to be honest, Im a little excited to have the opportunity to learn all that on my own in Ireland next year.

So what I'm asking is:
1) What are some beginner tips for cooking for yourself?
2) What are some of your stand-by, easy recipes that I could learn?
3) What advice do you have for eating cheap?
4) Any other wisdom you wish to impart on me.

Thanks!

I can only spend $10-15 a week on food. I live in the southern US (Atlanta area to be more precise) so that's not much to go on. I'd probably starve normally with only that much to spend, however I live with my parents (due to the unemployment). While I have to buy my food they let me use their ""staples"" as long as I don't waste it.

This does not include their meat (for the most part). However I do get bread, soups, rice, all of their spices and things like that. So I can make it on $15 a week for food. 

I've been eating a lot of processed food lately and my mom is worried. For example, last week the store I usually go to had frozen pizza for $3 each. I can make 2 or 3 meals out of that so it's less than $1.50 a meal. That's cheap but also not exactly good for me. Probably better than completely surviving on ramen though.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of foods I don't like, and most of these happen to be healthy for me. I don't like most soups. The only greens I can eat are lettuce and broccoli. Mustard greens, cabbage, brussel sprouts, etc, i couldn't eat no matter how hungry I was. I literally gag on them.

I usually can't afford meat except lunch meat to make sandwiches. Ground beef is expensive here. The cheap stuff is $3 a pound and that's 73/27 crap. Chicken is cheaper and I love chicken but when I can buy 3 loaves of bread or 1lb of meat, it's hard to pick the meat.

Ingredients:

* 3-4 packages of Ramen noodles.
* 1 bag of coleslaw mix (cabbage, carrots etc)
* 2 Chicken breasts (I've used canned chicken and tuna too, still turns out pretty good).

* Dressing: Oil, Vinegar, Black pepper, Ground ginger, Soy Sauce, Peanut butter.

Prep:

* Cook chicken however you like, I just season them and cook them on a baking sheet in the oven. When it's done, chop it into cubes.
* Put some oil into a pan on med. heat, then throw in the crushed Ramen. Cook it ~10 min or until it's mostly brown. If you want you can throw in some Peanuts or Almonds, and cook those a bit. Once it's done remove from heat.
* Make the Dressing. In a bowl, mix up about 3 Tbsp. Oil, 2 Tbsp. Vinegar, 2 Tbsp. Soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp. Peanut butter. Add 1 Tbsp. Pepper, and 1 Tbsp. Ginger.

* After the dressing is done throw it into the pan with the coleslaw mix and mix it until you've coated it all with the dressing. 

And that's it, can just eat it room temperature or cold. If you refrigerate it, it won't be as crunchy, but I don't really mind.

1360610027.0,14,self.budgetfood,18bos8,"Tortilla Pizza - Easy and cheap pizza for one, and it does party tricks",14,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/18bos8/tortilla_pizza_easy_and_cheap_pizza_for_one_and/,"I don't want to detract from anybody's authentic pizza recipes here.  Making dough and sauce and all that is wonderful.  But for those of us who want something simple and cheap when the pizza craving hits, tortilla pizza is a great alternative to frozen and way cheaper than delivery.

I will explain the stove/broiler method first, but you can make this in a toaster oven, or even just a microwave.

**Ingredients:**

Olive oil, or cooking medium of your choice.  
Flour tortillas - I use the ones for soft tacos.  Bigger tortilla means bigger pizza, but takes a little more care.  
Sauce - a small jar of generic pizza sauce works fine here and cover many pizzas.  Consider pesto and other alternatives when you see them on sale.  
Cheese: mozzarella, provolone and/or parmesan are my favorites.  
Toppings:  these are small pizzas so a little goes a long way.  Get some good pepperoni or salami, though leftover ham and other meats can work well.  I love leftover chicken with pesto.  
More Toppings:  use what you've got handy.  I like to chop up a few green olives with my pepperoni, or kalamata olives with chicken if I've got some.  Can't go wrong with a slice of tomato or a few strips of roasted peppers.

**Tools:**

Cast-iron skillet, or other oven-ready pan, big enough to hold your tortilla with a little room to spare.  I use a small skillet with my taco-size tortillas.  
Stove top and broiler.  
Cheese grater, knife, spatula.  

I'll use the typical pepperoni pizza for my example.  Chop up the toppings, even if you bought pre-sliced pepperoni, as it will make slicing the pizza easier if everything is in tiny sub-bites.  (Also, pepperoni is cheaper by the stick than in those bags of slices.)  Grate the cheese (also cheaper by the block than pre-shredded, and tastes better), slice the olives or whatever you are using from the More Toppings category.

Meanwhile, turn on the broiler and let it pre-heat.  Warm up the skillet over medium or a little lower.  Add a couple tablespoons of olive oil (that's a lot, I know, but you'll thank me when you taste the crust) and swirl.  Put in your tortilla and allow to brown on one side.  My brand of tortillas puffs up in the pan at this point - I let it expand for a few seconds (cause that's always cool), then lay the spatula over the center so that it will brown evenly.

When the tortilla smells like toast, flip it over so that the other side will brown.  **WHILE THAT IS HAPPENING** (you get the idea this is an important tip, right?) you will assemble the pizza on the toasted side.  Spoon on some pizza sauce and spread evenly, close to the edges.  Add a thin layer of cheese - I like to just plop a circle of provolone right in the center.  Sprinkle your toppings over this and cover evenly, leaving just a thin margin at the edges.  Add a thicker layer of cheese on top (here's where I use the mozzarella and maybe some parm).  Go crazy here and ignore the whole ""margin at the edges"" thing - I deliberately scatter some past the edges of the crust, so that I get a ring of fried cheese around my pizza.

If you are working quickly, you can do all of that while the tortilla is browning.  If you think you are going too slowly (or the tortilla is cooking too fast) then just turn off the heat, but leave everything in the pan while you assemble the pizza.  After a little practice you will know the right heat to use.

Now the broiler step: take your skillet off the stove and slide it under the broiler, within a few inches of the heat.  Stand back but don't go far.  Within a couple minutes the cheese will melt and brown on top; you should be able to smell it if you are staying close.  Frequent checking is allowed.

When the cheese is browned, take the pan out of the broiler.  Slip the edge of the spatula around the rim to loosen any cheese, then scoop the pizza onto a plate.  The heat from the toasted crust below and the melting cheese above should be enough to warm the toppings nicely.  I've never had a problem with anything tasting undercooked (and I make these things pretty thick).  If you do, try warming the densest toppings (probably meat) before making the pizza, or letting the pizza stay in the pan for an extra minute or two before slipping it onto the plate.

Just as with a regular oven pizza, you don't want to slice it yet.  Let the cheese cool and solidify first.  Mine takes 2-3 minutes.  When it is ready, slice it to your liking.  My style is to cut it in quarters and then each quarter into thirds, so that I get 12 two-bite slices.  (And that is why the toppings need to be cut up so small, to make the slicing easy.)  Serve with some sensible side dish that makes you feel less guilty about pizza for dinner.

What, one of these is too small to fill you up?  You don't have *any* sensible side dishes?  Never fear.  My favorite ""pizza feast night"" treat is to make one of these and enjoy it while watching a show.  Leave the pan and tools out.  When the show is over, come back and make round two, with less oil this time because there was some left over from the first. I like pepperoni for round 1, chicken and pesto for 2.  Once you have some practice, you can make these in 10-15 minutes plus trivial clean-up.

**I only have a toaster oven:**  you will need to work in three stages.  First, brown the tortilla on one side, then flip and brown the other.  Take it out of the oven and assemble the pizza.  Put it back in and brown the cheese.

**I only have a microwave:**  still possible!  Look up suggestions for how to make tortilla chips in a microwave.  I've done it, but it is tricky, and I don't want to recall from faulty memory.  Crisp your tortilla, assemble your pizza, heat the toppings and melt the cheese.  You won't get browned cheese, sorry, but hey, pizza.

**What about the party trick:**  if you have a pizza stone, sheet pan or sturdy cookie sheet for your oven, you can make 3-6 of these at once, with careful practice.  This converts tortilla pizza for one into tasty party finger foods.  My experience is that it is easiest to toast the tortillas individually in advance, as they can be pretty fussy.  Then, close to serving time, assemble a variety of pizzas and put them into the oven, letting the cheese melt and brown as described.  Cool and slice (this is where you will definitely want 12 slices per pizza) then impress your guests.

**Note to purists:** no, a tortilla is not a substitute for a good pizza crust.  However, it makes a very good cracker crust for that style of thin pizza.  This also cuts down the carb count and allows people with gluten issues to make a pretty good pizza treat out of gluten-free tortillas.  Other sorts of flat bread can be used here too, but the skillet browning method is especially good for a thin crust.

This recipe is super quick and very filling, may even be able to make 2 servings if you are a light eater.

Recipe:

-1 pkg ramen noodles (any flavor you like)

-2c water

-cabbage (chop off a small junk from a head of cabbage and slice thinly)

-broccoli (break off a few spears from the head)

-1 carrot (thinly sliced)

-optional- seasame oil (about a tsp, nice for extra flavor)

-optional- few ounces of cooked meat (usually leftovers) sliced thinly


Bring the water to a boil on high heat and add the ramen, cook about 1.5-2min.  Add the rest of the ingredients and about a quarter to half of the ramen flavor packet (those things are loaded with sodium).  Stir and continue cooking for another minute or two, remove from heat.
I like my vegetables to still be a little firm and crunchy so if you want to soften them up more cook them longer.  If you are in a hurry throw a handful of ice cups in to cool it down more quickly.

-In a Crock Pot or slow cooker, place one diced onion and one whole bulb of garlic also diced (high heat setting).

-Place 5 thighs (legs attached, bone in; is cheaper) in boiling water for 15 minutes. That is long enough to cook them enough to be able to debone every bit of meat by hand once cool enough. 

-Place meat into slow cooker and add also BBQ sauce of your choice. I prefer anything with NO high fructose corn syrup. Also add a couple splashes of water. You be the judge of how much sauce. After two hours you will be easily able to shrew it to bits by fork by just mixing it around. All done. 

Place it on a toasted bun and there you go. I have not calculated the cost per serving but it is quite cheap. For a single person it can last you all work week. So tasty and garlicky too.

Take a whole Onion with both top and bottom cut off. Remove the first yellow layer of skin revealing a pure white interior. Using a sharp knife cut a cone shaped hole at the top of the onion. Then cut a beef bullion cube in half, next slice that half into three segments. Arrange the three segments in the hole you made. Add two pads of butter into that same hole as well. Finally wrap your onion tightly in tin foil. Throw in on a med/high grill for 35 min (depending on the size of the onion, small=30 med=35 large=40).

Ingredients:

1 box mac &amp; cheese (I used some of [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iZsvBVAb-w0/TfuOhdy5PWI/AAAAAAAAAG8/k1cpIK09r7k/s1600/annies-organic-macaroni-and-cheese-sale.jpg) but you can use whatever variety you like and it'll still taste great) 

1lb ground beef

1 package of cheapo taco seasoning

Cheddar cheese

A can of black olives.

Chop up some olives and grate yourself a TON of cheese. Brown the beef in a skillet, drain it, and add the taco seasoning. Prepare the mac &amp; cheese according to the box instructions, and when that's finished, dump in your meat, cheese, and olives, and prepare for cheesy taco deliciousness. 

Bonus: Go to Taco Bell and steal a *shitpile* (no, seriously; steal as much of that fiery juice as you can without getting kicked out) of hot sauce, and dump it into your concoction as well.

All of them are worthy as being cheap in my book, here are the few that stood out.

**Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken**

This would have to go into that ""so easy it's not really a recipe"" category.

1 cut up chicken or just your favorite pieces

2 cups barbecue sauce or a jar of your favorite store-bought

Put the chicken in the slow cooker (Crockpot™ is actually a brand name) and cover with the barbecue sauce. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. (Newer slow cookers will probably only take 4 hours as they cook much hotter than old ones.)

**Taco Meat Pies**

You can make these up from boiled hamburger or leftover taco meat or raw meat.

Brown the meat if raw, then add some taco seasoning and water. Let it simmer until thickened.

Make your own biscuits or use a can of refrigerator biscuits.

Roll each biscuit into 1/4"" thick circles. Put a few spoonfulls of the taco meat and some shredded cheese on top. Fold each biscuit in half over the meat, making a half circle. Pinch the edges together with a fork.

Bake at 400 for 8 minutes or so. Freeze any leftovers and reheat as needed or pack frozen in a school lunch. My kids liked them at room temperature.

**Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs**

This is one of my favorite recipes from Mama Dip's Kitchen.

6 chicken thighs

1/8 cup vegetable oil

1/4 cup lemon juice

1/2 tsp oregano

1/4 tsp black pepper

1/2 tsp garlic powder

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 cup soy sauce

Soak the chicken pieces in salted water for 20 minutes (or just rinse if you're in a hurry), then pat the pieces dry and lay them in a baking dish. They should be a bit crowded, touching each other.

Mix up the rest of the ingredients and pour over the chicken, then let stand for 20 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or until done.",,False,self,t5_2si9h,False,,green,True,t3_i038k,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/i038k/quick_cheap_recipes/,

1365466325.0,11,self.budgetfood,1bydsa,Pseudo-huevos rancheros + asparagus + bacon + avocado = $4-5,11,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1bydsa/pseudohuevos_rancheros_asparagus_bacon_avocado_45/,"I just made this rather lavish meal and only realized how cheap it was after eating it.  First post so here it goes:

You will need (all food purchased from Target in Alabama):

* One can black beans (I got the brand name for $0.92, you can the house brand for like $0.76)
* One can rotel tomatoes and peppers (I like ""hot"", got it for $0.99)
* One pack of small 6"" tortillas (24/$2-3)
* One egg per meal ($1.80 / dozen)
* Some cheese (I got cheddar, 8 oz / $2.50)
* Asparagus (1 lb bundle for $2.44, usually $3.50)
* One avocado per meal ($1.19 this time of year, may be more other times)
* Bacon ($5.29 / lb, I use 3 strips, or roughly 1/8th the pack)
* Salt, pepper, olive oil, butter, call it $0.40 per meal total

$19.51 or so gets 4 full meals with the easy ability to make several more (you will have lots of leftover eggs, tortillas, and bacon, and you may have enough huevos rancheros mix for 5 or 6 meals instead)

* Step 1:  Drain the beans, mix with the rotel and store in a tupperware container or something in the fridge.  You can do this anytime, and it will last for several days.
* Step 2: Preheat oven to 400 with a cookie sheet inside.  Take a few asparagus sticks (I use about 1/4 of the 1 lb bundle), break the hard ends off, throw in a gallon bag with a drizzle of oil and rub it all around until asparagus is coated in oil.  Throw asparagus on a sheet of aluminum foil with 3 strips of bacon (or however much you want).  When the oven is hot, set the foil on the cookie sheet and set a timer for 10 minutes.
* Step 3: Throw a tortilla in a toaster oven or in the actual oven for a few minutes, not until it's crispy but just until it's a little browned.  Put a pat of butter in a frying pan and heat it up on the stove.  Take the beans+rotel mix and spoon out a little (1/6 to 1/4 of it) into a small bowl, and microwave for 30 - 45 seconds.
* Step 4: When you have 5 minutes remaining, toss an egg into the frying pan, cook it however you like.  Make sure you take the tortilla out of the oven. Also somewhere in there, cut open the avocado and spoon it onto your plate
* Step 5: When the timer goes off, throw the bacon onto some paper towels for a minute, put the asparagus on your plate, then put the bean+rotel mixture on the tortilla, throw an egg on top of that, and sprinkle some cheese on top of that, with maybe some salt and pepper.
* Eat everything.  Try the bacon with the avocado, it's divine.

Individual cost: $4 if you catch some things on sale, $4.50-$5.00 if you don't.

3) Wash them briefly, chop the ends off, and peel the skins.

4) Chop them up into 1/8th inch slices (This is crucial to the crunchy exterior; any smaller and they burn, and any larger they become soft. Measure one slice as a template for all others).

5) In a large bowl mix together the chopped carrots and a few splashes of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (use your hands, they are the best tools in the kitchen).

6) Dump that mixture onto a baking sheet, and slide it into the oven for 26 minutes.

I've been following the Whole30 nutrition program, and love it--the only downside is it's taken a pretty big chunk of my monthly budget for groceries, and I'm at a point where I really need to cut that back as much as possible.  What I'm trying to do is figure out some great ways to save without giving up that way of eating.

More info can be found about the program [here](http://whole9life.com/category/whole-30/), but for grocery shopping purposes it essentially comes down to this:

Lots of protein, red meat, high-quality grassfed, etc, is best, though I already haven't been following that to get some more appropriately priced meats.

Tons of vegetables. Fresh is better, but I'm already eating quite a lot of bulk frozen bags to save on some money.

Clarified butter, olive oil, coconut oil, etc. are good. No vegetable oils.

Moderate amount of fruits, no fruit juice.
Minimal nuts and seeds.
No sugars of any kind.
No dairy.
No legumes (including soy, peas, peanuts).
No grains.


So, no potatoes (other than sweet potatoes/yams), no rice, no beans...all the big, super cheap, buy in bulk items I used to eat a lot of are out.



Anyone who's done the program before on a budget and has advice, or anyone who can just look at the grocery items above and point out things I might be missing as far as cutting back expenses, please throw your advice out here!  My monthly budgets are in a really good place right now--other than the huge chunk of groceries.  I'd really like to get that under control and start saving some money every month.

Thanks in advance for anything you can throw my way!",,False,self,t5_2si9h,False,,,True,t3_1erp9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1erp9g/grocery_challenge_whole30_on_a_tight_budget/,

This week's theme will be:

**IN-SEASON**

Here's how it'll go: I'll pick one thing from [this](http://www.eattheseasons.com/) site (also found in the sidebar), which lists current in-season foods. You pick two other foods from that list. Then you make them into a meal/dish. Like 'Chopped', you still have your pantry items and whatnot, but you MUST incorporate three items from the list. 

My pick is: **lamb**! 

(I'm raising the per-serving price to $4 for this challenge, because I know that lamb can be a bit more expensive in some areas than others.) 


EDIT: If you REALLY cannot find lamb on sale, feel free to try duck, as it's the other in-season meat listed on the site! ",,False,self,t5_2si9h,1368116752.0,,green,True,t3_1dat3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1dat3q/budgetfood_challenge_16_three_ingredient_inseason/,

I have been experimenting around with a system that would analyze your spending, present meaningful data to you (think price trends, grocery store price comparison, personal stock levels, anticipated next purchase date) and allow you to get a more in depth idea of where your money is going in regards to food (and such).

I'd like to add in some tips that can help guide you in the right direction for saving money. For example, the system should alert you when you have bought an item at a relatively low price and suggest to you to bulk up on it (if possible), as well as alert you on new highs/lows of item prices. 

I have a lot more ideas about how the system should be, but depending if there is any sort of demand will depend on how the system is developed. I don't want to spend much time on the user interface if only a handful of people would ever use it.

Do you have more ideas on how you would want to analyze your food spending? A big thing for me is buying in bulk - I hate wasting money and buying more of something later on, but at a higher price, especially when I have loads of freezer space!

1) he can not cook or prepare anything due to a medical condition, not even a sandwhich or a microwave meal, so I have to be able to cook it.

2) we can ONLY shop at the Lapeer Michigan Walmart, as that is the farthest I can ride my bike. 

3) He can't have any form of chicken

4) I am autistic, and have a ph imbalance. I can only eat a handful of foods. I can not eat mashed potatoes, pasta, cooked tomatoes, many rice and bean dishes, foods made with balsamic vinegar and some other vinegars, etc. I can not drink more than 3 sips of anything non carbonated, even water, without throwing up. I prefer novelty, as eating isn't very fun and is rather unpleasant and new foods make it more interesting. When he is not home (lunch every week day) I need grab and go/no-cook foods because it is not safe for me to cook home alone in case I have a sensory overload. 

5) We share a fridge freezer unit with another person. We are permitted approx. 1/4 of the freezer and 1/4 of the fridge. We have EXTREMELY limited shelf storage space, and can generally only go shopping once a month except for little things (we ran out of bread or cheese due to unexpected company, etc). 

I love to cook, and to make things from scratch. I'm generally home enough that if I need to I can cook all day, but there are days when I can't due to sensory issues. We need at least some ""easy/pre-prepared dishes"" that don't take up too much space. Also, our roommate hates when I cook because it might not look exactly perfect if he comes home early before I've cleaned, so I can't make big meals every day. 

We have to feed two extra people at lunch sunday, and once a month we have my friend's daughters (7 &amp; 10) over for the weekend (friday dinner through sunday breakfast) and need meals and snacks that are healthy and fun.

You'll need:

- One medium sized portabella mushroom 

- A handful of baby spinach

- Some pesto (I use the kind from trader joe's)

- A small handful of mozzarella cheese (i used shredded, but go ahead and experiment)

- A bit of olive oil

- 2 pieces of sourdough bread

Steps: 
   
1. preheat an oven to about 350°

2. arrange the spinach and  mushroom on a piece of tinfoil and cover in a light glaze of olive oil.

3. top spinach and mushroom with mozzarella cheese and fold tinfoil into a lose ball (to keep some moisture in and prevent leaking) 

4. Put tinfoil ball into oven

5. Start lightly toasting bread in toaster oven. When it's done, top each piece with a light glaze of pesto.

5. By the time you've finished with the bread (about 5-7 minutes) the stuff in the oven should be done. 

6. Cut up the now baked mushroom and arrange everything on the sandwich.

With just my boyfriend and I eating here, its hard to use up perishables quickly without eating the same four things all the time. I'd love to expand my recipe choices to use up things like dairy (especially this damn perpetually returning sour cream from chili night!) and bread and veggies. Its not like I'm buying a gallon of milk a week for two people but a quart is just always stalking me when I try to figure out what to cook.

Here's some of my stand-bys. All of them are pretty basic to make too.

**Freezable**

Cream of Vegetable Soup (dairy and veggies! Perfect for slow cooker cookin'.)

Or just any veggie soup. 

Or stock! I have a container in my freezer to throw random veggie bits, like peels or turning wilty, so then I could make stock at some point when I'm feeling my inner Martha.

Baked mac and cheese. Cut and packaged in single serving squares for the best frigging lunch in the world.

Quiche. I rarely have leftover eggs but when I do, I throw together a quiche for that morning brunch when you want to feel like one classy bastard but are too lazy to cook.

Freeze turning bananas for when you aren't too lazy to cook and make some banana bread- which then you can freeze.


**Not frozen but reborn from the ashes of milk (or something) into something better**

Yogurt (and then you can make [these things](http://www.kitchenstewardship.com/2010/01/12/homemade-yogurt-recipes-so-you-can-eat-it-all-the-time/) with that.)

Pudding (Also, rice pudding.)

Italian Bread Pudding
[Dulce de Leche](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dulce-de-leche-recipe/index.html)

Bread Crumbs

Fried Rice (perfect for leftover white rice from takeout.)

My boyfriend makes hashbrowns with leftover fries...its weird.

This is a shame. If you're in the know - skip down to recipes. Noobs - read up. 

Now, London Broil is the preparation of a cut of beef, not the cut itself; however, many markets label the flank steak or trimmed top round as a 'London Broil"". It can vary from 1"" think to 4"" thick, and it's almost always 9""-12"" long. Ask the butcher what cut it is, if it's not labeled. 

My local Safeway (which is Carrs in some places, I understand) usually has these cuts for $2.50-$3.50/lb. They often have BOGO sales on them (which averages to $6/steak). But most importantly, they are almost always in the clearance bin. I have been regularly picking them up for around $6. They freeze beautifully and easily feed my steak-lovin' family of 4. 

This cut is best when marinaded. I usually throw it in a gallon-sized freezer bag with some Italian dressing and freeze it for future use. Sometimes I get fancy with some wine, some balsamic vinegar, and some oil and herbs. It really doesn't matter, just make sure you marinade it something with an acid (vinegar) and a base (oil). 

Cook that son of a gun! Two ways: grill it or broil it. Throw some salt/pepper on it. Either way on high for 3-4 minutes per side, per inch of thickness. Really thick ones: get the char on and then turn down to medium and roast it. 

Let that bad boy rest! Do you know how to check done-ness? Yeah? Ok, skip this. If you don't keep reading. Touch that meaty part of your hand between pointer and thumbalina. When your hand is relaxed - that's what very, very rare feels like. Make a loose fist - that's medium rare. Tight fist - why did you bother buying steak? That's well done. And criteria for divorce. Back to resting. Let the meat chill out for a few minutes after you pull it off the heat. Don't you dare cut it right away! 

Has it rested? Alright, cut it in very thin slices (about a quarter of an inch) **across the grain**. That's the magic. Now what are you going to do with this gorgeous, meaty goodness?

**Total: $11.15 or $2.78/servings for 4** (note: skip the toast for less carbs and it's $2.28/serving)

**Just eat it with a baked potato and salad**

I wont insult your intelligence there. You know how to make that and how much it costs.

Since we're traveling and don't have an income, we have a strict $20/day budget for food. (Or less, if I can manage it.) Which wouldn't be a problem in a perfect universe, but I don't live in that universe - the price of proteins is rapidly skyrocketing out of my price range. Ground turkey is usually affordable when I can get it, but because it's so cheap, it's fairly difficult to get a hold of. I was starting to consider processed proteins like hot dogs and canned chili, but my boyfriend gets terrible heartburn from these items. And I would circumvent the hot dog heartburn by burying them in macaroni and cheese, but of course, I have found the one man in America who hates macaroni and cheese. 

I keep turning to google searches for recipes, but I've exhausted all the keyword combinations I can think of. These searches take literally three or four hour chunks out of my day, EVERY day, and frankly I'm so burned out by the process that I could just cry. Or explode, whatever comes first. 

So therein lies the rub: I'm too broke to buy expensive and/or healthy ingredients, but the cheap stuff makes my guy's GI tract attempt mutiny. The fact that he's kind of a picky eater is not making my life easier. 

Can you guys help me out with some super cheap recipes that won't blow out his system? 

Spicy food, expensive meats like ground beef and chicken breasts, and expensive fresh veggies are out of the question. Rich sauces and cheese sauces are also a no-go, as well as zucchini, cooked mushrooms, and fruit in any form. (Sorry.) Tomatoes and tomato sauces are pretty manageable. 

I know this is a tall order, but I'm at a total loss here. ANY ideas at all are greatly, tremendously, transcendentally appreciated.

I might be gluten/lactose free this summer. I'm getting some tests done in the next few weeks which will determine my dietary restrictions for the foreseeable future.

Big problem is I grew up on ""Canadian food"" (Kraft Dinner and hot dogs, spaghetti with ground beef sauce, fried pork chops with boiled potatoes and peas or creamed corn) no flavours, no fancy spiced dinners, nothing.  He grew up on Russian food so things like borstch, crazy herring salads that I couldn't pronounce if my life depended on it, soups with 5 or 6 different kinds of meats in them, sauces that would make your toes curl cause they are so good etc.  My cooking is just no where near that level, Also the things I have tried to make him that are Russian meals he just plain doesn't like them and says I don't do it right or we just don;t have the right ingredients, or the quality of ingredients is not right  He is almost impossible to please!
