1372777571.0,187,self.weddingplanning,1hi0le,My #1 piece of advice for your wedding: The Wedding Paradox,209,22,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hi0le/my_1_piece_of_advice_for_your_wedding_the_wedding/,"What is the wedding paradox? The wedding paradox is that the more you concentrate on each other, the more included your guests feel. Why is this? It's because they're getting to witness something personal. The more people feel like they're getting to witness something personal, the more privileged they'll feel that they got to be included. 

A wedding conspires against this, unfortunately. Whenever you have more than 20 people in a room, you no longer have a guest list. You have an audience. Like it or not, human behavior is such that people in large groups turn into passive watchers and expect to be entertained. This is not a problem. The problem is that the couple, consciously but more often unconsciously, feels that and turns into performers. They're not concentrating on each other.

So read your vows to the other person, not with a wink to the audience. Want an intimate wedding? Be intimate with each other. Slowly walk around with each other during cocktail hour. Be real and be present. The guests will be able to feel this.

Have you ever been to an amazing, unforgettable concert? I bet it was because the musician(s) got lost in the performance and created something spontaneous and authentic. I bet it's because the musician poured his/her heart out on stage and you felt lucky to see something so heartfelt and genuine :)",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,married,True,t3_1hi0le,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hi0le/my_1_piece_of_advice_for_your_wedding_the_wedding/,

1. You might not be able to get the ring on your spouse's finger. Stress, heat, nervousness, and etc all culminate into swollen fingers. That ring that fit just fine last week totally won't fit without some serious shoving during the ceremony.

2. You really won't care about the little stuff, no really. It's not because you didn't care about it enough before, it's because when you're in the moment there's no longer anything you can do to change it, so it no longer matters. I was surprised at how little I cared about things when they didn't work out on my wedding day.

3. You will still care about the big stuff. And something will go wrong to ruin at least one big thing, and it will bother you for quite a while after your wedding. Mine was we didn't get a first dance because of a ""surprise"" limo showing up to whisk us away.... so we rushed through the cake and totally skipped the first dance. I am still pissed I didn't get a first dance to this day.

4. Everyone will lie to you , through their teeth, on the day of your wedding. Seriously. I'm surprised at how many people just flat out lied about one thing or another whether in an attempt to ensure I won't worry about it or they just flat out didn't know so they told me what they thought I wanted to hear. 

5. You might not be able to SLEEP on your wedding night. Putting aside the post-nuptial nookie that's hotly debated on the wedding night. My new husband and I couldn't calm down, despite being exhausted, to fall asleep. We were just so keyed up and talking about what an awesome time we had, no amount of relaxing, hot showers, Benadryl or whatever would get us to pass out. We had to be up super early too for our flight so meandering onto a cruise ship with 2 hours of sleep totally sucked. 

6. Depending on how much time Wedding Planning took up prior to the wedding, you might find a lack of things to do for a couple weeks afterwards. It takes some serious adjustment to realize that after however long focusing on this one thing for this one day... it's over, and you no longer have to worry about those spreadsheets or DIY projects, it's totally over. You now have loads of free time. 

7. Things you think would be a no brainer, are not no brainers. Write down who you want in pictures and then tell those people so they know too. You'd be surprised how many people just assume they're going to be in pictures and stick around, and how many people who are close family that just take off. 

8. You will be surprised at who gives you gifts and who doesn't. This is a touchy one since everyone says, ""Oh you should never expect a gift."" Well I didn't expect gifts, but it didn't mean I wasn't surprised that our close friends who without fail send us a card for every holiday, including the most arbitrary ones (labor day, really?!), didn't even get us a Congratulations card. It stuck out because it was very unlike them. Apparently some people really like weddings and some people really don't. 

9. The buck doesn't stop there. You think since the wedding is over the money is done leaving your account? HA! Wedding dress cleaning can range from $80 - $300 depending on what you need done and how you want it ""preserved."" Not to mention postage for the Thank You cards and getting pictures printed that your family and friends took, or maybe even from your photographer depending on the package you purchased. Oh and the honeymoon, one tends to spend a lot of money on a honeymoon, even if it was ""all inclusive.""

10. Finally, the proclivity for one or both of you to get sick as soon as you get home. Apparently according to my doctor it's ridiculously common for one to get home from their honeymoon and immediately fall ill with a cold, flu, or something because of the stress, hugging all those people, travelling, and even sex (UTI, yeast infection or just general irritation). Even if  you did the deed before your wedding day your immune system could be compromised from all of the above and affect sex too.

I see it in forums and blogs. I don't often (if at all) see it in this subreddit, which is why I lurk here often, but I do see it around Reddit as a whole. 

""I don't get why people spend so much money on 'One Single Day'. It's just a party, guys!""

""I only spent $3.50 on my wedding and we've been married for 1,500 years, anyone who spends more is an idiot!"" 

""My ring is made out of recycled cat turds that we harvested ourselves on our commune! Anyone who buys a diamond deserves to be forcibly sterilized!"" 

or even

""I'm not getting married because getting a piece of paper to validate your love is stupid and I hope your cake is poisoned because weddings and marriage are just to show off.""

What is this, I don't even. 

I get not going into debt for your wedding. It is something I wouldn't do, personally. I don't look down on people who do, though. Sometimes you have to go into debt to have a $2,000 wedding. Sometimes you can put $10,000 down, but would like an extra $5,000 to make it prefect for you. Sometimes you need to have that wedding ASAP because one of you is being deployed, or mom is sick and may not make it another year or two, or you're about to relocate and want to throw the party before you move, or for whatever reason you find. People go into debt for cars or homes they don't need. As long as your choice makes you happy, who am I to care? 

Nope, I don't feel ""better than"" anyone. I've been to some amazing weddings for amazing people that have ranged from a few hundred bucks to six-figures. I have been to some ""crappy"" weddings at various budgets as well. What made them crappy was that I could tell the couple wasn't as in love as they proclaimed OR they were doing something that they weren't comfortable with, whether it means spending too much or too little, eloping or choosing not to, letting their parents help out of necessity or not letting them help out of pride. 

As long as you and your partner are happy, then who cares what you do or don't spend? 

My wedding is not JUST one party, one day, one night. My wedding is probably the only time that my family and friends will come together with my man's family and friends in one room. It is a celebration of our marriage. It's not just ""some event"". It is a day in which I want to make my friends &amp; family feel special and pampered because THEY are the reason I am the person I am today. I wanted to go all out, and going all out for me means that I have to spend what many people will consider a frivolous amount of money. Going ""all out"" for some people may mean $1,000. For others, it may mean $500,000. Why do we have to shame others either way? Why do we feel self-righteous about our budgets? 

I wrote a lot more about what MY budget it, but I deleted it. It doesn't matter if I'm spending $6 or $600,000. I wish the budget shaming would just end!

1366084573.0,130,self.weddingplanning,1cfv5j,The art of NO,140,10,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1cfv5j/the_art_of_no/,"I currently work in a forensic mental health clinic.  Every single day, I get pestered by drug addicts to petition their doctors for more drugs.  I deal with homeless people wheedling for extra bus tickets.  I take calls from lawyers demanding that their reports be bumped ahead of other cases.  Before I started this job, I couldn't say no.  It just wasn't in my vocabulary. Two years of endless demands has prepped me in a rather useful way:  I've learned how to politely explain to someone that I understand their need/want/concern, but it's just not going to happen.

I do not want children at my wedding (for a number of reasons) and the word was spread.  I was dreading my cousin's RSVP because I just knew she'd try to force her way into securing invites for her four (FOUR!) kids.  I just got off the phone with her.  

I was told that they thought they could come; ""No, sorry, that's why the invitation was only addressed to yourself and your husband."" 

They want to come; ""Well, unfortunately the cutoff is at first cousins.  We're not making any exceptions on either side so it stays fair.""  

They are crying because they picked out outfits and are now uninvited; ""I can understand that they'd be disappointed and I'm sorry your kids are upset, but they were never invited in the first place.  That's why I made sure to mention it a few times in the months leading up to the wedding.""  

She even tried to say her husband won't be coming because they cannot afford a babysitter; ""Oh, that's too bad.  I'm glad you'll be able to make it, though!""

I hung up the phone and sighed.  While I'm still pretty upset that my cousin would try and manipulate me with the tears of her children, I have mastered the art of no!  Firm, polite repetition of my main point until the other person understands that I'm not going to yield.

**EDIT**  A couple of comments asked for me to go more in depth, here's my personal attack plan:

-  Rehearse your points beforehand, you can even write them down to make sure you have an arsenal at the ready.

- No matter what happens, stay calm. Getting emotional creates an opening that people will jump at and try to manipulate to their advantage.

- If you're doing it over the phone, smile as you speak - it literally softens the sound of your voice and takes the edge out of it even if you feel like screaming at the person. To a lesser degree, you can do this in person; just don't grin constantly or they may think you've lost your mind.

- Using softer language comes across as more respectful, i.e. ""Unfortunately, we're not doing blank"" instead of ""We don't want blank.""

- If all else fails, say you're sorry that they don't like your decision, but unfortunately you can't accommodate their needs. I find that ""I understand how you feel about this, and I'm sorry that you're upset, but please respect my decision on the matter"" will stop most rational people in their tracks. Irrational people... good luck with that!

Back in January the death of my Grandfather was very difficult on me and I was having trouble coping with it, and had to be put on medicines to control my blood pressure because I was at serious risk for a heart attack at the ripe old age of 30. 
When it came to the wedding planning I was very helpful to my bride, I helped her with a budget, I made her bouquet (out of book pages like she wanted, it had nearly 2 football fields of wire, 50 pearls, and 200 pages to it, it took me about 100 hours to make) a lot of the craft stuff I did, because I have a job that allows me to work on various things in my downtime. So I stayed very involved in helping with the wedding, while buying a house for us.
Day before the wedding her bridesmaids friends are starting to call the shots, and ordering me around, my blood pressure spikes into heart attack range while being on the medicine. Day of the wedding they are ordering me this way and that way where I don't see my bride before hand, through this I never had a chance to look at all the things I made for the wedding, it became lorded over by the bridesmaids. 
I know it is traditional for the groom to not see the bride before the wedding, but it would have meant so much to see her in the moments after getting ready, when the music she uses to calm her down was playing, when she was admiring the way she looked, I know that that moment was such a sweet moment that I would have loved to have seen it, rather than being kicked outside to sweat out my soul in the hot August sun. I would have loved to take her hand and walk around to look at all the things we made, to just enjoy a moment of peace, it would have done much for my blood pressure and would have made the day so much better for me. As it is, it was the single most stressful day of my life, and I was so happy for the honeymoon to be so then we could be alone. 

So on your wedding day, remember that you are marrying someone who wants to be there for you at all times, and we hope the wedding day is one of the happiest, and we might like to share that bit with you.

I was standing kind of away from the crowd because I had to use the bathroom, and of course you get stopped a million times. So I'm chatting with one of my MILs friends, someone I've never met, mind you. We're having a pleasant conversation when my 16 year old nephew comes up to me and interrupts by saying, ""Aunt V, I need to talk to you about something."" 

""...Um, ok."" I look awkwardly at the woman because I feel bad that our conversation was interrupted and then he goes, ""Something personal."" The lady takes that as her cue to leave to give us privacy.

He comes up to me and says, ""Do you have any weed I can buy?""

ON MY FUCKING WEDDING DAY!!!

I was like, ""NO."" and walked away.

First of all, you are my nephew. I am NEVER selling you weed. Secondly, I DON'T SELL WEED?! Thirdly, I don't even HAVE weed. And fourth, IT'S MY FUCKING WEDDING DAY. I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO SELL YOU WEED ON MY WEDDING DAY EVEN IF I DID HAVE SOME AND I DID SELL WEED AND I FELT ALRIGHT SELLING IT TO YOU, MY 16 YEAR OLD NEPHEW. ON MY WEDDING DAY.

Step 2: Try not to panic. 

Step 3: Decide to elope! Yay! Congratulations! Better start planning!

Step 4: Make plans to go to the courthouse the next morning before work. Inform parents.

Step 5: Use lunch hour to call courthouse repeatedly to schedule a ceremony time, as per website instructions. Encounter numerous voicemails and no live people. Receive no returned calls.

Step 6: After work, shop the internet for wedding bands. Place order at 
approximately 2 am. Fall exhausted into bed after placing order.

Step 7: Go to the courthouse in person the next day. Get marriage license by waiving waiting period. Discover that you can’t get married there today (Thursday). 

Step 8: Research elopement chapels and officiants. Make 200 phone calls. Leave numerous voicemails. Write a dozen emails. Wait for replies.

Step 9: Finally reach coordinator at small chapel. Book it for Saturday. Cringe at cost of last minute elopement package. Text details to immediate family.

Step 10: Purchase last minute airfare to fly groom’s sister in from Arizona. Cringe at cost of last minute flights. 

Step 11: Call local restaurants and ask for last-minute use of banquet room. Book dinner for 18 people following your wedding. Cringe at cost of dinner. Double cringe just thinking about costs of alcohol by the glass.

Step 12: Go to craft store. Buy veil, garter, and plain adjustable rings for use in ceremony.

Step 13: Go to work! Try not to cry at work.

Step 14: Go home. Experience entire range of emotions associated with wedding planning. Sentiments may include, but are not limited to:
“My FMIL is trying to control everything!”
“This isn’t how I wanted my wedding day to be!”
“I can’t believe this! I get to marry my fiancé in 2 days!”
“Flowers? I need to have flowers? Oh God, I need to have flowers!”

Step 15: Try not to cry due to overwhelming stress and emotional onslaught.

Step 16: Fail horribly. Sob shamelessly on kitchen floor. 

Step 17: Dig through closet for dress to wear. Find nothing. Call mother to borrow dress. Find options, all 2 sizes smaller than regular dress size. Be extremely thankful you started work out program when you got engaged. Squeeze into borrowed size 10 lace sundress. Search for cardigan/shrug as to avoid freezing to death while wearing summer sundress during Michigan winter. 

Step 18: Go to bed. Toss and turn all night. Fall asleep 10 minutes before alarm goes off. 

Step 19: Go to work again. Try not to cry at work while writing out vows.  Distract yourself with /r/funny. 

Step 20: Leave work and pick up groom’s sister from airport. Play it cool, making sure to avoid acting like you’re ready to pull your hair out. 

Step 21: Go to bed. Toss and Turn all night. Wake up at 2am, 4am, 6am, 7am, and with alarm at 8am. 

Step 22: Go to work on your wedding day because you couldn’t get the time off with such short notice. 

Step 23: Rush home from work and frantically do hair, make-up, and paint your nails (even though you broke half of them in the past 24 hours alone). 

Step 24: Meet up with immediate family and drive to tiny little chapel hidden in not-so-awesome neighborhood.

Step 25: Wedding! Make sure to hurry through your ceremony in 30 minutes or less so that you don’t have to pay extra, then head off to dinner so you can eat something for the first time all day before you collapse exhausted into bed!

Just FYI: We had already paid deposits in Mexico for our destination wedding next May (2014), and we still plan to have a wedding there with all our family and the full reception. Feel free to AMA!

I kinda hate saying that, but it's true. I've been working on losing weight since the engagement and I've done really great, I've lost 25lbs since January. But I'm still plus sized, and even though my wedding is in June of 2014, I have been dreading the very idea of looking at, trying on, and purchasing a dress. I know I have time, but how much time do I REALLY have? (rhetorical question)

My stigma comes from a lifetime of feeling like a sub-par woman, comparing my bodies to those of swimsuit models and celebrities, I grew up in Southern California and walked away from it all with a huge complex.

The truth of the matter is, my fiance has been there for me at 60lbs lighter and asked me to marry him at my absolute heaviest weight, so why am I so afraid, still, of my body? I know this isn't the form I want to always be, I know I have let myself go and have completely changed my eating and exercise habits, and I'm getting back to where I am comfortable, but I have to start thinking about my dress.

Today I reluctantly made an appointment in a wedding dress boutique in Portland, to look at dresses. I assumed they wouldn't have any sample dresses in my size and that I could look but not touch.

First of all, I was wrong. I am about a 14-16 pants and XL shirt, and wedding dresses run smaller so I knew I'd be looking at a 18-22 size wedding dress. The woman that was helping me, didn't even mention my size at all. She simply pointed to the sample size rack that I'd be looking through and helped me pick out one of each dress style. 

What happened next was magic.

I put on the full torso bra and the mermaid petticoat and began to slip into dresses. One after another, they maybe didn't fit perfectly, but she held them in a way to give the illusion that they did. And it made me feel like a million bucks. Dress after dress, I got to see my body, my silhouette in these stunning gowns that I previously could never picture my current body in. 

I looked at myself for the first time and saw a woman, I saw myself as a whole and not just my flaws, I saw the things that stood out to me like the fact that my bust and hips are larger than my waist, and with that cinched waist, I looked like a I had an hourglass figure. The dresses looked NORMAL on me. Simply, I looked like a bride.

I finally slipped into the mermaid dress, the one I never pictured myself in, the one I dreaded the most, and when I saw myself, I began to cry. I looked stunning. The dress was perfect, it fit me so well, the corset back created the perfect silhouette and my body looked incredible. I have never said those words before. *My body looked incredible.*

She put a veil on me and I didn't have words. I never thought I'd be the woman crying over a dress or speechless because of a veil, but I was.

I walked out of there happy. I did not purchase a dress, despite how I felt, I still want to lose a bit more weight because I have so much time. I also want to look at a couple more dresses, just to make sure, but I have a general idea of how each type of dress looks on my body. I no longer fear dress stores. The size stigma is always going to be there, but in my head now, knowing if something fits you correctly, it is going to look better. I might not ever be a size 4 bride. I might not even be a size 14 bride, but I know that I'll look my best and I'm even excited to purchase my dress.

If you are engaged and afraid of the dress part like I was, please, do yourself a favor and find a boutique with a large range of sizes and go for it.

Please read on before you agree/disagree...",111,30,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1h98jb/meta_should_we_perhaps_limit_photos_of_venues/,"**Disclaimer: I'm not a mod... just a heavy user of this sub that would like to offer a suggestion!**

Hi everyone!

I love this subreddit. Needs to be said up front. I'll probably say it again later on because I can't help myself. I have never found a place on the Internet that has a wider variety of brides who are all genuinely supportive of each other and sincerely helpful. Forums on the Knot, etc, tend to be populated by gals with mountains of money to spend, strictly adherent to ""rules"" for rule's sake, and Pinterest-level expectations of the final ""product"" (I say that sarcastically, because I think we all know here that a wedding is not a ""product"", but in fact, a pretty fucking special occasion). Hell, we even have DUDES on here, how great is that for perspective?

I'm so happy when I come here for a day and see a lot of self-posts. People sharing tips that I hadn't thought of. People with problems that I've faced myself and I can assist with. People with in-law trouble who just want a shoulder to lean on. I think *that* is the difference between /r/wedding and /r/weddingplanning. 

But we go through phases... one person will post their ring, then another goes ""oh, that's acceptable"" and does it. And so on. Eventually the sub gets overrun with posts that are awesome to look at (and they are, please do not misunderstand me), but don't really provide a lot of insight into the wedding planing process, challenges we face, wins we want to celebrate, etc. We eventually (politely, because our mods are awesome) asked people to post their rings on /r/justengaged instead. But lately it's been all about venues and dresses. Which if it was done in moderation, would be just fine! But we're all excited about our weddings and the next step in our lives. So it tends to snowball very easily.

I love this sub and think it has a distinct service to offer that gets easily lost in a lot of image posts. So just a few thoughts, proposals, or whatever you'd like to call them:

* **Allow 'brag'-type image posts just one day a week** (ala what /r/TwoXChromosomes does with Fridays). Maybe it's Friday, maybe it's Monday. But whichever day we select, that's the day to go absolutely nuts with venue pictures, engagement shots, rings, etc. These posts are still helpful, for ideas and inspiration. But we do have access to Pinterest for that. So maybe just limit them to once a week here on this super-wicked-awesome sub?
* **Images would still be allowed as replies to posts on any day of the week.** So it's not like you couldn't respond to someone with ""well, here's what I found"", ""here's what we did"", etc.
* **Requests for help in finding a specific dress, item, place, etc, would still be allowed any day of the week.** So someone who is looking for a green dress could still post a picture of a green dress and ask if anyone's seen something similar. 

**Bottom line: Brag/Check Me Out image posts are awesome, but perhaps they should be more regulated in a sub that has consistently been a place to find high-quality wedding planning advice and information.**

Thanks for your time! It would be great to see this upvoted for visibility (it's a self-post, so no karma), but I'm not going to beg because I believe in the upvote/downvote system. :)",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,2months,True,t3_1h98jb,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1h98jb/meta_should_we_perhaps_limit_photos_of_venues/,

If this subreddit has taught me anything it's taught me to have a voice in my wedding planning process. I still hate saying no, but I've learned that it is necessary!!! I'm here to share the positives that have come out of the negative. 

I do not want kids at my wedding. I felt it was rude to include that on the invitation. That and I did not have the space anywhere to include it. I went with the understanding that how you address the invitations is how you let your guests know who was included in the wedding. If it's addressed to ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jones"" then that's who's invited. If it's addressed ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jones and family"" that means bring your kids! I heard through the grapevine that my FH's father is just telling his side of the family to bring kids. An uncle and aunt were speaking to my FH's father and not us (I've reached out to his family before the invites went out as a way of introduction as we've never met. They know how to contact me. They should have contacted me.) We headed if off before it got too far and FH told dad ""we don't have the space for kids. We have space for the people that are specifically called out on the invitation"". APPARENTLY F-FIL took that as ""If my wife and I give up our seats at the reception then the kids can come."" Lo and behold we got a response card back with the aunt, uncle, and two kids names RSVP'ing to the wedding. I took a stand. I said no. A fight ensued (the VERY reason I never say no normally. I can't take fighting.) and feelings were hurt but in the end, F-FIL is not paying for our wedding. It is in no way his place to tell people they can come. He can tell them to get a hold of US as it is OUR wedding anyway. We'd be the ones with the answers to the questions. 

Today was my hair and make-up trial. I've been going to this woman for years and have always loved what she does with my hair. She had an idea for an updo. I was weary of it but I let her try it because I trust her. That and I wanted to see it for myself before saying no. When it was all said and done I hated it. The placement of the veil was not what I wanted either. I bucked up and said I didn't like it. I wanted my hair and veil lower on my head. To my amazement the world didn't end! She shrugged and said no problem. Did a quick trial of another updo and I loved it. 

TL;DR: It may be hard but you need to stick to your guns. Don't be afraid of someone getting mad at you because at the end of the day this is YOUR day. Don't get timid and never compromise on your vision.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,2months,True,t3_1ipr1p,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1ipr1p/a_lesson_in_no/,

1371571769.0,78,self.weddingplanning,1glaq3,[UPDATE] Florist fired me --&gt; best thing that could have happened,87,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1glaq3/update_florist_fired_me_best_thing_that_could/,"For those who care, I posted a post (redundant?) a few weeks ago about my florist who had ""fired"" me for asking too many questions 2 months out from my wedding.

The most amazing circumstance has come out of it.

I am getting married in western Kentucky, and had approached Western Kentucky University after starting to search for a new florist. So many good things came of this:

1) I'm getting EXACTLY what I want (including these hard-to-find berries the other florist basically said ""sorry"" over [these were pretty important to me])

2) I'm getting EXACTLY what I want for significantly cheaper

3) We had such a good meeting, this florist and I.  We really just connected real well and shared some ideas, and really just shot the breeze

4) I mentioned that I was making my own centerpieces and he was curious as to what flowers I was using, or how he could help.  I told him the quantities of flowers I was buying (total of 500 stems came to around $650)... he just got back with me today and can provide all of it for actually around $500.  Not only that, but he's going to trim and dethorn all of them for me (saving nearly an entire day of work) FOR FREE.

I am getting ALL OF MY FLOWERS for my entire wedding for under $1000.  This includes bouquets for 7 bridesmaids, myself, 4 corsages, 13 boutonneires, all of my flowers for the reception AND ceremony (again, around 500 stems).

I am so blown away and just..  flabbergasted that this could be so great.

Just needed to share, because I feel like I""m walking on cloud nine right now.

* Just because we won’t use it doesn’t mean we don’t need to register for it.
* ""Just register for this, you can always exchange it for what you * really want!"" (That's actually not okay with me)
* I will not ask people to buy me towels that are more than $30 a piece. I just refuse.
* Apparently people who work at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond are convinced no one buys several small gifts at once. I've done it several times and have seen many others do it. I guess they don’t think about poor young folk.
* Registering is a really good way to get into an argument over something stupid like measuring cups or shower curtains.
* My fiance apparently cares about how many shower curtains we register for.
* He actually has a lot of opinions about a lot of things (which is good, because I really don’t care what kind of cookware we get).
* Pyrex is superior.
* I need to chop vegetables all the time, and I never knew it.
* I need too many trash cans.
* I am not one to sort through all the options. I look until I find one I like, and settle on it (but that’s not how I picked FH).
* We tend to like simple, basic, black/white things (actually, we already knew that).
* I really have no idea what color KitchenAid mixer I should want. Still deciding.
* ""You don’t need to register for that! It’s really a gift card item.""
* ""But we already have one!"" is not an acceptable thing to say.
* After you're “set loose” with the scanner, scan less than ten items and leave. You can do the rest online anyway.
* It’s easier to just do it all online to begin with.

1375026233.0,69,self.weddingplanning,1j7w3r,I found The Dress at a trunk show!,72,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1j7w3r/i_found_the_dress_at_a_trunk_show/,"[Here it is!](http://imgur.com/TrxsXh5) I thought I would share my trunk show experience, for anyone who's clueless about trunk shows (like I was).

I had never heard of or attended a trunk show, but I had my eye on a particular Lazaro dress and decided I would take a look around at a Lazaro trunk show nearby this weekend. My aunt was in from out of town because she's getting chemo &amp; a bone marrow transplant, so I wanted her to be able to come with before her surgery. I had to make an appointment about a month prior &amp; I was barely able to get an appointment - there were only 2 slots left! It was kind of nice having an appointment because there was only one other group there besides me, so the staff was able to focus on helping us out. I don't mean that in a selfish way; trying on dresses is such a process and it helps to have the salesperson focused on you rather than trying to multitask with 3 other girls.

I brought in a picture of the dress I wanted to try, which I liked until I put on THE dress. There was simply no comparison - I knew the second I put it on. Once I decided it was The Dress, they brought out champagne &amp; the accessories people went nuts putting veils and jewelry on me. It was pretty neat, and Lazaro himself came over to congratulate me and offer accessories suggestions! I'm not big on having a lot of attention on me (it still makes me nervous to think that everyone will be watching me at our wedding) but when you find your dress, it's really nice to have your spotlight moment!

To be perfectly honest, I don't recall if this happened to her or if she heard it somewhere. Let's just assume it was her...

One day Mrs. USMBTRT was in her psychology class and her professor told the class they were going to have a discussion about attitude. He took a glass beaker and filled it exactly halfway with coffee from his coffee mug. When he reached 50% as well as he could, he picked up the glass, held it way up for the whole class to see and said, ""ok, what is this?""

Being a class full of psych majors, most people knew where this was going and started calling out, ""half full!"" or ""half empty!"" There was some chatter in the back about the technicalities if he filled the glass versus poured something out.

The professor interrupted and said, ""this isn't about optimism or pessimism. This is a glass full of stress. If I hold it here for just a moment (his arm was fully extended), it weighs next to nothing. The longer I hold it, the heavier it gets. Eventually, this little glass of stress is going to feel so heavy that I won't be able to lift it any more. The longer I hold it, the more it hurts. me.""

-----

I decided to post this here because some of the stories in this sub make me feel sad for the people going through so many roadblocks trying to plan their wedding. When something undesirable happens, take a breath, put the glass down, and shake it off. You'll feel so much better.

Until this past week, his dad did not know I existed. I should also add that we're a gay couple.

Due to Circumstances, his mom told his dad, and his dad called him late one night as we were eating dinner. The dad explained, in a surprisingly calm voice, that he wanted nothing to do with his son anymore, that my fiance wasn't his son anymore, that he was not welcome back home, that he was never to call or talk to his family again. He noted that if my fiance's sister attends the wedding, the dad will cut her off financially (she's still in school). And then he hung up.

Similarly, my dad will not be attending the wedding, choosing to stand on some moral high ground. He will not visit our apartment, and while he still talks to me, the mere mention of a wedding will cause him to shut down and hang up the phone.

We're dealing. These are experiences we knew we'd have to go through, and while prior knowledge doesn't fix the dilemma, it makes getting over it a little easier. We're figuring out contingencies for if his dad shows up drunk and angry with a weapon, or if my dad ultimately gets dragged by my mom and then makes a scene or condemns us to an eternity in hell.  And we're figuring out whether or not we want to include their names in our program, etc.

My goal is not a pity party (although a bit of anonymous venting is always nice) but to give a lot of wedditors a flip side of the coin. Be glad that your mother-in-law is giving you grief about the guest list. Love the drama your parents are causing about having a late wedding. Get into a fight with everyone in the family about whether there should be alcohol. When your parents tell you that their 5-year old nieces and nephews have to come, remember that they aren't calling you an abomination that will corrupt their children.

In short, wedditors, take a moment to just embrace the fact that your parents love you enough to give you a ton of shit about your wedding. It may not seem like it, but it's pretty awesome.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,2months,True,t3_11j847,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/11j847/a_sanity_check/,

Here's my three pieces of advice.,73,11,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1boi8v/i_did_it_heres_my_three_pieces_of_advice/,"First of all, like many of you, I was thinking ""why didn't I elope?"" but had a very real desire for my close friends and family to be there when I got hitched. 

We planned every detail ourselves, spent way more than we wanted to, and stressed way more than anyone should, but it all ended up amazing.

With that said, here is what we learned. 

1. **Set a budget first.** It was awkward, but if you are expecting close family to chip in, talk to them about it FIRST! It will be less awkward than having to ask them later. If you are expecting a few contributions from other guests (like a donation fund for honeymoon etc), don't count on it at all. 

2. If you're like us, we took care of all the planning ourselves, including the contracts. Do yourself a favor and make sure that every single one of your vendors knows that you do not exist to them on your wedding day/weekend. That is, **give them a trusted contact that will take care of all day-of communication**. I actually had a vendor come up to me to discuss the terms of our contract **during the event.** This caused me undue stress during an otherwise stressful time, and had I given him a contact he could have talked business all he wanted and I could have been saved the stress.

3. **Go on a honeymoon immediately.** Due to our budget, we had not really planned a honeymoon immediately afterwards. But we were extremely fortunate to be given a couple nights in a hotel room, and I cannot emphasize enough how vital it was. It doesn't have to be fancy, one or two nights in the Hampton Inn by the interstate could do the job. My point is it's not about luxury, it's about decompressing with your spouse. Watch TV. Read. Go to a restaurant. I found what we did 90% of the time was talk to each other about our little stories about the wedding weekend, and reminisce on what will become the best memories of our life. 

 **EDIT:** But can't you do this at home? Yes and no. When we got home, we immediately got into ""back to normal mode,"" which is necessary but should be put off a couple of days in my opinion. Go somewhere where there is no laundry, no meals to be cooked, no garbage to take out etc.

That's all I have to offer, there is certainly a lot of other advice to consider, but in the end just relax and let it all happen. None of the bad stuff will seem bad next week, and all of the good stuff will be too easily forgotten.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1365105079.0,,married,True,t3_1boi8v,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1boi8v/i_did_it_heres_my_three_pieces_of_advice/,

It's all about this one stupid thing people keep telling me. This phrase is *killing* me, guys. It's not constructive and it's totally ridiculous and I am so tired of hearing it. I wish I could outlaw it. I'm sick of hearing, ""It's *your* day, do what you want!""

It seems like whenever *any* issue related to weddings comes up, someone says this to me. I've heard it from vendors, from friends, from relatives--I don't know why the world is suddenly acting like it's okay--no, expected--for me to ""get my way"" and ""do what I want."" I feel like when people tell me, ""It's YOUR day!! You should do it the way YOU want to!"" there is some kind of expectation that I'm going to throw a fit if I don't do what I want. I'm not a little kid--I understand that things cost money, that certain things aren't possible, that there are things called budgets and families that make things more difficult. I feel like when people tell me that I should do what I want because it's MY day, they discount my ability to act as a rational adult. If part of being a rational adult is being able to throw an event that is enjoyable for not only you but your guests as well while still keeping within a budget...well, I can do that, damnit, and I don't need permission to act like a diva in order to get that done. 

It also seems to happen a lot online, and I feel like it's quickly becoming the least helpful response ever. Someone asks an etiquette question or about a tricky situation with a MOB or whether it's okay to do xyz and invariably someone ensures them that they can do whatever they want, because it's their wedding!!! Not only is that not true, but it's also really not helpful. Yes, it is your wedding, and you should strive to throw a wedding that is what you want. But as all of us know, there are a million little considerations that go into throwing a wedding--if I was really just doing whatever I wanted, it would be damned inconvenient for everyone else, which is definitely not okay. I honestly can't think of anyone who hasn't had to make some compromises in wedding planning--why pretend otherwise? 

So, yeah. I feel like this one little phrase is driving me kind of crazy. I'm glad we've gotten to the point, as a society, where we aren't expected or forced to throw certain types of weddings. But I also feel like pretending that the only thing that matters is what I want is ridiculous.

I first learned of them from Offbeat Bride's [article](http://offbeatbride.com/2011/06/unplugged-wedding). An unplugged wedding is one where only the paid photographer takes pictures, and guests set aside their phones/cameras/iPads and just ENJOY the ceremony without having to snap a ton of photos. Or, if you want another angle, it's so that guests don't get in the pro's way and ruin beautiful shots. I am going to be doing this for my ceremony and posed pictures afterwards, but the reception will be free game. I wanted to let you other brides know about this, because I think it is underutilized and not well-known. 

[Here](http://shangchenphoto.com/weddings/say-yes-to-an-unplugged-wedding-ceremony/) is a professional photographer's website with examples of unplugged weddings vs a typical wedding. 

[Another](http://www.shireenlouw.com/2013/04/guests-ruin-wedding-photos/) and [another](http://robinwoodphoto.com/encouraging-an-unplugged-wedding-austi-wedding-photographer/). You can find so many websites where the pros talk about how much they love this idea. I asked my photographer what he thought of them, and he had never heard of them - though he was completely on board with the idea! He said he had been yelled at, pushed, and cursed at because he got in the way of a family member's shot. That's not gonna fly for me. 

A lot of people have mixed feelings about this, since you're depriving guests of their ability to preserve a moment, and everyone wants their specific shots. But I'm convinced that their momentary irritation will be worth it for photos that are not ruined by someone's arm, butt, or camera blocking the shot. Plus, how embarrassed would that guest be when they realize they got in the way of the pro for a shot of lower quality? I'm having my photographer leave cards with access to the online gallery for everyone to take with them. I'm also putting in a bit on my wedding website, and having my officiant make an announcement about the ceremony being unplugged so that people don't forget. I plan on using word of mouth as well.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,3months,True,t3_1dts1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1dts1v/a_bit_of_info_about_unplugged_weddings/,
1361033578.0,61,self.weddingplanning,18n5vp,I am a graphic designer at a print shop who keeps seeing the same design/printing mistakes being made by DIY brides.  I'd like to help you out! AMA,68,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/18n5vp/i_am_a_graphic_designer_at_a_print_shop_who_keeps/,"I have worked with a lot of DIY brides with their wedding printing.  I've designed and printed just about anything printed for weddings; save the dates, invitations, RSVPS, envelopes, programs, menus, placecards, thank you notes, wedding schedules, napkins, bridal shower and bachelorette invites, etc. I've done it all!

What I have run into, and want to address, is the creative bride that is a non-designer, who doesn't know a lot about printing processes or setting things up to print. I want to help you save money and a lot of stress by giving you some tips on designing/printing.


* First, **TALK TO YOUR PRINTER OR DESIGNER BEFORE BUYING ANY PAPER OR WORKING ON ANYTHING**. I cannot stress this enough. 
Let me share some stories with you to explain.

    -Some of those wedding invitation packages you can buy at Michaels or JoAnns have vellum paper in them - which is okay to run on your home printer, but if you put it into a some commercial printers, IT WILL MELT.  I once made a bride cry when I told her that I couldn't run her invites because (1) the pre-cut paper was too small and (2) it was fragile tissue-vellum. 

    -Another bride came into my shop with an example of what she wanted (black ink on a shimmery ivory cardstock) and asked for some quotes on digital printing.  I loved her for it because she knew exactly what she wanted and even had an example.  I quoted her on supplied paper, design, and ink and she said she would be back.  The next week, she returned with BLACK paper -she had impulsively changed her mind at a paper store- and asked if I could print on it.  I told her I could, but the printing cost would change because it would have to run it through an ink-press vs. digital printer.  The quote ended up being WAY out of her budget and she could not return the paper she bought. She was definitely upset with no one but herself.


* Be early.  If you want to send out your invitations in September, go talk to your designer/printer in the July/August.  Wedding printing sometimes takes some time with the designing/production...you have to allow some freedom if your printer is busy with other projects.
Furthermore, don't come in the week of your wedding and ask if they can rush and print your programs for you - especially if they are an odd size and require folding or perforating. I assure you, your designer/printer will not be very happy with you.


* Be organized.  Bring in examples of what you want.  Measure the sizes of the finished project.  Bring it your dress swatches from David's Bridal. Figure out how many invites you need.  This is one time where you will be admired and thanked for being an assertive Bridezilla.  


* If you want to DIY but don't know how to design, just shell out some money and have a professional do it.  I mean, you pay a professionally-schooled hairstylist to cut your hair, why wouldn't you pay a professional graphic designer to help you make your custom wedding invitations?  If you bring examples of what you like to your designer, and be very specific of what you like, there shouldn't be any problem for them to recreate it exactly how you like it. And it really isn't that expensive...a lot of places would charge between $25-$50 for design.


* Regarding etiquette and wording on your invites: it's totally up to you how you want to word it.  There's no right or wrong way to word invites anymore...I've worked with formal invites and very non-traditional brides. If it is really important to you, read up on some Emily Post.


Um, so this might have turned into a bit of a rant, but I honestly LOVE working on weddings.  I just hate seeing brides all stressed out about something that could have easily been resolved if a little planning had gone into it.

So, AMA...you can ask me about the Bridezillas/Momzilas/Groomzillas I've worked with or just any questions about wedding design/printing you want!",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1361119815.0,,,True,t3_18n5vp,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/18n5vp/i_am_a_graphic_designer_at_a_print_shop_who_keeps/,

I proposed to my fiancé a couple months ago, and have since taken the reins in regards to planning our wedding. He's giving me input when needed, and is giving me some good feedback when I run things by him, but he's essentially thrown his hands in the air and flailed, proclaiming ""I don't know how to do this planning stuff!"" So he's leaving it up to me to do most of the legwork.

Seeing as how I've never done any of this planning stuff either, I'm diving into every wedding-planning resource I can find, Googling like a mofo and sifting through blogs and articles for guides, suggestions, examples, etc. Things have been generally pretty helpful, but guaranteed, 99% of the time, these websites are directly addressing you, the reader, under the assumption that you are the bride. Talk of dresses, bridesmaids, shoes, jewelry, beauty regimens, hairstyles, and a surprising number of digs at the men involved in the wedding as simple monkeys who know nothing about what is going on.

Oh, by the way... Did I mention there are *no brides* in our wedding?

We're a gay couple. We exist, and we do get married. In addition, even if it wasn't the case of a gay couple, what if it was the groom who was doing a majority of the planning in a heterosexual wedding? 

The dearth of resources for the organizing gent is a little surprising and disappointing. Thus far, I've found exactly one site dedicated to the masculine participants in wedding planning and festivities, [The Plunge](http://www.theplunge.com), and half its articles are fluff ""Women, Am I Right?"" pieces, or proclaiming how much planning weddings *like, totally sucks, bro*.

Does anyone know of any decent resources for the guys?",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1353707054.0,,lessthanamonth,True,t3_13onqn,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/13onqn/frustrated_at_how_bridecentric_wedding_planning/,

1366290737.0,58,self.weddingplanning,1clq9f,My experience with David's Bridal,62,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1clq9f/my_experience_with_davids_bridal/,"Over the past month or so, I've seen an influx of posts about David's Bridal ruining dresses or being downright rude to brides. When these posts surfaced, my dress was actually at David's for alterations. I was sick to my stomach and wondering if I made the worst decision to first, buy a dress from David's Bridal and second, get it altered there too. I had my final fitting yesterday and I have to say that this wedding dress experience has been nothing but positive! I'll share my story so that hopefully other brides won't shy away from what might be a great experience for them as well.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm a plus-sized bride who has lost 35lbs since buying my dress in December (going down from an 18W to probably a 14W). I live about 9 hours from where I bought the dress, so I've actually had an experience with two different David's Bridals in two different countries.

Just days after we got engaged last March, I set up my wedding Pinterest board and started browsing David's website. I came across [the](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_Chiffon-Soft-A-Line-Gown-with-Side-Drape-9WG3078_Bridal-Gowns-Shop-By-Size-Plus-Sizes) dress. As a plus-sized girl, I wanted something figure flattering. I'm not ultra-feminine so I was looking for something less blingy, but not plain. I didn't know anything about our wedding plans yet, but as it turns out, I would need something light and flowy for our destination wedding. This dress was everything I was looking for.

Fast forward to December, when I made an appointment at the Port Huron, MI, David's Bridal. I put off my dress shopping for as long as possible because of my body issues, and also because I live 9 hours away from my mom and MOH. I came prepared with five wedding dress choices loaded on my iPad, which I think really helped and sped up the process since I was aware of what they had and what I wanted to try. My consultant, Sam, was so helpful and made me feel beautiful and worthy throughout the whole process. What I didn't like about David's though, is that they have no mirrors in the changeroom, so I had to come out of the changeroom every time in less than flattering dresses.

Dress after dress came out and nothing was working. Where was my #1 dress? It turns out they don't have my dress in my sample size. Instead, I am put in a similar silhouette and my consultant holds up the size 8 sample in front of me so I can see what it looks like. Not ideal, but I put off dress shopping for so long and I was already in love and had my mind set. We order the dress that day. My consultant assured me that if I didn't like the dress, that she would work with me to find something else I loved. I took comfort in that, but still felt like I was taking the biggest risk in my life. 

Two weeks later, it arrives at the Port Huron location. I made the trek home with a sense of dread. What if the dress looks horrible on me? What if I hate it? What if it doesn't live up to expectations? Let me tell you, it was worth the gamble. The dress was so flattering, so perfect, and so me. I got tears out of my usually stoic mother!

David's Bridal in Port Huron, MI, was nothing but supportive throughout the whole process. I can't speak highly of them enough!

I felt trepidation about getting my dress altered at the Ottawa, ON, location. It was newer, Canadian, and unfamiliar to me. I haven't lived here long, so I don't know much about seamstresses around the area, so I thought that David's was my best option.

I had my first alterations appointment on March 5, and at this point I lost around 25lbs. I think I had a junior seamstress since all she did was pin the sides at my chest and didn't touch the rest of my body at all besides the bustle. But what did I know, maybe that's all I needed? That appointment wasn't so great, but I kept positive.

Last Friday, April 12, was my second fitting. I dropped 10 more lbs and lost about an inch in my chest, waist, and hips since March 5. Oops! The dress was noticeably loose and I started to hate the way it made my body look. I had a more experienced seamstress pin the dress, and then I could see my body emerge! I looked fantastic in the dress and it accentuated all my hard work. She scheduled my final fitting for yesterday (April 17) and I was very impressed with the quick turnaround.

I went in yesterday and oh my god, the dress was perfect! I can't get over how great it looks and how great I look in it. There were no stains or rips anywhere to be found. [Here's me in my dress](http://i.imgur.com/bk1ZWrA.jpg). It's bustled so you don't get the full effect, but I'll be sure to post wedding photos next month! It's also on an angle since I went to the appointment solo.

The dress cost $449+tax USD and alterations cost $168+tax CAD.

Reading that we needed to apply the Groupon first, we started over on my machine, but never closed out on fiance's.

At the end of everything, Vistaprint told me that my order was $220, and that I was going to save $100 with my Groupon.

Except that *exact same order* without the Groupon was $116 on my fiance's screen. Vistaprint saw the Groupon and jacked up the price accordingly.

We're asking for a refund from Groupon. But in short, *be very careful.*

EDIT: Looks like a number of people are having success, particularly with the $17 for $70 Groupon. It's definitely worth trying if you bought the Groupon, and I don't want to discourage people from using it.

We got engaged 9/25/11. We said 2 years so I set the date 9/27/13. I saw my gown in a magazine ad while awaiting our plane home from our trip to Disney (where he proposed). I found the Rapunzel gown and was devastated because I HATED it. I decided before completely writing it off I'd try it on. A few weeks later [I did](http://i.imgur.com/BI0TEky.jpg). And I LOVED IT.
 
I had lost some significant weight the year before and was around 145, 150 lbs in that photo. I bought my gown in November of 2011 and by December 2011 it was in and the long wait set it. I got switched from night shift to day shift last April and promptly put ALL the weight back on. 

January of this year I was in Texas for work and staying with my fiance's sisters. We went shopping for my veil to match my gown. They put me in a size bigger than I ordered and [this](http://i.imgur.com/oikphzr.jpg) is what that [looked like](http://i.imgur.com/f0CiBjo.jpg). I'm about 180 lbs there. I'm not saying that it's the end of the world but I worked really hard to lose the weight and I was mad with myself for putting it all back on so quickly. I've never had to worry about my weight for most of my life, but as I got older my metabolism dropped to the floor. I wasn't used to eating a certain way so it was a very big mountain for me to climb. I got my ass into high gear. I didn't lose ALL of the weight I put on but I dropped about half of it. I went to my first fitting on July 18th and my dress wouldn't close. I was still too big for it. They were going to have to let it out on the sides. This was what I was fearing. 

On the car ride home (Connecticut to New York state) my mother reminded me that I had the undergarments on this time, I had muscle mass because I was working out. I just got back from my second fitting and I am so proud of myself. They laced me up and I looked in the mirror and I look [fierce](http://i.imgur.com/Iw1zpK1.jpg]. Am I back down to 135, 140? No! But I don't need to be. I'm loving me now. I'm comfortable in my skin. My fiance loves me no matter what. I feel beautiful and I feel like a [bride](http://i.imgur.com/GD0ntiH.jpg). Sorry for the last one, my mom was getting nervous with the digital camera. 

TL;DR: This wedding planning process has made me look at myself in a whole new light. I'm no longer worrying about ""one more pound"". I smiled at myself in the mirror for the first time in over a year. Give yourselves a break ladies and drink in all that is you. This is your moment. Own it.

But some post-wedding advice for you ladies... :),63,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1c5cma/omg_got_married_last_month_and_just_found_this/,"I got married March 9 to my most amazing husband but I've been a redditor for over a year and never even heard of this place til today! Good luck and best wishes.

Some tips - 

Relax and breathe. Realize things will get forgotten. We wanted to put out dry erase boards for our photo booth. I bought them and it was only upon arriving at the venue that I realize I forgot them completely. Afterwards, all of the photo booth pictures are still hilarious! So who cares? That being said, if you are worried you will forget it - go overboard. Lists, reminders, phone alarms, strings around your fingers. My grandmother was pretty upset that I forgot the mailbox for notes and cards, but that was mainly because she's high society Southern so she was just worried I missed out on money.

You can get mad later. There are things that are going to bug you, but this is the only wedding day you'll ever get. Your cousin said something shitty to you. Smile and brush it off, enjoy your wedding. Then if it's still bothering you, call her in a few days or when you get back from the honeymoon and give her what-for.

Make sure your photographer and all the vendors know exactly what you want and where it needs to be! I failed to put a few must-have photos on the must-have photo list, and in all of the craziness, they didn't get taken. That was my fault, but I'm married to my best friend, so I'll be okay. It does you no good to give your coordinator a blank chalkboard and tell them NOTHING about what you want them to do with it.

Be sure to ask most of your guests for their cell phone pics individually because for some reason, they don't just send them to your or immediately post them to Facebook.

If you can afford it, hire a videographer! I lost my job before the wedding and that was the one thing I was going to pay for myself, as my parents were giving me the entire wedding as a gift following my layoff. They assured me my Aunt would videotape it all, which she did, except the camera had some sort of malfunction and won't actually, you know, play the tape. Deep down, part of me WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF for not making official arrangements.

Lastly, be sure to make sure EVERYONE who helped out gets a thank you. My best friend from childhood and I had a falling out and while she was not a bridesmaid, she was still invited to my wedding. You don't just shake off 13 years of friendship. She ended up getting there a bit late, to where you have to sit in the lobby and wait until the processional ends. Well, so my dad and I walk out there and I just see here and we both start kind of happy-crying. She says ""you look so pretty!"" And my coordinator asked her to get on the other side of the door. My best friend for almost half my life got to open the door for me to see my husband for the first time. I could have been snarky, but I loved our friendship and even included her in my thank yous later that night. I got my best friend back.

Anything can happen! Enjoy the ride, because ultimately, it's only six hours and be sure to savor every second and just soak it all in!",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,t3_1c5cma,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1c5cma/omg_got_married_last_month_and_just_found_this/,

1368857966.0,47,self.weddingplanning,1ekdfp,"PSA - Remember the awesome review I gave of the Wonderxue dress I got from Etsy? Yeah, I had to buy another dress a couple days ago.",59,12,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1ekdfp/psa_remember_the_awesome_review_i_gave_of_the/,"So I felt compelled to tell everyone here about this, because I wrote a raving [review](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1bs6mx/i_ordered_my_dress_from_wonderxue_a_seamstress/) not long ago about the dress that I ordered from Wonderxue, a seamstress from China that sells on Etsy. The dress is gorgeous, there is no doubt about that. Just by looking at it, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between it and the Justin Alexander dress it was made to imitate (even the ladies at different bridal boutiques said the same). 

However! About a week ago, I took the dress to my seamstress because it definitely needed alterations. It was way too big on the top, and needed to be taken in at the waist. The entire time I just kept thinking ""No big deal, just some simple alterations needed"". The minute the seamstress (an extremely experienced lady who has been doing wedding dress alterations for over 15 years) saw it, she had a look of disgust on her face. ""Where did you get this dress?"" she said, and I sheepishly replied ""A seamstress from China"". She knew it, she tore the dress apart. Even though from looking at it any normal person would think it was amazing quality, from a seamstresses perspective it was far from it. When I tried it on, I hadn't even tried to sit down in it - she prompted me to do that and I seriously couldn't even sit down without it feeling like it was going to bust at the seams. Why was I so stupid? It looked so gorgeous, even very well made, but I felt duped. 

She said that when she normally charges $100-$200 for alterations, this would be $600 minimum to make it look ""decent"" on me. She said that she would have to completely reconstruct the dress, and that with the poor quality of the materials used to make the dress, it would be very difficult. She said, ""I don't want to be the person to tell you this, but you need to get another dress. I can make you look decent, but you will never look stunning. You deserve to look stunning."" I was so crushed, you have no idea. I felt sick. 

So I had to rush around and after two days of going around to countless stores, I bought a sample dress for double the price I paid for the Wonderxue dress. I am currently trying to get a refund for the dress I bought from her, but I doubt she will give me my money back. Her response was that it had been too long (43 days, I get that) and that initially I said that it fit fine, just big in the top. I explained that I had no idea the work that needed to be done to make it fit normally, as I am not a seamstress, and I thought it would be easy to remedy. 

This whole thing has been a nightmare from beginning to end really. I am so disappointed that I had faith in a dress I had never tried on. I don't know why I would put such an important purchase in the hands of someone I had never met. I'm sorry if my first post persuaded anyone to buy a dress from her, and if you did, I hope it works out way better than my experience. I feel so terrible about everything. 

The only upside to this situation is that I found the dress of my dreams. I am thrilled with it. I am just crossing my fingers that Wonderxue will refund the dress that they made me. If not, I guess its a cost I will have to eat and I have definitely learned my lesson. I don't want anyone else to make that mistake! I seeked out Wonderxue to remake a dress that I fell in love with in a boutique, but was out of my budget. Instead of trying to replicate that, I should have just kept looking for a dress that would fit into my budget and still make me feel beautiful. There is a reason that first dress that started it all, the Justin Alexander, cost what it did. Again I am sorry everyone, just waned to put this all out there so that you can do with the information what you wish!

I know I tempted fate and this could have been avoided, but I ended up giving David's Bridal the benefit of the doubt and have thus far been reminded why I shouldn't have.

I bought a wedding dress from a DB down in Florida, where my family is. I had only gone with the intention of having the 'trying on dresses experience' with my mom and didn't plan on finding a dress. BUT, the sales lady was super amazing and pulled something for me to try and I ended up loving it. I know they work on commission, and it just didn't feel right giving someone in PA (where I live) the bonus, when this lady single handedly found this great dress for me and was so awesome. So I bought it in Florida, and they said they'd call when it came in and ship it to me.

Well, the estimated arrival date comes and goes. I call the DB and surprise, my dress had come in and no one called. They say they will ship it ASAP and I'll get it within a week. A week comes and goes. I call again... *they don't know where my dress is*. The computer says it was prepped for shipping but never went, and the gal helping me on the phone can't confirm if it is even still in the store. A manager will call me tomorrow she says.

Tomorrow comes and goes. No call. I call them again. The dress is still there and was just never shipped, she says. They were out of UPS boxes to ship it properly. For an entire week. They have promised to call me tomorrow with a tracking number. I'm holding my breath.

In the meantime, my local DB orders the wrong color dress for one of the bridesmaids.

First, go to the picture. Right click it and click whatever version your browser has of ""Copy Image URL"" (could be things like ""Copy image address,"" etc.)

Next, open google images. Click the little camera in the search bar and paste the image URL in the new little box that pops up. Hit enter.

And here are some thoughts/hopefully helpful hints on their creation:

All of the paper I procured at [Paper Presentation](http://www.paperpresentation.com/). I spent a while comparing prices here, and other places (including paper source) and I found that their prices were more reasonable, and they have a truly insane array of color choices. Everything in our suite is 100% cotton. 

The stamps for our address, our monogram, and our website are from [Simon Stamp](http://www.simonstamp.com). Again, I shopped around a while and their prices, turnaround time, and the ease of their online stamp maker thing was unbelievable. Each of our stamps was around $7.00.

The bakers twine I got from [Whisker Graphics](http://whiskergraphics.com/). They were having a sale at the time, so they turned out to be cheaper, though I suggest hunting around as it seems baker's twine is invariably overpriced. Whisker graphics also has some very cute paper bags, some of which I purchased, but didn't end up using.

---------

Everything was hand lettered/illustrated by me (I used gouache and various artists inks), then scanned, and cleaned up/assembled in photoshop. 

One thing I figured out early on was to work at a much larger scale (at least for the handwriting) and then make it smaller in photoshop, as it gives you more room for error. To give you an idea, each line of text on the invitation was actually about 1"" tall by 8"" wide. 

The designing/illustrating process alone was very time consuming. I'm sure I spent at least 100 hours on that alone, but as both art and paper goods are something I very much enjoy, it did not feel like a chore at all. I think this is key for any crafts/DIY elements you might undertake for your wedding. If it's a craft you HAVE to do, to save money or what not, make sure to do it as cheaply, stress-free, and honestly as lazily as possible while still striving for a quality product. I would probably have DIYed my invites even if I wasn't so fond of paper and such, but if that were the case they would have been much simpler and less time consuming. Did we need a wedding map with ~~my favorite~~ the only coffee shop in town? Certainly not, but I really wanted to make said map, so I did. 

-----
 If you're undertaking a large invitation suite, I think a spreadsheet is key. I made one that had each individual piece (field guide cover, field guide interior, etc.) listed with the paper color, dimensions, where the paper was coming from, how much I spent, etc. Having the paper color and dimensions was key though. Listing the paper colors helped me figure our color balance, and the dimensions let us know how much of everything we needed/how we could print the most things on the fewest sheets of paper. 

ALWAYS order extra. At the time of ordering, I thought I needed 29 invitation envelopes. The envelopes came in packs of 10. I decided that having 11 extras was much better than having 1 extra. I was definitely right :P

Finally, if you're DIYing. EXPECT things to go terribly wrong and take longer than expected, especially when it comes to assembling things. We only had 26 sets of these to assemble in the end (though we did assemble extras), and I would say each thing took us an entire night to do. For instance one night we did all the stamping of envelopes and luggage tags, the next night we glued invitations together, etc.

The thing that went the most terribly wrong for us, is that when all was said and done, our suite (even though everything was the correct dimensions) with the belly bands on, was too big to fit in the envelopes I ordered. After some deliberation, and attempted fixes, we decided to make our own envelopes, and in the end I actually like them better!

Finally, HAVE FUN! Even though the work of assembling them was a pain, the time I had watching anime with my fiancé while gluing things to other things and folding (so much folding) everything, was the most fun I've had working on our wedding so far. I really felt like I could see our marriage in the works, if that makes sense.

And here's the relevant letter in case the link doesn't work, emphasis is mine.


 "" I am 27 years old and engaged to an amazing guy. When I was a little girl, my dad was involved in a really bad accident and was burned over a large portion of his body. He lost part of one limb and has some serious disfigurement. He has been a great dad and I never think about it. A few weeks ago, my fiancé started acting strange when we talked about the wedding. I asked him what was up and he avoided the question. **Then his mom called me out of the blue and told me that she didn't think that my dad should come to the wedding. She thinks that he will upset the guests and ""traumatize"" any children who might be there.** She is suggesting that we have a private family ceremony before the big blowout. I got upset and my mom asked why. When I told her, she said that she and my dad understand, which only makes me feel worse. Maybe my future MIL has a point, but I would really rather disinvite HER than my dad.""


Holy *crap* what a horrendous person. Reading this has put my future MIL problems way into perspective. Is she nosey and obnoxious at times? Hell yes. Would she ever even *think* of excluding any of my family because they don't look normal?  **Hell no**. 


Has anyone else dealt with future in-laws attempting to exclude your family or friends?

I've been shooting weddings for 7 years and I own my business, which I run with the help of my husband. I meet with brides constantly and it seems that there's a ton of misinformation where photography is concerned in the wedding world. I'd love to help answer your questions and address any concerns you might have! 

For the sake of not wanting this to seem like a self-promotional post or an advertisement (and for privacy's sake in the case that I need to answer specific questions about my experiences), I'd rather keep my business name private. But I'd be happy to provide proof that I'm legit to the mods if needed. In a world where anyone can buy a camera and call themselves a photographer, I understand the need to know who you're talking to.

Happy planning! Ask away!

Edit: I've had a request for some FAQs so you have an idea of the basics -

* *Do you shoot film or digital?*

Digital! Although, I love film and I break out my film cameras and Polaroids occasionally for fun. 


* *What did you study in school?*

Studio Art with a concentration in Photography


* *How many weddings do you shoot per year?*

Between 20 - 25, usually


* *Do you recommend using two photographers (a lead and an assistant, or second-shooter) at my wedding?*

YES. I personally never shoot alone, because I love having a second pair of eyes and a different perspective. Not to mention, the security of having a pair of helping hands with me all day. If your photographer charges extra for a second-shooter and you can afford it, do it. That being said, make sure that the photographer you're hiring is also more than capable of shooting alone. 


* *Do you include a disc of images, USB drive, or image download with your packages?*

Yes. Each package includes access to all professionally edited wedding images with personal rights to the images.


* *Do you suggest having an engagement session done?*

Yes. It's a great way to get to know your photographer, and for them to get to know the two of you as a couple. It makes the wedding day photos flow MUCH more smoothly.


* *What questions should I make sure to ask when interviewing photographers?*

Are they insured? Do they have backup equipment? What EXACTLY is included in your package (meaning, the end result. what will you end up with? A disc, a download? All images edited or just some of the best)? How many weddings have they shot? Can they provide references or reviews? And always ask to see at least one wedding from start to finish. Photographers can easily show the best 25 images on their website, but it takes seeing a FULL wedding to really get an idea of their style.

I'll add more as I think of them!

***Edit: Thank you all so much - this was awesome! I will check back periodically to see if there are new questions posted, but feel free to send me messages if you want! And thanks to the few other photographers who shared their input as well... it's always great to connect with new photo friends :)***",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1367697909.0,,,True,t3_1dmrna,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1dmrna/im_a_professional_wedding_photographer_and_im/,
1365225142.0,46,self.weddingplanning,1bs6mx,"I ordered my dress from Wonderxue, a seamstress from China, via etsy. It arrived today. Here is my experience!",58,12,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1bs6mx/i_ordered_my_dress_from_wonderxue_a_seamstress/,"So in a thread a while back, someone had asked if anyone had ever bought a dress online or via etsy, particularly the seller [""wonderxue""](http://www.etsy.com/shop/wonderxue?ref=shop_sugg). I did, and I am SO happy. Here's how it all went down.

Back in January I had started looking for my dress. I ended up trying on #8641 by Justin Alexander and fell in love with it, but not so much the price tag. It was about $1800, not including the sash or veil. I was so bummed, as my entire wedding alone is only going to cost around $6000. There was NO way I was going to spend almost a third of my budget on the dress. No way. So I started looking at alternate options and found the shop called ""wonderxue"" on etsy.

I sent a message to the owner of the shop, Yuan Chen, and asked her if she could make the dress. She does a lot of custom work and remakes of designer dresses, and she said it would be no problem. I went to a local alterations place and had my measurements professionally done, sent those to Yuan and paid for the dress. It cost $490 + $35 shipping. I also bought a mantilla veil from her for $30 that she shipped with the dress.

There were a few hiccups along the way. For example, she had said initially that the dress would be here mid-March. I think she got slammed with orders because her shop announcement at the top of her etsy page was being updated almost daily - explaining that she was unable to respond to e-mails in a timely fashion and that she was working around the clock to finish orders. She said that it being prom and wedding season, she was basically working non-stop. So communication somewhat slowed down to a scary pace. I would go a few days/almost a week without hearing anything when initially she responded immediately. She had initially said that she would send ""progress pictures"" throughout the construction process to let me know how things were going. This never happened, so naturally I started worrying, second guessing myself and quite frankly, freaking the fuck out. I was scared that my dress wouldn't come in time for alterations (I just had a baby, so my body is still fluctuating quite a bit). Then last weekend she sent me pictures of the finished product and said she would mail it this past Monday. It came TODAY! I was blown away that it got here from China in less than a week, and all in one piece.

Let me just say that the four month wait, the stress, the freaking out and worrying was 100% worth it. The dress is amazing. The quality is impeccable, and it fits like a glove (except in my boob area, but I'll get that altered soon). I am seriously amazed that I paid 1/4 of the price for this dress that looks like the same thing I tried on in the designer boutique. It feels GREAT, and the materials she used are beautiful. I really don't know if I would be able to tell the difference between this dress and the designer version if the two were held up together. They both fit the same, feel the same, etc. I would do this all over again in a heartbeat. 

My only suggestion for any of those thinking about doing this is to not wait until the last minute. Yuan is getting a lot of negative feedback lately from pissed off customers who didn't get their dress in time, but I don't think its fair. She is in China, making amazing dresses for rock bottom prices and she is busy as hell. Her work is in high demand for those reasons and if you budget enough time to not only be patient and allow her to complete and ship the dress, but to get any necessary alterations done once you get it , it is well worth it to go this route. 

I put together this [album](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZL0Go/new) of pictures for you guys so you can see the original and her remake of the dress.

I searched and searched for the perfect wedding photographer, and after weeks I finally found one that we loved in our budget. I couldn't wait to work with her, especially after stalking all her other wedding and engagement photo shoots on Facebook.

I made a hair appointment for a cut and style for a few hours before, because I wanted my hair to look nice. The girl who usually cuts my hair at the salon wasn't available, but it's a great salon so I just chose another stylist and didn't think twice about it. 

THAT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE. When I got there, I had to wait twenty minutes because she was running late. I booked my appointment with plenty of time to get ready afterward, so I just shrugged it off. I've been growing my hair out for the wedding, and once I sat down with her, I told her I wanted her to cut off as little hair as possible (I've been growing it for over two years, I used to have a pixie cut). SHE CUT OFF ALMOST 3"". By the time I realized she was cutting off too much, it was too late. To make matters worse, when she styled it, she used a huge curling iron and it looked like I was going to prom or something. I came home from the salon in tears, and had to re-wash my hair and do it myself.

Later, we were waiting for the photographer to arrive (we got our pictures taken on my University campus, in the library and outside) and she got lost and parked on the wrong side of campus. We had to walk all over campus looking for her, wasting a good half-hour of light and time in the library. I was in heels, and we were both carrying lots of stuff for the shoot. It's a really confusing campus if you aren't familiar with it, and I should have given her more specific directions on where to park and how to get to the library. By the time we found each other, FH and I were sweaty, my heels were killing my feet, and we only had an hour to work with until the library closed. Between that and my hair, I was beyond upset.

But then we started taking pictures, and everything worked out great - the sun was coming in at just the right angle through the windows in the library, and we got tons of great shots in there before we moved outside to catch the last of the light. The photographer was a dream to work with. She knew exactly what to do and where to go to get the best shots. She brought the pictures I had sent her and made sure we got every single shot I asked for.

A few hours after we got home, she posted a sneak peek on her Facebook page (she's so fast!)[ AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.](http://imgur.com/a/TbITP)

There were certain things we are absolutely NOT splurging on, but other things (like photo and video) that we absolutely ARE.  Needless to say, with our budget being so tight, we kinda...ran out of money for day-of coordination.  My sister-in-law to be is a florist, and a damn good one at that, but she's also a bridesmaid and I wanted her to be able to enjoy the day.  So essentially, I was looking for set-up/take down folks.

In the area I'm having my wedding, you literally can't find someone for less than 1800 for this type of thing, and the average is closer to 3k.  I was aghast and had all but accepted the fact that I might be setting up the flowers for my own wedding in my gown, which is a bit big and unwieldy but hey, I'm a big girl, I'll live.

In a hail mary moment, I decided to post an ad on Craigslist looking for a ""budding"" planner who wanted some gorgeous photos and vid for her portfolio.  Within hours I had an inbox full of requests from non-budding, actual-planners with massive portfolios for RIDICULOUSLY good prices. 

At the end of all this, I'm walking away with a coordinator for my rehearsal and wedding for $350.  I can't even believe I'm typing that.  I don't have to pay for her travel and lodging, and I get two girls for both days.  Her rationale for doing this was that she had never organized a wedding at our venue and really wanted to get our photographer and videographer's work in her portfolio.  I was SHOCKED that she was willing to discount it so deeply, particularly given her wonderful reviews online.

So uh, I highly encourage you guys to post a wanted ad if you feel like you're going to be paying too much for day-of.  Maybe this was a no brainer for a lot of you ladies but I couldn't BELIEVE the savings I got.

EDIT:  just wanted to add a detail to this, maybe it'll make your ad as successful as mine was. i put a link to my photog's website, as well as my videographer's website, in my ad.  i figured, might as prove that the ""budding"" coordinator is going to get some style-me-pretty caliber stuff out of the deal.  most wedding cinema makes me CRINGE so if there's an area i was spoiled about, this would be it.

(Wondering if anyone else has done this?),47,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1apf7b/i_finally_solved_my_wedding_problem_i_think/,"So after a long time of worrying about my wedding in the sense that I was worried about offending people by not inviting them because it is too expensive/ wanting to have a small wedding, this afternoon I had an epiphany. Most of the people that wanna come are people from old jobs etc, love them to death but they don't really know ryan etc. 

So this is my idea and I know its not original: Get married in the morning with both our families and small close group of friends. Have a wedding brunch (which is awesome because i LOVE breakfast food!) let everyone do what they wanna do for the rest of the day (my more straight laced relatives might go home at this point) while making ourselves available to hang out with whoever wants to. Picture taking... nap? 


Then after dinnerish, we rent out a room in a restaurant (our christmas party only cost 500~ with food!) and invite all of our friends to celebrate with us with apps and desserts. 

Has anyone ever done this? Was it cost effective? Did everyone enjoy it? Any hidden obstacles I am overlooking?

Here's what I learned (3 bonus pictures!),52,14,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1jrq38/finally_married_heres_what_i_learned_3_bonus/,"I am official a Mrs. now! The days I had been waiting for years for have come and gone, and I couldn't be happier. I must admit, I'm relieved because holy cow, the last month was ridiculous with all of the stuff that had to be taken care of, but I am even happier that I can say I have my husband. I learned some stuff that I'd like to pass along to you other weddit readers:

- Don't stress out. Seriously, just don't. My wedding was full of drama, but the whole time I just shrugged it off because I knew it'd get fixed. Some examples: 1. One bridesmaid and our musician formerly dated, musician was afraid her new boyfriend was going to beat him up or something, so he asked if someone else could play with him. Upside - 2 musicians for way cheaper than usual!! 2. Two months before the wedding, one bridesmaid applies for a job in another state, gets said job, and has to move and probably won't be able to come back for the wedding. Luckily, my niece was willing to step in, but we couldn't order her the right color dress. Since we did different styles and 2 different colors, it wasn't even noticeable that she was added last minute. 

- Use the [Wedding Party App](https://www.weddingpartyapp.com/) (or something similar). We have so many pictures that we will treasure that are from different perspectives other than the photographer. 

- Be comfortable with your photographer. We used the same photographer for engagement pictures (2 sessions), and I did a boudoir shoot with her. By the wedding day, she knew exactly what we were like, which kept it fun. 
 
- (My only [small] regret) Give yourself plenty of time, for both getting ready and the ceremony/reception. We had plenty of time for getting ready, but our ceremony started at 7pm to save us from the NM heat. That worked great for the weather, but it didn't give us near enough time to socialize with everyone at the wedding (it was about 185 people). 

- Breakaway bouquet!! It was so fun to see the shock on those ladies faces!

- Just have fun. By around 10:30, most of our older relatives headed out, and it came to be mostly young relatives and friends. We danced the night away and had a blast. 

All in all, keep your wedding about what it's truly about - love. We were surrounded by the love of our family and friends on our wedding day and I couldn't have asked for anything more. 

Bonus: my 3 favorite wedding pictures so far!

""Oh, I told -Work Friend- that he could come to the reception.""

What? Why.  Why would you do that.  Does Work Friend have a wife? Yes? Then you just invited two more people, not one. And now your mom is gonna get pissy because it's 'rude' to invite people to just the reception. (Side note, we're doing this  with a couple of my brother's 20 year old friends, but that's 'cause I'm paying them to set up the food). And not only his mom is worried about rudeness, he wants to have a completely open bar because ""just open beer, wine and soda isn't enough, it's just awful and people will  hate us."" 

He  ended up  inviting 8  extra people, and telling 4  other people that, if there was room, we'd fit them into the ceremony (which has room for 100 to sit, and standing room for about 10-15 in the back). 

This put our final final guest  list to 112, not counting the wedding party (cause they'll be standing up so they don't need seats). 

So I was going through the list, separating people for the RSVPs (no children are invited to the reception, so we decided to send everyone two RSVPs, one for the ceremony and one for the reception, and only list the invited names  for each occasion on the cards, to help clear up confusion). 

And I had a thought...there are several people we *know* will not attend. 

 One of his aunts is bed bound with severe MS and lives over 600 miles away. Another aunt is 95 years old and, again, lives over 600 miles away, in a *very* rural area. She has caretakers come in daily to cook for her and so on. I doubt his foster brother (that he hasn't seen in years and hasn't spoken to regularly in over a year), her wife that he's never met, and the foster brother's nephew (again, never met) are going to travel over 600 miles.  Then there's a family of three who, while they were close next door neighbors, probably won't attend because the husband has been suffering from a neurological problem that hospitalized him, and while he's better now, they still don't know what happened and he's  doing monthly testing.  They're not going to want to travel so far with his health being so unpredictable  and the medical expenses they're dealing with. 

Then my grandfather and his step daughter, I haven't seen them in over five years. We write every now and then, but he moved to Oregon and the weddings in  Missouri. Those two probably aren't going to make it, especially since my grandmother is invited and their divorce was *not* amicable. 

That's like, 10 people who are  very, very unlikely to attend a December wedding right before Christmas that's over 600 miles from where they  live, for someone they haven't seen or spoken to in a long time. 

So I realized we can just go ahead and invite everyone, including his work friends, to both the ceremony and reception.  Problem solved, right? No one's getting snubbed by only receiving a reception invite, his four friends won't be confused about wondering if they got ""bumped up"" to ceremony and reception, etc.  

Nope. He  flipped out.  He thoroughly believes that these people will come.  He actually got offended that I'd even *think* they wouldn't attend. He insists we keep the list with some people invited to just the reception.

I talked to his mom, on the side.  She agrees with me that these people are like 99% unlikely to not show. 

So, I'm just nodding and smiling and agreeing, and then I'm sending out the damn invites my way anyways. These people are *not* going to show up, and even if they do, there's standing room for them. We'll pack some folding chairs into one of the cars, and if extra people show, they can sit.

We wrote our own vows.**

It was challenging, it was time consuming, it was kind of stressful, but it turned out to be a really valuable exercise for both of us in thinking about why we're good with each other and what we can both promise to work on.  If we'd gotten around to pre-marital counselling this may have been unnecessary but since we didn't I'm glad we wrote our own.

**2. We didn't try to hide me or the gown from him ahead of time**

Oh my god I cannot even begin to contemplate what an utter flaming pain in the ass it would have been to try to keep me hidden.  This tradition wasn't important to either of us to start with and luckily none of the parents cared either, so there wasn't much question about it, but still I am so glad we didn't have to bother.  It let us take most of our pictures ahead of time so we could spend more time celebrating with guests, it meant we could just do all the prep in the same location, and nobody had to be constantly on guard to prevent us seeing each other.  (Edit: Plus we're each others' best stress relievers, so it was great to be able to spend the morning chilling and snuggling, especially since we were both too wound up to sleep much.)

**3. We provided transportation for guests**

Our venue was a bit of a drive away from where people were staying, and we had an open bar, so it seemed like the only responsible thing to do.  It was a little bit of a pain to set up and somewhat to my surprise only about a third of the guests used it, but they were very grateful for it.  I was glad we did because if not I would have worried about guests either potentially driving drunk, or not taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves fully.


Those are the highlights, anyway.  I could probably keep going :)

We set our date a while back for August of 2014. She has recently informed me that she will be getting next April in Mexico, and has asked me to be a bridesmaid as well. I am panicking.

Since my fiance and I are planning to honeymoon in the US, attending her wedding will actually cost us more than going on our own honeymoon. 

I know that my friend isn't obligated to plan around me, but I honestly don't know how I am going to afford to contribute to the cost of my own wedding, honeymoon, and her wedding.

He may not be around very much longer (he might have 6-9 months left) so we would like to accelerate our wedding plans and hold an intimate wedding in Salt Lake City sometime in the next couple of months. I don't want to rely on my in-laws to be because they already have so much to deal with so I'd love to plan something remotely...we live in Portland Oregon. 

Does anyone have suggestions on any of the following: 

A particular hotel that could serve as a one-stop location for a small ceremony, private dining and accommodations while we and our guests are in town? I like modern/hip vs. traditional style and decor. The only hotel I've found so far is Hotel Monaco. 

Restaurants that could be rented out for a small ceremony/dinner? 

Reasonably priced photographer?

Guitarist/Singer that we could hire to play a song at the ceremony?

If you don't have Salt Lake City specific ideas but have experience planning a wedding in a city you don't live in, what is your advice? 

We want to keep this super low key and relaxed for the sake of my fiancé’s dad. There will be 20 guests at the most. We are somewhat flexible on the date, but we’re shooting for a Friday evening. I have only flown through SLC so I feel pretty lost at this point and to be honest, the internet searches I've done so far haven't yielded anything amazing, just your run of the mill hotel chains. There's gotta be some cute, hip, modern places, right? 

We briefly considered a destination wedding but I never imagined it would be like this! It just feels right though, to do it this way and I know it will be very special regardless.

It's been going well so far but after many failed attempts, I have come to the conclusion that I am not talented enough to create an invitation that doesn't look like a blind 6 year old was the lead designer on the project.

This lead me to Vistaprint (Canada). The more I look around the site the more money I seem to be able to save so I figured I'd pass on some tips for other brides looking to use the service. This might work for other similar companies as well.

1) Sign up for an account and save the designs of everything and anything you could ever want from the site... even if it's out of your budget range.

2) Be careful with packaged invitations! $185 for 50 invites and RSVP cards doesn't sound too bad but if you drop the package deal and add the items separately with PLAIN envelopes, it comes out to under $100 before any discounts (see #3). I don't need to double my price just to have little trees in the bottom left corner that they're going to rip anyway.

3) Be patient! If you look like you are interested in becoming a customer (by saving designs and items) they will want your business. Within 7 days I had an e-mail offering me 10% off the stuff I had saved and some other little offers for additional items (business cards, etc).

4) Be VERY patient! Within 30 days of creating my ""order"" I had a 50% off coupon for all invites in my e-mail. Now that I have some play room, I could add on bells and whistles (premium paper stock, etc) and still be under budget.


I'm not a bells and whistles kind of gal so I just ordered my standard 110 invites, 60 rsvp cards and some address labels. Total cost: just under $100 including basic shipping.

Any other tips for ordering from sites like this?",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,married,True,t3_16mqzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/16mqzr/our_invites_things_i_learned_from_vistaprint/,
1375052855.0,39,self.weddingplanning,1j8ov6,Everything you always wanted to know about wedding ring tattoos but were afraid to ask.,46,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1j8ov6/everything_you_always_wanted_to_know_about/,"[(Our tattoos.)](http://imgur.com/a/xx2cD#0)

There's a sad lack of resources on wedding ring tattoos on the web. Sites like The Offbeat Bride recycle the same set of pictures, including designs that will smudge badly, and henna paintings. Aged rockers getting married are left to their own devices.

That's why I thought sharing our experience might come in useful. Of course, tattoos are a controversial thing. If you hate the idea, that's cool.

**Demographics**

To give you some idea of which niche we fit, we're 33 years old living in Croatia. She's an economic analyst and I'm a programmer. She already had a tattoo between shoulder blades; I had none. We don't represent a subculture. 

**Design**

Fingers are not ideal places for ink. You need a design symbolic of a ring rather than an actual ring, simple and flexible enough to stay nice even after (_not if!_) it smudges. Single color only; wife and I took different colors (she purple, I indigo) for variety. Reputable artists won't do the inside, so no looping around the finger. A good artist will know what works. Ask them for ideas.

Interestingly, my and wife's tattoos smudged differently, and our designs ended up not looking exactly the same. 
 
**Procedure**

R/tattoos has excellent advice on choosing a good shop. The pain is light. Our tattoos just stung on the sides, where the flourishes end. I didn't time the procedure, but I think it was around 15 minutes for each.  

Then irritation and swelling set in, which was unpleasant but not unbearable. We healed in just under two weeks, with regular care to prevent infection but without film wrap.

**Environment**

We were nervous about getting a visible tattoo, and we actually discussed it with our employers, who were supportive. Take your country's customs into consideration before you render yourself unemployable.

We found most people didn't really care. Some loved it. Some hated it. That's just something you have to accept.

Don't count on covering them for work or family. A big signet ring will obscure them, but not hide them from every angle. _If you can't wear them openly most of the time, don't get ring tattoos._ 

**Permanence**

Your tattoo is pretty much *permanent*. Laser removal may leave scarring and is a health hazard. Accept that if you split, the tattoo stays. 

My wife and I lived together for 9 years before marrying, so we were confident we have a good chance of staying together. 

**In closing...**

The bottom line is, don't get this if you have any doubts whatsoever, but if you're getting it, make it a big one and wear it proudly.

I hope this was of some use to someone.  If you have any more questions... Shoot.

My wedding was Wednesday and I wrote out a long post telling all about it on the wedding subreddit, but I decided to remove it because it was far too long for Reddit.  

Anyway, long story short, they really aren't kidding around when they tell you things will go wrong.  Don't be surprised if absolutely nothing goes according to plan.  We had an outdoors ceremony listed on our invitations.  Wednesday morning, it rained longer than I've seen it rain in years and we had flash flooding.  The rain cleared by noon, but the wind was so awful, we had to have it all in our indoor reception.  

My maid of honor surprised me with a mani/pedi the day before the wedding, when we were actually supposed to be baking cupcakes, so my mom and grandma took over and made some terribly inconsistent, pretty ugly cupcakes.  Thank god my heart wasn't set on them being beautiful and they still looked cute and tasted awesome.

My white flip-flops were in a bag with some decorations and one came out with some red paint or something all over the band, while the other stayed white.  It would not come off no matter what you used on it.  So I took a bottle of red nail polish and dotted all over both straps and made it look like I meant for them to be that way.

We were promised an old-fashioned popcorn maker to fit with the theme and to hold people over during the small wait for my MIL to get burgers grilled.  Management changed at the place the popcorn maker was located, I kid you not, the DAY before.  So we lost the popcorn machine the day of.  We bought boxes of popcorn and popped them in the microwave in the little kitchen instead.  I was still able to use our popcorn boxes my MIL bought for us!  Yay!

With all that happened (and more, ohhhh, much much more), I still could not wipe the smile from my face all evening.  The ceremony was quick and awkward, but it was funny and really very down-to-earth.  And getting all my old and new friends together and discovering how well they all get along was just awesome.  I really had the best night of my life and I'm not kidding.

I hope for all you soon-to-be brides, you just focus on the reason you're there and the reason you're doing it all rather than on the things that go wrong.  If you can't even stop grinning like an idiot long enough to take a few ""serious and stoic"" pictures, no matter what seemed to have gone ""wrong"", everything really went right.

She's bought literally thousands of dollars worth of outfits (all returned, finally) and didn't love any of it. Finally, I made her come over and try them all on for me. She has amazing taste in clothes, but no idea of what actually suits her body.  She keeps getting these knee length sheath style dresses and do nothing for her shape but she's scared of her 'bottom half looking big'.

So I said ""Let's go shopping.""

I took her to Nordstrom Rack, went straight to the dresses and picked out ten dresses in styles I like (I'm also a pear shape) and her size (and a couple of some bigger sizes).

It turns out she was afraid of longer dresses doing the bias-cut look and clinging to the hips and then tapering.  I hate that look too.  I got her to try on several evening dresses and she found the one she loves and almost cried while hugging me. She loves it. It looks great on her.

I cried at my shower, too. I have a problem.) I'm picking up the back today with the engraving and then will set the watch to the time we're getting married before I wrap it up.

Guests like my roommate exist.",51,15,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1h2wny/brides_a_warning_guests_like_my_roommate_exist/,"So I'm planning a wedding of my own, I have five weddings to go to this summer, two of which, my male roommate is also invited to. They're actually this upcoming Friday and Saturday. Yea, crazy weekend. 

Anyway, he starts off with not RSVPing to either one. (The save the dates were sent out last October, invites probably end of March) Friday night wedding, I think he had every intention of going to but we didn't realize he hadn't returned the card until the bride-to-be comes over one night for a get together at our place. Immediately she was on his butt about how the due date was passed and he can either let them know then and there what his plans were for food and attendance, or not come. He proceeds with ""uhh I don't know if I can get out of work. If I say yes can I cancel at any time? Hey dude (another friend we had over) wanna be my plus one? Yea I'll say that I'm coming but I don't know if I'll be there or not. We'll see"" she responds appropriately with ""you've known since October, you weren't given a plus one, you're being extremely rude and NO, at $100 per plate, you absolutely cannot cancel at any time"" he never really answers her so she assumes he's not coming. 

About a month ago, he does the same exact thing to the Saturday night wedding bride when we all get together for her fiancé's birthday. The kicker with this one is he blatantly says one night about a week later, in front a close friend and my 2 other two roommates, all of whom are friends with the groom from high school, one is actually a groomsman (my fiancé) and the other being the best fucking man, ""yea I don't think I'm gonna go to the wedding. I got the invite but I lost it and they'll probably just assume I'm not coming. It's whatever I just don't think I'll have a good time. It's an hour away, fuck that, and it just doesn't sound like fun"" now, I just about lose my fucking mind, but I guess it's a guy thing cuz the three of them just sat there and didn't say anything. Not that it matters, but this is going to be the biggest, most elegant wedding I've ever been to and he's going to know a TON of people there. His absence will be noticed. 

Fast forward to tonight, 3 and 4 days before these weddings and I offer, as nicely as possible, to take his gifts to the respective weddings for him since he ""decided"" not to go. He looks at me like I have three heads and says, and I quote, ""if I don't feel like going to the weddings I sure as hell aren't going to buy them a gift. Haha thanks for your offer but that's ridiculous. There's no way they expect a gift from me"". As nicely as possible I told him that I've been to a lot of weddings, I have five this summer, I'm planning one of my own, as he damn well knows, and it's considered very bad form to get invited to the weddings of your close friends, not go, then not send gifts. He thought I was absolutely hilarious and turned the tv up louder. 

It's very true that I'm venting about my idiot roommate, a lot of my rage comes from being mad FOR the brides he's dicked over, but I also just wanted to warn you. Don't allow guests to be inconsiderate assholes. Set an RSVP date of a long time before your wedding. I hope you don't have a ""Jon"" on your guest lists.

-Our wedding is in December so she said book a florist now as December is a busy season and it helps the florists to plan how much they will need to order. She said I can pay a deposit to book the services but I shouldn't have to finalize choices until October. 

-A good florist will ask what the brides waist size is suggest bouquets based on that rather that dress size since dress sizes can vary. (I never even thought of a florist asking for my waist size) She said someone with a tiny waist and huge bouquet looks off in pictures as does someone with a larger waist and a tiny boquet. She said ax experienced florist will make a bouquet that compliments the bride. 

-Make sure in your contract the # of flowers are stated. Your contract should say not only ""Bridal Bouquet with white roses"" but rather it should say ""Bridal Bouquet with 14 white roses""

-Be careful about going with a friend or someone that does flowers on the side for out of their house because they don't have the proper storage and usually the flowers will need to be ordered at the last minute and if there is something wrong with the order its harder to correct the problem with less time.

-If you are getting arrangements made for your ceremony try and get something you can use to also decorate the reception with to get more use for your money. Bridesmaid bouquets can be put in holders and used to decorate the cake table for example. 

-Before meeting with your florist regarding centerpieces (or if your centerpieces are DIY) don't make any final decisions until you ask your venue if there are any restrictions. Some venues don't allow candles or only allow certain types of candles or candle holders for example. 

-She suggested for a winter wedding that pewter and black are good colors for bridesmaids dresses and can choose a wide variety of colored flowers and they won't clash. 

Well I think those were the main points. Sorry if I rambled yet again! I hope some of these tips help some of you.

Pretty much every time I go to the beach, I drag whomever I'm with to one of the black &amp; white old-timey photobooths and get our pictures taken. So when I heard about this trend of people having photobooths at their wedding, I knew I really wanted this.

Unfortunately, they're rather expensive, and I'm on a budget. At minimum I was seeing prices of $600 - $700 on most companies sites, going easily upwards of $1000. I did see one or two Groupons for something like $400 for two hours, but that seemed like an awful lot to pay for only two hours!

I did some searching online and found some people had done DIY booths, so I decided to give it a try.

**[Here's what I built](http://imgur.com/a/Wdwgv)!**

[These are the instructions](http://diy.weddingbee.com/topic/diy-photobooth-using-pvc) that I used to model my booth off of. I used the photo to figure out which pieces I needed and about how much pipe - the only difference was that I added a second shelf (for more room and extra support).

A friend of mine was willing to lend me his PVC pipe cutter, which was a huge help - not sure if it would have gotten done without that. I went to Home Depot for the PVC Pipe - used 1' PVC pipe and couplings (T couplings and corner couplings only) and the booth took a bit less than 10 pipes of 10' length. The pipe and couplings ended up being about $120.

Putting it together was mostly a matter of looking at the photos from the example I used, measuring the pieces initially to get the lengths I wanted and then making sure the rest of the pieces matched. 

Then I went to JoAnn's and got fabric to cover the booth with. I used velcro both on the fabric and on the PVC pipe to cover it all. The fabric, velcro, and curtain rings ended up being about $120 (I probably could have saved money here, but I wanted the fabric to match the colors we're using for the wedding.)

For the pictures, I'm using a laptop, an extra monitor, and a webcam (all of which I already own), along with software called [Sparkbooth](http://sparkbooth.com/) which is $60 (well worth it - it makes the process really simple for your guests and you can have it automatically print photos to a photoprinter or upload to a website or whatever).

I still have to figure out lighting - there's no flash with the webcam so it's definitely necessary. Right now my plan is to try a Halogen work light and some sort of light softener. And I plan to make signs for the booth.

After I put it together, I broke it all down into manageable/transportable pieces (and took photos and wrote instructions while I did so). Since I will probably not be the one to put it together at the venue (thankfully my dad volunteered!), I wanted to make sure that the instructions were thorough.

Basically so far, the cost has been about $300, and I'm expecting lighting to cost about $25 and props about the same, so a total project cost of $350. Not as cheap as I was hoping honestly, but still significantly cheaper than most of the prices I saw, and we can use it for as long as we want. I'm thinking of selling it or renting/lending it afterwards.

I want to share my experience with everyone, hope it helps in planning.",45,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/11z4fj/my_wedding_went_off_without_a_hitch_last_weekend/,"So my husband and I planned our wedding all by ourselves and we did just enough to make things go perfectly!

First piece of advice? GET A DAY OF COORDINATOR! It was the only way that we could get the reception set up the day of and make sure that everything was the way that we wanted it to be. Our wedding would not have happened without her. 

Second? Make day-of schedules to be given out to family/friends/bridal party/ groom's party / anyone who you think will ask you when things are happening the day of. Give them out at the rehearsal dinner if possible. This will seriously help keep a million people from asking what is happening when on your big day. The last thing you want is to have to check your phone a million times because everyone is calling to ask you where things are / when things start. 

Ladies - when getting your stylist make sure to get a preview done first for hair and make-up and discuss how you want your bridesmaids styles to be. This helps them figure out how much time they need. We ended up getting my stylist for about 6 hours for 6 girls total. It was perfect timing. Trust them to know how long it takes. Get reviews of them from as many people as possible. Our stylist made me and my girls so comfortable and made us feel the best we could about ourselves :)

Gentlemen - please schedule things for your groomsmen to do the day of. My husband had not done this until last minute even though everyone wanted to get together with him for lunch/brunch and hang out before the ceremony. It really helped calm him down in the end! 

Talk to your photographer and possibly walk through your venue with them - We met up with our photographer beforehand and showed him all the places we wanted to take pictures. He gave us great feedback and took notes. We also gave him a specific shot list of photos we wanted and this was AWESOME. He followed it perfectly. I also made a pinterest board of photos that I enjoyed and sent it to him. He found great ways to incorporate the creative ideas with our venue. 

MONEY - TRY TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING YOU CAN BEFORE THE WEDDING DAY! We ended up not having to pay anyone the day of. It was either pre-paid or we are paying it this week. We didn't have to worry about too many tips since we didn't hire cars. The only person I paid in cash that day was my stylist. 

Write down your vows! Don't try to memorize them. I would have stuttered and gone blank had I not had a card with my vows on it!

Last piece of advice! If you know people/have friends who can be your vendors (musician, photographer, videographer, DJ, etc) try to hire them. We ended up saving a ton of money because almost all of our vendors were people we knew. Our DJ was a groomsman (who made an AMAZING playlist), our photographer works with my husband and cut us a great deal and yes he is a professional photographer, our videographer is a friend of ours, our baker is the wife of another coworker, etc etc I think we saved a couple thousand dollars by using people we knew.

Extended, extended family knows that they are automatically invited--Really, because you're not.  

Why, you ask?  Because our wedding is very small, 50 people (maybe less, if not everyone makes it), we aren't having a formal, sit-down dinner.  But it will be an awesome balls-to-the-wall reception, with ONLY our closest friends and family. And the most important factor, my family and my fiance's family has never met, so we want our families to be able to hang out and get to know each other, because it will probably be the only chance they get!

I've had old friends from high school, who I haven't seen in 6 years ask when my wedding is so they can make it!  A new neighbor, my fiance and I got to know assumed him, his wife and baby were all invited!  No, because I met you after the guest list was finalized.  
My bridesmaid's older sister also assumed she was invited!!  (and she is... NOW, but it was after she backed me into a corner.)

I've come to the conclusion, that everyone (especially the people who say 'they hate weddings')loves weddings!

I asked a lot of advice - did people really think I could get everything ready by October, my month of choice?  No one was very optimistic.  They said there was more to it than I thought, that vendors would be the hardest thing to find and book, especially if my date wasn't available.

Well I picked a date - 10/26/13, a Saturday - and started looking.  I found one venue I really liked and had my date available, but it was too small for our guest list.  Then I found the second venue.

[It's perfect.](http://cheshirestl.com)

It's historic, has a super unique vintage feel, and all the suites are literary themed (I'm a HUGE book nerd).  Most of our guests are coming from out of town so the fact we can have the ceremony, reception, AND guest rooms there is perfect.  The food is delicious and most of all, it's exactly what I wanted for my wedding - something that people leave from saying, ""Wow, that was really unique.  I'll remember this.""

So I signed and sent in the contract forms this morning.  We're officially booked!  This takes care of ceremony space, reception venue, guest lodging, catering, booze, AND setup/breakdown all in one fell swoop.

1372133727.0,32,self.weddingplanning,1h0njk,Your role at the wedding reception and how not to blow it,65,33,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1h0njk/your_role_at_the_wedding_reception_and_how_not_to/,"I have to get this off my chest. I considered posting on Facebook but the wrong people might see it and be hurt. I post it here in the hopes that I can help make your reception a better celebration. I am a wedding DJ extrordanaire. I am a master at planning the timing and pacing of a reception. I can see how every decision you make is going to affect the energy of the party, and when it isn't going to go how you were hoping I can tell you how to fix it. Listen to my words.

Your guests are there to celebrate, *with* **you**. Rule number one is to be present. Every moment you are absent from the room hurts the reception. The most critical time for you to be in the room and center stage is the transition from dinner to dancing. Your guests want to dance, but they need permission. They expect dancing to begin immediately following the after-dinner formalities. Do **not** go off to take a sunset photo or leave to change into a more comfortable dress for dancing. If you delay the after-dinner formalities, like cutting the cake or the parent dances, your guests will get ancy but they won't dance because you haven't done your part to tell them the party is starting now. 

Are there exceptions? Sure. Some people might get up and dance when they hear a great song, but take the same room full of guests and put them in both scenarios, one where you kick off open dancing with the formalities, and one where you just start dance music after dinner and the one where you start with the formalities will be first to a full dance floor every time. 

Being present also means you must embrace the spotlight and accept that there are times when the action is fully centered around you and the party cannot move forward without your participation. A good DJ (or band leader) will check to make sure you are ready before announcing something that you need to be a part of, but if you've planned out the timeline ahead of time you should at least be aware of the loose timing of everything even if your DJ drops the ball. When it's time to cut the cake, start walking over to the cake table immediately. When it's time to do your father/daughter dance, get to the dance floor, and if dad isn't there already or on his way, go *get* him!

Don't jump in the photo booth with your bridesmaids first. Don't go to the bathroom. Don't go to the bar to get another drink. All of these things should be planned around the important moments. 

Imagine watching the Oscars and when Hugh Jackman announces the winner of best actress the camera cuts to the back of Glenn Close's head, still seated in the audience, talking and laughing with another attendee. That's what it's like when the DJ announces the bouquet toss and you're across the room chatting with friends and relatives. Your guests are an audience and you are the **star** of the show. How does it look when the star of the show is off in her own world?

It's so simple and yet so important that you be present, in mind and body. I promise you a better celebration, more fun, and better memories if you just do this one thing for me. Please, I beg you, help me to help you. 

That is all. We now return you to your regularly schedule discussion of dresses and venues.

It's just as big of a day for the groom, so why is it always so much about the bride? Shouldn't it be equal? I feel like the groom is totally forgotten. When was the last time to saw a groom-centric wedding ad that wasn't for a ring or tux? You can say its because the bride's family traditionally pays for the wedding, but the whole phenomenon completely transcends that.

I've only been to 2 weddings that I can remember, and one was a casual Mormon wedding and the other was a traditional wedding of my youth leader. I didn't get an invitation other than a verbal invite and I was not invited to the reception. So, I knew/know nothing about etiquette, random stuff like cake cutting fees, the point of save the dates, etc. And all the sites that are supposed to be for beginners just assume that you know what all this stuff is and how to do it. I like r/wedding planning because it is full of people who I feel I can relate too. I also like the general attitude of flexibility. I was put off by sites such as the knot which just didn't fit my attitudes or styles. So, with a year and a half to the wedding, just wanted to say thanks and I'm sure that I'll be here a lot!

1335900635.0,35,self.weddingplanning,t1ya1,Fiance's ex picked the SAME DATE. What the what??,39,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/t1ya1/fiances_ex_picked_the_same_date_what_the_what/,"A little back story: We were all mutual friends for 10+ years. She and my now-fiance were together for 9 years. They broke up, she found someone new, fiance and I got together. The weirdest part is that we live in HER home state which makes this a bit harrier. 

So, Mr.OhNoWeddingDate and I picked a date, a Friday in August. It has special meaning to us blah blah. We share a lot of mutual friends (pretty much all of our friends that we've known for 2+ years) with his ex so the word got out that were were engaged and picked this specific date. Ex called fiance, and had nothing to say except snarky remarks about ""How quickly"" he ""settled"". What?? We've been together 2 years and friends for 10, dude. Not to mention that she was already engaged at this point with no wedding date in sight. 

So, her brother comes over to hang out with me today (I told you, we've been friends for a while! He's a cool dude) and tells me she picked the same date knowingly. They're kind of close but her weirdness drives him away, so he wanted to let me know now instead of letting me find out at the last minute. 

Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed. A coincidence is one thing, but straight up doing this out of spite or whatever? That is insane. My fiance doesn't know yet, as he is at work and I don't want to have this conversation over the phone.

This wouldn't be a big deal if we didn't have pretty much ALL mutual friends and if we weren't both doing this out of the home state of most friends. Even having the weddings within a few months of each other would be difficult if you account for travel expenses and vacation time @ work. 

So far I have booked the ceremony venue and the photographer, but I am in luck. The photog is one of my best friends and is flexible enough to be able to change dates with no penalty and he hasn't bought plane tickets yet. The ceremony venue only cost $100 to book/reserve. The reception venue lets you change dates with minimal penalty, but only once, and only if there is availability. I have not sent out invites yet, thank goodness! They are ready to send, but not sent. I HAVE sent save-the-dates, though, and what a hassle it is going to be to change our dates. 

**Here is my plan:** She wants to get married on Friday? Fine. I will get married on Saturday. This way, our friends will still be in town, and they get double bang for their buck. I know a few people have silently ""chosen sides"" but those are the kind of people I don't mind missing out. 

**Here is my fear:** She finds out and changes her dates, causing me huge financial trouble due to changing the reception venue. Worst case scenario she hops on the Saturday train and I'm SOL. I just want to NOT stress about this. August is coming so quickly. 

**Here is the other issue:** She refuses to talk to me. We used to be close friends until I ended our friendship on the basis of her cheating on my now-fiance. She was pretty scandalous, and obviously still is. 

**Here is another part of the plan:** My fiance is very close to her parents, and I am assuming they are footing the bill. They're pretty loaded and she &amp; her fiance are pretty poor. Is it in poor taste for him to call them and explain that their daughter is being a serious jerk about this? They still meet up for dinner every now and then (once or twice a year) so it's not totally weird that he'd call them. Is this out of line? 

Oh, I hope you guys never have to go through this! This whole situation is blowing my mind. We are in our 30's. We are not freshly 18. I feel like this crap should have stopped 10 years ago. 

Any advice? 

**Resolution: First off, thank you all for responding. I know this was absolutely nuts! So, my dude came home, I told him what was up and he immediately said ""I'm calling Mary (her mom)."" While most people said it would cause drama, like I said, they are super close. Anyway, Mary was super receptive and even said her daughter started pushing for this date all of a sudden, being really stubborn about it even though it's just a couple of months away., and ""no wonder why"".**

**She is used to her daughters outbursts and fits since this is not out of character. She called us back Wednesday and said ""Don't worry, it's taken care of, she's doing it in November now, period."" I have no idea what transpired but I'm assuming her mom called her out on her BS and she was embarrassed. Similar things have happened before, such as her trying to convince my landlords to SELL our house to her because ""she lived here first"" (as my roommate).**

There were five other bridesmaids who *all* were much, much skinnier than I am.  In particular, I wear a GG size bra so strapless wasn't even an option for me.

I remember standing in the store trying to hold back tears (and trust me, I'm no wimpy chick) explaining that I really didn't feel comfortable in the dress that was picked for me to the point I was willing to step down as a bridesmaid and just be a guest.  I didn't make a scene, I pulled my FSIL aside and begged her to let me pick something I was comfortable with and was told - 'well, you can get this one dress with one strap but I wanted all my girls to match.'  Being the only one with an issue was humiliating and so I backed down.

$400 later ($280 dress, then adding another strap and some other alterations), it's the day of the wedding and I have five inches of cleavage showing.  I'm mortified.  My mother now says she doesn't want to hang our family formals on the mantle because I'm dead centre and the dress is obscenely low-cut.

I understand my (now) SIL was just frustrated at trying to pick one style that everyone would like... It doesn't exist.  Everyone has a different body type and unless you're dressing triplets who eat/exercise the same way, your girls will most likely not look the same in the same dress.  In the same vein, on the whole strapless bridesmaid dresses do not stay up while dancing the way wedding dresses do.  A wedding dress is tailored to fit you like a glove, they have boning, some have a corset which you can tighten, etc...  Strapless is in and it's cute, but it's not for everyone.  If they pick the same one on their own, consider yourself a winner and go buy some lotto tickets before that luck runs out!

So, ladies, when you take your girls shopping for the love of all that is sacred please entertain the idea of same color/different cut or even just same color family for dresses.  Personally, I love the latter and would rather have my girls go pick out something they like in my color palette than have them tugging and fussing and over something they'll never wear again.

**TL/DR SIL chose a tits-out bridesmaid dress for me -  for my wedding my maids are just wearing whatever ""little black dress"" they want.**

**EDIT** Pictures of said dress.  [Hiding the cleavage with my bouquet](http://imgur.com/hvQ0F) and [walking down the aisle, forgetting to hide the boobage](http://imgur.com/dp8bK).  Shame, lovely color and all... Just too much boobs in 'yo face.

**EDIT #2**  I also feel like I should say it didn't ruin the entire day.  90% of what I remember is bawling as my little brother told my good friend that he promised to love her for the rest of his life, and that the first wedding cake I made as a professional was liked by all.

Long story short, I'm freaking out. Weddings are expensive, I'm dealing with drama from his side and mine because I don't want my mother/siblings there (emotional abuse history), every one wants to take over everything to the point where I just want to scream ""NO!"" constantly, I'm getting shit from my gay friends even though I'm making a huge monetary contribution toward a local LGBTQ organization, and all I really give a crap about is marrying my man. Seriously. 

I would LOVE to have a party with all of our friends and family (the ones we like, anyway), and get drunk, and dance, and wear a pretty dress, but the drama that is surrounding it is almost unbearable. Everyone has an opinion about everything, I can't just plan in peace, and I'm ready to say ""Fuck it!"" and spend $10,000 on an amazing vacation for the two of us and spend the other $10,000 on a couple of motorcycles. Ugh! 

I feel like this is a phase that many people have during wedding planning, but I just need to vent. It's making me resent his family, hate mine even more that I already did, and making me want to strangle people that I love. I'm really trying to keep it cool, and I'm generally a laid back person, but I totally get why some people turn into Bridezillas. OMG. Can't I just wear what I want, pick the place I want, pick the food I want, and pick the damn music I want, without being questioned the whole way? 

The only person who I really want to hear from is my fiance because it's his wedding as much as it is mine. Period. I don't want to hear my bridesmaids whine about the color I picked (seriously. they can wear ANYTHING as long as it's blue. they can wear a ball gown or a goddamn bikini, as long as it's some shade of blue). I don't want a lecture from his mom about how I will regret not having my mother there (this is coming from a lady I have seen 3x in my life due to physical distance... she doesn't really know very much about me besides that I make her son very happy...). 

I just don't want to deal with it anymore. Please tell me this will pass as long as I just go ""Uh huh, OK, Whatever you say"". I have seriously said ""Thank you for your input, I will take that into consideration as I make my choice"" at least 100x over the past few months. Soon it's going to turn into ""Get bent and throw your own f-ing party"" if this keeps happening.

Easiest way to find this deal is to look at http://www.dailydibs.com/topic/GrouponNationalDeals , since the deals will show only for certain cities, but you can buy it no matter where you are.

Step 2- Use Groupon link and promotion code to get credit to show on your shopping cart. Design your invites and whatever else and put it all in your cart. 

Step 3- In a separate tab from your cart, open up retailmenot.com and search for vistaprint. There is a link there that gives you 50% off on almost any item. Click on this link, and when the window pops up, click on your cart. Now you will have the groupon credit, plus 50% off most if not all your items!

For an idea of what this can get you, I've bought this deal twice (Once I somehow got credit from Groupon and didn't even have to pay the $17.)

For a total of $39.87 (Counting the one $17 charge for the groupon and $22.87 for shipping for two different shipments. I got-

2 sets of 50 4""x8"" flat invitations (Color front and back, plain envelopes.) I got two in separate shipments because the first set had typos, argh.

100 rsvp postcards (color front and back)

20 flat tall thin rehearsal dinner invitations (Color front, blank back)

1 cute black t-shirt with stick figures of me and my fiance in wedding gear for me to wear on our honeymoon

1 Just Married Window Cling with wedding date

1 large Just Married Magnet with wedding date

I want it to not be tacky, I want the food to be good, I want the booze to be plentiful, and I want the dancing to be embarrassing. 

But I am having a REALLY hard time getting over the cost issues. I know, I know, most special day, whatever. I just can't justify spending tens of thousands of dollars on this one day. When my fiancee is looking at wedding magazines, all the invitations are $2k-ish. And it's not just that. Ridiculously expensive cakes. Ridiculously expensive booze. Ridiculously expensive venues. Ridiculously expensive clothing. I swear, if you just removed the word ""wedding"" from any of these, they would be 1/10th the cost. It just feels like I'm being taken advantage of because of the nature of the event, and I don't want to be bitter afterwards. 

In addition, I am having a difficult time with something else. I don't know how to put it, really. It's like.. the fetishization of weddings. Where every little thing has to be a special little snowflake, and everything has to have ""that personal touch,"" and everything has to be ""unique"" and trying to outdo each other. I don't know why, but I find it incredibly grating and off-putting. It feels like the materialization of the attention-whore culture of reality tv shows and american idol. If we hadn't already plunked down for a venue, food, and alcohol, I'd seriously push the idea of elopement. 

tl;dr: Getting married, cool with the idea of marriage, but the wedding concept feels slimy and I worry I'm going to be bitter and resentful over the cost and attention whoring involved.

They never called to notify me. I am trying not to freak out, but I am at a loss of what to do. My wedding is October 26th. This dress and veil were already paid for. Their phone line is disconnected. I found them on Facebook and messaged them there (as well the owners personal page, but that hasn't been updated since September 2012).

Any ideas or tips? I'm REALLY hoping that she has my dress and just hasn't gotten around to calling me yet...But I'm so worried. :c

I called them, and the manager told me she was actually going into a meeting with my dress shop owner, as all the 'leftover' dresses were being sent to them. Very confusing. Now I'm just waiting to hear if this new store actually has my dress.  I'm still pissed my store didn't even let me know (nothing on their FB wall) what was going on. But oh well.

Went just fine.  I had a friend who was in charge of making sure that the playlist was progressing at a rate that matched the mood of the crowd.  He was the only one with the password to the computer, although my father did some helping over his shoulder at one point.  Both had fun!  I definitely didn't time the playlist correctly, so he corrected it midway through to make the room more lively.   
   
[Here was the Spotify playlist we used](http://open.spotify.com/user/keo8128/playlist/4ZNry4YJZjnO3Y9emMcLpN), in case anyone wants to steal.  The first 3 songs were first dance, father/daughter, mother/son, and then it becomes open dance floor.  Where there's a string of Journey songs, that was about the last dance.  We didn't really listen to like 7 Journey songs in a row, he just tossed them in there for whatever reason.   
   
The point at which my friend started modifying the playlist was at ""Soul Man"", which is a family favorite.  I was a little perturbed that he chose songs that weren't radio edits, but I was too distracted being happy at the time so I didn't notice until later.  I hope nobody with little kids noticed.  I did notice at the time that he chose to include ""Gold Digger"" (which was a request by the bartender, apparently).  But I just laughed, because I had spent so many months excluding songs exactly like that from the playlist.  He also apparently loves conga lines, which I do as well, but my husband had requested no conga lines or cheesy music.  We had 3 conga lines and the Electric Slide.  Ah well!  I had an awesome time with all of the above.   
   
We did, through the course of making this playlist, come up with another ""UnWedding"" playlist that amuses me greatly.  Songs that sound like they'd be fun to include until you listen to the lyrics!

1) Be picky about your photographer, and go with a professional with wedding experience.  We didn't want to spend so much money, and we have professional photographer friends and family members, but my parents insisted on getting us pros as a wedding present.  For one thing, it's great to have everyone we love (including the photographer friends/relatives) in the photos!  Plus, they appreciated not having to work during the celebration.  And our photos came out AMAZINGLY well!  We have about 700 of them, and the rights to print as we please.  After hearing countless horror stories of awful wedding photos, I'm eternally grateful to my parents and think it's worth spending extra on!

2) Hire a professional DJ (or band).  Not only will a professional be better at reading a mixed-aged crowd and playing appropriate music, but the DJ is also the MC and thereby dictates the timing of the whole reception.  We interviewed several before finding a guy we clicked with, and our reception ran strong for almost three hours longer than planned and literally everyone danced.  Everything happened on time, and I didn't worry about when things would happen because I trusted him to work with the site coordinator.  He was worth every penny!

My one wedding regret is that I worried so much about something silly.  I'm sure everyone does this, and I just want to say that in the end it didn't matter AT ALL.  Our officiant said the ""f"" word, the flower children outfits turned out to be a hideous shade of teal that matched nothing, but I married my best friend with all our friends and family there to celebrate with us, and it was AMAZING!  And we have at least two things to laugh about when remember it :-)

Anyhow, I hope this helps some of you pull off fantastic weddings on a budget!

1363220610.0,30,self.weddingplanning,1a93qf,My single friends have told me they don't want to hear about my wedding.,45,15,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1a93qf/my_single_friends_have_told_me_they_dont_want_to/,"Is this ridiculous or legitimate?

The three of us have been close friends for several years.  I didn't ask either of them to be bridesmaids as my fiance and I decided to have just our brothers and sisters in the wedding party (it's going to be a small wedding), and I explained this to them and they understood and said they still wanted to help out.  However, I've been thinking back over the last 6 months since I got engaged, and I don't remember either of them asking me about my wedding stuff at all.  In the meantime, I've asked them a few times to go with me to bridal shows, floral consultations, tastings, etc and they've always had a reason not to go, which I never really questioned until now.  We are all in graduate school and are super busy, so this seemed normal to me.

About 2 months ago Friend A's boyfriend of one year broke up with her and she's been taking it pretty badly - Friend B and I have been spending a lot of time trying to help her recover.  Last weekend Friend A was having a better night than usual and I mentioned something related to wedding planning (I don't remember what), and Friend A burst into tears and ran to the restroom (we were in a restaurant).  Friend B then told me that it was extremely unkind of me to mention my relationship and happiness to Friend A while she is in such an emotional state.  Apparently they've talked about this without me plenty of times, and they both feel that it's a slap in the face to hear me talk about my fiance/wedding/happiness/etc.

What I don't understand is this: I'm supposed to be there for them when they go through relationship troubles (Friend B also ended a relationship about a year ago), but they don't have to be there to be happy for me when I'm NOT having troubles?  Is this friendship?  

I've been thinking about this constantly over the last few days and it's really been upsetting me.  I just don't know how to react.  Have your single friends been responding poorly to hearing about wedding things?  Any input appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks for all your input.  I think you guys are right - A and B are pretty immature - I think I've matured over the years we've been friends while they have not done quite as much maturing.  I've never been someone with many good female friends and I was excited to be able to share this with them, but I've decided I'll let this lapse into a casual friendship and not mention my wedding again unless they specifically ask (not that I really talked about it much to begin with).  Oh well.  Fortunately, my fiance and our sisters are the most amazing people ever and they are totally supportive and wonderful.  Ain't nobody gonna rain on my parade!

Side note: When I said graduate school, I really meant medical school - that's right, in just a little over a year these women could be writing your prescriptions!!",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1363230590.0,,lessthanamonth,True,t3_1a93qf,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1a93qf/my_single_friends_have_told_me_they_dont_want_to/,

So I was mostly prepared for the worst. I was all ready to say things like ""I don't care if wearing my glasses, flat shoes, and no veil does not look 'bridal'."" I didn't want a train or a strapless dress, and I was prepared to have all of like 3 options because of that. And because my ideas of dress pricing came from Say Yes to the Dress and looking at David's Bridal and Alfred Angelo online, I was expecting to be approaching 4 figures.

As you've already guessed from the title, that wasn't my experience at all. My mom and I got to the shop (a privately run place in Altoona, PA), and were allowed to just look through the racks until an attendent was freed up to work with us. At that point I tried on the first 4 dresses I'd found that I liked - in a private dressing room where no one had to see me in my underwear but me (guess I bought that new strapless bra for nothing!).

I didn't really like any of them on me, so I described what I wanted to the attendent (mentioning that we were going bowling after our reception/lunch, which she was really excited about). She went to the racks herself and pulled two dresses. The first one was PERFECT. The attendent commented ""And you can even bowl in it!"" (which was totally true). It fit almost perfectly, so I got to take it right home with me (just need the straps adjusted, which I'm going to have done by a seamstress I've worked with before). We were in and out of the shop in about an hour.

Oh, and the best part? $159! They didn't even attempt to upsell me to their fancier dresses!

The only thing missing from the TV experience was there was no one popping a bottle of congratulatory champagne for me when I did say ""yes"" to the dress.

But that's okay. I preferred the beers we drank later anyway!

(I can't find a picture of the dress online, but it's a Mori Lee and looks a lot like [this one](http://www.huluweddingdress.com/product_images/uploaded_images/product-1209.jpg), but has a lace overlay over the skirt part as well)",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,2months,True,t3_1a1fi5,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1a1fi5/my_dress_shopping_experience_wayyyyy_easier_than/,

Just wanted to say how glad I was that I did the whole thing so simply. It was easier than hosting a house party. We did the ceremony and reception at the same venue, my favourite restaurant/bar. The ceremony was short and simple, after the ceremony we went and had coffee at the cafe owned by the same people as the bar, while they set up for the reception. We just did finger food and there was way more food than we needed!

If anyone right now is weighing up between big, extravagant and traditional, versus small and simple, I cannot express how glad I am that we did it small. We had 40 people, the whole thing (including attire, flowers, food, venue, shoes, rings, decoration..) came in at just under $3,200.

A couple of things I was super glad we did was print out business card type things that had our flickr account details on them, so guests can upload their photos. We also made cards which guests could fill out with a date for us to go on in the future, we got lots of good ideas! Every time we want to go on a date, we'll pick a card and try to go on it as soon as feasible :)

A while ago I posted here about shower etiquette and who should be putting it together. My mum decided that she was going to help my MOH out in planning a shower for me, so that was cool. My MOH dropped out because her cat died (that's a totally different story) and will not be actively participating in any part of the wedding other than signing papers. So now my mum is planning this basically on her own, which she's happy with but I am not. Well, I'm happy that she's planning a shower for me, but some things make me worried.

I am 100% certain she has invited people that aren't even invited to the wedding. Some are people that didn't get invited because we're not close (neighbours.. wtf), people I do not like, and some are just her friends and have no connection to me. Yay.

So, I don't like crowds of people I like and now I'm going to be stuck with a crowd including a lot of people I don't like. I've told my mum that I didn't even want some people there and she was just like ""well it's too late now we'll just have to hope they just drop in and take off.""

I'm not looking for any advice, because there isn't really any to give, I just needed to rant about this. I'm annoyed that my mum invited people I asked her not to; I'm annoyed that she ignored my request to keep it to JUST family and bridal party members; I'm annoyed that she's basically throwing a party for herself; I'm annoyed that I feel so selfish for being so upset with this.

(You can see it [here](http://www.alysefrenchphotographyblog.com/2013/02/27/gardens-of-bammel-lane-wedding-krystal-jeremy/) if you're interested!) We had a short mini-honeymoon and then I had a day to relax before going back to work.
 
And that is when I hit rock bottom.

I knew I was at rock bottom when I was listening to the song I walked down the aisle to, holding (hugging?) my bouquet, eating wedding cake straight out of the Tupperware, reading my friends' Facebook comments about my wedding pictures, and crying. *Mourning* my wedding. 

I guess the only way it could've been worse is if I had been wearing my dress too, but we've gotta draw the line somewhere, right? I realized just how pathetic I was being, and turned to the Internet. Surely others have felt this way before me, and luckily I found that many have.
 
Some ways I am dealing with this out-of-the-blue gloom:

**1) Tying up loose ends.** I still have Thank Yous to write, decor to sell, scrapbooks and albums to make. I have wonderful memories and just because the day is over, doesn't mean I have nothing to remember.
 
**2) Planning more weddings!** My brother is getting married in December. My close friend is getting married in February. I am trying my hand at day-of coordination. I can still use all the knowledge I've acquired over the past 2 years of planning to help others have wonderful weddings!
 
**3) Spending time with my parents.** One of the best parts about wedding planning was all the DIY stuff I got to do with my mom and dad. There is no reason to stop now!

**4) Be beautiful.** I really loved being fancy and pretty on my wedding day, getting my nails done, all of that. Normally I look like I just rolled out of bed (because usually I did). I'm a wife now, and I want to take the time to be gorgeous for my husband.
 
**5) Take time for me.** I lost 30 lbs for the wedding and started Couch to 5K. I now have more time than ever to get in the best shape of my life.

**6) Plan for the future.** One of the best things about planning my wedding, for me, was SPREADSHEETS. Hot damn I love spreadsheets. Now I can make them for cleaning the house, planning our budget, couponing, etc. I am a wife now, I've got shit to do.

**7) SPEND TIME WITH MY HUSBAND!** He is an amazing and patient man, and put up with all my planning and going to my mom's 5 times a week. He is the one I am lucky to spend every day with. He makes me laugh and cry every day with his humor and love and tenderness. I love the crap out of him.

The wedding is over. It was the best wedding ever. Now it's time for the best marriage ever.

Our guest list was tight.  As a result, we have decided to have an adult only wedding.  Furthermore we have also had to limit the +1s for our distant second cousins who are not in long-term relationships.  I see these cousins once every 2 years and they have a poor record of attending family events.  They will still know at least 30 other people at the wedding.  

I am surprised by the number of distant aunts who have called their mothers, to relay a message to my grandma, to relay a message to my mom, to relay a message to me about their disapproval with our invitation (either because they can't bring a date and/or child).  I don't know if they are spreading the word with hopes that we will phone them up and give them permission to bring whoever they want.  My mom has been keeping this information to herself as to not stress me out (which I appreciate!), but she let it slip by accident today.  I had no idea people were so annoyed with our invites!

I guess I just find it rude that these guests are expecting us to honor their wishes by spreading the word through the grapevine.  They are all adults between 23 and 30 years old!  I would much rather they keep it to themselves, or email me personally if they really want to bring a baby and/or +1.  We won't let them(!), but it would be the mature thing to do.  Do they expect us to call them and say ""Oh ya, that line we printed on *everyone's* invitation..... that doesn't apply to YOU, of course""! 

I guess this invitation process has made me realize you JUST CAN'T WIN!  :p  Anyone else experienced the same thing?!

I need some advice. A couple friends of mine are getting married, and I know most of the wedding party (it's basically a high school reunion).

The maid of honor invited my girlfriend to the bachelorette party, although she is not a member of the bridal party. Well now the MOH has changed her mind, and doesn't want my girlfriend to go. So she connives a scheme in which she tells all the bridesmaids, and my girlfriend, that the bachelorette party is cancelled. And then tells the bridesmaids, behind my girlfriend's back, that the party is actually still on, she just didn't want my girlfriend to go. Well one of the bridesmaids, a good friend of mine, ratted out the plot and told me. She thought that was a very bitchy move on the MOH's part, and knew it would eventually come to light (and didn't want to be a part of it).

Of course, I've relayed this info to my girlfriend who is upset -- not about being uninvited, but because they snuck around her back to do it. It's like a real life Mean Girls movie.

The bridesmaid that ratted out the MOH doesn't want the MOH to find out that she did it. And they're trying to keep all of this secret so the bride doesn't find out.

What should I do? Should I confront the MOH? (She'll be able to figure out who the tattletale was and start even more drama!) Should I just cancel my plans with my girlfriend to go to the wedding?

What would you do? Other than call the MOH a bitch to her face?

I got [married on September 2, 2012](http://imgur.com/5krAO), and am only now feeling back under control enough to put up this post! Throughout the whole wedding process, I kept little notes of some more uncommon items I wish I had thought of / known about before hand, in the hopes that I could provide some new tips and advice for the rest of you to-be-brides (complete with some photos, because who doesn't want to share some of their own pics??)

1.) If you are a budget conscious bride remember to consider the cost of gasoline. You may be doing a lot of running around a few days to a week before the wedding. I had to stop and fill up three times in the week and a half leading up the big day! That was about $120 that I hadn't budgeted for.

2.) The week leading up to the wedding may be busy or stressful and the last thing you may want to do at the end of the day is worry about making dinner, or prepping a lunch for the next day. PLAN AHEAD OF TIME. Either make the decision to eat out (and set aside budget for that) or maybe make some freezer meals. I tried making a few crockpot meals to hold me over, but my fiancé didn't want to eat them (he was too nervous / excited and wanted comfort food every night). We ate out a lot. No matter what, try to remember to eat healthy so that you feel your best and have energy! If you gorge on mac and cheese because it's your favorite food, you may not like yourself very much later (especially if you are trying to watch your weight in the last few days). Lots of veggies and fruit.

3.) We held our ceremony [outdoors in our backyard](http://imgur.com/40LTD), and the aisle was [down a flagstone path](http://imgur.com/277CM) we have at the side of our house. Because there is [dirt / foliage](http://imgur.com/8H0ok), I bustled my dress up for the walk down the aisle, then when I reached the ""altar"" I had my maid of honor [un-bustle my dress](http://imgur.com/DEC6z) and [lay it out](http://imgur.com/tITbT) for everyone to see the detail on my small train. Just a thought for outdoor brides conscious of trying to keep their dress clean for photos.

4.) Before you get close to your day, have a serious talk with yourself / your significant other about what may stress you out the most. For me, if was financials - our budget was all planned and we were in perfect shape, but I knew I would stress about making sure everyone was paid on the big day. I absolutely did not want to have to think about it - so I pre-paid all my vendors 100%, other than tip, which was handled by my maid of honor. I know this is risky, and I'm not suggesting it to everyone. Be proactive about what may preoccupy you from having FUN!

5.) This isn't a new tip, but I'm hoping I can word it for you in a new way. This is YOUR DAY TO RUIN. Only YOU and YOU ALONE can ruin it for yourself. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I want all of you brides out there to remember that it's all in how you react to the things that happen that make or break you. Cake fell over? Salvage what you can, take some hysterical photos, send someone to the store for a sheet cake. First dance music screwed up? Tell everyone you're going for a drink and you'll try again when it's all sorted. The point is you can't make everything perfect, but it's purely up to YOU how you process it. Take control like the beautiful, elegant bride and woman that you are.

I did not invite anyone +1, and when I saw the email initially I got really upset. I didn't respond to the email and I'm glad I waited. 

After thinking about it, I realized that 
1. I can call my cousin directly, he is an adult and should have asked me directly.
2. After flip-flopping with allowing him to bring her which means changing the table arrangements, changing my catering order, etc. I have a clear and kind reason to decline his request.

Other than immediate family, I invited a total of 4 friends to my wedding, 3 of them are single and one is married. My parents did not invite a single friend, and my fiance's parents only invited 3 close couples. I know every one of the guests personally, and unless you live with your significant other, you did not get a +1. Every guest was invited by name. For these reason I'm going to let him know tomorrow that unfortunately he may not bring his friend who is visiting from another country. The whole she-bang is only 4 hours long in the middle of the day, but if she would like to come for dessert, she is welcome. 

For the record, he did this 5 years ago at another cousin's wedding, and we had to squeeze 13 people at an already crowded table. AND to add to the difficulty, I'm getting ready at this aunt's house. urg. 

**UPDATE:**  I didn't have my cousin's phone number, so I decided to call my aunt instead... She hung up on me when I told her the ""friend from Brazil"" was not invited. Ha.

I said I didn't invite my friends because I want to keep it small ""but he's your cousin!""

My fiance's brother asked me the other day if he could bring his girlfriend of 2 months to the wedding. I told him I was really sorry, but it was 12 days before and there was literally not the room. I even told him about the 3 incidents we've had with other family members swapping invites, bringing guests, etc. I was really nice because I do feel bad that he won't have her there, but (as I told him) we made the guestlist, sent out STDs (lol), and invites before they started dating. He seemed fine, like he knew that what he was asking was a longshot and expected it.

Fast forward to midnight, I get a text from him saying, ""I'm not coming to the wedding."" I seriously think he's kidding at this point because what. I reply back, ""You're kidding right?"" and get a, ""Nope.""

He refused to answer my phonecalls after this, turned his phone off. I check Facebook, and said girlfriend unfriended me. Yeah, because I really want to invite you now!

Of course I had a final at 7:30am the next morning, but I managed to get a couple hours of sleep after I puked up some of the anxiety. My fiance promised me that he'd come, said he was just being dramatic, and that he'd handle it.

It took me having a meltdown in his face the next morning (between finals) but I think he's coming now. I told him that he promised his brother that he'd be there, that I already had my best friend bridesmaid drop out because she didn't buy her tickets and didn't want to now (this was 2 weeks ago), that this had nothing to do with his girlfriend and if she ""took it personally"" as he said, that's her problem. This isn't about her, this is about it being our day and family.

He promised me he's coming, and I made him promise because I told him I couldn't spend the next two weeks, and especially the day of, in a complete panic that he isn't going to show up.

I still just can't calm down, I'm so angry with him for trying to pull this. I specifically didn't go into some rage about her being crazy, because whatever, that's his decision, but if two months into the relationship she isn't going to let you go to your brother's wedding? REALLY?

1371359930.0,30,self.weddingplanning,1gfv56,A long-ass cautionary tale: Why you need to be careful when you choose your bridesmaids,35,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1gfv56/a_longass_cautionary_tale_why_you_need_to_be/,"So, I've posted in here before, but due to some stalkerish issues (irl) I've created a new account.

Yesterday I was a bridesmaid in a good friend's wedding. She asked me to be a bridesmaid a few weeks after she got engaged, and I was pretty sure I was asked to be one because she didn't have nearly as many attendants as her FH. However, she's always been super sweet, so I accepted.
Shortly after, she confided in me that one of her good friends, who had actually been pretty absent in the last year, mentioned that she should be MOH (people, just don't invite yourself into someone's wedding party and don't pressure them to give you titles). My friend, always worrying about hurting someone's feelings, indeed made her MOH.

At first I thought MOH had it together. She was in constant communication with us and seemed to be making plans. I wasn't involved in the process quite as much, because the bride didn't want me to have two weddings to worry about (mine's in two months).

Dress shopping: We were told we could choose our own dresses from anywhere so long as they were a certain length, a certain fabric, and a certain color. MOH made a big deal about how her dress should be different, like with some extra color or bling or whatever. She didn't get her way on that, but she and another bridesmaid did end up with the same dress and she pouted about it.

The shower came along, and while the MOH did order favors and some random decor from a cute website online (http://www.bigdotofhappiness.com), bridesmaid #2 seemed to do most of the work as far as food and setting up since it was at her house.

Bachelorette party: At first, MOH planned on everyone staying at the most expensive hotel in town. When no one agreed to stay/split the bill, she had to change it, and then said ""well now I don't know what bar to go to."" She got there, checked in, and threw some random decorations on the wall. I paid for half the hotel room and I know that bridesmaid #2 chipped in for a fourth of it. I ended up deciding which bar we went to. No big deal.

Rehearsal dinner: MOH tells me why one of my good friends hates her: ""her boyfriend kept touching me and asking for pictures of me. It's not my fault he's gotta touch this."" Seriously? Classy lady right there.

Wedding day: We were allowed to start setting up at 1pm. Ceremony started at 4pm. Three bridesmaids (and bridesmaid #2's awesome husband and mother) frantically set up the reception area, stairwell, and gazebo for the ceremony. MOH arrived at 1:30, and at 2pm, declared that her makeup artist was there and she needed to go in the other room. MOH sat back getting her makeup done for the next hour and a half. It should be noted that no one else, including the bride, got their makeup professionally done, and we all had our hair done before the setup time.

At 3:30, it was pretty clear that we weren't going to be able to take pictures before the ceremony. I left the husband &amp; mother so I could go do my makeup and change. I told MOH ""okay, your turn!"" and she said ""I have to go help bride get into her dress for pictures and I need to get ready. Besides, I did all the work for the shower and bachelorette party."" Needless to say, she did not help finish setting up.

During reception: MOH didn't budge from her chair. I got most of the wedding party on the dance floor, but she refused, saying ""I'm not drunk enough.""

Post reception: We had 45 minutes to break down. MOH pranced around the room, licking icing off the cake, saying ""I'M SO DRUNK!"" Obviously she wasn't a big help.

So brides, before you pick your bridesmaids and MOH, don't base it on whose feelings might be hurt. Pick dependable people who won't piss everyone else off and who will make sure your centerpieces are all where they're supposed to be.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,t3_1gfv56,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1gfv56/a_longass_cautionary_tale_why_you_need_to_be/,

The part that we both find really sad is that I will not be able to attend the engagement party (FMIL is planning two of them), and we won’t be able to have a bridal shower for her because of the distance between us (FMIL is planning one for her without even inviting her bridal party from the NE). We won’t even be together to pick out the wedding party dresses or the actual wedding dress. 


I don’t know if this is a good idea, but I was thinking of ordering a set of Waterford champagne glasses for her and her finance and sending a letter with them suggesting they bring it with them to each of the occasions, so it’s kind of like we are all there with her. I was also going to try and con her finance into at least getting one picture of them toasting from each event so that I can add it to some kind of scrap book for the wedding day.

Backstory: When I was in college I met my two best friends (We'll call them Bella and Eve) and also another girl who would hang out with us every once in a while, but who I have never been particularly close with (We'll call her Kim). Kim is the type A personality and I am pretty laid back. It's not that we don't get along, it's just that if she didn't hang out with a lot of my other friends I probably wouldn't actively choose to be around her. She's also incredibly competitive and so one of my friends has nick named her ""The One-Upper"". She always has to be better than you. Be it grades, clothing, bragging about how many guys hit on her (this one is constant.), every little thing. She has to be better. She is genuinely a good person I think, I just can't stand her being competitive. 

Now Kim has been with her now fiance for almost five years (this fall), and she told him that she gave him a five year limit to propose. She literally begged him for YEARS to propose to her. And every time someone we knew got engaged she would get really depressed, frustrated and give him crap about it. Now, he's said to other people we know he doesn't even wanna get married, and it's really sad but he flirts with our mutual friends to the point where they have asked him to stop talking to him and he brags about having a crush on one of them (since I'm not that close with her, it's not my place to break that news as I have no proof that he's cheated or anything, but we all think he will someday…).

Fast forward about 4 years. My now fiancé (we'll call him Sam), proposes at the beginning of last month. I am ecstatic, we have been together for a little over two years and he's definitely the best person I've ever met in my entire life. My soulmate. When I tell Eve, she tells me I should probably tell Kim's boyfriend so he knows and is prepared for the crap he's about to get. I text him that night and then Kim the next day. They both take it well, although he tells me to take it easy on telling her as she's really wedding and baby crazy lately. Two days after I get engaged he proposes to Kim. She announces it on Facebook that next morning (before I had even announced my own and she didn't even bother to text me to tell me, but although annoying it wasn't a big deal). I announce later in the week.

Now Kim has been prying me for information about my wedding for the last month. She asks me when I'm going to have my wedding, I tell her August of next year. She schedules her wedding the first week of that August. I ask her where her venue is (hoping not to accidentally book it when I book mine), she won't tell me (""it's a surprise""). But when I tell her the region we are booking our venue at, she invites herself and her fiancé to our wedding. She insults my family when she asks what my budget is, I tell her that besides a little bit that Sam's parents are helping with, we're paying for it on our own. She asks if Im shocked my parents aren't helping. I tell her that no, they've told me forever they were not going to pay for my wedding. She says ""they can't? or they won't?"" Either way makes my family look bad. She tries to get info about my wedding out of my friends, just lots of stressful nosy annoyances from her for the past month and a half.

But the worst of it all, and what has me stressed out beyond belief is something that happened this last week. So, Bella and Eve are my two closest friends in the world. We are the three musketeers, just inseparable when we are near each other. After we finished college Bella joined the military. She most likely would have been my Maid of Honor had she not been in the military. I'm hoping she'll still be able to be a bridesmaid, but I'm not even sure if that's possible right now. I'm okay with that, and we have both talked about it and there are no hard feelings if she can or she can't be there. So I hint around to Eve if she would be my Maid of Honor a few weeks ago. She seems to get excited and I'm pretty happy. Of course I want one of my best friends to be my MoH. So this week I go over there and give her the little bridesmaid gift and card that I made and I ask her. She tells me she has to think about it. Kim has already asked her to be her MoH and she turned to her down, and being my MoH would really hurt her feelings. Now, Eve turned her down for a few reasons. One, she tells me she isn't all that close to Kim, and she's way closer to me as a friend. She was very surprised Kim even asked her to be a bridesmaid. Kim guilted her saying how Eve is her only friend in her wedding and the closest friend she has (Which Eve and I think both think is not true). Kim has two sisters and with one of them Kim was her MoH, so Eve and I both kinda figured that she would ask her sister. The other important reason she turned her down is Kim is VERY type A. Eve was afraid she would do something wrong unintentionally and Kim would flip out and cry (she does that when things don't go her way). Eve tells me that she really wants to be my MoH, that we're really close friends and she would love to, but she doesn't want to hurt Kim's feelings and that Kim would take it very personally. She tells me she has to think about it for a few days.

I'm getting so tired of Kim manipulating everything to go her way, and getting away with it. I really don't want to guilt Eve into being my MoH, but I would be really hurt if I couldn't have my best friend be my MoH just because it might hurt Kim's feelings. I don't really have many other options if Eve says no. One bridesmaid lives across the world, another lives across the country. Bella is not sure where she'll be, and the only other bridesmaid nearby is my sister (I talked to her already, we are not that close for sisters, she's okay not being my MoH and honestly can't afford it as she's just got out of school and might have to move to another state soon for a job. I will most likely be paying for everything for her to be involved in the wedding). 

I never thought I would feel this guilty asking someone to by my MoH. I'm guess I'm just looking for an outsider's advice and perspective about this situation. ",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,t3_1icsx8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1icsx8/how_should_i_deal_with_a_oneupper/,

I just want to see if /r/weddingplanning thinks this is a good idea or a terrible idea.*

I have this crazy wedding idea that has the potential to be awesome. I used to work at a summer camp, and the [main lodge]( http://ci.easterseals.com/images/content/pagebuilder/lodgeweb..jpg) has a lot of potential to be a [reception venue]( http://universalwebsites.theknot.com.s3.amazonaws.com/UniversalWebsites/WYSYWYGImage/7322624081294439/1892632/med/TimberPointinsidepic.jpg). [Bonus: It has a beautiful outdoor ceremony spot too]( http://www.romineweddingsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/434.jpg). 

Our closest guests would be traveling about an hour to get there. We would also have some people flying in from other states. The closest hotels to camp are about 20 minutes away in a neighboring town. I started to think…who’s going to want to travel all that way just for a ceremony and reception? And will we be able to spend quality time with everyone who traveled to see us get married?

So here comes my (not so?) crazy idea. What if we made our wedding into a whole weekend getaway? The camp rents out cabins to the public in the off-season. They have heat and AC, but they’re pretty rustic — standard camp bunk beds, cement bathroom floors, etc. But the price per person ($12-15) is pretty attractive considering that area hotels run about $100 per night or more.

So here’s my question: Would you personally be willing to participate in such a weekend? Do you think many people would? (I realize it depends on our guests, but I wanted to gauge general opinions). 

We would likely plan activities for the weekend to keep people engaged (ha) and having fun (see sample itinerary below). 

-

Friday evening:

5-7 pm: Arrive at camp, set up beds, get comfortable, etc.

7:30 pm: Welcome dinner at local restaurant (not paid for by the couple — just a chance to casually catch up with our out-of-towners)

9:30 pm: Campfire, s’mores, icebreakers, share stories/memories of bride and groom

-

Saturday: 

simple bagels/fruit/coffee breakfast provided by couple (there are no breakfast restaurants in the area)

11 am: weenie roast outside cabins, provided by couple

12 pm – 2 pm: Give people time to get ready

2 pm: ceremony at [lakefront](http://imgur.com/lVqRsiE)

3 pm: cocktail hour on porch

4:30 pm: reception at lodge

8:00 pm: start hayrack rides/campfire (our favors would probably be s’mores supplies)


**TL;DR: We are considering hosting our wedding at a summer camp, but many of our guests are traveling a long way to get there. Is a wedding weekend camp getaway a good idea?**

Edit: We would encourage people to stay at camp with us, but they would certainly be welcome to come just for the ceremony and reception, or to stay at a hotel instead.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,t3_1g7x9f,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1g7x9f/wedding_weekend_at_camp_yay_or_nay/,

Thank you.",36,9,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1fufwq/that_rsvp_i_sent_you_yes_it_does_need_to_be_sent/,"This post is for everyone at all stages of their engagement or marriage or anything not included in those two categories. It’s about letting the bride and groom know whether or not you will be in attendance to their wedding.

My FH and I sent out invitations for 130+ guests on May 20th of this year. As of right now, 18 days have passed since the initial sending out of invitations accompanied with their respective RSVP cards. We have 48 confirmed guests as of right now, and only about 7 saying they cannot come. We put clearly on our RSVP cards June 19th, which is 12 days from today. With over half of the people with no response whatsoever, we are somewhat concerned. 

In a situation such as this one, what is the most logical thing to do?
We asked people who have dealt with weddings if this is normal. The simple answer is yes. From my future MiL, she says that the same is going with the wedding shower (total secret from me, except for this fact). To add, she said that the same thing happened at her wedding in 1987. 

Tonight my FH and future SiL had a game night with one of her friends that got married in March, and I was pondering the same thing. I went ahead and asked her, and she said something that bothered me even more.

When she got people who didn’t RSVP at all on the phone, they acted smooth by saying, “Well of course I’ll be at your wedding”. She did say that the majority of the people that said this did show up, but in one instance, a family of 6 that said over the phone that they would be attending did not end up there. So she spent about $120 for people who she thought was showing up, but didn’t.

The majority of our no-RSVP is family, and we assume will be the same. However, here is my point:

When you get an invitation in the mail, put that invitation on your fridge &amp; mark it on your calendar. Next, request off work, if needed (of course, if you want to go). Then, send back your RSVP as soon as you know you can, preferably before the listed date. 

Once you have committed to going or not, you have made that choice. You must go if you say you are going. If you say you are going but all of a sudden cannot, make sure to tell someone ASAP that you can’t go. It may be $10 to a couple hundred dollars that the couple is saving by you telling them this. Although this may seem like a small amount, $10 could be part of their electric bill next month that they do not have to pay. Or $120 may be 3 months of cable and Internet that they do not have to pay. If anything, that is a better way of saying “Congratulations” than slapping them with a bill of something that wasn’t used. 

I want my guests to enjoy my wedding, and am willing to spend to money. But seriously; don’t waste my money. I sent you the response card with my address and a stamp. All you have to do is record your yes/no answer, what meal you want, and mail it. That's it. I don't understand how this is a problem across decades. I would appreciate if it stopped now, please.

**The update:** My dress finally arrived. It has two stains right on the front torso. I saw it without even having to move the dress or touch the plastic, so if someone had taken five seconds to look it over before shipping it, they would have seen it. It looks like it could be rust or something. There's also a giant wad of string/fuzz/something attached to the bottom. 

I called the store and they were, of course, apologetic. But the gal on the phone was also quick to say that although she had been the one to help me on the phone before, she didn't *personally* pack up my dress for me. Way to CYA. I've insisted they order me a new one and send me a UPS label for the damaged one.

I've had so much help and inspiration here over the past year while planning my wedding and I wanted to do what I could to give back. So here is everything I think may be helpful to those of you still in the planning process! 
I'm not going to claim to be an expert on any of this but I hope some of my experiences are helpful. All of the photos shown here are by my lovely photographer, Todd, of Come Together Studios. 

First, here is a list of my vendors for those of you who might want to cut to the chase. It was a western NY wedding.

**Wedding Summary:**
This was very much a DIY and not quite traditional wedding. 
My husband is Jewish and I am not, but neither of us are religious so we wanted to incorporate some traditions but have a secular ceremony. We had about 150 people attend. The ceremony was held outdoors overlooking a [waterfall](http://i.imgur.com/nzxqs.jpg). It was officiated by one of the best men who was ordained online. The reception was held in under a tent at another location in the park. 
My mom grew most of the [flowers](http://i.imgur.com/9wnuv.jpg) in her backyard, my dad made the [centerpieces](http://i.imgur.com/Ut5TV.jpg) (and cut down the trees they were made out of). I bought [Chinese lanterns](http://i.imgur.com/IsKVr.jpg) from the Christmas Tree Shops for $1 and  dyed them blue. We had a [Chuppah](http://i.imgur.com/x8pMJ.jpg), that my dad made out of trees in the backyard, and my mom and grandma decorated with Ivy from the garden. On to the details...

**The wedding**:

**Getting Ready [Album](http://imgur.com/a/WOqWf)**
The wedding party stayed in a gorgeous farmhouse nearby the entrance to the park, furnished with pretty antique furniture. It made for a great time and a perfect place to get ready. My love and I started the day by exchanging gifts while on opposite sides of a wall so we couldn't see each other. Then we got pretty and left for the ceremony!

**[Ceremony](http://imgur.com/a/95ner)**

We held the ceremony at 4:30 at this [gorgeous overlook](http://i.imgur.com/SfgZi.jpg). It had been raining all day, but luckily it stopped for just long enough for the ceremony and pictures to take place. 

The wedding party entered down the aisle. I had a maid of honor and a bridesmaid, he had two best men, and two grooms women. All the girls wore navy blue dresses of their choice, the men had brown ties, and the maid of honor wore brown. 

My dad and I came from [here](http://i.imgur.com/410fe.jpg), set to the music [Hoppipolla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkP_NaMsrMM). It was absolutely amazing to reach our guests with that music playing and to see the huge smile on my soon-to-be husband's face, with all of our family and friends there smiling. 

We had a close friend do a reading, then read our vows. Then my husband's sister-in-law performed the song Dodi Li. 
Then we exchanged the rings. 
The officiant  (our mutual best friend and one of the best men) pronounced us husband and wife, we kissed, and then we BOTH [broke the glass](http://i.imgur.com/tsc0c.jpg). 
We were announced, and walked up the aisle together with [bubbles everywhere.](http://i.imgur.com/nHynP.jpg) 

The guests proceeded to the reception for a cocktail hour while we did [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/llmKJ). 

**[The Reception](http://imgur.com/a/r3YVh)**

We had no DJ, just a laptop with a few playlists for dinner and dancing. 

[We were announced](http://i.imgur.com/fDzHT.jpg) to the song Marry You by Bruno Mars
We went straight into our [first dance](http://i.imgur.com/6OJbV.jpg). The song was Tethered by Sleeping at Last.
Then we did the father daughter dance and the mother son dance. 
Then dinner! We didn't want to keep our guests waiting for food.
Then we did speeches, [cut the cake](http://i.imgur.com/qeqEl.jpg), and did an anniversary dance for all the married couples. (Invite all married couples out to dance, ask couples married less than a year to leave, 2 years, 5 years… etc. until there is [one couple left](http://i.imgur.com/rky0f.jpg) ) We did that to ""The Book of Love""

Then we did the [Hora](http://i.imgur.com/CRgoE.jpg). SO. MUCH. FUN.
Then dancing! No bouquet toss or garter dance. 

It was so much fun. 

**My advice:**
* Don't worry about how many bridesmaids and groomsmen you have, or their genders. 

* If you are trying to save money, ask your family and friends to be a part of your day. We had everything we could done by people we love, and it meant so much to us for them to be involved. 

* Have a back up plan for rain. No matter what. I still can't believe some people refuse to do that. We had a shelter reserved just in case the weather didn't cooperate. Warm and dry guests are important. 

* Before you talk to anyone at the reception, sit down and EAT. Together.  Then you can be well fed and make your way around to talk to everyone during dinner. 

* Don't stress about the small stuff. Whatever happens, at the end of the day you will be married. If you just go with the flow and enjoy the day, you'll have a perfect wedding, even if you forget your bouquet and are 15 minutes late to the ceremony because you went back for it. Even if your hair gets messed up because the veil won't stay in. Even if you mess up your dance steps that you've been practicing forever because you've never done them in a wedding dress. Just laugh off the things that go wrong, because things WILL go wrong, and have a great time. My wedding was not perfect, but I had decided that I would not worry about anything the day of and be the most easy going bride I could be. 

* Delegate. Make sure the day of your wedding, you and your groom are not in charge of anything. Make sure you know who is supposed to do what, and make sure someone you trust is in charge. We had assigned different duties to each of the members of the wedding party, and to a few close friends. It made things fun and everything went smoothly!

* Keep track of costs. Keeping to a budget is hard sometimes. But you can do it! Shop around, keep a spreadsheet with all your expenses, and DIY what you can to save money. 

* Get started on that guest mailing list now. It takes forever to collect all the addresses.
 
* Hand address your invites. It is an extra personal touch that our guests loved. We did not pay someone to calligraphy them, because it just seems weird to me to pay a stranger to hand address something. I bought calligraphy pens and practiced for a while so I could do it myself. It took some time, but I was so happy I did it. Also, BUY EXTRA ENVELOPES. Even if you do have someone address them for you, they usually require 20% extra stationary. 

* If your fiancé wants to be involved and you are the bride, you are going to have to go to a little extra effort to make sure family, friends and vendors don't leave him out. Most people assume it's ""The Bride's Day"" and ignore the groom. It's really infuriating. Luckily, most of our vendors were pretty good about that. We split up who was in charge of emailing who, and made sure everyone knew it was a joint effort. Still, people will probably comment that the groom shouldn't care, or that the day isn't about him… just be prepared and don't be afraid to correct them!

* Schedule a time and place for your photographer to take your formals. Have a back up location as well. Telling them in advance is also good. And let them know if there are any special shots you want. I also say this as a wedding photographer. 

I hope that helps! And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I will update this post if I think of anything else!

I'd had a particular style of wedding dress in mind for myself for a long time--fitted, sweetheart neckline, mermaid silhouette, off-white--but no dress in my price range seemed to fit those exact specifications. My wedding is in just over a year and I was planning to go dress-shopping at the end of next month when my out-of-town bridesmaids will be coming to visit.

On a whim, I stopped into BCBG today while running some errands to try on a dress I kept coming back to on Pinterest but was concerned that it wasn't ""wedding-y"" enough. Lo and behold, it was utter perfection! [this](http://www.bcbg.com/Avi-Pleated-Gown/NQR6U561-114,default,pd.html) is the dress. 

I stopped into a bridal boutique that didn't require appointments to try on a few traditional dresses and make sure I wasn't missing out. Nothing looked anywhere near as good, even one that was very close to my pre-imagined ideal. When I showed the woman working there the photo of me in the BCBG dress, she said ""forget these dresses! You have to buy that one!!"" So I did :)

So excited to have gotten what I thought would be the hardest part of wedding planning (we already have the venue) out of the way!! AND for only $500, 1/4 of the budget I was allowing myself for a dress. Those of you who haven't had luck finding your dream dress--look at non-bridal shops for white or off-white dresses!!

Happiest day of my life. SO many things went wrong but the only one I truly cared about was that the photo booth didn't show up.

I had contracted the photo booth with a wedding-entertainment company here in Massachusetts. Through this Company, I contracted the DJ ($700), some uplighting ($900) and the photo booth ($900). The DJ was great, and he also installed the (battery powered) uplighting which- seeing in person, was NOT worth the $900 I spent on it.

The photo booth was a no-show, and my wedding coordinator spent a good deal of the reception on the phone, trying to track them down. Her advice to me was to get a full refund on what I'd spent with the company (nearly $2000) because this was a breach of contract. Not only had we planned to use the photo booth photos as favors for the guests, we had also planned to use the ""Memory Book"" they provided with the service as a guest book and had no other way to ask our 170 guests to sign in.

I figured I'd wait to hear what the company had to say- perhaps something awful had happened to the driver, in which case I would understand but would still ask for a partial refund. Today I had an email which stated that the photo booth tech had picked up the photo booth from the warehouse, then taken his mom shopping- during which they were both in a major car accident that they were brought away from in ambulances, and the photo booth was damaged. They tried to dispatch another tech to get a replacement photo booth, but they were all in use at other weddings.

I then had an email from the president of the photo booth company telling me that while it was very sad that I had no booth at my wedding, the accident was an ""Act of God"" (which, on the contract I signed, releases them from any liability as I understand it) and that it could have been a lot worse and that I was being unreasonable asking for my money back. He also said that he doesn't represent the Photo Booth company and that I was attacking him unfairly. Up until this point, I'd had no indication that they contracted out their photo booths.

At this point, I became furious. How is a car accident an Act of God?? Why did the tech decide to take the photo booth destined for my wedding out on a little errand with his Mom? Why wasn't there a Plan C in effect?

I guess I'm wondering what you all would do in this situation. In my anger, I told him that I wanted ALL of my money (nearly $2000) back, rather than just for the missing booth- but is that an over-reaction? I'd be happy to just pay for the DJ (as I said, the DJ was great but didn't have great things to say about the company). I did tell the president that I would be happy to involve my lawyer but he accused me of threatening him.

I've also left him a voicemail so that we could clear up any misunderstanding... but nothing yet.

TL;DR: Representative from Vendor company seems to be misusing legal jargon to get out of refunding me money, I'm ready to smack a bitch...",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,married,True,t3_1hg4qu,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hg4qu/looking_for_postwedding_planning_advice_a_vendor/,

And how do you think that it will be received?**



Here's mine:
I, a white girl from a Catholic family, am not getting married in a church, and I *might* just be wearing a red dress to my wedding. 

I'm getting married on July 9th, and didn't have a wedding dress. We're getting married in court, and having a ""fake"" wedding, a.k.a. the ""big"" wedding in October. We're just grabbing a few friends and getting married on a Tuesday, and drinking in the city afterwards. 
I wanted a simple, yet feminine white/off white dress that would still knock my fiance off his feet, but not scream **BRIDE, HERE'S THE BRIDE, HERE SHE IS, I FOUND HER!** 
I spent my weekend going to every store, thrift shop, garage sale I could find, and could find a white dress that wasn't 1. too short, 2. too ""beachy"" 3. patterned 4. too casual 5. just downright tacky

I was completely disenchanted. My friend suggested that I shop bridesmaid's dresses instead, saying that they tend to be fancier, but on the simple side. 

After many internet searches, I think I may have found (the other) one! I just ordered two dresses off of the J crew website. The [Mirabelle dress in Poppy Red](http://www.jcrew.com/wedding/Wedding_Bridesmaid/silkchiffon/PRDOVR~66737/66737.jsp) and the [Louisa dress in Champagne](http://www.jcrew.com/wedding/Wedding_Bridesmaid/silkchiffon/PRDOVR~47993/47993.jsp). I am IN LOVE with the Mirabelle dress, and wanted it in the champagne color, but since it was backordered, I said to myself *Damn it, screw traditions, I'll wear what whatever color I want! I'll get the red! Why not?* ...but got the Louisa dress... just in case I'm not brave enough. 

I know that was long, but I wanted to share my (pending) triumph in finding a wedding dress for my spontaneous wedding. 

tl;dr Couldn't find the dress I liked in off-white, so I bought it in red.

And then yesterday my mother posted on Facebook that she is so excited, my Dad just bought her a new wedding set and they are reconfirming their vows in May, complete with the wedding they never got when they were young.  I am heart broken.  My parents have acted out against me before but now I feel like this is a gigantic ""fuck you, we hate you for existing"".

So i did what everyone said and made sure to select some dresses from online, armed myself with friends to pull gowns since I heard they would be super busy and inattentive, and prepped for an awful experience. 


Holy crap, i had THE BESt experience! I went on a Saturday in June (yesterday) which i hear is the off season. There were only 2 other brides in the store. My consultant was ready within 5 minutes of my apt time. Not only that but two of the managers came over to say hello as well as another consultant to help adjust a gown when mine was off pulling more dresses. I took my time and wasn't rushed. My apt lasted over two hours and they were not upset. I was so impressed with the customer service!

I do think it helps to shop during the off season. But i just wanted people to know i had an amazing experience and it can happen at DB. Thanks DB in Cincinnati!  I love my dress!  Wish i could post a pic but the fiancé might see. I hope others can have an awesome experience too!

Seriously. I've always loved them and I think they look cool. I dont normally wear heels and I wasn't planning to wear heels on a day that I'm going to be nervous enough. I didn't want to worry about tripping or getting stuck/losing a shoe when I walk on the grass. I honestly did not believe my guests would think about them negatively.

So I go to a seamstress, recommended by a family friend, and I bring a pair with me (not the ones I plan the wear, just the ones I already had on and I explained they'd be brand new) and she literally berated me for 15-20 minutes about my shoes and why I need to wear heels and ""nice shoes"", not ""sneakers"", and it progressed into getting my hair done and wearing Spanx, or whatever, under my dress so I don't have ""you know, blobs everywhere"". I guess wearing Converse said to her that I don't care about my appearance, which couldn't be further from the truth. I think my shoes told her that I'm going to carelessly throw my dress on and just go and not worry about how I look instead of the day long process I'm actually planning in real life. Oh yeah, and my mom sat there and agreed with her... and all I could do was turn red and just agree and take it in hopes that they would just stop. It sucked and put me in a funk... but I'm ready to talk about it now.

SO... I know it's ""my day"" and ""do whatever you want"" but should I wear nice shoes to complete a certain look? Will brand new Converse really ruin a certain look?

I feel bad because she's obviously old school and I knew deep down she wasn't trying to hurt my feelings but I still don't understand why she made it her business to talk shit on my shoes for 15 minutes.

Of course, your timeline can vary. It depends on what you're doing for your wedding. Ours is a simple and short ceremony, with the basic reception events. We are also doing as many pictures before the ceremony as possible, without us seeing each other, and with one photographer.

* **4:00**   Wedding Party photos
* **4:20**   Dinner Starts

* **7:20**   Sunset photos of bride and groom (approx 10 mins if we decide to do this)
* **8:00**   Exit

We were so happy that she was able to send us a timeline! Some of the times are estimates, and I am prepared to go over or under on them, but just having a form to go with makes me feel so much better!

1360691658.0,28,self.weddingplanning,18dzi2,Negotiating with vendors... a few thoughts to share,33,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/18dzi2/negotiating_with_vendors_a_few_thoughts_to_share/,"Hi everyone! I've secured the last of my major vendors for my wedding and thought it might be worth it to share a few of my thoughts of the negotiating process. This is my second wedding, so I've learned quite a lot from both experiences. The first wedding was quite inexpensive, this next one is a little bigger. But a lot of the same experiences applied both times. 

I also know there are a lot of vendors on this sub and would welcome you guys chiming in to agree or disagree with any of my points!

Some important notes to remember in booking and negotiating with a vendor, to be respectful to them and your budget/wedding day experience:

* **Services are not a product...** Not all DJ services are the same, no two photographers are alike in their artistry, no two Coordinators will make the same exact level of commitment. You will be making a lot of apples to oranges comparisons during this process... embrace the ambiguity or it will eat you alive!

* **Services can be negotiated...** There may be physical items in this deal that will never cost lower than a certain amount (flowers, for instance) but DJs, Florists, Photographers, etc, are providing a service. They need to make their living and you need to not spend your life savings on a wedding. So there is a middle ground to be found. Typically prices on a website are a starting point for discussion, not ironclad.

* **Vendors are professionals...** A lot of them are very good at what they do. They really are. And it's not fair to insult them by asking for things for what could essentially be free (you wouldn't like it if someone came up to you at work and tried to get more from you than you can feasibly give). So be reasonable.

* **Some vendors are not professionals...** I spoke to a photographer who was clearly a great artist. But he had the attitude that he would be doing me a favor by shooting my wedding. He insulted photographers who charged lower prices, saying it was bad for the profession (these were photographers whose work was clearly comparable to his in beauty, not people who thought they were photographers because they bought a fancy camera). Walk away from these vendors. Even a strongly worded email will not teach these folks that wedding photography is a combination of both business *and* art (or that DJ'ing is equal parts performance *and* business, etc.). Just walk away. 

* **Professional vendors LIKE weddings and people...** They are curious about your story. They're excited when your fiance is involved for reasons other than he's got the checkbook. They can connect with something like ""oh we went to the same college"" or ""my wife and I also dated long distance"". That connection gets you even better service. And in rare cases (""oh we went to the same college"") got me an unexpected discount!

Negotiation notes (caveat here, in that my fiance is the true negotiator of us, I'm just musing on his tactics):

* **Know where you are starting...** It's a real long shot to negotiate with the vendor whose basic package 3 or 4 times your budgeted price. Don't waste your time or theirs. Look for folks who are 1.5 to 2 times your budget and work from there. And of course, consider folks whose advertised prices are already within your budget. 

* **Know what you want... (and be reasonable)** I compared photography packages for a month before I even started contacting them. Websites, bridal fairs, wedding blogs, etc. During that prep time, I could clearly see some patterns. A second photographer did not *always* double the price. A professionally-produced album quite often jumped the price between $800 - 900. This helped a lot when my fiance and I sat down to really look at what we wanted. We came up with our personal package (7+ hours, 2 photographers, digital negatives with printing rights, engagement session, no album). If we weren't willing to spend a fortune, this was the minimum we wanted to walk away with. We also knew the positives that we had to sell to them (e.g., the location is beautiful and would be a great add to the portfolio, reception and ceremony in the same place meaning no mid-day travel, a fun theme that would be cool to show to future clients, etc.).

* **Price is important, but not everything...** Most vendors are going to be turned off if the first thing you mention is price. I would be too! But they're not dumb. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it (unless they're one of those unprofessional folks I mentioned before in which case they'll tell you that you're not committed enough to your day if you're not willing to spend X). So it helps to talk about what you want (that's what that preparation period is for). Share your story and situation. Then start talking price. As long as you didn't target someone super far above your range, the conversation is easier for both at that point. They can tell whether your style fits their style. They may connect with one or more elements of your story that makes them excited to work with you over someone else asking for that same date. 

* **Think about it...** If you get what you feel is a good price, don't feel like you have to say ""yes"" immediately. If someone pressures you to say yes right away, that's a point to worry about. If they do have two clients asking about the same date, it's reasonable for them to say they need to know sooner rather than later (like ""I can hold things until the end of the week while you decide""). But same-day decisions on an important purchase are not good. (I also recommend never buying a car the same day you first walk on the lot!). 

* **Get the offers in writing...** Make sure there is an email chain. If I spoke to someone over the phone, I would follow-up with an email making sure that we were still on the same page (""so as I understand it, you'd be willing to offer x, y, and z, for this price""). Even the most business-minded and professional of vendors gets overwhelmed with a lot of requests for information (especially early in the year). Do both of yourselves a favor and make sure there's record of the convos. Once you've narrowed down a final choice, you'll want to see a full contract. But that's a post for someone else more experienced with contracts. :)

I hope that helps anyone who is unsure about how to go about talking to vendors. For the record, here is what my fiance and I negotiated, versus to what we saw advertised (I'm DIY'ing my decorations and flowers, so no Florist):

* DJ - Advertised for $1000, booked for $600. 
* Coordinator (""Day of"" only) - Advertised for $950, booked for $600.
* Photographer - Advertised for $2950, booked for $1700.

**TL:DR** Don't be afraid to negotiate with vendors if price is a concern, but make sure you treat them with respect. ",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1360691900.0,,2months,True,t3_18dzi2,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/18dzi2/negotiating_with_vendors_a_few_thoughts_to_share/,

In regards to planning, it's been fairly easy - bridesmaids picking their own dresses, ceremony and reception at my parents house on a creek. There are only a handful of caterers/ rental places that would travel, so those were easy to select, too. Bottom line, all seemed seamless. I'm even doing my own flowers from bouquets at trader joes. 

Here's the deal. I LOVE reading sites like offbeat bride, practical wedding, etc. I have this idea I'm going to go on a thrift store scavenger hunt and find everything I want for decorations. I like to think I'll make cute themed stations and my own alter and favors. And I'll do all that for under $100. 

Cue the meltdown and reality check. I am not good at finding treasures in thrift stores nor do I have the free time i thought for massive craft projects. So I've decided to let the scenery be the decorations. i had forgotten that was the original intent of having it at my parents.

1374780649.0,28,self.weddingplanning,1j1pxl,Should I un-invite my aunt &amp; cousin?,32,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1j1pxl/should_i_uninvite_my_aunt_cousin/,"Backstory: my mom and her sister (my aunt) have been feuding for years over numerous issues, mainly the caretaking of their mother (my grandmother). They barely speak to each other and it's well known among that side of the family. I've had no previous issues with my cousin. My cousin (female) has a steady boyfriend, is nearly 30, and still lives at home with her parents. Her two younger brothers who are 20 and 22, also live at home.

1 Month ago: We sent ONE wedding invitation to the household addressed to ""Mr. and Mrs. _______ and Family"". We decided not to allow them to bring a date because we have too many cousins of dating age and already had over 400 people on our guest list. We also sent only one (not 5 all to the same address) because...HECK...wedding invitations are expensive! Not to mention stamps! However, if we had received notice that several people coudl not make it to the wedding, I was planning on letting ONLY this cousin bring a date, since they had been dating seriously for so long.

3 Weeks ago: My aunt texted my mother and asked if her kids were allowed to bring a date. I told my mom to tell her no. But apparently my uncle had already asked my father, and my father had already told him that they could. (Which already raises flags as to why they had to ask twice, but not the point.) I immediately got on Facebook and sent a message to this cousin (and several other to avoid anyone being upset) to tell them they could all bring a guest and to just let me know their name so I could write out a place card for them. Simultaneously, my aunt writes a scathing email to my mother regarding who should take my grandmother to the doctors that week, which leaves my mother in tears. The next morning, my cousin created a brand new Pintrest board called ""THINGS PEOPLE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO!"" and the only thing she has posted to this day is an article on ""Wedding Invitation Etiquette"". My first reaction to all this was to immediately tell them that they are not invited any longer (all of them). It literally had me in tears because of how mean family could be to each other, for no reason at all it seemed. Not to mention, we're not close with this family. Both my parents pleaded with me not to do anything, especially not to un-invite them, for the sake of ""family"". 

My Dilemma: I'm afraid that seeing my aunt and cousin at the wedding will just bring up angry feelings, and that is the LAST thing I want on my wedding day. My fiance and I are dismissing each aisle personally, what do I say to them? I can't say, ""Thank you for being here!"" Additionally, they haven't RSVPed yet and the date is coming close. Do I call and politely ask if they are planning to attend? Or write them and let them know that since they didn't RSVP that they are no longer welcome?

I'm getting married on July 13th and am currently hunting for a new wedding dress. 

I took my off-the-rack find to the woman who does my dry-cleaning (she also advertises herself as a tailor). She altered my friend's cocktail dress and it turned out really well. What happened with my dress is that she didn't measure me at all and just took out a bunch of material uniformly from the side. She sewed the front details into the dress (?) and then kept letting it out and taking it in, basically just guessing at a size until I would approve. I don't think she ever had an idea as to how it should fit and now the shape is all distorted because she's adjusted it back and forth in random parts. She's had it for 6 weeks and still can't get the size right, but is maintaining that she doesn't see a problem even though I can hardly breathe in it and yet am not ""held in"" at all, it's sitting too low and gives me considerable ""back cleavage"" which i didn't know was actually a thing until I saw a photograph I made her take of it from behind. In addition, it's stained from all of the wear in her tiny shop (dust from a corner, I'm assuming) and there are other issues with the buttons on the back that indicate the dress is pulled far too tight (which she protests). She failed to even hem the dress (which she was meant to do weeks ago) and the bustle isn't done. There was other work I wanted done to the neckline but that is clearly not happening. Since the shape is so messed up, I'm trying to find either a seriously talented tailor who can undo all of the work and then finish the job in less than two weeks. I was mocked for my last-minute desperation by the first company I tried phoning today and promptly gave up. So at this point I'm just ready to call it a day and start shopping for rentals or something else tomorrow.

It takes a lot to really get my temper to a confrontational  level. That being said, I think I'm going to get into a fist fight with the bride's mother. &gt;.&lt;

The bride is marrying my cousin in August, and we've all been friends with her for many years so I was honored that she picked me. She has always had difficulties with her mother, but you just never know because it's a private thing and you would THINK people would pull together for such a happy occasion. Apparently, that is too much to ask...

To keep things as brief as possible, I'll try to summarize the things that have been accumulating int he past number of months.

1. Mother of the Bride is ALSO getting married this year. It was going to be in July (about a month before her daughter), but she thankfully changed it to October.

2. The first thing we did together was go to a wedding expo. They both entered a raffle for prizes and Bride won a $1500 certificate for a photographer (approximately 3 hour session). Mom was trying to be slick and tell Bride that she *already* had a photographer and she should give the certificate to her! Bride was ready to hand it over because she didn't want to her her whine, but then Mom won a prize, too! Phew! It was the only thing that kept Bride from handing the certificate over.

3. At the Expo, Mom made it a point to leave me out of the conversation when Bride brought up the wedding dress plans. She specifically pointed to Bride and herself and said, ""Yea, you and I have to go to the boutique soon."" Since I was trying to observe her and see how I was going to handle her personality, I didn't say anything at that moment.

4. Wedding dress selection day: Mom *also* selected her dress that day because remember, she's is also getting married! We spent twice as much time on her than we did on Bride.

Which brings us to today. Today was simple. We had already elected the bridesmaids dresses and color. All we needed to do was find the right size and order them. Mom insists she comes along. Fine. First of all, she doesn't bother to say hi to me (that is just not how we do things in this family and she knows it).Then, instead of watching her daughter's bridesmaids look through shoes and accessories and supporting her daughter, she spends the entire time looking at dresses and shoes for herself. She manages to get a word in when she wants to shoot down one of my ideas, and then goes to try on some hooker heels. And of course the last blow is completely ignoring me when we're all saying good bye. Bride tries to call her back and make her say goodbye; I tell her to not bother and I simply walk to my car and drive away.

I sincerely don't care if she doesn't like me and I have no interest in pretending to like her, but she is just making this difficult for her daughter. I try to be as smiley as possible, which I'm good at even if I'm irritated, but Bride can tell when her mother is pissing people off. I'm trying my best to keep the stress off of her because she deserves it and I want her and my cousin to have the best day, but it's entirely possible that she is going to make me bring out my petty, vindictive side.

After being on this sub for a few months, I've noticed that there are a lot of posts that tend to appear frequently. Namely, posts like, ""Should I have a cash bar?"" or ""How do I ask for x instead of gifts?"" or ""Tips for a Destination wedding?"" You know, perfectly reasonable questions that get asked *a lot.* So I was wondering--should there maybe be a FAQ on the side? Maybe something that points people to a whole bunch of posts answering their questions (as opposed to just starting a new one)? 

I think the majority of the posts in this sub pertain to fairly unique situations, and I'm not talking about cutting down on those. I'm talking about creating an easy directory for questions that get asked a lot, as well as maybe providing some good resources--a sort of guide to getting started for new planners.

Yesterday an acquaintance of my mom's (she's met this person once) came over and gave us a wedding gift of $200 because she had heard from a mutual friend that I'm getting married.  I've never met this lady. I've never even heard of this lady until my mom gave me the gift and card from her. My mom is now insisting that I have to invite her and her husband to the wedding (my mother is paying for the wedding). 

I don't want them there at all. I have no clue who these people are. I don't want to deal with redoing the tables to find a place where they might fit in. Is it an etiquette thing that I have to invite them just because they gave us cash? Or can I just send them a thank you card and leave it at that?

Before I say anything else, I wanted to thank you all so much for your honest opinions about my first post. I got a lot of perspectives from both sides, and that really helped me a lot, both at the time and with what I'm about to go into.

So, my fiancé called and asked if John could basically lay out how the weekend was going to go and to let us know as we get closer what things who would be invited to. John said that he could tell my fiancé now, so here's the conclusive list.

**Tux trying on day:** from 1pm-roughly midnight. Tuxes, a cookout, then bar hopping. Not invited. Technically John said I could go to the cookout, but I really felt like from what my fiancé described that it was a forced invitation that he didn't really want to give because he felt bad. So, I told my fiancé that I didn't want to basically self-invite myself to the thing and declined. People outside of the wedding party are invited to the bar hopping, but I am not.

**Rehearsal dinner:** not invited

**Cabin:** wedding party only, not invited

**Reception dinner:** technically invited, but my fiancé (as a groomsman) will be sitting the whole night at a separate table from me.

So that's the list. Again, I want to thank you all for your comments before, as they helped me to put into perspective that a lot of the issue may just be that they are focusing specifically on the wedding party and it's not an intentional personal slight against me.

However, at the same time... I'm going to be honest with you guys. I just don't want to go now.

I'm thrilled for my fiancé to go, because I know he loves them and will have an amazing time. But even taking all of your comments into consideration, I'm still really, really hurt. Only one other person in their entire wedding party has an SO. It honestly doesn't seem like a big deal to me to add 2 extra people to something like the rehearsal dinner, but that could just be me. Then when it comes to the reception... I know everyone in the wedding party, the groom's parents, and the other SO (but she and I aren't close at all). And that's it. So I will be sitting, alone, for the entire weekend, watching. And I know it's completely selfish and probably rude, but I just don't want to go to any of it. I'd rather stay in my own home and have a getaway weekend on my own or with girlfriends than to go 4 hours away to sit and be miserable all weekend.

On the other hand, maybe the whole thing is just emotionally charged to me right now, and I'll feel differently in a few weeks. Again, please let me know if you have any advice, and if I'm being ridiculous again. I'm almost sure I'm being more ridiculous/selfish/etc. this time than last time.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,t3_1arub2,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1arub2/update_my_fiancé_is_invited_to_friends_wedding/,
1362749350.0,25,self.weddingplanning,19wrt4,Inviting someone you really don't want at your wedding. I need help getting over this. (rant),32,7,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/19wrt4/inviting_someone_you_really_dont_want_at_your/,"So forgive me ahead of time for the wall of text. I need a bit of a rant. Not really any solutions needed, but I could use some opinions on the situation...


I will preface this by saying that I have never had any real issues with my future in-laws in the ~7 years I have been with my fiance...until this weekend. 


We started making the guest list over a year ago. At that time, my fiance's parents asked that a couple (J&amp;L) be added to the list. There's a problem with that...J used to be my mom's boss. My parents are very private people and I don't even know all the details of what happened. Suffice to say, he did something shady (not sexual or anything, just bad business practices) and my mom could have sued him for it. There is bad blood there. My mom even mentioned how she thought my future in-laws would want to invite J&amp;L, and I realized how hurt she sounded. So over a year ago, I told my FMIL that we would not be inviting them. She isn't happy about it, but she says okay. She told me she would need some time to tell her husband. I thought it had been taken care of...until the invites went out last month. 


That's when they realized that I was serious about not inviting J&amp;L. All this time, they had been going to dinner with these people and talking about our wedding as if they were invited. They went to dinner with J&amp;L around Valentine's Day, and I get a text from FMIL the next day asking me to invite J&amp;L. My fiance called his mom and talked to her about how we would not be inviting them. He told her there was bad blood and just to trust us. She later called me to say she had it taken care of. I said, ""I'm sorry. I know they are your friends, but I'm trying to take care of my mom here. I don't want her to be uncomfortable on this big day. I don't want her to have to deal with that."" Ok. Great. No problem....until this past weekend. 


I get a call from my mom and she says, ""You know, I think you should just invite J&amp;L. They are really close with ""future in-laws."" I will be able to handle it. I will just kill him with kindness."" Um. What? So I told her that I had put my foot down about this and that they weren't invited. It was already settled...I asked her what happened to make her say this. Apparently, my FFIL called my parents that morning to see if J&amp;L could be invited. He gave them this whole spiel about how they are such close friends and how J&amp;L are expecting to be invited. He asked my parents to convince me to invite them. My dad said, ""No. This is denganzenabend's and her fiance's wedding. You need to talk to them about it."" I was furious. Not only had it not been taken care of, now they were trying to manipulate me and my fiance into doing what they wanted!!!


So now the future in-laws have waited so long that there is no excuse that can be used without J&amp;L thinking my mom has cancelled their invite. I don't want to give J&amp;L the satisfaction of thinking my mom is standing in the way of them coming, and I don't want my mom to look bad at all. No matter what the in-laws tell them, they will think my mom just vetoed their invitation. Had it been taken care of over a year ago, they could have just said, ""Sorry. We are only having family at the wedding."" But no. Fiance and I decide that we have to invite them. It's the only way to save his parents from embarrassment and my parents from a bad image. My mom truly sounds like she is okay with it. I think she wants him to see how well things are going for her, and I think she wants to ""kill him with kindness."" 


So basically, I got manipulated into inviting people that I truly did not want at my wedding. I'm having trouble with this whole thing. My fiance is upset because he can't believe his parents did this. He doesn't think they were trying to manipulate us, and he had to talk to his mom while she was crying and upset at the aftermath of my conversation with her. He feels stuck in the middle, while I'm so mad at them that I don't want anything to do with them anymore. I can't help feeling manipulated, and that sense of trust and respect is completely gone right now. /rant


Thoughts? Opinions? Any advice on how to move forward from this? Am I being a bridezilla? 



TLDR: I feel that my future in-laws manipulated me into inviting my mom's shady ex-boss. They did this even after I told them a year in advance that he wouldn't be invited. I'm upset and angry. My fiance is stuck in the middle, and I'm not sure how to move forward.  



EDIT: Wow!! I didn't expect this to blow up so much. Thanks so much for all your kind words. It's nice to know that I'm not crazy, and that this really was a breach of trust. I want to say one thing though: My fiance's parents are *not* villainous people. Yes, I feel manipulated. Yes, I am upset and hurt. Yes, I have lost my trust in them. And yes, I think that they seriously broke our relationship when they refused to listen to me for *over a year* about this. But my fiance's parents have loved me and treated me as their own for nearly 7 years. I believe that is why his mom was so upset after I spoke with her about this. She realizes that she has done damage to an otherwise great relationship because she didn't want to face the awkwardness of telling their friends no.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1362769634.0,,married,True,t3_19wrt4,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/19wrt4/inviting_someone_you_really_dont_want_at_your/,

The gowns should have come in two or three weeks ago. 

Every time I would call the shop, the owner said the shipment was delayed. We ended up calling the manufacturer and they have no record of an order from Adrienne's. She took our money and never ordered the dress.

Reps at the company that makes the dress actually inspected the shop a week or so ago after getting so many reports of fake dresses and failure to deliver on FULLY PAID ORDERS. 

My wedding is in five weeks. My bridesmaids can't afford to lose the deposit they put down. Luckily, my mother is offering to help with some sort of quick replacement. I don't know if we're going to go to a department store or what, but with bridesmaids scattered as far from New York as Calgary, Canada and California, it's going to be a major pain in the ass to coordinate and get done.

I can't believe I've been so focused on everything else. After a complete meltdown yesterday, my fiancé reminded me that all he needs that day is me. That as long as we have each other, everything else will be okay. He made me toast, ran me a bath, and told me to go read our vows again.

Forget the wedding, I'm excited for my husband.

Take a deep breath brides and grooms. Everything that goes wrong will be worth the prize at the end.

My dad told me recently he has no clue what to say for the speech during the reception.

I hope I do not offend anyone with this question! However my partner and I have been discussing this a lot lately. As I'm sure a lot of you are in the same boat, we are a young couple with student loans, a mortgage and other debts that we are responsible for. We want to get married next Summer but are kind of spazzing about how we are going to afford to hold a wedding for a minimum of 106 people. 

So my question to you is this? Are you paying for the whole thing yourself? Or are your families paying? If you are paying yourself have you saved up all the monies for your budget or are you taking out loans? 

Any and all comments are welcome :)

We had a sleepover the day before dress shopping, and if I was to do it again, I would have tried to get them to meet even sooner, and maybe even invite the groomsmen over for a day out with them, too.

My bridesmaids consisted of my high school friend, my sister, and two college friends who didn't really know each other. I realize now that it has to be tough to be thrown into a group where you know close to nothing about the other person, but you're expected to get along and plan with no problems.

Having the day to hang out and chat about non-wedding stuff was great! I made them lunch and dinner (and breakfast the next day before we went out) and I was blown away how much my old and new friends got along! While I cannot speak for them, I'm sure it was a little bit easier for them to plan things together afterwards versus having the maid of honor send a message to everyone saying ""So, um, I don't know any of you, but pitch in $50 for the bridal shower!""

It even made a big difference in the bachelorette party and even the wedding reception. I got texts from my fiance on his bachelor party complaining that since some of the guys didn't know each other, and one was trying way too hard to be funny and it was getting embarrassing. I felt like my bridesmaids were old friends meeting up for drinking and dancing.

On the dance floor, it didn't matter as much on who was single and who wasn't...they danced with each other and kept the reception fun!

I've been using vistaprint for a lot as of late, due to good quality and great price.

They send you a garment bag, tips for care, and a little pamphlet letting you know that **they will reimburse you for up to $75 of seamstress work for sizing.**  All in all, price to quality is good!  The reason I ordered from them to begin with is that they are American based and accept returns up to 10 days after arrival.

[Second post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1imokf/update_i_am_this_close_to_scrapping_everything/)

After a few awkward and painful conversations with my parents, they *finally* acknowledged that maybe we were in over our head and couldn't afford this wedding after all. This has been particular hard for my mom, who feels like she has failed me (her words) for now being able to pay for the wedding she always wanted me to have. I think she kept insisting it would be ok because she thought that, somehow, we would be able to come up with the money, but honestly it's extremely unlikely that it will happen at this point, and I know I don't want it badly enough to ask them to go into debt for it (I know they would if I asked for it, that's how much they want to do this). It really sucks that it's come to this, but it's reality. We simply cannot afford the wedding we planned.

So, our new plan is to slash the guest list. Dramatically. At this point, it will be our immediate families (parents, siblings, and grandparents) and our closest friends. Probably around 25 people altogether. (Basically what I've been asking for since the very beginning.) Right now we are ironing out the logistics of moving the ceremony to a smaller space, I think it'll work out nicely, actually. We are also talking about hosting a casual family barbecue in May that can double as wedding reception/graduation party before we leave for our honeymoon.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Unfortunately, there's still some hard work to do. I've spent the last 6 months telling my extended family about our wedding plans, and now I have to tell everyone that they're not invited after all. I feel really awful about it, because I really do love all my aunts and uncles, and I'm afraid that some people will be really hurt when we break the news to them. I think this would have been a lot easier if we had decided on a small wedding from the beginning, but now we have to backpedal and un-invite people.

So my next question is, how do we go about telling my extended family members that we changed our plans and we're not inviting them to the wedding after all? What's the best way to to do it to minimize hurt feelings? Should we be upfront and blame it on the finances?

Finally, I'd like to offer up a huge thank you to everyone who chimed in on my other two posts and gave me great, supportive advice.

I got married last weekend and it was perfect, but a few days later I started getting snarky, pissy, and passive aggressive responses from friends about why they weren't invited or were invited on such short notice. Backstory: we moved up our wedding date and had to do some major cutting to our guest list. We had the ceremony at a park where we were only supposed to have 30 people and the reception was pot luck style at our house. We ended up going over 30 and decided to say screw it and invite another 10+ people the week before the wedding. Still we couldn't invite everyone we wanted to invite. We did send out emails about 6 weeks beforehand to people we would have liked to invite but just could not for logistical reasons and let them know we'd celebrate with them at a later date when we could afford to have a bigger party. So flash forward to when a couple of the last minute invitees never responded and then days after the wedding I get a message saying they were upset and offended that they didn't get invited sooner. Still others who didn't get an invite sent emails saying they were surprised and how did they not hear about this (though they had been informed). And then there are those who haven't said anything directly but are playing the passive aggressive vague status update game on Facebook. I wish I could go back in time and do something differently, though I don't know what. Part of me is upset because now when I look back on the week after my wedding I am going to remember feeling guilty and apologetic that my wedding couldn't be what THESE PEOPLE needed it to be for themselves, never mind that it was OUR wedding and who cares about how we felt that we couldn't have the wedding we'd originally planned on.

Important points are bolded:

-**future Sisiter In Law (fiances brothers swife) used to work as a pastry chef at a hotel** about 6-8years ago. She is about 32 and I'm 27yrs old.

-after my engagement she offered to make our wedding cake, I said that would be nice. Money was tight (and is tight for her family too) so she laughed that it could be their gift to us and she wouldn't have to worry about finding something. For the record,we don't expect gifts and would rather people come and have a good time than worry about what to buy.

-**she wants to start a cake-making business, **but it is a long way from being up and running.

-3 months later I asked her again about the cake and she says she didn't realise I wanted her to make the cake, so I said yes we do.

-2 months after that, we've only had a discussion about it (mostly to do with how difficult it will be) and **her plans of what she wants to do aren't fitting in with what we want.**

-she has mentioned that she is looki forward to making it, and being able to use the pictures for her portfolio.

-**she's since made two practice cakes (over styrofoam)** to enter into a local show and one cake for a family members birthday. The two cakes came last and **I was really dismayed at the quality of them.** The cake for the birthday was **near inedible.**

-**her dad has just been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer**. I don't want to add extra stress or expectation on her.

-I haven't heard from her in about a fortnight when we previously would email each other several times a week.

-my mum is paying for a good chunk of the wedding, and we managed to renegotiate a contract and saved her about $600 'spare' that my mum wants to still contribute.

-my fiancé and I have had a consultation with a very good professional baker who specialises in wedding cakes, and they can do whatever we want and their only intention is to give us a nice cake that we are happy with. **The professional's cake quote came in under the extra money budget.**

-I was planning on (and have started) making my own gumpaste decorations for the cake but it's getting to be too much effort and I don't want the stress of trying to get enough done and have them look good enough. I see it as a whole lot of effort for something that isn't eaten and won't even last once they are near the moisture of the royal icing.

I'm worried about offending her, but I need to tell her that we have chosen to go with the professional baker. I really just want them to not have to worry about anything to do with the cake and just turn up to enjoy the day. I feel she is not ready for this type of job yet and I know that I don't want to potentially be upset with her if she makes an indelible, poorly decorated cake again. I know how judgemental I am and I know it's a character fault...but I don't want to risk being in a situation where she disappoints me. With my future in laws family I know they hold grudges about the silliest things so a) I don't want to be a part of that mindset and b) there will be *something* we do either inadvertently or deliberately that gets somebody pissed off....so we can't please anyone.

I wanted to be able to help her with her business but it has shifted the focus from us having a nice dessert to serve our guests, to keepi somebody else happy.

It is making me sick thinking about how we can handle this. I need to talk to my future MIL and get advice from her. The SIL has a bit of a wedge between her and the rest of the family due to her attitude and behaviour so MIL has seen it all and can hopefully help me too.

My mother said she just wants us to not stress and be happy with what we choose, and to be diplomatic when we make us choice. Reading between the lines she would rather us go with the professional too.

Any help or constructive advice most welcome. It probably sounds like the biggest first world problem, but it's the issue of how to deal with the sister in law and minimise her hurt feelings that I need help with.

I've been busy Googling trying to find an alternative to throwing a bouquet at the end of my reception.

Has anybody, or is anybody planning on, not throwing a bouquet? If so, what, if anything, did you do instead?

There are a few reasons for me not wanting to throw a bouquet:

-my actual bouquet will be heavy and I worry about it crashing into something or someone.

-the venue is actually too small to effectively throw a bouquet anyway (plus has a low ceiling in the seating area).

-there will be very few single girls there, and I definitely don't want to alienate them or make them uncomfortable.

-it seems to me like a waste of money on a throwaway bouquet.

The best idea I've seen so far is to give it to my Grandma. But if I would make a 'thing' of it, or just give it to her quietly at the end of the reception...I'm not sure.

Another option I thought was that I could ask my mum or uncle to take it to lay at my other, dearly departed, Grandma's grave (I would do it myself but I am leaving for the honeymoon the next morning).

Does that sound too morbid? We regularly go and lay flowers for her, and I miss her so much and wish that she could be there for my wedding...

I'm thinking it will be easiest just to take off my dress and put it back on, however I don't know how difficult that will be.  I've taken it off and on for fittings, and while I need help it isn't too difficult.  The bathroom at the reception hall has a bridal area, too.  We could lock the bathroom door, go to the bridal area, I take off my dress, to into a stall to do my thing, come back and put it on again.

and we already live together. I anticipate that we will have trouble creating a registry
 because we already have so much stuff. While talking to my future husband's grandmother, 
she suggested an alternative to the bridal shower. Back when she got married, a bridal 
shower was not about giving gifts. Instead, it was an opportunity to prepare the bride 
for domestic life. Recipes were given to the bride to help her prepare for entertaining 
family and friends. In the case of his grandmother, she also received homemade jams,
 jellies, and other preserves.

After talking with her, I had an idea to do a recipe and advice shower.I was
 planning on mailing out a letter seeking recipes or marital advice from all of the
 wedding guests. I may include a pre-printed page for everyone to fill out. I would
 take all of the things I receive and bind it into a book. 

My question is: Is this appropriate? I'm just worried that people may ignore it

If you want the full story, here is the reddit link: http://redd.it/zrp2b .  As time wore on, she showed over and over again that she was not mature enough to handle being a bridesmaid. Things had not gotten better at all, so yesterday I broke almost every etiquette rule and did the unthinkable. I requested that she step down from being a bridesmaid. She hung up on me and immediately started texting my fiance. I knew that this would probably ruin our relationship, but I was left with no other choice. Her issues with us were escalating and it was getting worse instead of better. I was having wedding nightmares almost every night.  She has vowed never to speak to us again.

Honestly Reddit, I didn't want it to come to this. I was hoping that everything would work out for the better. However, last night was the best night of sleep I have had in a month, and it feels like a giant weight was lifted off of my shoulders. Does being relieved make me a bad person?

My advice to anyone getting married is really seriously think about the people you want to be in your wedding. Ask yourself:
1) Is this person a mature adult who can handle just about anything?
2) Is this person responsible?
3) Is this person dependable?
4) Is this person going to be there when I need them?
5) Is this person selfish and self-centered?
6) Is this person going to complain about anything? Or everything?
7) Can this person afford (time and money) to be in a wedding?
8) Does this person have other priorities (an infant, small children, a demanding job, college education, another wedding) that may create a problem?
9) And most importantly, am I going to REGRET asking this person to be in my wedding?

Reddit, please learn from me. Don't make the mistakes that I have made. No one deserves to go through what I have gone through. This has been hell on myself, my fiance, and his parents. Seriously, learn from me.

1307463528.0,24,self.weddingplanning,httzu,Got married a week and a half ago. My experience for anyone who's interested.,25,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/httzu/got_married_a_week_and_a_half_ago_my_experience/,"Got married 11 days ago in a smallish ceremony. My experience:

* We had a small wedding (about 35 guests) far away from home on the Friday before Memorial Day. We drove the 900 miles and stayed with friends for a few days before the wedding. No matter what you do, the last few days before your wedding will be stressful, things will take longer than you want them to, and before you know it, someone will be telling you ""it's time."" I was getting dressed and joking around with the photographer and my bridesmaids when someone suddenly called ""it's time!"" and I was like ""really? already?"" Before I knew it, there was music and my dad was walking me toward the altar.

* We had a short outdoor ceremony in a gazebo. You won't remember a word the minister says, so make sure you get a copy of the ceremony so you know what you've agreed to. When I got to the altar it looked like my groom was getting watery eyes and I had already decided I wouldn't cry no matter what. I started making hand gestures and generally acting goofy to lift the mood. It went over well, no one cried and everyone told me I was a hoot. Have fun, it's your day.

* We had a buffet-style meal with sandwiches, salad and pasta. Between taking photos and greeting everyone, my groom and myself hardly tasted the food. It was delish, and I remember wanting more. The bridesmaids and groomsmen did us a solid by setting up the bridal dressing room with food and drinks and they made us go in there alone for about 10 minutes. It was really nice to get to sit down with my husband for a quick bite to eat. Make sure you get time with your new spouse.

* We had our cake made by a fellow Redditor and it was absolutely delish! Of course we forgot to bring a serving knife so my groom and I made it work with 2 plastic knives. Things will go wrong. Just smile, be playful and people will think everything is perfect. We got so many compliments on that cake and it was absolutely gorgeous.

* My groom and his best man stayed up until 3 in the morning putting together music for the reception... then we hardly used any of it. Scope out your reception location and if there's not a huge dance floor, don't stress about the music too much. My groom agreed to let me pick the music we'd walk out to after the ceremony. The look on his face when the first few lines of Bon Jovi's ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" came out was priceless. Pick something fun to walk out to.

* Getting a great photographer is key! We had so much fun with our photographer and we got amazing pictures. She posted some of them last night and more are on the way and I am ecstatic! Find someone who does amazing work, let them know what you want, let them have some artistic freedom (they get paid to do what they do for a reason) and treat them like a guest. They need food and water and breaks as much as anyone else (probably moreso since they're following you around trying to document everything). If you drag them around in the heat, don't give them breaks and generally treat them like crap, how can you honestly expect them to do the best job they can? Treat them right and they'll treat you right. So far, [we love the pictures she got.](http://i.imgur.com/oNPGo.jpg)

* Make arrangements for leftover food. We had a lot of leftovers and, luckily, one of the guests was having a bonfire party the next day and made good use of the food. But if no one has space or need for leftovers, you'll be throwing a lot of money (and delicious food) down the drain.

* It will be hard, but try to have a conversation with every guest. I felt bad that we invited people from out of town and I didn't get to spend much time with each of them. I think I had an actual conversation with everyone, but I can't remember (it goes by fast) and that kind of bothers me. We did make an effort to get tons of pictures with our immediate families and bridal party and after the cake we had the photographer follow us around so we could get pictures with all the guests.

So much more happened and I'll answer questions if anyone has them. To be honest I was feeling the stress the day before the wedding and I really started regretting not just going to the courthouse. But then the wedding came... and I wouldn't give that day up for the world. It was amazing being able to see everyone we love, bring them all together and show everyone how much we love each other. It made me realize that my family really only fully comes together on 2 occasions: weddings and funerals. And it's really hard to reminisce about time spent with family at funerals without bringing back feelings of grief for your lost loved one. Give your family something joyful to celebrate.

Oh and you can have an amazing wedding without breaking the bank. Our biggest expenses were venue, photography and food and our final tally didn't come anywhere close to those bridal shows you see on TV. We told a little fib to the florist and got all the flowers for $50... just by saying the words ""anniversary party"" instead of ""wedding"".

The venue, the tables and chairs the food the decorations the timing plan.. Everything. We finally got to the point of putting down the deposit on the venue and the coordinator quoted us about 2500 more than the original verbal conversation. Needless to say I was a little upset. I emailed her back and explained that she had added a lot of things that we didn't need or want and she came back with another quote that was still 500$ more than the original quote. BAH. In addition to her being hard to contact and not all that interested in our wedding I finally had had enough and in a spurt of motion went into super hyper drive. 

That weekend we went to see another venue where the coordinator was so excited about our wedding that he gave us hugs! Bonus! He knows that our budget is a little small for this new venue ( the Max Theatre in Detroit) but he is going to work with us and help us make it happen. 

I just wanted to say, 8 months out and I had to re-plan everything! Good thing I had enough time to make this decision and not just get roped into paying the 500$ more than what we budgeted for. 

Overall, we are paying more for some things and less for others but the overall experience will be better at the new place.

Because of the self-moderating nature of the subreddit (if there's advertising, someone usually flags it pretty quickly), things get handled.  But sometimes you WANT to hear about that band that was awesome.  Or there's a new wedding planning app available you might really like.  Or the venue you were kind of thinking of booking has dropped the ball on the last three weddings it handled.

There's theknot, weddingwire, offbeatbride - of course. But we'd also like to introduce /r/weddingvendors

Anyone who is posting advertising to /r/weddingplanning is encouraged to post in this subreddit.  It's new.  It's got very few posts, but it has the room to grow.

Please feel free to post about the vendors from YOUR wedding whether it's rants or raves. (I have to admit, I've been slack.  But I had some AWESOME vendors that I worked with and I'd like to encourage others to use them!)

I was confused, but only for a few minutes. 

She was calling to tell me that God had put something on her and her husband's hearts.  At this moment, my heart started pounding, because it's been an awful week and I honestly expected to hear bad news.  Maybe it was only that they wouldn't be able to attend, but I just had this moment of anxiety like ""OH NOES.""

*""I've been so preoccupied with this feeling all week and I can't even focus on what I'm doing because I needed to tell you.  God wants us to give you a gift.  It's not for your Future Husband, that part was very clear. It's a financial gift and it's meant to go toward your wedding. Does that make sense?""*

I started crying, because the amount she told me was shocking (I've never been the beneficiary of a financial gift before) and **exactly** the amount that we were over budget.

This woman does not know me personally, only through family friends.  She went on to say *""The only stipulations to the gift are that you don't tell anyone who it was that gave you this, and that you spend it on the wedding. It doesn't matter on what aspect of the wedding - whatever little extra you weren't able to do before we want you to be able to take care of.  God wants you to know that you have sisters in Christ -- a family that loves you.""*

My fiance has been stressed over the budget (we are like, *shoestring*, and I actually prayed so hard on Saturday to win the Powerball (first ticket I've bought in a year!) it wasn't even funny), and things really were a little more than we were hoping it would be.  You know how the little things add up, right?

Anywho, this was a major blessing for us, along with all the other little blessings like people working with our ridiculously low budget in all aspects of the wedding, as well as being available on the freaking PRIME WEDDING DAY of June 8th.

We don't want to be having to deal with driving all over (or getting chauffeured around)  on the big day.  We found a reasonably priced hall that'll let us bring in our own food AND provides bartender services, etc.

My husband was invited to a friends wedding. Neither of us are really close to the couple and the only other mutual friend either of us have with them is my ex boyfriend from long ago. I worked with the dude half (let's call him Ben) for many years and we played music together sometimes, but this was in our late teens. We are in our 30s now. 

Weird part: It was only my husbands name on the invite. As I know wedding etiquette goes, you don't ask if your partner is invited if it doesn't say ""Mr &amp; Mrs"", ""plus guest"" or have a second name. There was no RSVP card, just a ""Let us know if your coming! [1] blahblah @gmail.com""

When we got married, only Ben was invited because they weren't even dating at the time. The guy half of this couple shows up with his new girlfriend, no call ahead or anything. To bring a stranger, uninvited, to my formal, small wedding was kind of... strange. And rude. But, I let it go because I liked the dude as a friend and his GF turned out to be cool.

Here we are, years later and they are getting married. Awesome! We all really got along, though we haven't hung out often at all. The last time we saw them was in the fall, and that was randomly. We are all FB friends and all that, though.

I come home to find a wedding invite in the mail. Addressed to my husband and only my husband. The only person HE would know there is my ex-boyfriend. Awkward, much?

So here we are.

I'm not gonna get all butt hurt about it and cause drama/stop being their friend, but REALLY? SERIOUSLY?

Something like ""catiebug and catiebug's fiance have known each other for so long that back when they met...""

* Pluto was still a planet.
* Facebook was -2 [read as ""negative two""] years old. 
* A single quarter at (our alma mater) cost $604. It now costs $2,208.
* The Terminator had only just been elected governor (paving the way for the bride and groom to have his signature on their diplomas).
* Nobody had ever heard of the term ""wardrobe malfunction"".
* Less than 10% of the world used the Internet and they used it for an average of less than 45 minutes per day. 
* World of Warcraft did not exist, so the groom still had a social life.
* Gmail did not exist.
* GM still manufactured Oldsmobiles.
* Jeopardy had not yet experienced the reign of Ken Jennings and Friends was still on the air.
* The Boston Red Sox were still laboring under the Curse of the Bambino, having not won a World Series since 1918.
* Halo was still just Halo.
* Netscape was still a thing while 95% of the world used Internet Explorer (some of you probably still use Internet Explorer, which the bride and groom beg you to stop doing). 
* You could still fly from New York to London or Paris on a supersonic jet. 
* Only the richest people had iPods and there was not an app for that. 
* It took 12 and a half minutes to download a single song.
* The TV series Firefly debuted on FOX and despite what anyone may tell you now, nobody watched it then and it was cancelled. 


It's been fun picking out things that relate to our interests (video games, sports, computers, etc.) or our history (school and travel). But I need more items!

Can my fellow wedditors think of anything to add to the list (funny or interesting)? Anyone who is famous for something now that we would not have thought attributed to them at all in 2003?

I finally decided order of events, it has been bugging me since we got engaged and I have been trying to figure out ways to please family and friends as well as doing something that reflects our personalities and tastes, isn't going to cost a fortune and where we can involve everyone we want and it has been A NIGHTMARE. Grandparents want a beautiful ceremony and peaceful day, mum wants to manage the whole thing alone and doesn't trust anyone else to do it right, I just want to celebrate with my loved ones and my fiance just wants to get married (duh)..

and so I came up with a split day.

We will have a gorgeous midday ceremony, with soft music followed by champagne, and a large afternoon tea, we will be able to socialize and talk to all of our family and really enjoy the company and it will all die down and be over by 6pm, this gives all our older relatives a chance to get home early, the day doesn't drag on and no one ends up tired and exhausted.

After this, all our friends (and anyone who wants to stay on) are invited to a privately hired venue. There will be cocktails, toasts, speeches and plenty of food and we can all celebrate for as long and as late as we wish, there is accommodation for plenty and the following day me and my new husband will be able to fly off to our honeymoon.

Feels so good to finally have a foundation, It isn't until November 2014, but I am a firm believer that if your prepared and organised and know what you want then everything will be perfect and I wont be stressed... Recipe for success! Just wanted to share :D xx

1360087900.0,23,self.weddingplanning,17y05z,Honest opinions relating to kids at a wedding. ,26,3,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/17y05z/honest_opinions_relating_to_kids_at_a_wedding/,"Ok, I'll start by saying my reasoning behind this question. First, let me say that I LOVE kids. I got my degree in teaching, so I'll literally spend the rest of my life around them every day. I never considered NOT having them at my wedding. 

However, a few months ago, I went to my cousin's wedding and another one of our cousins brought her kids. One of them was about 3 and one was a little over a year old. Literally, almost the whole ceremony, the 1 year old was whining. They were a few rows behind me (I didn't even know who it was until afterwards) and it was very distracting and hard for me to pay attention (as I imagine it was for others). I sat there the whole time and wondered why that person didn't get up and leave to calm the child. I mean, usually that's what people should do. I've always seen it as rude to just sit there with a crying child and disturb everyone (is that just me?). 

When I found out it was my cousin whose child was acting that way, I was mortified because I was totally hating throughout the whole ceremony (haha). However, now that I am engaged, it worries me because this cousin will pretty much HAVE to bring her children because there's no one to keep them (my mother says her husband just ""doesn't do that."" Great husband, huh?) 

What I'm asking is, is there a way to handle this without being totally rude? Could I arrange seating and have someone specifically sit her toward the back and on the end so she can get up if need be? Could I actually have someone ask her to leave should her child be loud? Could I set up a child care area at my wedding? How has anyone else dealt with unruly children?

Could use some advice!,27,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/17g1mh/sad_sister_situation_could_use_some_advice/,"So, my three sisters and I are pretty close. The only thing I ever dreamed about my wedding, other than awesome dress, was that I would have all of them with me. Thing is, I have two military sisters (Go Navy! \^-^ ) so we've kind of been holding our breath for the last eight months waiting to find out if they will be able to get leave. Got really excited because last month they both figured out that yes they could!

Then, a few days ago one of them text me saying that she wouldn't be able to make it, because someone had informed her wrong as to the paperwork or something. I couldn't help but cry a little. I love her very much, and I'm so proud that she is out there helping protect our country. Just got my hopes up, you know? Feeling a little squished right now.

So, I'm trying to figure out a good way to incorporate her in the ceremony... can't do Skype, cause she can't access it out on the ship. So far my idea is to make an origami flower bouquet out of giraffe paper (giraffes are really her thing) and hang it on a shepherd's hook where she would be standing. Also, send her tons of pictures and a video of the ceremony.

**TLDR; Love my Navy sister, really sad she can't make the wedding and looking for non-skype ways to incorporate her**

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the great ideas! I think what I'll end up doing is having her write a speech that another sister can read for her during the toasts, hang the bouquet of flowers where she'd stand, and maybe have my FIL mention her when he does the blessing for the meal. \^-^ I think all these little things will make me/her feel so much better about her not being able to come.

We're having a wedding with 200 guests.    

We went to three different places, and the last place had these amazing huge tiered cakes priced at $3.50 per slice.  They were stunning, but a little out of my budget, and I commented to my mom that since we would have so much food, maybe most people wouldn't eat the cake anyways, so maybe we should just order a tiered cake for like 150 people instead of 200.  So I asked the consultant at the bakery how big a cake would be for 150 people, and did she think it could possibly feed 200 if they cut smaller slices.  The woman told us that the cake for 150 people is exactly the same size (18, 14, 12, 6) as the cake for 200 people - because there's a range for how many people the cake will feed. So then I said ""oh, so it's the same price for 150 as it is for 200 people?"", and she said ""no, you'll pay $3.50 per slice for 150 people instead of 200"".  So in the end, we ordered a cake for 150 people - it's exactly the same size as the cake for 200 people, but we're saving almost $200.  

**tl;dr**: ask the bakery what the serving ranges are for the different tiered cakes, and order for the lowest number of people for a given range - you'll get the same size cake and pay way less money.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,True,,,True,t3_sy1y6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/sy1y6/wedding_cake_moneysaving_protip/,

1306693857.0,23,self.weddingplanning,hmy0z,I am a wedding/party planner. Here are some useful tips and feel free to AMA.,25,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/hmy0z/i_am_a_weddingparty_planner_here_are_some_useful/,"I've planned 45 weddings and 15 parties. I'm currently working on 2 weddings so I know how stressful it can be trying to meet budgets and make everyone including yourself happy on your big day. Here are a few insider tips to help you save money and stress.

1. May,June and July are the peek of wedding season and are the months when everything costs the most and the dates the hardest to get. It's much cheaper to have your wedding during off season during the fall or winter.Also, changing leaves and snow can make for some breath taking photos.

2. Do NOT scimp on the photographer!!! You will regret it for the rest of your life. You do not want to look back in 2 years or 10 or 50 and go WTF was I thinking? What was this guy shooting? The biggest part of your budget should go to first the food and then to the photographer.

3.If you want to save money select a non-wedding venue. You may have to get creative in your serch but places like museums, art galleries, theaters, resturants, upscale private homes, aquariums,zoos, and parks that are not normally ""wedding"" venues will often give you a better price but are often more accomadating and willing to throw in perks. Perks can include: Free parking, tables, chairs, china, sliver wear, linens,pre-made maps, and coat service.

4. Read EVERYTHING and understand it before you sign a contract or pay for any service. Take your time with it and ask questions if something is unclear or worded in a way that you don't understand. This is one of the biggest mistakes people make in wedding planning yet it seems like the most obvious.

5.Buy items that do not have the word ""wedding"" attatched to it or come from the ""wedding"" section of a store. The mark-up on ""wedding"" items is amazing. You can easily pay 3x as much for the exact same item that you could have walked 2 aisles over and picked up. The difference you ask? One has ""wedding"" labled on it and the other dosen't. Take unity candles for example: a set of 3 white pillar candels with ribbon around them boxed as ""wedding unity candels"" costs $40. Yet in the same store, a few feet away, is the regular candle section where you can get 3 white pillar candles for $10 and can buy ribbon of your choosing for around $2. $40 vs $12 and a few minutes worth of work. Shop around and don't be scared of a little do it your self.

6. Do it your self as much as possiable. There are many great free tutorials on youtube and on wedding forums for everything like: Flowers, decorations, hair, make-up, invatations, aisle runners, cake toppers, place settings,ect.  Just make sure you do multiple trial runs well before the date and you give yourself plenty of time to do it. Plus you have a back up plan.

7. If you are on a budget and want a designer wedding gown, shop used. oncewed.com is great, also check wedding forums, ebay for an actual seller, craigs list, and local classified. BEWARE of the knock-off dresses from China. They are all over ebay and have several websites. They promise designer dresses for around $200-$700. These are cheap un-licenced copies of the dresses and the quility is not even close to a match. Some girls get lucky and get dresses that can be saved by a seamstress but most end up needing a new dress and they are out the money that they spent on the cheap one.

If you aren't into the designer gowns and just want a simple dress or a dress of color, check out prom and formal wear dresses. Bridesmaid dresses are also a cheaper choice. If your set on having a ""wedding"" dress check out salons that offer destination gowns. These are gowns that are normally simpler and more flowy and much cheaper than a regular wedding gown.

8.Do away with the whole wedding favor for the guests thing. It's a waste of so much money that you could have put to something else. No one cares or remembers or wants anything they've ever been given at a wedding. Most people leave them on the table or throw them away shortly after getting home. Put the money toward good food and booze..your guests will remember that more.

9.If you want to save on the catering bill you may want to opt for a cheaper menu. You could go for an hors d'oeuvres only or a dessert only reception. You can also opt for a cake and punch only reception. These should only be done at non-meal times(2pm-4pm and 8pm to 10pm) and should be printed on your invites.
Some other options are brunch and buffet type receptions. 

Hope some of you find this useful. I'll add stuff as I think of it!

She suggested that my dad contact whomever gave the flowers and ask if it was alright if we had them sitting there for our wedding.

Lo and behold, the woman who had given the flowers was an old friend of ours whom we hadn't spoken to in some time. Her son and I were best friends growing up, but we have also lost touch. She had given the flowers in rememberance of her husband, who had been tragically killed in a car wreck about 6 years ago. So, my dad called her and of course she says yes, and she also calls the florist to ask if they could make the flower arrangement ""happier.""  It was so sweet of her!

Now, I'm writing thank-yous and I am sending her one as well. My problem is with the wording.

I sent a text to all confirmed guests on Friday telling them ""Three weeks and one day til the wedding!"" and also telling them that hotel blocks were closing very soon, and gave them phone numbers to the hotels (again).  

Since then, one of the groomsmen was over at our house and asked, ""When's y'all's wedding again?""

As we're from Texas, we have a LOT of traditional/conservative family/friends. I didn't want to take his name, and he completely understood. I didn't want him to take my name either, and we don't have any names in our ancestry that are particularly interesting. So we've decided to take a completely new, entirely unrelated name and make it an identity for the new family we're going to create together. Starting fresh, right?    
    
So that's all fine and dandy, but how do we tell our friends and family? We're getting down to the wire and we just now decided this is what we're going to do (I struggled with the guilt of not following tradition for a while). We'd like to announce it during the ceremony in some way, but how do we say it in a way that doesn't blindside everyone or sound weird or defiant? Does anyone else have any experience in the matter?    
    
EDIT: Ok, ok. I understand that telling them in the middle of the ceremony would be too much of a blindside. The problem is we haven't officially picked the name yet. Saying we do in the next few weeks - how would you suggest we tell people? Word of mouth seems a bad idea, because then I feel people would interpret us as being like ""we think you did it wrong, so we're doing it this way. Burn your bras, ladies!"" instead of ""there's more than one right way to do this, and we think this is best for us, that's all"". Would an insert in the invitations be okay (about to send those). I can't talk to people personally because I live across the country. I'm afraid people would still be blindsided if we put it on the wedding website, because not everyone would look at that. E-mail? Facebook? How do I make this personal and reassuring instead of a perceived cutting of ties?    
    
P.S. We told both of our immediately families, and they get our reasons and are very supportive and excited for us. We are lucky to have some amazing people as our very nearest and dearest, but our extended family...well..we'll see.

As a disclaimer, I guess you can categorize me as a ""mason jar"" wedding because I live in a rural part of Oregon, the venues I have to choose from are vineyards and barns, and to be quite honest if I could afford it I would serve my champagne in crystal flutes and dance the night away in my custom Lazaro gown and Louboutin Lady Peeps but since that can't happen: babies breath and mason jars will have to do. /rant

* him write a letter for me to open on the wedding day

* picture with me in the dress, from fitting appointment this weekend

* photo charm on my bouquet to ""walk me down the aisle""

I'm not asking for much, but in some cases, these groomsmen live in a different time zone, which has required travel-planning.

I've had to help them with places to find flight deals, and reserved their hotel rooms. They've booked a return flight the morning after the wedding that would require them to leave the hotel at 5am. This would be fine, except that they haven't rented a car, or booked a shuttle, or communicated in any way that they intend to exchange tickets for a later flight, so the passive onus is on me and the bride-to-be to possibly drive them back (no) or book a shuttle for $200. It's a 2-hour drive from the venue to the airport. In that specific case, the groomsman have less money to afford the costs, and one of them is unemployed. I've specifically said that exchanging tickets would be cheaper, but neither of them has said anything other than ""as long as we don't get stranded."" Thanks.

On top of that issue, there's little things causing anxiety: not everyone has gotten their suits together, no one's stepped up to give a speech at the reception (or at least told me about it, but I have asked them collectively), and I've asked one of them to volunteer with helping set up a photobooth, but no one's responded. When I call them up or send emails to get updates, the more it seems like I'm nagging. Part of why I'm in this dilemma may be because I led by trying to be as accommodating as possible, but now I need them to step up and handle themselves, their suits, and their travel plans like grown-ass adults.

I'm stressed and anxious and depressed, so I need some help in finding a rational way to be more proactive and direct, without coming off as nagging, or at least, no longer caring about nagging. Am I approaching this incorrectly? If this is just paranoia, what can I do to reassure myself?

I really do need help/advice with a somewhat delicate topic regarding invites.  I'll try and keep this short and only add in the important details.

To say my mom and I don't get along would be a huge understatement.  We hardly speak to each other, and the past few times we have it ended with us getting into heated arguments.  Less than a year ago she up and left my family (dad and siblings) for a guy she had been seeing for ~6 years.  This is where most of our disagreements have come from lately, especially since the guy is hardly a year older than I am.

My mom is invited, but not involved in any way with the wedding.  She keeps going back and forth on whether or not she is going to even come, but I'm sending her an invite in the mail and I do want her to be there.  However, her boyfriend is absolutely not invited.  This is nonnegotiable, not even for a minute.  I'm so entirely set against her bringing this guy that I will have basically hired guards with his picture to make sure he isn't anywhere near the ceremony or reception.  Aside from me not liking him, this is such a delicate and recent situation that there is no doubt in my mind that someone (my dad, an uncle maybe) would get into a physical altercation with this guy.  I don't want any of that.  I don't want to remember my wedding day as the day I also had to bail my dad/uncle out of jail, or the day one of my aunts went ape shit crazy on my mom, or the day my mom brought the child she dumped my family for to the happiest day of my life up to that point.

In addition to her not bringing him as a plus one, I don't want her to bring anyone.  Since leaving my family, she has also left nearly all her friends, and (to my knowledge) everyone she hangs out with are into many illegal and ""underground"" activities.  It may be selfish, but she cannot bring someone like that.

Part of her issues come from mental problems (bi-polar and depression), and while I know that because of these things not everything she does is really her doing them, she is aware of the problem, has been for years, and chooses not to seek the help she needs.

This is my problem: I don't know how to tell her without upsetting her to the point she A) doesn't come or B) brings the guy/someone else just to upset me.  I don't know if I should make her a ""special"" invitation, give her a call to tell her, or simply leave the guest/+1 off the invite.  The wedding is coming up in a few months, and we are planning on sending the invites off in ~1 Week (sending them earlier than usual and not sending STDs).  If anyone has been through something somewhat similar, or has any ideas of advice, I am all but desperate on what to do in this situation.

I'm having a really hard time trying to reconcile this.

My fiance and I are getting married in less than two months (December 1). Almost everything is in place; dress, tux, attendants, venues, caterer, cake, dj, officiant, the whole nine yards. Then yesterday I was taken completely by surprise.

My fiance wants to be a doctor and is working his way towards medical school. It's no secret that medical school is super expensive and most doctors spend decades paying off their student loans. Well, my future father-in-law works within our state's university system, and his position would allow my fiance to go to any state university with his tuition comped up to about $300,000 with no age cap, just whenever he finishes his degree. And then, if all of the money hasn't been used by the time his degree is finished, we would get the difference. The only catch is that my fiance has to be able to be claimed as a dependent on his dad's tax forms. That means he can't be legally married.

Too much time and money have been invested in the wedding to call it off or postpone it now. So it's been suggested that we follow through with the ceremony and just not sign the papers.

I won't lie. I cried. A lot. Hard.

I feel ridiculous and selfish, but that just isn't how I had ever pictured my wedding going. We would still have our rings and we would still tell people that we were married. I could still change my last name. So I don't know why I'm having such a hard time being okay with this. It's just a piece of paper. But some small part of me almost feels like without it I would just be pretending--playing house.

But this opportunity is too good for him to pass up. He wouldn't be in debt and we wouldn't spend the rest of our lives trying to balance a home budget with paying back student loans.

I'm so confused and stressed and I can't think straight. Does anyone have any advice they can give to try and work through this? It would be much appreciated...

Was that the wrong thing to do?,26,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/xmzih/i_wrote_a_notsogood_weddingwire_review_was_that/,"I got married last Saturday, and while most of it went very well, we did experience a few small issues that felt like huge issues in my mind.  The biggest issue being that we had a buffet, and my guests were not provided forks for it - that's right - no forks.  Apparently while some guests asked for forks, others thought it would be rude to ask for a fork, so they didn't, and no one at the venue noticed that people were eating with their hands.  My husband and I were running around the whole time and didn't even get to eat, so we didn't notice until about an hour in when I saw my dad picking up his food with a napkin.  That's when I realized there were no forks.  I had to track down a waiter and ask them to provide forks for everyone.  It wasn't until then that they brought out the forks for the buffet.  Now I know forks are a small deal, but it really irritated me, especially when a number of our guests came to us after the wedding, and mentioned the lack of forks - that was just honestly pretty embarrassing for me.

A second issue that we experienced was that we ordered kids' meals for all the kids at our wedding, but they all got them about an hour after the food service began.  It just felt unfair to me that the kids, many of whom were cranky and hungry, had to wait so long to eat, while their parents all had food.  

Anyways, after hearing about these things from multiple guests for a few days, I decided to write an honest wedding wire review for the venue.  I wrote that the venue was beautiful, and everything was great, except for the lack of forks and late kids' meals.  

Well, I got an email from the venue the next day asking me why I didn't go to them with these issues, and instead, wrote a poor wedding wire review.  They made me feel so bad about writing the review.  In my mind, there was no point in going to them about it, as I didn't learn about the issues until the wedding was over, and at that point, I felt it like saying something to the venue would only hurt people's feelings, so instead, I just wrote it in my review as things for other people to think about if/when they decided to have a wedding there.  Was I wrong to write a poor review, rather than approaching the venue?  Is there anything I could have done differently?  I just feel so horrible about it, as I wrote wedding wire reviews for all of my other vendors, and they were all really positive.  Now I feel like maybe I got some people in trouble at the venue or something, I'm not sure.  I just feel bad, but I was just being honest.

My wedding is October 4th 2014, and its going to be pretty casual, and laid back, I would like to take my BM out where we can all shop/buy their dresses shoes accessories, so they look coordinated without matching. We won't be going dress shopping until next year, but I'm big on planning ahead.

Price has been discussed individually, and the consensus is a quality-wear-again dress under $175 is what they'll be deciding on. 3/4 ladies are going to be in the plus size spectrum, so that's a deciding factor in what store we should try. My question is:

Where can I take my BM shopping for their dresses?

I was thinking that Macy's and Younkers were okay to try but I don't know much about their plus-size selection, and I am blanking on any other nice (not too expensive) stores we can go to as a group.

I haven't heard back yet about a time or location, but... we'll see. I'll keep ya posted. Thanks for the advice everyone. Hopefully I won't need it. :/**

Remember when I told you guys about the photographer that ended up having to bail on me due to her due date falling basically on my wedding? Well, I am having some serious issues getting my deposit back from them.

Let's see... I originally had spoken with her on May 13th, and she assured me that I would be getting my money back. So I waited.

And waited.

Two and a half weeks went by. I contacted her again. A few days later (now over three weeks out) I got a response back from her. ""Give it a few days to see if it'll turn up; if it doesn't, we'll cancel it and send another one out.""

Three days later, it showed up in my mailbox. The check was dated for June 5th, but the postmark was the 13th. I'm not stupid, but I opted to let it slide. Deposited it on the 24th (first chance I was able to get out to the bank.) And whaddya know, it bounced. So on top of having $550 less in my account than I had anticipated having this month, I have also been hit with fees. Needless to say, I'm livid.

Normally, I'd be all for paying for all of this stuff on card. But my mother is paying for the wedding, and she didn't even make a debit card an option; she wants literally everything in check form. So I don't know what my options are now. I let her know about the check bouncing, but I have yet to get a response from her. I feel like she's now purposely avoiding me. I'm willing to give her a couple of days (in the likely event that she is doing weddings this weekend) before I start calling down the fire and brimstone.

I guess what I really want to know is if this is in fact lawyer-worthy, or if I need to try a few other options first. I am just so freaking upset that this is happening... objectively, I can say maybe they had the money in the account when they first sent the check, and it was my fault for not depositing it immediately upon receipt, but honestly I'm not feeling like that's the case. Given how hard I had to fight to get it sent out at all, I feel like they were just trying to stall until they couldn't anymore.

BIG Irish Catholic family--my mom is one of nine, all of whom have kids, some of whom ALSO have kids. We want a small wedding, thinking 30 people for my side, 30 for the bride's and 30 for our friends, with 10 leftover for wiggle room. We're paying for it all ourselves, so we're keeping it as small as we can while still being respectful and including the most important people. Queue my mother.

""I have people I want to be there, and if that goes over your number, I'm going to pay for it"" Note the phrasing.

""Um, mom, I understand you want to do that, but we'd prefer to just keep it small and keep it to our number. There's some wiggle room up or down within reason, but we'd like to keep it ours and small.""

""The people I want there are going to be there, or I'm not going to be.""

Granted, I left out a lot of the more emotionally charged parts, but that's what my last hour boiled down to. Yes, I realize that I'm writing on the internet from my own perspective and that I might be unreasonably representing her and her opinion, but both of those quotes from her are verbatim. It's two years out, but we plan to pay for and plan it all ourselves, and this all comes from her wanting to throw an engagement party for us with 150+ people (not all of whom we want at the wedding, for size and price reasons). And we WANT it small not just for price, but intimacy. This isn't a ""We would like a huge wedding but we can only afford X"" so much as a ""No, really, we only want as few people there as we can get away with without pissing anyone off."" I am NOT ceding control to my mom. If we let her pay so she can just invite a few more people, she'll want to pay for something else if she can just change x or y about the wedding itself, and I'm very much getting a ""This is my wedding!"" vibe from her.

We've got the guest list down *exactly* so we can start addressing the envelopes (which took weeks of nagging to get some of his family's addresses/contact information out of his mother, who kept promising to get it done, but then never did it). 
While this is happening, my mom keeps assuring me that I don't have to invite anyone I don't want to, but I gave both her and dad a couple of spaces each to invite someone they're friends with, on the condition that I at least *know* the person. The idea of having total strangers at my wedding irritates me. Dad didn't want to invite anyone (he's kind of an introvert) and mom invited a few of her work friends that I know and like, and a family friend I only sorta-know, but she's nice. 

Then the other night, mom messaged me with ""Ugh, we have an obligatory invite to send out. My boss and his wife invited me to their daughter's wedding."" 

No. No no no hell no.

 For one, mom's already used up the spaces I gave her, and one of dad's that he didn't use. We're already over the venue limit by 10-ish people (but we know several won't be able to attend because of travel/costs). 

Secondly, I hate her boss. So does my fiance. he's rude, he's cheap, he micromanages my mother to the point where she *hates* her job. She turned the store around from failing to successful in just six months, and now he's changing the rules on what qualifies her for monthly bonuses. She worked hard and helped his business succeed, and he's trying to screw her out of money that she earned. He's also a Knight of Columbus, an organization my fiance *hates* as he feels they strongly misrepresent his faith, and the boss is very pushy about it. Not to mention when my mother fell at work and fractured her elbow, her boss talked her out of filing for Worker's Comp because he just ""couldn't afford it"" what with putting his daughter through college. 

We really, really hate this guy. So no, he doesn't get an obligatory invite. I don't *care* that mom says he's not likely to show up. Neither me or my fiance like him even the slightest. But apparently his wife mentioned how they're eagerly awaiting the STD, and mom realized we'd 'have to' send them one.

I told mom to give me their information and I'll call and explain that while we'd love to see them there, we're keeping the ceremony extremely small (we're not) and only extending invitations to close family members. Mom reluctantly agreed, but she seems upset that I'm standing my ground on this.

1352746731.0,21,self.weddingplanning,132q6d,Can you talk me off the ledge/help me get excited about my wedding? ,22,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/132q6d/can_you_talk_me_off_the_ledgehelp_me_get_excited/,"I want to preface this whole post with one important fact - I love my fiance &amp; I am very excited about marrying him. We've been together for about 7.5 years now &amp; I can't imagine being with anyone but him. Right now our plans are to have a small wedding in August 2013 in Las Vegas with our families &amp; a few friends, between 40-60 people. We're both 24, if it matters to anyone... (Quick edit, I forgot to say we currently live in NC, about an hour from my parents &amp; grandparents. His family is exclusively in CA/AZ.)

I just can't get excited about *planning* my wedding, for several reasons. I was hoping if I just list them out maybe someone can give me a verbal smackdown (or hug?) &amp; help me out of this mental funk I get into every time I try to plan. **How did you/would you deal with these issues, ladies &amp; gentlemen of Reddit?**

1. (Most importantly) Our families are from opposite sides of the US. His family lives in (&amp; can't afford to travel far from) California &amp; Arizona, while mine lives in (&amp; are too old to travel far from) North Carolina &amp; England. I had accepted the fact that many of my English relatives wouldn't be able to travel to the US for my wedding, so I agreed to having the wedding on the west coast, since that would allow the most people to come. But in the 5 months since we agreed on a location, my grandparents' mobility has gone seriously downhill, to the point where they physically cannot travel &amp; I really want them to be there. Even Skyping the ceremony to them wouldn't really solve it, because my grandma is mostly blind &amp; both grandparents are pretty hard of hearing. Has anyone invented the transporter from Star Trek yet? I could really use one about now... 

2. (More selfishly) I don't really have any girl friends to plan/get excited about the wedding with. I'm frustrated because I haven't started making plans because I haven't resolved #1, but it's also because I don't really have anyone to talk about it with. My fiance is a wonderful guy who would get married naked on TV if that's what I said I wanted, so it's hard to get any concrete ""I want this"" or ""I don't want that"" answers from him. My best friend (&amp; ""man of honor"") is a gay guy that I've known my entire life, &amp; while he is great for bouncing ideas off or venting to, he's not a flamboyant or girly guy either, &amp; I don't want to force him into helping with stuff he's not normally interested in. I have maybe 2 good girl friends, but they both live very far away from me &amp; we haven't been as close lately as we used to. How can I get over this? I know I don't *need* other people to plan my wedding, I just want to have fun with it like every other woman seems to!

3. (My problem &amp; I have to solve it, just need to rant &amp; get it out) I just lost my job about a month ago, &amp; while I'm looking hard for a new &amp; better position, there's nothing in sight. My parents &amp; my fiance are encouraging me to go ahead with planning the wedding but I'm a realistic person &amp; it feels wrong to be planning a wedding while we're struggling to cover our normal bills. My fiance says ""Don't worry, you'll get a job soon!"" but who knows when ""soon"" will be? My parents say ""You need to reserve your date &amp; start finalizing details sooner rather than later, it will get more expensive the longer you wait"" &amp; I know they're correct but that doesn't change everything else. My first instinct is to wait another year to get married (we have an exact date for a reason, so we'd have to wait til August 2014) but then I have to take the chance that my grandparents &amp; some of my English relatives literally may not make it until then.

To anyone who actually reads all of this, thank you so much. If you have any ideas, words of encouragement, tips for how to kick myself in the ass &amp; get over it, pictures of kittens, etc, I would greatly appreciate all of it.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,1352754105.0,,,True,t3_132q6d,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/132q6d/can_you_talk_me_off_the_ledgehelp_me_get_excited/,

One of my bridesmaids just got married but she had two wedding dresses, one which she didn't wear because it ended up being too small (she bought it a long time before the wedding and her figure changed from little boobs to big ones). It looks like it will be a good size for me and it is [beautiful!](http://imgur.com/tQdan) She offered it to me today and said if it fits I can have it. 

I am still a student and don't have much money for a wedding so this would be really great for the budget and it is so pretty. Is it right to take it? 


**Edit: Thank you everyone for the input! I will be sure to get it cleaned after and give it back to her so she can sell it if she wants to. Love the idea of buying her bridesmaid's dress! I was hesitant because it was a really expensive dress ($1500) and I am not use to people being so amazing. I will be trying it on when she comes to visit next week, if it fits I will be honored to wear it! She made it clear when she offered it if it doesn't work for me she won't be offended at all.

A slight rant.,23,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1i9q4l/loosing_excitement_in_planning_my_wedding_a/,"I've been engaged to fiance almost a year, been together almost 5 years. I love him to death. Our wedding is August 2014 and I'm now just kinda starting to plan.

I've been hesitant about it all because I'd rather go to the courthouse and get married. But my fiance wants a wedding for personal reasons, which I totally get.


My rant starts with the fact that I ordered save the dates last week. We weren't going to do them but decided since we still have a year we'd order them so out family and friends would have time to prepare (those that need time off/plan traveling, ect.) So I order them and I am REALLY excited because its my first step towards planning this thing. I text one of my bridesmaid about it and she replies stating that she thinks its a stupid idea and that I'm making a mistake and that she didn't do them for her wedding. Suddenly, everything in my 
world just shatters at this response. She thinks its a mistake because what if I have to cut people from the list? It'll piss people off. I get her point, but I was hoping for a more positive reaction.

Second thing (which is also a third thing) is our wedding is on a Thursday. My future mother in law thinks its a bad idea to have the wedding on that day because we need to be more courteous of the guests and make it more convenient for them to have the 
wedding on a weekend. I tried to explain that its cheaper to have it on a Thursday and that it's still over a year away. The other thing is my fiance and I plan to get married next month (August 2013) at the courthouse so he can get on my health insurance plan because of the new health care law. If we didn't need health insurance 
by January, I'd totally wait until next August. We told my mother in law and her response is that ""You're going to ruin the wedding by doing that!!"". This hurt me, a lot. We're getting married early so my fiance can have health insurance. He just started a new job with a brand new company and they don't offer health insurance and won't
for sometime.

I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this. Maybe just to rant to other people who are planning a wedding and get how frustrating it can be. I've never dealt with something this frustrating and at this point, with my experience so far, so hurtful. Its ruining this for me and I've barely started planning. I'm not sure if I'm being bratty about it. I personally don't think I am, but who knows?

I Polariz, gratefully take you, (mister hubby) to be my husband and life partner.

I will always be true and honest with you. I will tell you my thoughts and dreams and listen to yours. I will share your determination to get the most out of life.

I promise to laugh with you daily, to enjoy the small moments together; even just laughing at my dorky singing and dancing.

I also vow to enjoy the silence with you. To enjoy the time spent doing things on our own, while still in the same place. 

When things go wrong, I will be there for you, not always with an easy solution, but always with an ear to listen. We will be stronger with every challenge that life throws at us.

I promise to love you, every part of you, for who you are. Not only when you are sweet and caring, but also when you are cheeky and even grouchy. That is the passionate (hubby) I fell in love with.

You have made me a better person. 
You are my best friend.
I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Let’s grow old together.

**Edit:** Thanks for the feedback guys. I was pretty happy with them but am so glad to hear such positive feedback.

I just wanted to let the people just starting out know it doesn't always happen!  Although I am not sure what my bridesmaids think of me as a bride,  my bridesmaids have been the best I could ask for!  

My maid of Honor is doing her PHD right now so she is basically super busy all the time.  But she still manages to make it to any party I have had and has helped me out with anything I have asked her to.  Also right from the get go I told my whole wedding party my MOH situation and they were all more then willing to fill in where she couldn't knowing that I asked my MOH to be MOH because we have been best friends since we were 3! 

I think part of the reason why everything is working out so well is because we are being mindful of everyone's situation.  I have a wide range of body types in my wedding party so when we went shopping I told everyone the color the dress would be (Royal Blue) and said they could pick out whatever dresses they liked.  It took us all of 1 hour at Davids Bridal and they picked out 2 different dresses!  I think the hardest part was them realizing I wanted them to make the final decision on their dresses so everyone was comfortable!

I think the only issue we are running into now is on my end.  I keep getting asked to give the bridesmaids more to do.  But to be honest I really don't have a lot for even myself to do right now. 

Anyways I just wanted to end by saying I love this sub-reddit and it has helped me a lot over the pasted few months!

Even though I didn't like her at first, I knew she meant a lot to him and was happy to have my friend in the wedding in exchange. However, his friend is being so catty about everything lately that neither of us want her in the wedding anymore. Every time we say something about it she rolls her eyes or says something like, ""I can't wait until this wedding is over so we don't have to talk about it anymore"", she bitched about how much the dress was, and she constantly preaches to us about how marriage is bullshit. I respect her views on marriage...to each her own...but shouldn't she be happy that her best friend found the love of his life and is happy? We are both so happy and excited to get married and celebrate our love with our friends and family and she's kind of raining on our parade. I don't understand how she can act this way. If she didn't want to be in the wedding, she should have just said no in the first place.

I don't appreciate how she's treating my fiance and I don't appreciate her attitude. We can't ask her to step down because she already bought her dress, but I am fed up. I don't know how to bring up her behavior without causing a huge blowout. Any advice?

edit: thanks everyone for the support! we talked about it and he thinks that she's slightly jealous because we're getting married and she's kind of lost in life. i don't know. he also thinks she might have tagged him as a ""back up"" in case she never found someone, which i don't doubt because they have a bit of a romantic past. but she has a boyfriend that she's completely in love with, so i don't even know what her deal is. regardless, i trust my fiance 100%. i know nothing would ever happen. anyway, we're going to keep her on my side for now...he explained to her that she should view it as supporting US rather than supporting just me and that after the ceremony and pictures, it doesn't even matter what side she was on. i suggested she switch sides, but he said no (he likes symmetry). i suppose we'll see how it goes. until then, i'm not going to text her to ask her for help on any decisions and just let her be until the day.

1344997638.0,19,self.weddingplanning,y8mz0,Reposting my experience with invitations from about 4 months ago - I hope this helps someone!,28,9,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/y8mz0/reposting_my_experience_with_invitations_from/,"With a total of 95 invitations sent for about 170 guests, this wasn't too bad.

Some things I've learned through the process:

- I am SOOOOOOO happy I ordered my invitations during black friday! I spent just slightly over $200 for the invitations, reception cards, rsvp cards and envelopes, and the big envelopes (and both envelopes already had the return addresses printed on them) new note: I got mine from [peartreegreetings](http://www.peartreegreetings.com/) and they will sometimes have a 15% off wedding invitations code on their homepage)
- The clear, printable labels are great for save-the-dates and invitations, plus if you give your formatted list of addresses to your maid of honor she'll love you lots for making it easy for her when she helps plan the bridal shower. We're saving our hand-writing skills for the many thank you cards later on.

- While most people don't care, one insert was enough for us. We printed the hotel booking information on one side, and included addresses to the ceremony and reception on the other (along with a ""for more detailed instructions and registry information, visit our website"" note on the bottom. new note: we did [weddingwire](http://www.weddingwire.com/)) I had many long conversations with people and decided it wouldn't be right to include registry inserts in the formal invitations. Most were invited to the bridal shower anyway which included registry information and others will find our via word-of-mouth or our website.
-  Organize addresses by her family, friends of her family, his family, friends of his family, our friends. It took us a while to search through and make sure everyone was there and included.
-  Have and agree on a ""plus 1"" idea. We are giving our friends a plus one, but not family/cousins who are old enough (since most family will know each other, but not most of our friends) Unless someone tells us it's serious, it's something we can easily explain and justify.
-  ALWAYS buy more invitations than you need. Originally my SO told me to just order 80 (that was our list a half year ago with about 3 extra invites) I decided to spend the extra cash and got a little over 100. Definitely worth it.
- We decided no kids. We had no trouble with this when the wedding day came. ""Please join us for an Adult reception at (time)"" is a good phrase to use for the reception cards if you do the same so no one gets the wrong impression.
-  Right before we started putting on the stamps, we packed up one and visited the post office to make sure it didn't weigh too much. It came out to EXACTLY the right weight. Double-check before sending them out!

If I can think of anything else we did, I'll add it. I'm really glad this turned out better than expected. :-)


EDIT: now that the wedding has happened, I will say of the close to 200 people originally invited, only about 125 were able to come (which ended up being a GREAT number for us). This was a weekend in June, and several people had other relatives with graduation parties and dance recitals or they were out on vacation.

I didn't take any pictures while I was actually making them so I had to wait. If any of you brides have pictures of projects you are working on or things you want to do, I would LOVE to see them! I also included general pricing just in case you're on a budget. Anyway, here are mine:  

**[Guestbook](https://imgur.com/a/wtdt5)**: I had my hubby make guestbook pages using a [template](http://diy.weddingbee.com/topic/my-diy-guestbook) I found on WeddingBee in the DIY section. He switched out the tree for the heart tree and we did away with the predictions section, but otherwise, it went over really well. 90 pages were printed on cardstock and cut to 8X8 for $30 at Kinko's. I bought a ringed album at a scrapbook store for $10. I did have to punch the holes but it wasn't hard. I was afraid people wouldn't fill it out but almost everyone did. I also bought a 50 pack of colored marker pens from Amazon for $15.  
**[Pinwheel Place Cards](http://imgur.com/9fupp), [Pic 2](http://imgur.com/zWNye)**: I saw [this](http://www.projectwedding.com/wedding-ideas/pinwheel-escort-cards/1) tutorial and loved it. Found the exact same paper on Amazon and bought 4 packs. However, I realized that using one sheet per pinwheel made a HUGE pinwheel so I cut them into quarters and was able to get 120 squares out of one pack (returned 2 of the packs). Wooden dowels were AWFUL! The wood split every time I tried to hammer in a pin and finding all white pencils yielded no results. Found a much better solution: 8 inch cookie sticks! $2.99 at the craft store for a pack of 20. They held up really well and I even saw people put them in their lapel holes. It was just the right size! Whole thing cost around $25 to make 100 functional pinwheels. Tips: use a clamp to hold the sticks while you make the hole for the pin. I used a flat ended pushpin to make the hole because the round headed map pins kept breaking. I also used a rubber hammer to lessen the impact and keep the pushpin from breaking too.  
**[Pennants](http://imgur.com/JrMbJ)**: My step-mom actually did these for me. I provided the fabric and she put it all together. Everyone really liked them and they looked great in the pics!  
**[Table Numbers](http://imgur.com/vqMw3), [Pic 2](http://imgur.com/gbrKx)**: I wanted something that mimicked the pennants and came up with this on my own! I bought a 2 packs of glass votive candle cups and filled them with plaster. Stuck the wooden dowels that didn't work for the pinwheels in them and used a tutorial for DIY votive candle wraps to decorate the bottoms with patterned scrapbook paper. The biggest challenge was the numbers. I needed numbers that wouldn't weigh down the string in the middle. Bracelet number charms were incredibly hard to come by but in the end I found these lightweight silver numbers at a scrapbook store! I think this project cost me around $30.  
**[Hanging vase jars](http://imgur.com/3g0uU)**: Had to do this project, of course. I used [this tutorial](http://ruffledblog.com/diy-wedding-ceremony-hanging-chair-flowers/) and didn't veer much from it. I used 18 gauge wire which was strong enough to hold the jars, flowers, and water. Later used these on the tables as the floral arrangements.  
**[Tissue pomanders](http://imgur.com/C8dy9), [Pic 2](http://imgur.com/t9mUb)**: Pretty straight forward. Used 3"" styrofoam balls for the center because some tutorials say 5"" but those made huge pomanders. Target has cheap paper in a lot of different colors. It was very time consuming though. All my attendants were far away so I did all of these on my own. I made solid colored flowers, solid white flowers, and 2-tones flowers. In the end they came out beautifully and I got to give them away to the elders that attended. Overall I think this was around $20, but I got 8 pomanders out of it!  
**[Cupcake Sticks](http://imgur.com/BkeSo)**: This one was easy but again time consuming. Punching out all those little circles was boring. Used leftover patterned cardstock from the table number project for the scallop edged circle and the extra white cardstock from the pinwheel project for the white M&amp;L circle. Wooden craft sticks were purchased for $2 and I cut them down a bit with a scissor.

*TLDR from original post: I don't like diamonds, and the SO and I can't really afford one. I want a gemstone but I'm worried about the crap I'll get from people. Will I get a lot of crap? How can I respond?*

I asked my mom her opinion on the matter. As it turns out she has jewelry that has been in my family awhile that she would really like us to use the stones from and have them reset. She has a diamond engagement ring/wedding band, but what I am MOST excited about are her sapphire earrings. They are GORGEOUS and are a family heirloom. Appraised at 2K (!!!!) One huge, beautiful sapphire in the middle surrounded by diamonds in a sunburst design. Oh, and there are two of them, since they are earrings and all. Conceivably I could use her diamond from the engagement/wedding ring and put the two sapphires on the sides. So the SO and I are going to visit jewelry stores and see about what they can do to have the stones reset for me. Yay! I love this for the following reasons:

1. It will most likely fit our budget
2. It's more sustainable to reuse stones and I can have some diamonds with less ethical problems...if they are blood diamonds, the blood was had long ago and at least the stones are being reused (lord knows my mom isn't going to wear her old wedding ring...and I don't have any superstitions about it so whatever)
3. I get to have beautiful sapphires AND diamonds that we never could have afforded on our own
4. The SO and I can have fun designing the ring
5. Jewelry stays in the family and mommy is happy!

I'm, like, giddy right now. Thank you all so much for your responses. Turns out mommy knew best all along, but I really appreciate all of the input.

That's about nine months to plan a fancy, semiformal wedding for about 100 guests.

I had no idea it was THIS much work. I knew it would be a lot, but I didn't realize how complicated things can be, and how many things can go wrong. 

We have the venue, catering, dress, invitations, and all of the major stuff. However, we've been shopping for a photographer for about two months, and we still haven't booked. We have been going back and forth with potential photogs over email, and spent four hours last weekend interviewing two of them them. Now we are in ""contract negotiations"" with the one we want. (He had some language in his contract that made my fiance uncomfortable — concerning rights to use photos on social media — so that has added another week of going back and forth.) 

We also interviewed an officiant yesterday. That took a while. She was great, but I can't just interview one person for such an important job — leading the ceremony is a big deal, and the officiant sets the tone for the rest of the day. So, we're supposed to interview a few more in the next coming weeks. 

I've talked to one florist, and they sounded fine. But I LOVE flowers and plants — and I love to garden — so my MoH thinks I should interview one more florist to get a different perspective. But I'm exhausted and I don't want to. I just want to book this company so I can cross ""florist"" off my list — but I know my MoH is right; I need to interview one more.

Things I didn't anticipate: 

* My fiance started a new job in June, which is pretty stressful — and he hasn't had a lot of time to help me like he thought he would. Plus, on the weekends, he has been so stressed out from the workweek that all he wants to do is NOT think on Saturday and Sunday. Getting him to help with wedding planning has been difficult. I've done most of the work for him, but there are certain things I CAN NOT do, like try on his suit or the groomsmen's suits.
* The amount of time it takes to coordinate appointments with potential vendors and my fiance's busy work schedule is immense.
* Premarital counseling has taken up a lot of time and energy. It's energy well spent, but it doesn't make me any less exhausted.
* Choosing decorations requires several appointments to the rental company.
* Invitations don't just have to be SELECTED, they have to be EDITED, and your enclosure cards have to be WRITTEN. This means going back and forth with your designer and vendor (I used minted.com) for weeks. Etc., etc., etc.

**TL;DR: I suppose this is a rant, but I just wanted to tell any bride/groom out there who is thinking of rushing their wedding date to SLOW DOWN, and ideally book a date at least one year out after you get engaged. You have your whole life to be married, but wedding planning takes a shitload of time. Unless you have nothing to do during the work week, planning a fancy wedding (like I am doing) is going to take MUCH more time than you think.  I wish I had given myself some more time and thereby given myself a break.**

1374240756.0,17,self.weddingplanning,1imokf,UPDATE: I am *this close* to scrapping everything and eloping.,19,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1imokf/update_i_am_this_close_to_scrapping_everything/,"First post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1ie81b/i_am_this_close_to_scrapping_everything_and/).


So I had dinner with my parents last night. I explained that from the beginning, my fiancé and I wanted a tiny (immediate family and closest friends only) wedding, and if our big wedding plans weren't realistically affordable, we had no problem going back to what we originally wanted and saving the wedding money for a nest egg for whenever we buy a house. My dad eventually seemed somewhat open to the idea, but my mom.... she has a flair for the dramatic. The word ""humiliating"" was used like 4 different times over the course of the night. She said that if we didn't invite the extended family, she would stop going to the family reunions out of shame. She was laying the emotional manipulation on really thick, but I held my ground. She pouted a lot but listened to everything I had to say.


So here's where they are with money. When my sister got married a year ago, my dad's company was doing really well and he was getting really big bonuses every month, which they used to pay for all her wedding stuff without having to dip into his regular salary. This year, though, the company hasn't been doing as well, and the bonuses have been fewer and smaller. Dad said not to worry about it though, because he was planning on borrowing against his 401k to make up for it. I'm really not crazy about this idea, I hate that my parents would go into debt (sorta) just to pay for this wedding. Also, several months ago my mom sold $3000 worth of tools to a friend of hers, but still has not been paid for them -- the friend keeps saying she's getting the money together, but she still hasn't come through with it. My mom was planning on using that money for deposits from the beginning, and is super pissed that her friend is yanking her around like this. They told her that if she can't come up with the cash by this weekend, they are going to her house and taking the tools back so they can sell them to someone else. If these two things happen soon, we should have enough to cover the remaining wedding expenses.


The thing is..... I don't know if I even want it anymore. The idea of running off one weekend and eloping is sounding better and better. I honestly think my dad would be secretly relieved. My mom wouldn't be happy, but I think she'd get over it eventually. I have a plan, I think we could do it. It would be SO romantic, and I really feel like it fits me and my fiancé better than some big expensive party.

My dude says his parents ""will help"". Here is the deal: I want to know exactly what that means as soon as possible. I am ok with paying for the entire thing on my own, but if they want to help I want to know how much they want to contribute, and what they expect out of the ceremony/reception if they do contribute. I don't care about guests, as between fiance and I we are only at 70 invited (50-60 of which are sure things) and I've planned for 100. I do, however, care about my reception and ceremony. We will not be married by a rabbi, there will not be any religion involved. The ceremony will be at the reception venue, which is a rock club, and our officiant is our best mutual friend. I will be serving pizza and having kegs, BYOB liquor &amp; wine. After food it will be an open party, meaning the guests can invite their friends to come by. Bands will play, there may be some karaoke, I will not be wearing a white gown (probably), and the party is gonna go til they shut us down at 2am.

I am not a super feminine woman and don't adhere to typical gender norms. I've always been a tomboy and don't like being the center of attention. Basically, the thought of the actual wedding day freaks me out.

I know some people will say ""take sometime away from the planning"" but we really aren't planning a lot right now. We have the basics paid for (food, DJ, venue) and everything else will come together later. Not a single step of the planning has been stressful yet.

Has anyone ever thought about canceling? I think we may just run away together and get married when the timing is right.

I moved across the country last August for grad school, away from all of my friends. Because of the limitations of my school schedule, we are thinking of getting married next winter - way sooner than I had originally envisioned! I'd like to get started shopping around for dresses sooner than later, since I'm super busy with school and all the ordering/alteration issues can tend to drag.

However, I never thought that I'd possibly be shopping by myself. I have no siblings; my parents live out of the country and we're not super close. My best friend growing up is currently serving in the Peace Corps in a different country. Generally, all of my good friends from home/college are in the same situation as I am - very busy and in saving-money-mode, so they can't really afford to fly down or take a weekend away from their lives, especially if they will have to do so again for the wedding. Likewise, I can't really afford the time/money to take a trip up there either, just to dress shop. My fiancé's family is great and willing to help with planning overall, but they also live across the country.

I have a few new friends in my grad school program here that I'd feel comfortable shopping with, BUT I'm not currently planning on inviting them to the wedding (possibly if space/funds allow, but won't know until much later). I don't want to be rude and have them involved in any planning, and give them the wrong impression that they'll be invited.

WHAT TO DO? :( I'm not totally against shopping by myself if I need to, but it won't be the happy experience that I was hoping to have.

**EDIT:** Thank you, thank you for all of your lovely comments and kind words! I feel so much better about my situation and am actually pretty excited now! The fiancé and I were out and about earlier today looking at venues, and since we were in the wedding mood, we impulsively stopped by two bridal salons and I tried on my first few dresses! I think I would have had a sad moment trying on my very first dress all by myself, so it totally helped that he was there for gown #1 to break the seal.

I didn't find anything I liked today, but I feel way more comfortable now going again alone. I'll focus on the pros of not having to be swayed by anyone's opinion.

I have scoured the internet looking for good ways to tell guests that I'm having an unplugged ceremony. While I certainly want the point to hit home and be noticed, I don't want them to feel like they're children and that I'm constantly beating them over the head with the same info. I'm thinking of having it written in my wedding website, and also having the officiant say something before the processional - as well as word of mouth. Do you all think this is adequate but not over the top? 

Also - I cannot find good wordings on the internet. I have gone through a few pages of Google already. There are a few on Offbeatbride, ( http://offbeatbride.com/2011/06/unplugged-wedding-templates ) but some are too emotional for me and some are too straight-forward (signs that just say PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONES - I'm not having a sign anyway, people tend to not read signs), nothing sounds just right. 

My mom is also not on board with this idea. She is under the illusion that everyone will be perfectly behaved, that no one would dream of ruining a photographer's shot. She doesn't realize that it just happens and people become obsessed with capturing it for themselves, so they don't even notice. I don't see why you would pay a professional thousands of dollars, then allow amateurs to get in the way. She thinks it's rude and that there's no way to say it that won't upset people. Also, I like it, so she is bound to hate it. This would only be for the ceremony, of course I would encourage people to take tons of pictures during the reception. 

TL;DR: Want an unplugged ceremony. Need wording that sounds good but not mushy, and is sufficiently not-rude so my mom won't hate it. Also, ideas on how to get my mom on board with this.

**[Pictures of the wine at our wedding reception](http://imgur.com/a/7ozSb)**

**Story:**

For quite some time, my fiancee (at the time) and I had been wanting to take a crack at making beer and wine at home. To get a feel for the process, we first started with a couple of wine kits. We were actually kind of blown away by how they turned out. After making one batch, we decided to make another two batches as favors for our wedding guests. Let me know what you think and if you have any questions!


---
**Equipment Kit:**

Between our homebrew store, Amazon, and eBay, eBay seemed to have the best prices out of the three for all of the equipment/kits we needed so we bought everything from there. 

The **[kit we bought from eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=2&amp;pub=5575034733&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337214727&amp;customid=&amp;icep_item=350148648921&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg)** was about $110 after shipping.  The merchant, Midwest Homebrew &amp; Winemaking Supplies, had pretty good reviews and was quick on shipping so I trusted them.  I also wanted a kit with a double lever corker because the hand-push ones give me a lot of trouble. Since making our wedding favors, we've purchased many more products from them so I can say that they are a reliable company.

The equipment was for a 6 gallon batch.  To make this many bottles at one time, we bought 2 equipment kits.



**Juice Kits:**

I bought two juice kits for this as we were making two batches and was in a hurry.  If you have the time, I highly recommend that you start from scratch using grapes or fruit.  However, we had a very limited amount of time so we used the following wine juice kits.

* 1) **[Vintner's Reserve - Sauvignon Blanc](http://bit.ly/1668BGD)** (Everyone at the homebrew store told me that this would be the wine that would be ready the soonest)


* 2) **[Vino Italiano - Barolo](http://bit.ly/1668x9M)** (Had good reviews online)


**Bottles, Corks, Caps, Labels**


Bottles: 
We bought my bottles from my local homebrew store as those were the cheapest (and I wouldn't have to pay shipping for them).  However, I was considering purchasing them from Midwest Homebrew &amp; Winemaking Supplies because they were selling them for about $22/24 pack.  I'm not sure about the shipping.

Each kit makes about 30 750ml Bottles or 120 187 ml Bottles.  The 187 bottles made for good favors as they were tiny and could fit in a purse.  We went ahead with 187 ml bottles and BOY was that a hit!

Corks:

The corks that fit these bottles are the #7 corks. These were super expensive at the local brewing store so I purchased them **[off of eBay](http://bit.ly/17Hhv8Q)**.  

PVC Caps:

I bought white and gold PVC caps for my wine **[through eBay](http://bit.ly/16698Z9)**.  PVC caps make for a professional finish to your product. They're very easy to use to seal your bottles with and they are very easy to remove when you want to drink it.  We were thinking about wax dipping all of our bottles but that is always very difficult to remove before drinking.  **[Here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMO7xLXC6o)** that shows you the process of putting PVC caps on your bottles

Labels:

You can buy **[Avery Wine Labels](http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Products/Marketing-Solutions/Labels/Textured-Arched-Labels-Laser-3in-x-2_.25in-White-Print_To_The_Edge-9up-10shts_22809.htm)** from Staples, or you can just put a square label on your wine. I went with the wine labels because they were water-proof and had the nice shape that I was looking for.

---

**WINE MAKING PROCESS:**

**1) Days 1-10: Primary fermentation.**

The kits came with everything I needed to sanitize and set up Primary fermentation.  The whole process took about 30 minutes on Day 1.  I made two 5.5-gallon batches using the kit's juice, yeast, solutions, and filtered tap water (not distilled) -  then I set it aside for about 9-10 days.

Note: This may smell up your apartment/basement/wherever you keep your wine. The smell will go away, but I just wanted to mention that as a warning.  It's not a bad smell.  It just smells like fermenting wine.

* **Total Time it took: 30 Minutes**

**2) Days 11-21: Secondary Fermentation.**

All I did was check the specific gravity using the hydrometer and syphon the wine from the buckets to two sanitized glass carboys.  The whole process took about 15 minutes. I then let this sit for another 10 days. 

* **Total Time it took: 15 Minutes**

**3) Days 21 - 35: Stabilizing and Clearing**

On Day 21, I checked my wine with a hydrometer to measure its specific gravity.  It was well in the range of wine and so I continued with the wine making.  I degassed the wine by agitating and stirring the liquid as much as I could.  This took about 25 minutes.  Afterward, I added stabilizing and clearing agents to the wine and stirred those in.  These came with the juice kits.

I then topped up the carboys to about 5.5 gallons and added sterilized glass marbles to the carboys to displace the liquid so that there would be very little air at the top.  I didn't want to add too much water for fear that it would dilute my wine, so the marbles helped solve that problem.  Note: Make sure they're glass marbles.  Plastic marbles could leach chemicals into your wine and make it taste different.  The glass marbles worked perfectly for me.  I then left the wine alone for another 14 days.

* **Total Time it took: 1 Hour**


**4) Day 35 - Tasting and Bottling**

I poured some of the solution into a testing tube and checked the specific gravity/tasted it.  The gravity was solid and it tasted pretty good. I read that the longer you age it, the better it would taste.  I didn't have time to let it bulk age in the carboys, so I went through with the bottling any way.

I cleaned and sanitized 225 bottles and lined them up to syphon wine into.  I used the bottling attachment of the syphon (came with the kit) to fill each bottle, then used the #7 cork and the double-lever corker to cork each bottle.  (I sprayed my corks with the sanitizer and let them air-dry so as not to have any issues with our wine later on).

After corking, we moved on to capping all of the bottles.  This process is super simple and kind of fun. First you put some water on the stove to boil. Once it starts boiling, throw a cap onto one of your bottles and dip it into the boiling water for a couple of seconds. The PVC Cap shrinks almost immediately and seals your bottle.

* **Total time it took: 5.5 hours to do 225 bottles.**  

- 1 Hour to sanitize everything
- 3 Hours to bottle the wine
- 1 Hour to cork all of the bottles (~4/minute)
- 30 minutes to cap all of the bottles


**5) Labeling**

- After designing the labels (the initials of my wife and I), we printed 225 and placed them on each bottle. 

* **Total Time It Took: 1 hour**

---
Final Notes: 

* If you have a local homebrew store, ask them what the best process is to keep your wine from spoiling.  Because we were giving these out as gifts, we didn't want them to spoil after a few months or even after a few years.  Depending on the type of wine you're making... there could be different additional steps involved at keeping your product fresh.  We added them to our bottles and they've been fresh for close to a year now!

* SANITIZE EVERYTHING immediately before use and CLEAN EVERYTHING immediately after use.  Doing so will help to make sure your finished product tastes great

---
**TL;DR**: My wife and I recently got married and made 225 bottles of wine to give to our friends and family for our wedding and as gifts.  The whole process took a little over a month (not including aging the wine).

**Verdict after 1 month of aging**: Tastes pretty good! Very drinkable!  The white wine is super crisp and lovely. The red is a little strong but has a deep/rich flavor.

**Verdict after 2 months of aging**: Thrilled that the flavor got much better!  Note: It doesn't taste like a fancy bottle of wine - but it does taste very similar to a $15 bottle of wine!

**Verdict after 6 months of aging**: The flavors have settled and are very full and bold.

We're going to age a few of them for a total of 12 months and will report back after we try them.

We hope that this post helps other people start their adventures in making wine/beer at home.  We are now moving forward on another batch using fresh grapes!  Wish us luck!

We are also having a fairly non-traditional wedding, at a camp and inviting people to stay for the weekend to enjoy camp activities with us.  Trying to fit all the info to hopefully explain our plan for the weekend in detail without going completely overboard with info was a challenge. 

The invite is a pocket invite with several inserts of info.  

[This](http://imgur.com/2jO2enX) is the main invite. 

I will have several inserts:

[Ceremony Blanket Drive card](http://imgur.com/sC9mvMz)  I think the wording on this def could use some work. I was pretty burnt out by the time I got to working on this today.  I'm having this printed as biz cards via vistaprint.  

We also have a registration form which is 2 sided.  One side has details regarding staying the weekend and the other side is the form to fill out for those that do decide to the stay weekend.  It also clarifies that even if people don't stay the weekend we hope they will attend the wedding and ceremony and has a note about the event being an adults only weekend. 

Would love to hear any feedback you guys have.  I think Im almost ready to start printing.

UPDATE: Thanks so much everyone for your input.  I will try to post updated photos at some point but I'm at work and dont have time to get them up. 

So far this is the feedback I have taken and what I have changed:

Main Invite:  I have done away with Papyrus and switched it all to noteworthy font. The name font I am keeping the same but will work on making the J look less like a T. 

RSVP Card:  All font is now Noteworthy. Cursive font is out.  I have added a line for names. 

Activity schedule: I also did away with the cursive font and changed all of the schedule to the same font, Noteworthy.  I just made the descriptors (Roast and Toast, Check In etc..) slightly larger and bolded.  I left the title in the fancy font.  The labels for the days (fri, sat, sun) are the same bc those are images I dropped in so I cant change the font- I guess I could create my own with whatever font I like but I'm not sure how to get that washed out worn effect that is in the background of the words and I really liked that. 

Blanket drive card: I'm going to try to take the RSVP template and tweak it to make my own design for the blanket drive card instead of locking myself into a Vista Print Template that does not match.  

Thanks again everything.  EXTREMELY helpful.

I get the sense that we are getting away from ""traditional"" weddings. Which is fine, which is great, but what has been nagging me is that people seem to resent others (e.g. guests) who are not on board with this, in my opinion, deviation from the norm. For example, not inviting +1s. I get it. In fact, we are not inviting plus ones. BUT, we understand that there is a general expectation that +1s are invited, and are expecting some confusion or questions about our RSVPs. Because +1s were the way things used to be, they are the ""norm."" Just because we are enlightened and want to be unique and have a wedding that reflects OUR needs, wants, expectations, it doesn't mean that our guests are rude, wrong or what have you. And for those who want to be unique/have a time or budget contraint/are not interested in traditional wedding activities, it's totally fine that you don't want to do a garter toss or cake cutting. But getting frustrated at guests who say they expect something like this or talking down to other brides-to-be that like tradition...I just don't get it. I think more unique weddings and wedding etiquette are fairly new and unless a person is a savvy bride-to-be or has been to many weddings lately, isn't it ok to expect the expected?   

Edit Update: As a traditional bride, I feel like I'm getting pushed around for being too boring or ""cookie-cutter."" But there are many here who say they are nagged for being too nontraditional.

What a weird experience...,19,2,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hgs5u/i_went_dress_shopping_for_the_first_time_today/,"I made an appointment and went to the local David's Bridal to try on dresses. I wanted to get an idea of what I liked in a dress. I'm not anti-DB, but I'm not exactly a fan of them either, and it was exactly what I expected (but that's not the point of this post).

I went by myself for a number of reasons. One, most of my close friends are currently spread across the country. Heck, I'm not evening living at 'home' right now. Two, I trust my own judgement about fashion and what looks good on me. If I'm not comfortable in it, I'm not going to put myself out there on my wedding day. Three, this was just a visit to try different style, cuts, etc. 

Well, I found out that I was pretty much spot on with my assumptions about what I would like and what would look good on me. I did try on a super poofy dress (for shits and giggles) and was surprised to find I liked it, but it's just too much tulle for me to truly be comfortable in. 

However, I never felt like a bride. I just felt like ME in a bride's dress. Even when we found the one [I liked the most](http://i.imgur.com/Iq70ISH.jpg), and she put the veil on my head, I still felt like a kid playing dress up. I wasn't (consciously) expecting a revelation and sudden feeling of 'bridal-ness', but I just felt weird. Like I was pretending. I've seen hundreds (thousands) of pictures of models and real brides in dresses, but there was a complete disconnect between seeing myself in one and thinking...Bride. 

I sent my fiance a couple of pictures to surprise him (he didn't know I was going today), and he liked the same dress that I liked. But, I never got any sort of reaction out of him about seeing me in a bridal gown, or the wedding really being real, or anything like that. I was absolutely looking for some sort of validation and didn't get it. Maybe if I had some friends with me, that would have made the experience more 'real'. I'm tempted to send my mom the pictures or send them to a friend and see what reaction I get.

I had told her my plans for getting to her wedding (12+ hours of driving away!) were going to be on the way back from moving my boyfriend to where I live now. 

I understand that she has the right to not give me a plus one, but I feel like I can't accept the invitation to her reception because it would make me kick my boyfriend to the curb in a place he doesn't know to go find dinner somewhere.  What is the easiest way for me to say, ""Because I didn't get a plus one, I can only come to your wedding and not your reception?"" The RSVP doesn't have an appropriate option on it.

""I'm engaged!!""

""... Oh."" Silence. ""Well that's nice, I guess.""


Yesterday I called my dad for father's day and my mom ended up getting on the phone and started breaking down crying about how I shouldn't be getting married because I don't have a job (that's untrue, I do have a job, I'm just part time at the moment due to school and my boss will up my hours when I graduate in December) and I'm throwing my master's degree away by getting married (because marriage means I can't work?) and I'm going to be dependent on them for the rest of our lives (I'm semi-dependent at the moment due to school, but only temporarily). Basically, she was coming up with some really stupid reasons for why I shouldn't get married. 


It's really upsetting that they want nothing to do with the wedding planning or are even the least bit supportive. At the risk of sounding spoiled/ungracious/bratty/brizezillaesque, my little brother got married this year and they were thrilled and involved. They contributed quite a bit, financially, and were there for him. Me? ""Oh.. well let us know how your planning goes!"" I almost feel like they WANT me to fail, and every decision I've made about venue/location/date/etc, they swiftly try to fight against for whatever reason they can come up with. It's not like it's in my budget ($5k) to be choosy anyways.

The bride is my cousin, we aren't close, but I see her for at least a couple days every other year. I'll be flying to get to the wedding, as will the rest of my family. It's going to be a very fancy beachfront wedding that will cost more than double my salary, which makes me feel pressured to spend more on a gift than is really wise. The gifts on her registry are all very expensive!

I thought it might be nice to split a gift with my two brothers since they are both in graduate school and also a little short on cash. The problem is, we've each been dating our SO's for around 5 years, and two of us will be bringing our partners as dates. If the three of us combine gifts, then that leaves our two +1s stuck with a gift on their own. A gift from the combined 6 of us seems odd.

I know that gifting is a big deal, and that there are rules about your gift being at least equivalent to the cost of your plate, but this hardly seems reasonable that because they are throwing an extravagant wedding we must dip into our savings for a gift.

First of all, rude.

Second of all, the woman who commented is 1/2 of a couple who we've met only once, who we hired two years ago to paint our house.  

Let me say that again.  They are people we hired two years ago.  To paint our house. 

They are not even remotely close to the category of ""friends.""  They are HARDLY acquaintances.  Don't get me wrong, they're great people and we were really glad to hire them and spend some time with them, but we haven't seen or spoken to them in 2 years!  Of course, no one else on my damn friends list knows that, so now I just look like a huge asshole.  It took all my willpower to not just blow up at her.  Seriously, WHO DOES THAT?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!

Needed to get it out.  I want to punch the computer in the face.  I don't understand why people are such oblivious, selfish idiots about weddings.  I really don't.  Yes, I get weddings are fun.  No, you are not entitled to be invited to my wedding just because I met you that one time.

He's planning to pop the question in the next month or so.  Earlier he promised we could get married this year - I want to do it in October, late October is totally fine.  Just in the month of October.

So with him dragging his feet and saving money we're obviously getting into the danger zone.  Last night he asked ""If we get engaged soon, is October TOO soon to have a wedding?  Is that rude to your guests?  What's the protocol on that, do you think we're okay to have it this year?""

I realized I didn't know.  It SEEMS okay to me to give people a 6 month lead, and I know I can get it planned - I'm not concerned about that.  But is it considered rude to not give people a year?  Is there a timeframe we should be sticking to?  Or is it no holds barred?

**EDIT**

Thanks for all your advice!  A few notes about my own wedding:

- I've got MUCH already planned (yeah I know, I'm just like that), including colors, centerpieces, style, etc.
- I've already started DIYing some of the pieces (I have 4 vintage books I completely punched out with a heart-shaped punch for the tables and flower-boy)
- I've already reached out to some reception venues who offered to put me on tentative hold for the location
- I work full time, but the rest of my time is free for whatever

So I've got a lot of stuff in motion already, I'm not too concerned about the planning part.  I think only a handful of relatives would need to fly in (like 5 or 6? The rest would drive, it's only an hour or 2 here) and we're planning on a Saturday in the afternoon.

So I thought ""well, I might regret not getting it, they aren't making this one anymore and it's on sale, so better get it."" So I did. Or rather, my mom and dad did. They said they'd pay for it as I would be paying for pretty much the rest of the wedding myself. One year later, wedding still hasn't happened (It's an international affair, waiting on immigration), we're shooting for a spring wedding in 2013. And up until about a month ago I was still happy with it as my dress. But one of my other friends is getting married and shopping and she's been asking me to help her pick so while looking at other dresses online for her, I've slowly gotten more and more displeased with my decision to buy so quickly. I don't think the dress makes me look as womanly or as bridal as I envisioned in my head. But I can't just get another dress, not when it was paid for by someone else. And the shop won't take it back because it was a sale item. I don't really know what to do. My only option is to wear it because I can't afford to get another, and I'd hate to have an unused, unworn, unloved dress hanging in the closest as a waste of money. Anyone else have this problem? I'm feeling pretty down about it all. :(

EDIT: I'm wondering, against tradition, should I put it on and show my fiance? Maybe if he thinks it looks nice then I will get my confidence back about it?

EDIT EDIT: Thank you for the kind and encouraging words! I did speak to my mom about it, and she thinks perhaps I am just tired of it hanging in my closet and am ready to wear it! She might be right.

My fiancé and I are footing the whole bill to make sure we get exactly what we want on our big day. As for the invites, I know if I only address the invite to the parents thats code for only the adults, but they'll assume their kids are invited and then I'll have to do the awkward call and tell them. It's mostly going to be family members who are going to assume their kids can come. And they're going to assure me up and down that their kids are going to be sitting quietly through the whole wedding, and I know the second the ceremony starts, full on melt down mode will engage. I don't want kids at my wedding, nothing will change my mind.  

I'm considering including a little card in my invites that says something like ""since we know many of our guests have children, we would like to extend the offer to have a babysitter the night of the wedding..."" or something along those lines. The wedding venue isn't kid friendly and the reception space really isn't kid friendly, and it's really not my top priority to make sure kids are accommodated, and I've started catching shit. 

So r/weddingplanning is the card a good idea or should I do something else?

**UPDATE** I spoke with the person who books the reception space and she said that they don't allow children in the wine/beer cellar because it is too dangerous. Plus, it is going to be in a very old building and they don't have an elevator, so they don't want to kids running up and down the stairs.

So this is unfortunately the second time this has happened to me. It makes me feel like I'm not very important to anyone. 

When I first got engaged, I asked my sister to be MOH and my two best friends to be bridesmaids. I've been mutual best friends with one of them for about 8 years. The other I met in college and I thought we were pretty close. Well... some major shit happened in college and basically she just stopped speaking to me for 3 months. Then she randomly ""apologized"" and asked me to hang out with her and her friends (who used to be my friends). I later found out that was only so I'd come and feel awkward and not want to come back but she could still pretend she had apologized. So that was strike 1. 

I've never had very many friends, and so when I met another friend in college who was also shy and introverted we really hit it off. She never flaked on me, not once, and we got together for weekly dinners. After six months we were very close and I asked her to be my bridesmaid and she said yes without hesitation. 

After we graduated, she dropped off the face of the planet. She wouldn't reply to my texts or emails for months. Finally she sent me a facebook message to tell me that she didn't think she was going to be able to go because grad classes started that week and she didn't have much money and no date. I offered to pay for all of her expenses, including her dress, and I found out she wouldn't have actually missed any classes. I gave her time to think about it. I didn't hear anything so I finally just asked her and she said she wasn't coming. 

I feel like crap. I feel like I suck at friendships and shouldn't have asked her in the first place. I'm getting the impression that the only reason she isn't coming is because she doesn't have a date, and that makes me feel like I'm not worth very much to her. I would have gone to her wedding in a heart beat. Oh, and she refused to take a friend. She said it would be too weird. This just sucks. I'm not worried about sides matching or anything like that. I'm just not feeling like I'm very supported by my friends. I think only my sister and best friend will be coming to the bachelorette party. And I'm grateful to have them, I really am, but I just don't want this to bring me down.

Yet it seems like the magic of the ritual requires some kind of mutual ring exchange.

Do we a) buy another ring and just cram it on there and maybe I'll not wear it that often, or wear it on my other hand?  b) do some kind of shenanigans with putting my existing ring on my hand again?  c) do some other kind of magical bonding ritual in place of a ring exchange?   

We're not religious, though I am fairly superstitious, and my woo-woo magical thinking will be in full swing for this.  We're definitely getting a ring for him, regardless.

I found a lot of good tips here, vented to sympathetic planners, and had some good laughs (and a few ""well, at least I'm not dealing with that..."" moments) while planning.  I would like to share my whole wedding experience with you in the hopes some of it will be helpful to you, including cost breakdown, tips, etc.

Pictures here -- http://marybethbueno.com/a-love-story/
Video collage of pics here -- http://marybethbueno.com/joie-de-vivre-joy-of-life-2/

General Info -- we had a 5 month engagement.  Our families and many friends live out of state.  This is a second marriage for me (widowed) and a first for him.  We lived together nearly 2 years before the wedding.  Our colors were neutrals &amp; purples (any shade of purple, brown, gray).  I would estimate that we spent about $6,000 on the wedding, with my parents contributing $5,000 (very unexpected and appreciated).  We didn't keep extremely close tabs on that because we had expected to spend that much ourselves without my parents' help, so we weren't super strict on sticking to that number.

Invitations -- used a Groupon from Picaboo.  Ordered about 75 invites I think.  COST -- $40 (plus postage)

Ceremony Venue -- we got married in a park that is about 5 minutes from our house.  We chose it because we don't belong to a church and we've spent a lot of time running and biking the trails of this park, plus it's close to our house.  We decorated the aisle chairs with tulle pew bows that I bought cheap from Craigslist (CL).  Covered the trash cans with Dollar Store white plastic tablecloths; same with a grill that was under the pavilion (made it look like a table at the alter)  COST -- $100 for pavilion, plus $400 to rent 120 white chairs (that included special Saturday delivery fee and rental co. setting up/tearing down chairs).  Maybe $30 of decorations there too.

Officiant -- had a friend do this.  We paid for his hotel room (he lives 1.5 hrs away), but wouldn't have had to do this.  I wrote the ceremony myself, mostly using Google searching and cut/paste.  We had 2 readers (one did the Corinthians reading, another did a secular reading).  Cost -- $250 for 2 nights' hotel

Programs -- Wilton fan kits (it was Texas, outdoors).  We ordered/made 125 programs, but 100 would have been plenty (not every person will take one - esp. kids).  COST -- around $40

Ceremony details -- we had a cooler full of ice cold bottled water that the ushers handed out.  We had a basket of kiddie stuff -- wedding themed color and craft books, a couple dozen bottles of bubbles -- to keep them occupied while waiting for ceremony.  Ordered that stuff from Oriental Trading.  Well worth the $20 or so spent there.

Wedding Party -- we had 4 attendants each and no kids in ceremony.  Our siblings were all part of the party, plus 1 good friend each.  We had 2 ushers.  I also had a House Party (a southern thing) -- they are kind of like female ushers, but they run the reception (while the ushers run the ceremony).  I had 12 of my girlfriends from Texas do this, and this was especially important because of it being a home reception (more details on that below).  For wedding party attire -- I picked the color of dress from David's Bridal and told the girls I wanted knee-length.  They had over 12 options to choose from, and all chose different styles.  They had freedom to choose their own shoes &amp; accessories.  They paid for their own dresses.  Groom took as many guys as he could get together shopping and they picked out khakis from Gap and white shirts from another store (they went to an outlet mall).  They were told to wear brown shoes &amp; belt.  For the House Party girls, I asked them to wear purple.  

Dress -- I admit, this is where I splurged.  My dress was $900, from Alfred Angelo.  I also bought a sash/brooch from Craigslist (it was actually originally a hair piece!) for about $50 and spent $80 to have it sewn on as a belt.  I found shoes for $35 (and a pair of wedges for reception for $25) on sale, and my purse was also a Craigslist find.  My bracelet was $15 on sale, and my friend's mom (who makes jewelry) made my necklace (stunning!).

Getting ready -- I paid for all the bridesmaids to have their hair done, and got them either a mani or pedi, their choice.  We had sushi and champage at the salon -- way fun!  Spent about $450 for all that.  Again, a splurge because we could.  :)

Music -- we had a friend of a friend run sound at the ceremony (iPad)and serve as DJ at reception.  He did this for free, in exchange for a taxi ride at the end of the night.  We did rent equipment.  COST -- $125 for equipment rental; $40 cab ride

Reception -- our house &amp; backyard.  My advice for anyone who is doing this is:  make use of all the space you can!  We moved our living room furniture into the garage so the living room was where we set up the buffet table, gift table, and cake table.  We moved our guest bedroom furniture out to turn that room into a coffee lounge with chairs, regular &amp; decaf coffee, cookies, etc.  We wanted a place the older folks could sit down and where people could relax in the a/c.  We also had a card table in the kitchen/dining area for the same reason.

We rented a dance floor ($700), but borrowed about 8 rectangular tables from friends.  For chairs, we borrowed about 30 white chairs from a friend of the family and rented another 24 or so.  We also rented a bar and 5 light-up cocktail tables.  Our yard (which isn't THAT big, honestly -- we have about 0.32 acres total) was divided basically into 3 sections -- you'd walk out the back door and on the porch was the photo booth.  Behind that were the tables and chairs (to sit &amp; eat).  In the middle was the dance floor.  To the left was the bar, cocktail tables, and port-a-potty (our bathrooms inside were available too, but this helped).

Decorations -- We made our own centerpieces (well, I had girls' nights of crafting and wine to do this).  We had saved bottles &amp; jars, and spray painted them.  Some we left singular, and for centerpieces, we'd take 3 bottles of different sizes and colors, and glue them together (with a pretty ribbon around them).  They were the vases for our flowers.  For the jars - we took tissue paper and mod-podged them and put in LED or tealights for lanterns, to set around the yard where needed.  (We also rented 6 purple uplights.)  We also had a ton of white lights -- we strung some strands from our porch to a tree above the dining area, and wrapped trees in Christmas lights (all white), plus had the bushes draped in white lights.  Very romantic and nice.  I have to say -- my hubby did a great job getting the yard in tip-top shape and hanging lights!  (We had a bbq one weekend and provided the food and beer and had some of the wedding guys hang up the lights).

Rental Costs for reception -- about $2200 -- biggest items were dance floor and photo booth.  We also rented 1 sterno, 2 coffee urns, 25 mugs, 25 chairs, chafing dish, a Port-a-cool fan to put next to the dance floor, port-a-potty ($125), bar, 5 cocktail tables, and some uplighting.  This is where you could really make different choices and save!

Food -- we spent about $700, I'd say.  We did our own food, and it was great!  We had bbq sandwiches (our neighbor made the bbq; my family and I did the rest), 6 or so veggie burgers for those who don't do meat, pasta salad, fruit salad, potato chips &amp; onion dip (my aunt &amp; uncle brought it from Iowa -- you can't get my favorite dip in TX!), cheese &amp; crackers, and cookies/candy/cake.

Alcohol -- we paid a bartender $200, plus she had a tip jar.  We served 2 kinds of beer (1 keg each), white &amp; red wine (both pretty cheap -- Trader Joe's style, about 6 bottles each), gin lemonades, and we had a whiskey bar -- the bartender was making Old Fashioneds and Manhattans, and had other mixers for whiskey.  We had about 6-8 whiskeys to choose from.  Oh, and complementary cigars.  This was really cool.  People loved our drinks!  And the groom was telling guys to meet at the ""cigar lounge"" (our patio furniture in one corner of the yard) at 11 pm to share a cigar.  It was cool seeing all the guys do that.  We put up a tent (like the pop-up tailgating kind) over the bar area, with white lights around it.  We put the bar in front of our shed, which was open and had some coolers and supplies in there for the bartender.  The cocktail tables were in that area, too.  I honestly don't know what we spent on liquor -- that was hubby's jurisdiction.  Lol.  But it wasn't too bad....less than $1,000, I'm sure.

Cake -- I got a heck of a deal!  We had a basic white, 3 tier cake with coconut topping.  It served 96 people.  COST -- $100.  The trick was -- I ordered a cake the grocery bakery always has in stock, just in the biggest size they could do.  And had it plain, and did NOT tell them it was a wedding cake (the cheapest wedding cake they do, which was SMALLER, was $400).  It all got eaten (we didn't save the top layer), but everyone who wanted some got some.  We also had cookies galore, and candy.

Flowers -- I got them from Trader Joe's.  Picked them up the day before the wedding.  Just got assorted seasonal flowers in the right colors, and estimated what I'd need.  My MIL made all the bouquets and boutineers -- wow!  (You can buy floral tape and beaded pins from Oriental Trading very cheaply.)  We filled all the bottles, centerpieces, and vases I could find, and then some!  We put bunches of eucalyptus (wrapped and hung with ribbon) in the bathrooms and port-a-potty, which made them smell really good.  TOTAL -- $187

Photographer -- FREE.  Found someone on Craigslist who is looking to go pro and wanted to shoot a wedding.  We ended up giving her $100 and also made a donation to the Wounded Warriors Project (she is from a military family).  And we'll buy a set of proofs, and probably some larger prints.  She did fantastic!!!

Shuttle -- we had a shuttle that would take guests from the hotel to the wedding, then the reception, and back to the hotel.  Not everyone took it of course, but it was full and helped a lot to alleviate parking issues in our residential neighborhood.  And the last shuttle of drunkards had the driver take them to a bar instead of the hotel, lol!  It was fun seeing our friends and families from different times and places of our lives come together like that.

Favors -- we weren't going to do these, but at the last minute I decided I wanted cozies.  I think we spent about $125 for 150 of them.  Fun, but not necessary.  And the groom's sis surprised us by ordering shot glasses too.  So between those things, and the photo booth pics, people didn't leave empty handed.  I also forgot to tell people to take centerpieces and decorations, but am giving those out now.

Hmmmm....what else?

We also had baskets in each bathroom with things like ibuprofen, Tums, tampons, hairspray, Immodium, lint rollers, sewing kits, first aid kits, etc.  Got a lot of that stuff from dollar stores.

We did a lot of borrowing, Craigslist shopping, yard sales and estate sales. 

PROS of home wedding -- you can plan things just how you want them, it makes you do home improvement projects you have been putting off

CONS of home wedding -- you get obsessive thinking about possibilities, you have to do those home improvement projects, you worry that it won't work

All in all -- we wouldn't have changed a thing!  It was awesome!  And I'd be happy to answer any questions any of you have about any of the details, anything I left out, etc.  :-)

EDIT -- I should add that we did as much decorating and re-arranging as we could before our families started to arrive, but the day before the wedding was when most of the work happened.  My mom &amp; aunts rocked out the food that day, while my hubby's mom &amp; sisters did the flowers and decorations.  The guys went to work outside setting up tables and chairs, getting all electrical stuff sorted out (lights, DJ equipment), putting the tent up over the bar, etc.  It was actually really fun working together and having everyone spend the day together.

EDIT -- we also rented a generator.  Kind of noisy but well worth it!  We put it in the front yard where no one was hanging out.

EDIT -- a couple more details I forgot....

Guest book -- we did a fingerprint tree.  My mom made it.  She is so talented, it's awesome!

Something old -- antique locket with pictures of me and my late husband on my first wedding day
Something new -- necklace made by my friend's mom.  My friend was my personal attendant, and she was like my first-in-command through the whole planning process.  Get a good friend like this!!  I was so lucky to have her.

1373402180.0,17,self.weddingplanning,1hyj72,[UPDATE] Our Intimate backyard wedding is getting too big.,19,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hyj72/update_our_intimate_backyard_wedding_is_getting/,"The original post is here 
http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hsz2g/our_intimate_backyard_wedding_is_getting_too_big/

I came to the conclusion that I wanted to invite my teams SO because I wanted them to be with the person they love (if they have one) while they witness us publicly state that we want to be in love forever. Those invites plus some my mom added put us at around 125 and probably more than should be invited to my parents NOT super big house for my wedding. 

We discussed our guest list issue with my parents and we all hashed it out at great length. There was a day where we were set on the backyard wedding with just cutting my whole team from the guest list but after awhile that made me sad so a couple hours later I'm getting quotes on wedding venues to see what we could get that was bare bones yet still beautiful for 150 guest for not more than 2500 than our budget. Then it went back to my parents saying they want to do it at the house and we can just make it work. Got a call back from them about 20 minutes later wanting to the addresses of the possible venues. We were at a standstill because my fiance and I didn't want to invite less people but we also didn't want to rent a venue when our hearts and budget weren't in it. 

We had a long talk last night and decided FOR SURE (as in I'm not looking at venues anymore) that it will be at my parents house. We are ending up inviting a couple MORE people not less and changing the feel from intimate backyard wedding to loving party where people happen to get married. We will set up a chalkboard we have from our home brew tasting party letting people know to grab a drink and that the short ceremony will be at 5:30 and food will be buffet style starting at 6. We will NOT have enough tables to seat everyone at once and will instead have areas set up to encourage folks to drink for a while then get food, play corn hole on the gravel then drink then food, eat then drink and mingle then sit inside and chat with relatives. I like this idea and feel of the party much more than the feeling I got from planning this out at a venue. My fiance and I agreed completely that we much rather do it at my parents house, have less formal feel, be relaxed in the space we are on in, and focus on each other and spending time with our friends and family than doing it at a rental hall. Parking, seating, and restrooms are going to be a challenge but I have no doubt we will be able to provide enough of all three that it's not a problem so long as our guests don't have an issue with our wedding not being a ""proper formal wedding""

Hi! I´m planning my wedding for be this year. The theme is games in general since my BF and I, both are gamers.
We usually play console games like ps2, ps3, nintendo, ds, etc.

I want to know how can i mix a proper normal wedding style, with the games. I looked in google and found some awesome ideas, but i want to know if there´s people here with the experience, with more wedding decoration pictures, and wedding invitations ideas, the cakes,etc. So i can get some ideas!

My fiance and I got engaged back in July last year. We decided pretty much immediately that we wanted a childless reception with only two exceptions- his brother and sister who are 12 and 4. His brother is going to be a groomsman and his sister will be our flower girl. We were initially worried about some push back from his family, but everyone has been cool about ""no kids"" except for one person- his aunt, who is also one of my bridesmaids. 

My fiance's aunt was my co-worker/friend and she is actually the one who got us together. I want her to be in the wedding, but some recent drama is making me re-think my decision. The problem is, I don't know if I'm in the wrong or she is. When my fiance and I saw her for the first time after we got engaged I told her right then and there (because it came up) that we did not want children at the wedding. Her response was, ""we'll talk about that later."" I was completely taken aback by her response as I thought it was a little rude, but I let it go because I was newly engaged and wasn't ready to put my foot down about anything. We were also at a family party and I wasn't about to cause any drama. My fiance and I continued to tell people that we weren't inviting children expect for our two very special exceptions.

Skip ahead a couple of months and this aunt decides to spring on us that not only is she bringing her kids to the hotel we're getting married at (it's out-of-state), but she has arranged for a babysitter and will also be letting her children watch the ceremony. She sprang this on is after we had to listen to his grandmother (her mother) guilt us on the kid thing and talk about making other exceptions. She had just agreed to be my wedding planner that night and I didn't know what to do, neither did my fiance. We never spoke about it after that night. 

Skip ahead now to about three weeks ago. My fiance, who has been seething about this (me too), decides to say something to his aunt. He let's her know that there will be NO KIDS at the wedding except his brother and sister. That's it. His aunt is insistent that she has no one to watch her children (which is complete bull because their dad or grandparents would take them... or that babysitter she already lined up) and is now furious. He told her that if she truly *has* to bring them to the hotel- which we don't want- they are not watching the ceremony. He explained that it isn't fair to make exceptions for her children and no one else's when we have been very adamant with everyone that the ceremony and reception is adults only. She refused to reason, is totally pissed, and is whining about having to tell her kids they can't come. 

She intentionally sparked drama a couple weeks ago, which I won't get into, but is now ignoring my texts and the facebook message I sent to all the bridesmaids. She also avoided us last weekend when we were visiting family and she was picking up her kids. She wouldn't come in the house because we were there. 

I am fed up and I don't know what to do. I want to talk to her, but she isn't responding to me. I'm at the point I just want her and her behavior out of my wedding; but, am I the one in the wrong here? My fiance and I thought by telling her six months in advance that we do not want kids at the wedding that we were being reasonable, especially since she knew this was our original decision (though she chose to ignore it). Is she being as ridiculous as I think she is, or were my fiance and I wrong for telling her that her kids cannot attend the ceremony?

I'm really stressing about this and just need some outside input. We're just trying to be fair across the board. She is the only person in either family who has a problem with our adults only wedding. And as I said before, she has more than one person who can watch her kids for a weekend. So, what do I do? Tell her she's out or apologize? 

Thanks for reading this wall of text!

TL;DR- Bridesmaid was told initially that wedding is adults only (except my fiance's little brother and sister who are in the wedding party), then decided to take it upon herself to not only hire a babysitter to bring to the wedding, but told her kids they could watch the ceremony. When my fiance told her (six months in advance) absolutely no kids other than his brother and sister, she flipped out and now won't talk to me. She has caused drama and deliberately avoided us since the confrontation.

[Long]",25,7,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1ao1ln/my_fiancé_is_invited_to_friends_wedding_events/,"Warning, this is extremely long. Sorry in advance.

**Background:**

My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years, and for about 4 years we have been in a pretty close group of friends. The men in the group are all *extremely* close, and are all in each other's weddings. My fiancé and I will be the first to get married (in a couple months.) The next couple to get married will be 2 months after our wedding (we will call this couple John and Jane).

So, both guys ask each other to be groomsmen, and neither Jane nor I ask each other to be bridesmaids. (It’s not at all that we don’t like each other, it’s just that the guys have always been the “lynch pin” of the group. This has not caused any issue at all.) Keep in mind that the men ask each other to be groomsmen *after* we both set dates, and John and Jane know that my fiancé and I will be married by the time of their wedding.

**Where I can’t tell if I’m being unreasonable:**

John and Jane start planning their wedding weekend. They aren’t going away for their honeymoon for a while, so the weekend is truly a three-day event. They are renting cabins for their wedding party to stay in with them from Friday to Sunday, and have things planned until Sunday afternoon. They’re asking the wedding party to chip in on the cabins if they want to stay there, so it’s about $150/person.

I’m not invited. To any of this, except the actual wedding. Not even the rehearsal dinner, where everything I’ve ever been told says that you invite the wedding party *and* their dates, especially if they are married.

The other thing is, they're having their wedding about 3-4 hours away from where we live. I have relatives that live up there so I'll be able to stay with them over the weekend, but it's not like I can just do stuff at home.

Additionally, I just found out the other day that after all of their groomsmen do their tux trying on afternoon, they’re going back to John’s parent’s house… where his parents are having a big party for everyone. To which I am also not invited.

I’ve talked to my fiancé about it, and while he was definitely willing not to do the wedding weekend cabin if I wanted, I couldn’t make him do that. He loves those guys so much, *especially* John… and that weekend really is probably one of the only times he’ll see them for a while, especially in that capacity. John and Jane are moving far out of the country a couple months after they get married, so it really will be the last time he sees them for a while. I couldn’t take that away from him. So we’ve paid the $150 for the cabin and he’s doing it.

At the same time though, I really do feel hurt and upset. The whole thing is so weird to me, and I don’t understand any of it. But at the same time, maybe I’m being completely unreasonable in my expectations.

I don’t even know what I expect from this post, I think it was just something I needed to get off my chest. If you’ve read this long, thank you, and please feel free to let me know if I’m being ridiculous!

Then I read this article. ,17,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/19h8os/i_briefly_thought_about_releasing_butterflies_at/,"I was looking for a place to buy inexpensive butterflies, even if they're the cute little white ones that just float around the clover patches in my yard. I was looking to spend anywhere between $1 and $5 a piece (potentially, really just thinking about it) and release just a few dozen or so. 

Then I read [this article](http://www.naba.org/weddings.html), and the [reader responses](http://www.naba.org/readwed.html) to butterfly releases. 

How terrifying! The only thing I could consider was how beautiful it would be to have these amazing butterflies released into the air only to fly away freely. I never even considered that they could arrive dead, dying, or squished. I didn't consider the effect on wild butterflies, or the dazed and confused ones let out, or how people would be stepping on the butterflies as they walked away from the ceremony site. 

So I changed my mind. And now I'm on the hunt for something pretty, biodegradable, and not edible to throw. Probably just some simple flower petals.

1359935562.0,16,self.weddingplanning,17u1rj,I find it difficult to find shoes in my (large!) size in mainstream stores. So I designed my wedding shoes and had them handmade for me.,22,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/17u1rj/i_find_it_difficult_to_find_shoes_in_my_large/,"So I'm generally European 42 (a size 10.5-11 here in New Zealand) AND my feet are pretty wide across the ball of my foot. I can occasionally fit into a generous 41, depending on how wide and generous the style of the shoe is and if it will stretch if it's leather.

My partner and I got Officially Engaged in March of 2012, but we booked our venue in January of 2012 and I've been looking for possibly wedding shoes since before then. I've really not had much luck.

Our wedding colours are blue, gold, and silver/grey, and while I can find HEAPS of silver shoes (which is great for my bridesmaids), finding myself a pair of gold ones was *very* difficult. Finding a pair of gold heels that FIT was even harder.

I really didn't want to go with a basic cream or ivory shoes that screamed bridal. I didn't want a stilletto, I didn't want satin, I didn't want a kitten heel, I didn't want crystal details. What I wanted a pair of crazy out-there shoes that would continue to be eye catching even when I wore them in the next few years. I even searched for drag queen shoes in my city but couldn't find them.

I had some misgivings about buying shoes off the internet, because I was terrified that they wouldn't fit and I'd have to pay ALL THE MONEY to ship them back, or I'd get scammed, or they'd be cheap and nasty or **something would just go horribly wrong**.

Then I remembered a website a friend had told me about years ago, http://www.ShoesOfPrey.com. It's based in Australia, they do **free shipping**, and **free returns**. You basically get on there, ***design your own shoe*** and then they make it up and ship it out to you.

It's pricey but at my size, I was never going to find cheap shoes that a) fit and b) were comfortable anyway. 

Anyway, I ordered my shoes on January 16, 7 or so weeks before my wedding. They said it could take up to four weeks to receive them and recommended ordering at least 11 weeks in advance. 

I told them what size shoe I wore and there was a space for notes about my feet so I could tell them how wide my foot is. I ordered a 42.5 Wide to take into account the extra width. Then, five days after placing my order, I got a personalised email explaining how they construct a shoe for a wider foot and asking me to confirm the size I'd requested. I took the advice in the email and went down to a 42 Wide, not the 42.5. 

Then, last Friday, 2 February, only 17 days after ordering, 12 days after confirming my size, I got home to find an email with a photo of my shoes, their construction having been completed. They told me they had been shipped and I could expect them ""early next week."" Well, Monday morning comes around and they're delivered to work, less than 3 weeks after ordering! 

Anyway, here are the photos of the shoes. I've included a comparison shot of the computer-generated shoe. Turns out they really did know best and the shoes fit almost perfectly with just enough room left over for some heel grips and gel pads under the balls of my feet! You can see the small gap by the heel in some of the photos.

I'm about to launch a new website: it's a really simple way for married couples to collect, organise and share the photos taken by their wedding guests. 

As the awesomest wedding community on the internet, it would be fantastic to get your feedback on the idea, and I'd love it if some of you were able to use it for your weddings! 

Here's the site:
[guestgallery.com](http://guestgallery.com)

Anyone can set up an account to try it out and, if you'd like to use it for your upcoming wedding, you can use the voucher code &lt;removed&gt; which will make everything totally free - no credit card needed! 


This code can be used 50 times - please use it if you are getting married soon and would like to give some feedback. If you're getting married later in the year, ping me a message and I'll send you a voucher code when we launch, I promise.

I cleared this post with the lovely mod, /u/pink_misfit, in advance. I'm not trying to promote the site yet (I'll definitely buy a load of Reddit ads when we launch!) - I'd just love to know what people think, what could be better etc.

(Wall of text warning),20,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1b48qo/i_just_need_to_vent_really_upset_wall_of_text/,"So, FH and I have been together almost 7 years, and were actually engaged for about a year and a half. 6 months before our wedding date (which was supposed to be July 14, 2012), he had a midlife crisis and called it off. Needless to say, I was gutted. I considered leaving, but decided to tough it out. We stayed together, and both worked really hard to strengthen our relationship, and we're now stronger than we've ever been. In February, he proposed again, and we're back on track. We decided to do a small wedding at the County Clerk's office, just to get it done, and then next year, we're going to plan a big ""wedding"" for all our assorted family. 

Later that day, I called and told my mom and told her our plans, and she got annoyed. She didn't understand why we would ""get married twice"", and thought it was silly. She said it didn't make sense, and would be inconvenient for people and cost others too much money. Though I asked her what she was talking about, she could never explain what she meant by that, and eventually seemed to drop her arguments. I figured all was a go. 

This morning, FH and I went to apply for our marriage license. We were both so happy to be taking this step! And we decided on a date of May 3 - not too soon, but within the 60 days we have before the marriage license expires. It gives us time to prepare, to schedule time off work, etc. We sent messages to all our family. My mom gets back to me and said that date is inconvenient for her. She'll be getting back from a vacation a couple days before and said she won't be able to take any more time off work, and asks if we can do it the 17th. Then my sister (who will be going on that same vacation with her) texts back and says that day won't work for her, either, because she can't take the additional time off work, plus her daughter's birthday is a few days after that, and we need to make it another day. 

I grew up always taking a backseat to what everyone else in my family wanted. I never demanded attention, never needed to be in the spotlight. I've always wanted everyone else to be happy, even if it meant being inconvenienced or giving up on something I wanted. Now it's my wedding. MY F**KING WEDDING - the one time I should be allowed to demand attention and not have to cater to everyone else. And I'm being told that my wedding date is inconvenient by the two people who know I wouldn't do this without them. 

What started as a wonderful, beautiful day has turned into me sitting at my desk at work, trying not to cry because I'm upset, and frustrated, and I don't know what to do. 

Feel free to tell me if I'm being unreasonable, or whatever your thoughts are. I just had to get this out. Sorry. 

***EDIT***

I just want to say thank you to everyone who's posted their kind words, support, and personal stories here. You all are absolutely right, and I deserve to have my day.

I spoke to my mom, and I stood my ground. And, somehow, she came around to see my side of things. She ended up saying that she's taking that day off, and ""tough cookies"" if her boss doesn't like it. My sister remains on the fence, but knowing that my mom will at least be there has set me at ease.

We got engaged about 6 months ago, and are looking at a wedding date around early 2014. We did not expect any financial help from either set of parents, and were happy to pay for the entire wedding ourselves. My fiancé's parents recently mentioned to him - in passing - that they would like to make a very generous contribution to the wedding, and my mum told me she would like to contribute as well. Neither set of parents is putting specific conditions on these contributions - indeed, fiancé's mum told me that I didn't have to feel obliged to invite all of his cousins when I mentioned to her that I would like to.

My concerns are that my FFIL has made a number of offhand comments about the cost of different things, implying that we are spending too much or being too 'extravagant' when we have mentioned our approx price range for different items. He doesn't have a problem with the type of reception we are going for - a sit-down dinner - but has no idea about how much weddings cost.

I'm from a capital city in Australia, a basic 3-course, house wine and beer package is $100/person - and that pricing is consistent no matter where we go, even if we hire a hall with external caterers and our own alcohol (we've investigated all of these options!). He keeps referencing his wedding, which was 40+ years ago, and just brushing us off when we tell him that things have changed. 

If he had a problem with the type of reception - e.g. He thought we should have a cocktail reception instead to save money - I would be more understanding. The problem is that he literally has no idea how much a function costs - wedding or not - and refuses to change his perceptions no matter what. Him and my FMIL recently attended a niece's wedding and afterward he told me that their reception ""only cosy $4000 and it was really nice, no need to be too extravagant"". I asked him how many people that was for, and he said 40 - so $100/person! Even when I pointed this out, he still didn't get it! There is really no option to get our guest list that low, we are looking at 65+ people for just family. My FMIL agrees with us that he has unreasonable expectations, but he won't listen to her either. 

I have spoken to my fiancé about this, and it bothers him a little bit too, but he keeps saying that his father will be disappointed in him, not me, so I shouldn't worry about it. I really don't feel that this is true, and I find it really hurtful that he would think either of us would be overly extravagant or irresponsible with money - we recently bought a house, despite both being full-time students, and are on track to pay off the mortgage in 5 years. 

The obvious solution is to sit down with him and talk about it, but this is hard because he hasn't made a big deal out of it - it's been mainly little comments in passing, and I know I will come off as overly petty and defensive if I insist we sit down and prove we are spending money sensibly. Him and my FMIL are giving us the money no matter what, and won't withhold it if he thinks we are being extravagant, so that's not the issue - I just really don't want him to think that me and/or my fiancé are irresponsible with money. I get the feeling that he would make little comments throughout the planning process and on the day itself, which would majorly stress me out.

 I did mention once, semi-jokingly, that he was welcome to find us a cheaper wedding venue - he came back with an idea that we have the reception in a public park, ""so there are no hire fees and you can bring your own food and alcohol"". He hadn't considered how we would get a power connection to the caterers, who would serve the food/drinks, where the tables/chairs/crockery/glasses would come from, who would set it up, etc. - just mentioned the park and then said that it was easy to find somewhere if we looked hard enough, and started talking about something else so I couldn't interject and tell him all of this. 

I'm truly at my wits end with this - it is important to me that he doesn't see us as overly extravagant or bad with money, but I don't want to come across as petty or defensive by making it a huge deal. Any advice?

TLDR: Future father-in-law has no concept of how much weddings cost, thinks we're being extravagant when we mention average prices for our area, won't listen to reason or examples. I don't want to make a huge deal out of it and come across as overly defensive or petty, but this is really bothering me.

I thought I would update since so many people were kind of to offer their advice.

Since my bridesmaid (fiance's aunt) has been ignoring me, my fiance decided to try and contact her and set up a time to get together and talk. She dodged his attempts yesterday saying she wouldn't be home (she was, we drove by on our way into town), and then again today tried to dodge his asking when she would be available this week.

 She decided to let my fiance know via text message that she ""doesn't feel comfortable being a bridesmaid"" because she is so much older than the rest of us (we're all late twenties, she is mid-thirties) and she also will not be attending the wedding, but is going to stay home with her children instead. She claims that her not attending the wedding has nothing to do with our ""no children"" wedding, but she won't explain why she isn't coming.

She still won't talk to me. I sent her a text message (because I know she there is no other way to get in touch with her at this point) reminding her that I asked her to be a bridesmaid (she claims my fiance asked her, that hurt) because of how much she meant to me and that I regret that she is no longer a bridesmaid. I felt like I had to say it. I had to take that control in that moment and let her know I was hurt, but I was relieving her of this title too. This is the first time we have ever had a disagreement in the eight years we've been friends. I have no idea where all of this ill-will is coming from and I'm incredibly hurt by it. I guess she was never as good of a friend as I thought she was.

I was so wrapped up in my own emotions about this that it took me a little time to realize something far more important- she is not only doing this to me, but to her own nephew! It's so sad that her selfishness has brought her to this level. I used to defend her when her own family talked smack behind her back, but now I get it. I understand where their feelings are coming from. My fiance and I have just never been the direct recipients of her spitefulness. 

Needless to say, future family functions are going to be... different. She tends to organize and run them all. Who knows if we'll even get invites any more. My fiance has already said that we are not sending her a wedding invitation either, regardless of what happens over the next five months. 

I was really hoping my wedding would be drama free, although maybe from here on out it will be.

Thanks for reading this and the original post. It sucks the way things ended, but at least it's been put to rest. Now I will just be focusing on the rest of my planning and looking forward to the big day!

TL;DR- fiance's aunt/bridesmaid is not only out of the wedding party, but she has also decided she will not be attending the wedding. She made these decisions on her own without actually sitting down and having a conversation with my and my fiance.

So my venue will accommodate 100 guests, I have a list in front of me with 104 people. 

My moms side of the family is a little, can't think of the appropriate term....rednecky? They are a vast number of people and have been very successful in repopulating. I know I have to invite my aunt and uncle, and sense I am inviting all two of the cousins I have on my dads side I realize I have to invite all 9 of them and their spouses. Fine I can bite the bullet on that. Here's the issue many on them have kids of their own, some of them I haven't even met, and don't know there names. I have so little room for the friends I truly want to come to me wedding, I do not want these extra people. 

So if I only put the names of my cousin and her spouse on her invite, one would think that would be enough to make the message clear, but as I mentioned these people may not recognize the proper etiquette in going to a wedding. They may just BRING their kids, or some of the teenage ones  may just BRING dates. How can I stop this from happening?!

(Warning: I tried to break up the text as much as I could, but still a wall.)

**Backstory:** My fiance has an older step brother, we'll call him Phil. Phil, my fiance and I all kind of grew up together, and my fiance and I have know each other for 10+ years. Phil moved out west for work, leaving his longtime (2.5 years) girlfriend back home. While out west, he got another girl pregnant and immediately married her (we'll call her Megan), not really giving his girlfriend or family back home any explanation, just a phone call that said ""I got Megan pregnant and now we're married"". No one has really met her or knows her because they never visit because now they have two children and my fiance's family can hardly find time to make the trip out to visit. As of now, they're looking to move back because his work might be transferring him. 

**Now, my issue:** When my fiance and I got engaged and even before, things were fine and dandy between me and Megan, we would chat via text, FB message and comment on each other's statuses on FB, general things that friends do. But some of the things she says and views she has on things are a little strange, like when she married Phil, she called up his ex who was trying to get in touch with him and cussed her out saying how she was nuts and needs to let him go and to stop trying to contact him because he obviously doesn't want to be with her. Anyway, once we started planning our wedding, we decided that we didn't want any children there other than my fiances half brother and sister (8 and 12) who are in the wedding as readers - and we didn't make that decision until recently. The children that Phil and Megan have are both under the age of 4 and they're the kind of parents that refuse to leave their children with a babysitter or a family member if they ever go on vacation, out on a date and even to the movies. I know some kids can sit still and be quiet, but every wedding (and other major event I've been to) where children were welcome, the children were running around the entire time and screaming and carrying on, and that is something that I don't want at my wedding. Also, our reception venue is located in a historic building in the wine cellar, and they don't like having small children down there. They don't forbid it, but when I talked to the person who I'd be working with, they made it very clear that they do not want small children down there that could get lost or hurt themselves. I sent her a message letting her know that the wedding will be adults only and that children aren't allowed in the venue space and also let her know who was going to in the wedding (she had asked me awhile before and we hadn't nailed down) and told her it was just going to be my sister and my fiance's younger (16) half sister as the bridesmaids and his best friend and half brother (16) as his groomsmen. I also let her know that I would be willing to hire a babysitter for the night and pay, if she wanted me to. All I got back from her was ""okay."" Just the one word from my whole email. I was concerned because I sent her a few more messages and never heard back, so I was unsure if she was mad that the whole rest of the family was in the wedding and her and Phil and their children weren't or if she was mad because we were doing an adults only wedding.

I heard through my mother who went to lunch with my future MIL and she told my mother that Megan is livid that I don't want children at the wedding, and my future MIL took my side saying that weddings really aren't a place for small children. 

She has also made rude remarks about me and my fiance and how we're planning our wedding to other family members and right now with them moving back closer to us, I'm unsure if I should try and salvage the relationship between us. Should I ask her to help with little things having to do with the wedding to make her feel more involved (I get the sense that's what she's mad about) or should I just let this go and deal with the relationship after the wedding? Some family members think that she might be jealous that my fiance's parents (both mom, dad, step-dad and step-mom) are offering to chip in for the wedding and making a huge deal out of it, and she didn't get any of that with her wedding. It would make sense, but this all started before family members started offering to pay for some of the big ticket items. 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post, but I didn't know where else to post it and I've been lurking around this sub, r/weddings and r/wedding for awhile and it seems like there are a good amount of posts about how to handle family members for weddings.

Hey, Weddit.  I went out trying on dresses for the second time today with my maid of honor. There was one dress I tried on that practically fit me like a glove, was almost exactly the style I wanted (and was alterable to be exactly what I want), and was discounted because it was a sample sale.

I sent pictures to my mom to see what she thought.  Therein lies my mistake.

Now, a little background before we get into what happened.  First, my mother is a very practical woman.  She grew up poor, she rented her wedding dress and I'm not sure she gave two shits about what it looked like, either.  She's the kind of person where it was a big achievement when she graduated from wearing novelty-print sweatshirts with built-in collars.  Second, my parents told me a couple weeks ago that they wanted to pay for the wedding costs as is tradition, and that they basically trusted me to be the relentless bargain-hunter that I am and get the best deals for their money.

So, back to showing my mom pictures.

She had NOTHING to say about what I looked like in the dress, or even what the dress itself looked like.  ALL she could focus on was the ""outrageous"" price.  For reference, the price was 1225 down from 1780.  Actually words that came out of her mouth: ""we just don't pay 1200 for a dress you're only going to wear once,"" and, ""David's Bridal has dresses under 600 dollars, you just don't *like* any of them"".

I ended the phone conversation with her, asked my MoH to drive home, and cried half the way there as well as when I got home.

I know I can just pay for the dress myself if I want it.  That's not the point; the point is, she just DIDN'T HAVE ANY POSITIVE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE to seeing me look fabulous and happy.  How the hell am I supposed to deal with that??

**TL;DR My mom didn't care about her daughter in a wedding dress looking happy, only that it was too much money**

She has been married and divorced twice now (and she's 45 now), and we weren't the most enthused at her second marriage since they got engaged after a few months and thought she was rushing it a bit. At that time, she complained and took that to mean we ""didn't want her to be happy""; not the case. 15 months later (Fall of 2012), they got divorced, and my fiancee's younger brother (now 19) had recently moved to Texas for the military, so she is now living alone.


Fast-forward to a few weeks before we are able to tell her *our* good news, and we find out that she's been going to get check-ups regarding possibly having cancer. The day we're going to tell her we're engaged, we had planned breakfast with her. We arrive at her house, my fiancee initially hides her ring, we all catch up a bit (we weren't able to visit around Christmas), and then my fiancee puts her ring on and we tell her the news. In the span of about two minutes, her mother went from ""Congratulations! I thought something was up!"" to ""Oh, I found I have breast cancer."" quite nonchalantly. All of breakfast was discussing her diagnosis and treatment, and no mention of her happiness of us being engaged. *Please don't take this to mean we are unconcerned about her mother's diagnosis; we certainly are. We were simply hoping for a more happy gathering.*


Skip ahead to February, and we're trying to schedule visits to venues. We had seen a few on our own, and after we narrowed down to our primary choice, our families wanted to take a look as well. My family is very close-knit, so they wanted to be involved. Her dad and stepmom wanted to join in whenever they could, and her mom wanted to keep updated. We scheduled a return visit to our first-choice venue, we first invited her dad and stepmom, but they were going to be out of state that weekend. So she asked her mom, and my mom planned on joining as well. Anyone from New England can tell you that the Winter sucked, and we had to reschedule because of a nor'easter. When we scheduled the next one, her dad and stepmom could go, so we initially didn't invite her mom because her parents don't get along (moreso, her mom doesn't like her dad at all, and her dad is indifferent; it's more of a one-way dislike now). We never told her mom she couldn't go, but when she asked when we were going again and we told her, along with that my fiancee's dad was going, she flipped out and said assumed we were purposely not inviting her.


**This is where everything gets out of hand.** This was not in person, and was neither over the phone. Instead, she texted my fiancee about eight or so unanswered texts, blasting her about topics ranging from money, ""not wanting her to be involved"", my fiancee being ""spoiled"" and ""selfish"", us ""not caring about her in her time of need"", etc.My fiancee's mother has always been touchy with money, having withheld child support money from my fiancee when we moved out and she sold my fiancee's old bed, and especially with student loans (her claiming to have paid a significant portion of my fiancee's college costs when this was simply co-signing). At this time, we had not brought up paying for the wedding at all, and all things considered never expected nor wanted her to help out. She thought that my fiancee's stepmother is trying to take her place as my fiancee's mom, despite my fiancee being 22 and living on her own for years, and her stepmom having three kids of her own. In one of the texts, she proclaimed that even my fiancee's grandmother has ""always thought she was a selfish person who only cares about people when they give them things."" This was the most outlandish of statements, since we had just seen her grandparents within a few weeks, and everything was great; they were happy to hear we were engaged. With my fiancee's mother essentially insulting her nonstop over the course of a half hour, we chose to ignore the situation for the time being.


There was no contact for about three weeks, when my fiancee reached out, asking for her mother to apologize for the hurtful texts and to start being apart of the wedding planning. We had secured the venue, but her mother refused to apologize, and instead insulted her again for being selfish by ""making this about her"", despite it being out the wedding. Things came to a grinding halt when the Marathon Bombings happened in Boston. Her mother knew we had went to Fenway for the Sox game that day, and we were at Kenmore Square about a mile away from everything. At the time, with the lack of information and all the news reports claiming bombs, we were trying to get ahold of friends, and our family was contacting contacting us making sure we were okay. Everyone but her mom, that is. Both my fiancee's brother and grandmother told her she should call her mother, so she did. Her mother responded with a half-hearted ""I assumed you guys were fine."" The conversation quickly degraded into another argument about ""my fiancee being selfish"" and her mother not trying to be apart of our lives and the wedding.


Until today, that was the last time my fiancee and her mother had spoken. Her brother is home on military leave for a week, and her mother agreed to meet with her and her brother, with him acting as somewhat of a mediator. I chose not to attend this session because I didn't want it to seem like we were bullying against her. My fiancee drove 90-minute drive across the state to meet with her mother, and unfortunately I got a call after everything saying that nothing had changed. Her mother still thinks we need to be ""more supportive of her"", that she's standing by all of her insults ""telling it like it is"", and that she doesn't need anyone to tell her what to do. I'm not sure how we can be any more supportive, since after the initial diagnosis, we had talked about her upcoming appointments, wishing her the best, etc. She deleted us from Facebook (childish, I know) because we weren't showing enough support for her on her Timeline. She despises my fiancee's stepmom and refuses to acknowledge that she's a good person who's not trying to ""steal her children"" in some strange way. She's not interested in being apart of the wedding unless my fiancee apologizes for being a terrible, selfish daughter, showing support for her by driving home to see her on weekends, etc. She referred to herself as a ""survivor"" once or twice during the in-person conversation. It's gotten out of control, and is causing unnecessary stress for us, mainly my fiancee.


My parents have offered to help with the wedding, and so has my fiancee's dad and stepmom. We don't ask for money anywhere, as both my fiancee and I work full-time in Greater Boston. She's attending classes part-time for a second degree in Nursing, and will be going full-time after the wedding. We pay our rent, bills, and student loans, and my fiancee's mother is the only one who thinks we have issues with money. During the conversation earlier today, she used an example during this past Christmas of me asking her to split the cost of a laptop for my fiancee before her classes started as a reason of us ""always"" asking her for money. We didn't get that gift, and she got her something else. Cancer is terrible, but it's not an excuse to act this way to your own daughter. The insults and negligence on the part of my fiancee's mother has come to the point that we're considering not inviting her to the wedding. I don't think this would go over well with either my parents, my fiancee's dad, or my fiancee's brother. I never thought it would have gotten to this point.


**tl;dr** My fiancee's mother has gotten increasingly more insulting, outlandish, and disrespectful when it comes to our wedding planning and more importantly her and my fiancee's relationship, and we;re considering not inviting her to the wedding.

I saw the table and my heart sank. My coordinator called the vendor, repeatedly every five minutes. I grab a cell phone and start calling. I left a message to call me back. Nothing. My coordinator walks up to me with a confused look and said, I just spoke with Chelsea at Kingdom Cakes and she says she isn't your vendor. 

I grab her phone and start calling. Repeatedly. All my calls are going to voicemail. I had to go hunt down my phone, show her my emails and payment receipt that all say Kingdom Cakes and Chelsea's name.

I respond to one of the final emails I had from our vendor saying, ""you don't know me. Call me now!"" Did she call? No. Instead she emailed a long apology on how her outlook email deleted my event. That she was sorry and is refunding my money. 

I had no dessert to serve our guests. No cake cutting to perform with my now husband. My day went from fantastic to nightmare in under five minutes. The most talked about thing at my wedding was the cake not being there. People kept telling me how sorry they are instead of congratulations and how beautiful everything looked.

We are super excited about the move, so I had the idea to cancel our traditional registry and create a HoneyFund where each expense item is a ""hint"" to where we are going to be moving!  We would put in items like Gas Costs (with a description of how many miles it will be), Flip Flops, Tiny Umbrellas, Hemingway Books, etc.  It might be fairly easy to guess where we're going, but we thought it would be a cute way to ask for financial help with the move since it's so close to the wedding, and we can't take our belongings with us.

I just got a message asking for an update on [my previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1gjc24/an_i_being_a_bridezilla_or_am_i_justified_here/), so I decided to post it here, because so many of you were so thoughtful and gave me really great advice, for which I am very grateful.

So, the friend in question texted me the next day and said he was, in fact, going to come. He sort of apologized, though there are things I'm still very angry about. He didn't apologize for calling me emotionally abusive and manipulative, which had been really hurtful. I'm also still annoyed with him painting himself as the victim constantly, like nothing was ever his fault - he would say he couldn't come, then later when I got pissed he said ""I never said I couldn't come, I just wanted to talk to you about it!"" So he's still claiming that he never said he wasn't coming, though he did say that at least 3 times, and that selective memory bullshit really gets under my skin. But I'm trying to let it go, and I don't feel like now is the time to bring it up. If it's still bothering me down the line, I'll talk to him about it, but for now I'm just working on being grateful that my good friend is going to be with me during this amazing time in my life. I don't think we're going to see him until our July 4th cookout, so it gives me a little time to cool off.

Anyway, sorry if that got long. Yes, he is coming, so I get to have my friend there and I avoid pissing off my family. It had a happy ending after all.

I've been engaged for about two months now, and welll.. That's about it.
  
I've been on pinterest for ever, looked at a million timelines. I just don't know what to do!  i feel so much pressure to start producing things but lack of communication is killing me. My fiance are going to shoot for September of 2014 for our wedding. I'm not from around here, so I dont know much in terms of venues- I'm not at all religious so i'm not affiliated with any type of church.

My biggest gripe is that I make no money. Like i'm saying I scrape by every single month.. My boyfriend and I live together and while he makes a comfortable living, we still have seperate bank accounts so I have no way of budgeting anything. I'm trying really hard to get a second job, but I have a daughter, no family here, and a third shift job which makes it really hard for me to work around my schedule. So when people (like my mom, or my future mother in law, or my grandparents) start asking me, well what food are you going to have, where are you going to have it, whats your dress look like, and in my mind i'm just thinking, Alright I might be able to save up 500 bucks by next september if I don't eat for a while, so I hear Subway caters...

I really don't know how to go about the whole... budgeting aspect of a wedding. My fiance's parents make a comfortable living. My family does not. They live about three states away and my mom might as well be living in a condemned building and ""owns her own business"" which means they live off of her boyfriends pizza guy job and she lies on her taxes every year to survive. My dad hasn't had a job in almost 6 years, but his wife makes very good money. I can't expect my step mom of 6 years to pay for my wedding, but I also can't expect my future inlaws to do the same.

I would love a simple and small wedding, but my fiance has a very large family, and  his parents have said a dozen times ""You can't leave anyone out."" So my guest list is at the very most 40 people., while his is closer to 120 people. And seeing as a lot of his family would be coming in from out of state, and ALL of my family would be coming from out of state, that would make the rehearsal dinner a must, Right? I haven't been to many weddings, but it seems like you have to treat all of the ""out of towners"" to a fancy meal the day before :l

I'm rambling now out of stress, so now i'll just tldr.

**TL:DR** Not sure how to have those ""who is paying for what"" conversations and how to start budgeting for a wedding while i'm broke.

*edit* Man, every time I'm on reddit I End up saying something that turns out to sound wrong. But thank you guys for the advice! No one involved here is a ""jerk"".. My fiance's dad has 11 brothers and sisters that he's all really close with, and each of them have several kids.. The 120 guest list isn't like, brothers sisters cousin's wife stuff. 

And my fiance and i DO share bills and what not. but, he litterally makes about 4 or 5 times as much money as I do, and I feel like I couldnt justify going half on anything, but no one has offered anything to help yet. I just wanted to know the best way to go about figuring that out. Like do I just send out a a card like, ""Do you want to help pay for my wedding, check yes, or no.""?

We have 2 weeks left. The to-do list I gave my fiance 3 **months** ago is still mostly undone. It's stressful over here, and I need some perspective.

I've offered to help, I've offered to take the projects from him if it's too much, and he declines every time. 

He says he hasn't completed any of the tasks because he doesn't have any time to do so. He does work full time. But so do I. And yet I've managed to get everything *other* than what's on his list done. 

When we get home, I cook dinner, and then I go to my ""other job"" of planning this dang wedding. He will occasionally jump in, but usually wants to help me ""de-stress"" by going out or playing video games-- even though this is only delaying the completion of projects and making it harder for me to get things done in a reasonable amount of time.

In the four months since we've actually started planning, he's been able to research, gather parts for, build, and program a RC helicopter, he's been able to hunt down and install parts for his car, he's worked on his friends cars, loaded up laptops to work with custom hardware designs and *delivered* them (not a job-- for free as favors to friends). He finds the time to do the things *he wants to do* and will huff and sigh when I ask him to *listen to and weigh in on* the list of music I spent 3 nights compiling. Or pick out a wedding band for himself. Or find a rental company to rent the glasses that he was so insistent that we have for our reception. Because it's too much effort and too much pressure.

I don't know what to do anymore. He's frustrated because he feels like he can't do anything right, but I feel like he's not even trying. He's giving up and calling it impossible without working toward the goal. And I'm stuck here holding the bag.

Before selecting this dress I had tried on a few others, but they all seemed to shiny, or big, or heavy for my outdoor wedding. When I bought the dress, the sales lady told me I was in between sizes, and ordered the size up for me with the assurance that you can always make a dress smaller. For those of you going on this logic, here are some things to consider. 

1. Making a dress smaller is expensive. With the few pounds that I lost (maybe 5?) from actually bothering to go to the gym, I could have easily done a few crunches and fit into the size below. That would have saved me a lot of money. 

2. Making a lace dress smaller can be tricky. At some point, it becomes hard to take away the excess lace and retain the dress shape, or keep the bust in line. My seamstress was making a big stink about it, so I guess I should have looked for seams, or considered it's current seamless-ness to be a bit of a problem. 

3. The cups that you have sewn into your dress because being bra-less is awesome don't offer much support. I'm a 'D' cup but I had to buy those little 'cutlet' things so that I filled the dress out properly. I don't have saggy boobs, but they do benefit from a little extra underneath! 

4. Because I wanted to wear flats, the entire bottom of the dress had to be shortened. This mean un-laminating all of the lace at the bottom (about a foot-long strip) and sewing it back on to the dress at the right spot. My seamstress at some point suggested I just go spend that money on heels (which I can't walk in) and the problem would be fixed. 

5. Once the dress is finally tailored to fit you, it will look 100% better than you can imagine. Seriously, no more squinting, imagining, pulling in, wondering... It's either fit to you or it isn't (luckily mine is pretty much fit to me!). 

TL;DR: Ask a lot of questions, especially if you buy your dress from someone who doesn't do the tailoring (or visit the tailor, then buy the dress!).

You have been warned- this is REALLY long. Sorry! TLDR at the bottom..

So I see RSVP woes on here all the time, and I have often thought to myself how lucky I am to have sane and courteous friends and family- but we are starting to have some problems as the RSVP's are rolling in. 

My mom and dad met a couple about 3 years ago and became pretty close friends. They are now at every holiday, family party and camping trip. I've never particularly liked them as people- the wife is extremely controlling and flips if things aren't perfect and is always talking about people behind their backs. She has also used lending money to my parents as ways of seemingly manipulating them, asking them to take up whole weekends they had originally planned out to help them fix their car or motorcycle, have them watch their dogs etc. The husband is just kind of lazy and has a bit of a creep factor. As a couple they are uncomfortably disrespectful of each other. They'll call each other names, make fun of each others weight, yell at each other about things they did or didn't do, and all of this in front of my entire family. Their only daughter is 18 (maybe 19) and is spoiled. They just bought her a brand new car, a brand new quad,paid for all of her college... You know the situation- has never wanted for anything in their entire life. Not necessarily a bad thing, but she's not used to not getting what she wants. All in all- not my favorite people but would mean a lot to my mom if they came. BTW- we are paying for the entire wedding with no financial help from others. 

We are trying pretty hard to keep our guest list down- as are most of us. Our contract allows 95 people, plus our 5 vendors. If more than a hundred people come our wedding package will be upgraded to the next 'package' and we don't want that- it's an extra 2k. We invited 111, knowing at least 6 of those won't come, expecting at least 10 others won't be able to make it. Taking a bit of a risk but I'm pretty confident that it'll be under 100 when it's all said and done- it's a Thursday evening wedding. Buuuuut- we haven't gotten any declines yet so we will see..

Anyways, a week after invites go out my mom texts me asking if this friend of hers can pay for her daughter to bring a date. I told her as of now we have no room in our contract, that we are trying to keep it intimate, and that we really don't have room for anyone. She texts again saying ""Really? Even if she pays for it?"" Not wanting to explain our entire contract to her over text, and it being too late to call, and stupid me- not thinking it's a huge deal, I just repeated sorry no- we are trying to keep our number under wraps, and there is a 'b list' of people we are inviting if we get excessive declines. I heard from my sisters that my mom thought it was rude of her to try and invite someone, but at the same time she got upset at me for not just letting him come... There's never really been a way to please her... Any who- I thought that was that. 

A week later I get that families RSVP back. The way I have the RSVP set up is I have the line ""We have __ number of seats reserved in your honor"" written at the top, a line to write in their names and ""__ out of __ will be attending"". We gave them 3 seats, one for each person on the invite  (mom, dad &amp; daughter). They took the liberty of writing 4 people will be attending and ""So and so family +guest."" So even after my mom told them we didn't have room they still had the gall to invite a random stranger to our wedding. And even when it states explicitly that there are only 3 seats allotted to them- twice!!

Our 'policy' on +1's I thought was pretty understandable. Serious relationships- a plus if we've met them, married/engaged/living together, traveling to see us, or in the bridal party. This is a family unit- they know plenty of other people there. I have never heard that this daughter is dating anyone. We had to tell many people to stop inviting extended family and friends to the wedding as news was spreading like wildflower and distant relatives I've never met or heard of came out of the woodworks planning to use our wedding as an excuse to go on a vacation. I'm not making that up- that's what my grandmother actually said to me. She was quite upset when I told her we only wanted people we know to be there, and I had to make many phone calls telling everyone to stop telling people about our wedding- we wanted an intimate event. And once we let one person bring someone- we don't really have a leg to stand on anymore if someone else tries to pull the same thing- right?

This was 4 days ago and I still get very upset at this- just the fact that we already said no and she's still trying to weasel around things and get her way. We haven't contacted the couple yet- we will be seeing the couple on Sunday so hoping to come up with how to handle this situation by then. 

I feel like I have to either be a bridezilla and tell her no- and then I would become one of those people she bitches about, and have to deal with potential awkwardness at every single family get together ever, or be a push over. I really don't like either option... 

So I have come to you guys! What do you guys think I should do? Allow the daughter to bring a date (and hate and resent him from afar?) or upset the crazy family friend and risk being called bridezilla for the rest of my days, because apparently this lady is always going to be around... Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR- Mom's friend inviting date for her daughter even though we already told her there was no room for him. Don't want to upset the family friend dynamic, but don't want to be a push over either...

So today my FMIL emailed me asking for a copy of our wedding budget and said that we can review it together next time we see each other.  Don't get me wrong I really appreciate everything my FMIL has done for us so far but I feel like this is an bit to far. 

 Yes she is helping financially but shes not paying for the whole thing.  And at one point she said she thought the wedding should be under $10 000 which is not the case since we are inviting 145 people and I wanted a few nice things at the wedding.  

I consider my self very money conscious and it bothers me that she feels we need to review it with her.  I know she will tell us we need to cut things but its a little late for that the weddings in 2 months!  Besides I know we can afford what we are getting and if we cut out things we won't be having the wedding we want. She has already taken it upon herself to do things for us that we didn't as for or want but we looked past it. But this is really starting to get to me.

I've lost all my enthusiasm for planning the wedding since I bought it. I can't even think about getting married without getting sad now. Its just so plain, and boring and made out of some kind of shiny satin that will look awful in pictures. Its nothing I ever wanted to wear when I got married.

Any specific pitfalls not commonly known?,15,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/14e9lb/im_considering_a_destination_wedding_any_specific/,"My fiancee and I are considering changing our wedding plans from a local, fairly traditional ceremony &amp; reception to having a destination wedding to Iceland. Outside of the typical ""Check the country's laws to make sure it's legally recognized both there and in the US"", and trying to coordinate a wedding 4 time-zones away, are there any specific things we should be mindful of in making a decision? We both would LOVE to have it in Iceland, but are both extremely hesitant to do so. Here's some background information:

* We got engaged in Iceland this past Spring.
* Here, we're looking at a 200-ish person. Most of it is due to us having large &amp; tightly-knit families that not inviting would trigger major issues. She's a bit less willing to deal with the fallout than I am. A destination provides an easy-out for slashing the guest-list to maybe 40 invites (could this still be way too high?) limited to only immediate, first-degree family, the wedding party, and a few close friends. We expect some of the closer friends to decline, anyway.

* Our ""here"" wedding is slated for April 2014, but moving it to Iceland would also move it up to September 2013 more than likely. This is obviously less time to save.

* Cost in many ways may be cheaper. Food is $70 vs $120 for here, although the US price includes lighting and other frilly things). Iceland is maybe $70 with group discounts. $900 for transportation of a group from the airport to the hotel and back. Hotel is roughly $100/night. We'd cover the two nights most people would be there. This is on par with local, but the hotel is MUCH nicer.

*  We'd have no wedding coordinator to handle things for us ""over there"" like we would if we picked somewhere tropical. We'd be planning 95% of everything right from here.

By removing many of the frilly things and having a more casual reception, I think we'd cut the overall cost of things from roughly $30k to maybe $20 K. We haven't looked at any church fees in Iceland, but a big issue may be finding a photographer/DJ from over here.
  
We'd fly out in late January to book a place and hopefully schedule a photographer. To me, having it in Iceland would be absolutely beautiful, but there is the cost of guests' airfare that may prevent them from going. This may sound rude to consider, but we'd also lose out significantly on gifts that would either offset some of the wedding cost or prevent us from buying all the miscellaneous items people normally get.
  
If you can't tell, we're looking for excusesto have it there...it just seems so far *out there* that we're not sure it's a good decision or if we're overlooking significant stress-factors in trying to plan a destination wedding.  I know airfare will turn some people off, but is there anything else we *should* be doing beyond covering their transportation/hotel costs?

We've just recently (within last month) set the date and booked the venues and our extended family are asking lots of questions about it. Which is understandable. 
Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled they are taking an interest...but we are trying to play our cards close to our chest at this stage due to various personal reasons. 

We've been polite when we've said that we're keeping it a surprise for a bit longer, and when my future SIL said ""I can't wait to see where it is"" I just smiled and said something about it being very 'us' and everyone will like it. It's only a month or two until the invitations go out so they will have plenty of time for organizing once they receive the invites. It's a very convenient location for the whole family too so no flights or hotels will need to be booked. The most we've said is that it will be at the Botanic Gardens, and it will be at lunchtime.

I'm worried we came off as rude because we aren't telling everyone around us every little detail of our wedding plans so far. I believe that the more you hear about something the less you end up actually listening to...and I don't want to be one of those brides that only ever talks about her wedding and tells every last detail of it.

Should I just indulge them even though I am uncomfortable talking about something that isn't fully organised yet?

Now I need advice on a bridesmaid.

Ok, we've been engaged for 2 years. I didn't listen to advice and asked my girl friends to be bridesmaids within a couple of months. One of the girls I asked I had known for a few years and we hung out somewhat regularly. About 2 months after I asked her she went away for college and I've seen her a grand total of 2 times in the past year and a half. I don't have any mutual friends with her, and honestly I don't have much in common with her anymore. She's ignored countless texts and FB messages from me over the past year and a half asking her how life was going (when she did respond, she just talked about her problems and how shit her life was). Already she wasn't a good fit for a bridesmaid but I figured what the hell, we'll get through it.

Now my sister, my maid of honor, is telling me that this girl has blown off a planning meeting today and is ignoring everyone's messages asking her how her projects for the shower are going. It really pisses me off because she's back home from school for summer break (I learned through FB, she didn't even bother to tell me she's back in town), she doesn't have a job, and she's just posting pictures of her hanging out with her other friends all the time. My sister has a 15 month old baby, is working on her master's during summer break from teaching high school full time, and is constantly busy, so this girl giving my sister the run around is infuriating.

The thing is that 6 months ago I sent her a message telling her that if she was too busy to do the wedding and to commit to helping with things, I'd totally understand if she wanted to step down. She responded saying she was so sorry that she was so distant, but that things would be different after midterms. It didn't change, she's worse now, and I just don't get why she wants to be a bridesmaid! I'm really unhappy with this girl, and I honestly don't really want her to be a bridesmaid. I know that asking her to step down would probably end our friendship, but at this point there's not much of one so I'm not too worried. It doesn't help her that I'm doing awesome things for my bridesmaids as a present to thank them for their help, so I feel really uncomfortable dropping a couple hundred bucks on her for doing nothing. How should I go about telling her that she's still welcome at the wedding if she wants to go, but I really don't feel comfortable having her in the wedding party.

I got to the shop and FELL IN LOVE with the first dress I tried on, AA 2041. Last Friday I had my maid of honor and a bridesmaid see it and they loved it, even though they're both anti-short dress! 

Today I had made an appointment for the Alfred Angelo store in San Antonio where my mom is, since she wanted to see it (note: my mom and I do NOT get along well). We shopped at David's Bridal too, and I liked some of the Oleg Cassini short dresses. I got to Alfred Angelo, and the dress I love has been discontinued. I tried on other short dresses but didn't love them as much. The ladies said they would scour the inventory of other stores and let me know if they could get ahold of one. 

After a few hours I had given up hope and went back to David's Bridal to get the runner-up dress. I'm literally walking in the door when the Alfred Angelo in Albuquerque calls me and says they have the dress in my size, only downside is it's white instead of the ivory I wanted. I said I'll take it! And since it was on clearance and they have a 50% clearance price sale on right now, total price including shipping is $119!!! Normally this dress is about $350. I was ecstatic and broke down crying. My mom still offered to pay for it even without seeing it because she saw how much I really wanted that dress and figured even if it didn't work out, it was only about $100.

Her immediate reaction is that she doesn't want to discuss wedding planning because she wants me to get married a minimum of 2 years from now. I'm talking that was the second thing out of her mouth after ""congratulations"". Then, she didn't celebrate with us, but left. In fact, that was her reaction every time I brought up my boyfriend and I getting engaged before it actually happened: ""Well, I hope you don't want to get married in a year""

I was upset. We went to dinner last night to clear the air. Her ""apology"" was ""I'm sorry you're so sensitive, but I was tired."" in response to my question about her attitude. I also brought up that if she is concerned about money, that we are prepared to pay ourselves. She was visibly offended by this. She went on to say that its not a good time for her because they're selling their house and she has a lot on her plate and is stressed. I will also add that she does not work and has not worked for about 30 years- so not a ton of stress in every day life.

She also told me that she is still not over the death of her sister and her mother and its hard for her to be excited for me. While I understand that to an extent, they passed away 3 years ago. I feel like could possibly be a ploy to make me feel bad... and its working. She also fears her opinions do not matter because I have made some decisions already about what I want for my wedding, examples: 

1. Milkshakes instead of cake 
2. My friend's cover band to play (which they agreed to do for free)
3. A venue that allows outside catering so my parent's restaurant can cater and we can save money

She said the fact that I have made decisions on these things without consulting her is horribly hurtful and she disagrees with 1 &amp; 2. She also said she insists on coming to venues to look at them, but won't give me a time frame other than ""not in the next 2 years"". So she has effectively undercut any ability for me to look at them this fall, which is when my fiance and I want to look- unless we want to pay for it ourselves which will cause a HUGE fight. 

I'm not sure what to do. I want her to be happy for me, I want her to be involved and her opinions matter... but when she acts this way, I just want to make decisions on my own to give myself less of a headache. Christ, I genuinely feel guilty I got engaged and I know my fiance hates this and finds her selfish. All this drama not one week after getting engaged makes me want to elope. It's not what I'd REALLY want, but I don't know if I can handle all this bullshit either. 

Can anyone give me some advice?

I have no clue what to do. I will be 5 months pregnant when our wedding happens. This is not how I pictured my day. We've been paying for this all ourselves. Should I put it off?? What to do about my bridesmaids dresses and their money spent?? How about those 100 invites I ordered? How to tell people hey I'm pregnant come to my wedding? Anyone been pregnant on their wedding day? Is that even kosher to have a baby shower 3-4 months after a wedding???

My college room mate and I lived together all four years. We had an odd relationship in a way, we watched tv together, went out occasionally and proof-read each others papers. We weren't all girly bff-y, we weren't huggers, we didn't squeal with excitement when we saw each other after an hour, we rarely talked during summers or other breaks. We lived well together for the most part and were similarly interested in our study/alone time and in having someone to eat wings and watch House with occasionally. 

Well, I hooked her up with one of my fiance's friends and much to our surprise they got married last year after dating off and on since senior year. Now we have all be out of school some time by now, we live in different towns about 45 minutes apart, see each other only rarely when we have parties or for special events or really make an effort to plan an evening with them. Long story short we still enjoy their company but we have grown apart. There were a few tiffs over the years on the guys side about money and things but my roommate and I were pretty much the same, casually friendly to indifferent depending on the day. 

When they got engaged they asked us to help as they are not exactly planning type people. We have both worked in catering and have helped with others weddings before and we enjoy hosting/planning/decorating etc. I spent many a night on the phone with her while she cried because her fiance didn't understand how much something was supposed to cost or whatever. Great, that's what bridesmaids are for! My fiance picked out all the clothes for all the other groomsmen and the groom and went out of his way to make sure everyone had matching ties and suspenders and such. I personally made the bouquets and all the other flowers for the wedding so that they could help save on florist fees. My Dad catered at a super low cost. We were living 2 hours away at the time and both took nearly a week off work to come into town early and help set things up, do last minute stuff, arrange, organize, drive around, etc. We enjoyed it for the most part and we were glad to help friends. 
Despite all of this, the groom tells my fiance a couple weeks beforehand that he is making another friend who wasn't even going to be in town until the morning of the wedding his ""best man."" This hurt his feelings but he dealt with it and moved on. The night before the wedding the groom convinced him to take him to a strip club and blow lots of money on buying him lap dances even though they had talked earlier about how my fiance really didn't want to go and really didn't need to spend anymore money because he was taking week off work and had spent gas money and clothes and food and such. The girls were ok for the most part other than dealing with some other flakey bridesmaids who weren't very helpful/didn't show up to things. 
In the long run, the wedding was lovely, they went on honeymoon we've had them over for cookouts a few times since, yada yada. 

Fast forward to this year and we are now planning our wedding. I knew in advance that they would not be willing/able to help us in the way that we helped them and that's not the point, you don't help someone just so you can hold it over their head later. And we don't really need that level of help because we enjoy the process ourselves and have more family to help out with things as well. 

I recently sent an email to her going over the basics of the wedding and talking about plans for engagement party/bridal shower things etc. The wedding is not until this coming spring so we have plenty of time to plan and we have already gotten the basics pinned down. 

The response that I got from her was shockingly rude to me. She basically told me that I shouldn't bother with any wedding ""stuff"" because after her wedding she doesn't understand why anyone cares about it and it was a total waste of money and time and they should have just eloped. Of course she is phrasing it like advice as in ""don't stress about it because it doesn't matter"" but can she not see how shitty that makes me feel to have put as much effort into something for someone else only to have them tell me that it wasn't worth it? It basically seems to me like, ""ok, my wedding is over, I'm over it now so you should just skip everything because it bores me and I don't want to have to do it again."" Even if she isn't going to be helpful in the actual planning, she could at least manage a little enthusiasm for it. 

She proceeds to tell me that she ""isnt sure how many things her husband can attend"" because of his work schedule (did I mention we took a WEEK off for their wedding?) and that they MAY be able to attend the engagement party. 

Also she doesn't like any of the dresses I suggested and doesn't want to spend money on something she'll never wear again ($120 dress I bought for her wedding is still hanging in my closet, I've worn it once since then, she's showing me pics of polyester sundresses for $30 that she wants to wear! in the wrong color!) Disagreed with my shoe color suggestion which I really don't care about but honestly does everything have to be an issue? I just don't understand how someone can be so thoughtless about how/what they say. I want her in the wedding and I want to not blow this into a huge issue but I feel like if I dont say something she will just continue this way sort of raining on my parade and being a debbie downer about everything and half-assing all the bridesmaids shit, do I say something? Let it go and hope it gets better? Ask her if maybe ""planning another wedding so soon after yours is just too much and she wants to bow out?"" I don't know.

I'd have hated to pay for extra length and alterations.

Problem was, I couldn't find flats that looked ""special"" enough for my wedding day (for less than like $500, which I wasn't willing to spend on shoes I would wear one day). 

I found Beholden Bridal on Etsy: http://www.etsy.com/shop/BeholdenBridal   She has a range of styles and price points. I went with the ""Downton Abbey"" slipper, one of the less pricey options, which she dyed a perfect purple for me, and they just had the right amount of sparkle and oomph to make me feel like I was wearing a very special, expensive pair of shoes.

And she was super sweet and easy to deal with. My MOH ordered them for me, as they ended up being a gift from my 3 bridesmaids for my shower. 

OOh, AND it turns out the shoes she decorates are from Davids Bridal, so I could go and try them on and not have to guess my size. Awesome.

I am figuring out my booze situation for the wedding;
My partner's family does not drink, but mine does, and some of our friends do. I would say 50/50 are drinkers (100 drinkers/100 nondrinkers).

Instead of open bar, or cash bar, is it tacky to give everyone 2 drink tickets? That way they can have two drinks on us (and those who don't drink can give their tix away), and then they have to pay for the rest of their drinks?  Should it be 3 tickets?

I don't drink so I have no idea how the whole alcohol thing works.  I budgeted $2000 for alcohol for 200 people (again, I have no idea about booze), so would that do?

Edit: Any unused alcohol left over from the night will be returned to the store for money back. Yes, they do that where I'm from :)

What do I do?,16,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hyzyc/bride_called_megroom_today_crying_one_month_from/,"Groom speaking here. We booked the church two months ago (with a written, signed agreement) and put down a deposit and later paid the fees in full. Met with the event coordinator of the church Sunday, she said that the sanctuary was going to get some plaster work on the ceiling due to some small falling pieces, but said that it would be done in time and not to worry. Today the building director called my fiance and said it would be done the Tuesday after the wedding date so we couldn't use the sanctuary. He's excuse was, ""You know how construction is"". She called me crying.

I don't know what to do. The invitations have been sent out with the church address. Everything has been planned around using this church. I feel very disappointed with the church. My fiance has worked for the church's nursery for 4 years. We both have helped with numerous youth events and community work. I feel like they have let me down. I plan on contacting other leaders of the church for help.

I understand if it was an emergency (fire, flood, ect.), but this isn't. Why couldn't the construction just pack up for the weekend and come back the next week? Or just get it done 2 days early?

I've heard of many difficulties with RSVPs, but this seems like a particularly weird one. We're getting blank RSVPs returned. The names have been filled out, but no options checked. I'm baffled.

For reference, here's the language:


Name(s) ______________________ [they fill in this part themselves]

We have reserved __2__ seats in your honor.

____ of __2__ happily accept

____ regretfully decline


I've gotten 10 cards back with the names filled out, but neither option checked. I'm not stressed, just flustered. We're obviously going to have to call them to confirm if they're coming or not, but I wondered if anyone had a similar experience.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,t3_1hxxpw,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hxxpw/emptyblank_rsvps/,

In last night's dream, my mother forgot to bring my necklace (a family heirloom) to the hotel, we were over an hour behind schedule, the photographer was missing, a bridesmaid was stranded at her house with a car that wouldn't start, and my shoes were 2 sizes too big.

I hate it, they're awful, and I always wake up feeling anxious and pissy. Does this happen to anyone else?
