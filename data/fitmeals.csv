1374465477.0,185,self.fitmeals,1ishqt,I started making a r/fitmeals cookbook. Looking for some input.,209,24,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1ishqt/i_started_making_a_rfitmeals_cookbook_looking_for/,"Edit: I appreciate the feedback so far. Keep it coming. Also it came up and I feel it's worth mentioning. I have no intentions of making any sort of money off this. It will 100% free, I promise. 

So I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1io2pp/a_new_rfitmeals_recipe_book/) the other day. A lot of people seemed interested so I figured I'd take a shot at making a r/fitmeals cookbook. 

http://imgur.com/a/6uOne#0


Here are 14 pages I made up to just give a basic outline of the cookbook. Naturally each chapter would be expanded and I'll likely add a Snacks/Misc chapter too. 

My goal is to have it available in pdf and iBooks format so people can put it on their iPads/Tablets/Computers. 


I would like to get some input/constructive criticism. I had a few questions about it myself. 

1. What should be the criteria for a recipe? I've been compiling recipes most by sorting by ""Top - All Time."" Some posts have better pictures/nutritional info/instructions than others. Should I only take the recipes that had quality photos/instructions or just continuing to take most from the Top Voted?     


2. I don't have any sort of design/art experience. If there is a color scheme or formatting tip you want to give I'm all ears 


3. How many recipes total would you want to see in the cookbook?


4. Currently I have it in chapters by meal types. Do you think it would be better to organize the recipes by the post tags? (i.e [Low Cal][Veg] etc) 


I hope you like it, or at very least like the idea of it. Please leave some input on what you'd want to see from a r/fitmeals cookbook.

It's a world of difference. It almost tastes like ground beef/pork and can be substituted for anything that calls for ground beef/pork. I was sceptical about the low fat content at first, but it works beautifully even with very lean cuts of chicken.

* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup water

**Nutrition:**

Whole crust has 4 grams of effective carbohydrates, 26 grams fiber, 49 grams protein, 65 grams healthy fats, and 745 calories.

**Preparation:**

* Preheat oven to 425
* Mix dry ingredients together.
* Add wet ingredients, and mix very well.
* Let sit for about 5 minutes to thicken.
* Spread on pan into a round 12 inch pie
* Bake for 15-17 minutes until cooked through, then add toppings and cook until they are done.

**Topping Options:**

* I always spread a thin layer of 100% organic, salt-free, tomato sauce.
* Use fat free cottage cheese. I know it sounds crazy but it really does taste fine and it's super healthy.
* Typical toppings that I use include chicken breast, onions, mushrooms, ground turkey, and pineapple.

Topped with a can of Tuna as requested by /u/CommanderDerpington in /r/Fitness 

I ran out of unflavored whey, so I used a scoop of Raw Meal protein instead.

Doesn't taste bad at all with tuna.. But I still prefer my usual with grilled chicken and onions

I ate it with brown rice.

My only suggested tweak is that, next time, I'll use more broccoli and garlic, and maybe some onions. I could also see this being good with all sorts of flavor/spice combinations. Oh, and in case there are any other gluten-free folks out there, I used Manini's multipurpose GF flour and it worked really well for the breasts.

[Cauliflower Fried Rice](http://timgetsfit.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/faux-fried-rice1.jpg)

Serves 4

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, sliced
* 1 medium head cauliflower
* 1 Tbsp virgin coconut oil
* 2 large eggs
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small (1/4” piece) of ginger, grated
* 1 large zucchini
* 1 large yellow squash
* ½ medium onion
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1 medium carrot, sliced
* ½ Tbsp soy sauce
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Preparation**

There are two ways you can ‘rice’ the cauliflower.  I use a food processor and break it into small pieces then pulse until it’s the right size.  If you don’t have a good processor you could also use the large openings on a box grater, note that grating cauliflower is very messy.  If using the food processor you may want to do a few small batches.  Place this in a microwaveable bowl and set it aside for now.

Next, slice the chicken thin, as you would for any stir fry.  Also slice up all your veggies and put them together on a plate or bowl.  Beat two eggs and add the soy sauce to the eggs.  You’ll want to prep all this at the beginning as things will move quickly once you get going.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add ½ Tbsp of coconut oil.  Add the sliced chicken to the pan and cook until no pink is visible, this only takes a few minutes.  You can season the chicken some if you like.  Remove the chicken and set it to the side.  Add the garlic and ginger to the pan and s
aute for about 30 seconds then add the vegetables.  Cook the vegetables to your liking, I prefer mine to maintain some crispness.  Remove vegetables from pan and sit aside.

Microwave the riced cauliflower for 2 minutes.  While that is cooking add the remaining ½ Tbsp of coconut oil to the pan and scramble the eggs.  Add the cauliflower to the scramble egg and chop the egg into it.  Season the cauliflower and rice then add the chicken and vegetables  and combine all ingredients and check seasonings again.  Heat for 1-2 minutes to make sure all ingredients are warm. Serve.

**Tips, tricks and shortcuts**

* Use any variety of vegetables you’d like:  Water chestnuts and bamboo shoots would be a good addition and you can top this with chopped green onion as well.
* This is mostly Paleo but if you’re 100% hardcore paleo this can be made without the soy sauce and sub coconut aminos. (I haven’t tried the coconut aminos so I add that as a recommendation from others.)
* This can also be made with shrimp, pork or beef.
* Sriracha makes this even more awesome.

A few users were posting regular recipes using the [HIGH CAL] tag, things like normal cheesecakes, meat with heavy sauces over rice, cheese burritos, etc. Gaining is important for a lot of us, hence the tag, but there should be something that sets it apart from literally *every other recipe* outside fitmeals (foodporn, allrecipes, etc). It's typically used to describe a calorically dense food that has a great micro- or macro-nutrient profile for health / athletics, or that subscribes to a certain dietary restriction (paleo, veg, gluten free, etc).

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/12nawm/high_protein_100_grams_beef_stew_for_your_winter/) a recent example of the tag used correctly.

Since past submissions are being collated on something we planned to finish ages ago (my fault as well) it's going to be a bit of a pain in the ass to go back and sort through the ordinary recipes that don't belong. Kindly report any links that clearly aren't a *fit* (HAHA)

We're doing a community garden plot together this summer, so he's gonna grow his own veggies.  And so will try things and hopefully that'll get him psychologically tuned up to start to change his tastes.  But I need every angle I can get!

This is a muscle building meal, not a weight loss meal. Weight loss is not the only aspect of fitness. Just like a 90 calorie vegetarian meal would be of no use to me this may be of no use to you. 

Ingredients:
1/2 cup oats

1 large egg

1 scoop of protein powder (I used MONSTER PROTEIN banana)

1/2 cup of skim milk

1 tsp Baking powder. 

Blend together for the pancakes. 

   Topping for pancakes- 

1 package of vanilla Greek yogurt 

1/3 cup low fat cottage cheese

1/8 cup skim milk. 

Stir and cover pancakes 

   Eggs- 6 egg whites.

I cook a big pot of oats in milk and then stick it in the fridge, getting several days worth per batch. Each morning I scoop out some cooked oats and heat them up. While that is heating I crush up a bunch of blueberries, cut a few strawberries and throw the lot in with a handful of raisins.

Ingredients:

&gt;**200g Diced chicken fillets**
&gt;
&gt;**200g Bell Peppers (green/red/yellow/whatever)**
&gt;
&gt;**100g Onion**
&gt;
&gt;**200g Spinach**
&gt;
&gt;**100g Asparagus**
&gt;
&gt;**50g Green beans/snap beans/similar**
&gt;
&gt;**1 clove of garlic, 1 slice of ginger (personal pref), dash of soy sauce, and a dash of worcestershire sauce**

~~                                                            ~~

METHOD:

1. Roast hazelnuts - gas mark 4 (350 F) for 10-15 minutes. Shake the tray/move them around every 3-4 minutes (warning - awesome smell/flavor. be careful not to indulge).

2. Slice asparagus down the middle length-ways and cook on low-moderate heat for 3-4 minutes with a crack of salt and black pepper, and drop of oil. Then remove from pan.

3. To your now empty pan, add following all finely diced. Onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook until, well u know, goldeny kind of browish. Still on low-moderate heat. Not too hot now.

4. Add your sliced and diced chicken and cook until cooked.

5. Add rest of vegetables and the nuts **except the spinach**. Add the dashes of sauce now too. Maybe add 50g of spinach after a minute or two to promote moisture, quite important actually. Yes, do that.

6. Doing well, quite long yes but worth it. Cook these away as you please, and after 3-5 minutes, add as much spinach as you can fit in the pan. 150g of spinach is quite a lot you will find out.

7. Cook as much of the spinach down as you can and add the rest.

8. Cook the remaining spinach down as you please. Check the consistency of your peppers and other veg; basically how you want them cooked.

9. I like to leave it on for a few more minutes to let everything sweat a lot. You actually get quite a lot of liquid (sauce almost) which is so delicious.

10. Plate up

~~                                                            ~~

There is no added sauce packets or anything. You will be surprised at the amount of moisture comes out of spinach (I was). All good natural ingredients. Remember to season with black pepper during cooking too.

~~                                                            ~~

And the macros for this meal as prepared above (not counting garlic, ginger, soy sauce or worcestershire sauce) are:

**Protein: 57.48g**

**Carbs: 28.55g (Sugars: 13.93)**

Feel free to substitute ingredients/tweak to better suit your diet, tastes, or what's in your cupboard.

**Ingredients**

* One cup (227g) Fage Total 0% Plain Greek Yogurt (I've tried several brands, none are as good as this)

* One scoop (30.4g) ON Double Chocolate Whey Protein (Substitute brand/flavor if necessary)

* One tablespoon (5g) Unsweetened Cocoa Powder

* Two tablespoons (12g) Chocolate PB2 (Powdered peanut putter, adds nutty taste without many calories)

* One teaspoon (2g) Truvia

* Splash of milk, about 1/4 cup (I used unsweetened almond milk), to help mix in powders

**Nutrition Facts**

* 1 fairly big and filling serving

* 329 Calories

* 3.6g Fat

* 21.6 g Carbs

  * 13.3g Sugar

* 52.2g Protein

Just dump all ingredients in a bowl and mix until well blended and no more lumps are present. Add more milk if it's too thick and the lumps are remaining. Chill it a little while (if you can wait).

Like I said, feel free to experiment, I've been wanting to get some instant coffee to give it a mocha flavor. This makes one pretty filling serving, and may actually be 2 servings for someone just wanting a light snack. Thanks

* 8-10 Roma tomatoes (seeded)
* 1/2 - 1 red or white onion (to taste)
* 2 medium cloves garlic
* juice of one lime
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 jalapeno pepper (optional, add more if you like supah spicy)
* 1 teaspoon coarse salt
* 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper


How to prep:

Seed and dice tomatoes. Chop onion, jalapeno and garlic to a fine consistency. To these ingredients, add the fresh cilantro, salt, pepper, olive oil and lime. Mix well.Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Best if served the next day.

Personal notes: in this house, we skip the jalapeños - so season to taste there. The best method to seed roma tomatoes is to cut them in half (at the ""waist"" so to speak) and then just stick your fingers in each of the seed chambers - this seems like a lot of trouble but it's just one extra step in the 'mato prep and well worth it.

That original request has stuck with me, though. I really don't know why someone hasn't done a ""from the ground up"" style cookbook before and I thought that if nobody else did, why shouldn't we just do it ourselves?

It's in this spirit that [The Omnomnomicon](http://omnomnomicon.org) has been created. The goal will be to put out weekly checkpoints of pantry levels and equipment owned (presuming that you have been following along at home and are cooking the same 5 - 7 recipes that were most upvoted through the week) and collect the prior week's recipes into a weekly ""chapter"" for the ""book"". Think of it one part Iron Chef and one part [/r/52weeksofcooking](http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/).

It's a microwave banana bread pudding kinda thing that really doesn't taste like it's under 200 calories, but it is!

**Ingredients**

* 1/2 scoop vanilla protein powder (I use bsn syntha-6)
* 1/2 a banana
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tbsp PB2
* 1 packet truvia
* Dash of salt
* I threw in a little vanilla. Optional.
* 1/8-1/4 cups of water
* 2 tablespoons fat free cool whip

Mash the banana in a mug or bowl with enough space for this to rise a few inches. Add in the protein powder, pb2, truvia, salt and baking powder. Add in 1/8 cup of water. If its too dry add more. You want this the consistency of thin cake batter without being runny. 

Microwave on high for 1:00 to 1:15. You will know when it's done because the entire thing will rise and then start to set. Give it 5 more seconds after that and you're good.

2-3 ""Scoops"" of vanilla protein (24g per scoop)

1 package of sugar-free lemonade mix for making 2 quarts (I used the Walmart brand)

1/2 cup water (or milk)


Stir, spread in a brownie pan, refrigerate for 2 hours, consume, repeat. Try throwing in actual lemon juice for more tartness or sugar/honey for more sweetness. Powdered sugar on top will make it a sort of healthy dessert

At first, I was so mad my mom would give me this gift of sabotage, but a friend suggested I look up some frozen yogurt recipes. 

The original one I found was :
1 cup fat free vanilla Greek yogurt
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 T sugar
1 t pumpkin pie spice

We bought plain Greek yogurt instead, and I added SF vanilla sweetener to it. (I know, some of you will admonish me for adding fake food, but it's what we did)

This turned out AMAZING!!! The consistency was creamy and the tang was lovely with the pumpkin. 

A whole cup of this frozen heaven was only 140 calories.  (serving size is 1/2 c. =70, but it was so good we finished it).

1332253662.0,73,self.fitmeals,r53g2,Indian Daal (Lentil Soup) - [Low Cal] [Cheap],77,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/r53g2/indian_daal_lentil_soup_low_cal_cheap/,"This is a Pakistani version of Daal given to me from my dad.




Ingredients:

2 Cups Red (Orange) Lentils - You can find these at ethnic stores and some chain grocery stores near the beans or in the ethnic section.

5 Cups Water

1-3 tbs olive oil

1 large yellow onion

3-6 cloves garlic (crushed and diced)

1 inch of ginger root, peeled and diced. (you can substitute with ginger/garlic paste)

2-3 tbs Cumin (ground)

1 tbs garam masala (Indian stores will have this)

1-3 tbs red chili powder (depending on the spice level you want)

Salt and Pepper to taste

1 large lemon or about 4 tbs lemon juice


In a pot, add lentils, water and salt to your liking.  Bring to a boil and simmer covered for approximately 40 minutes.

While boiling the lentils, heat a sautee pan with oil and turn down heat to medium.  Sautee onions for a long time, until they start turning brown.  When the onions begin to turn brown and crispy around the edges, add cumin, garam masala, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic.  Cook until garlic browns.  You may need to add more oil and/or water when you add the spices to prevent burning and sticking to the pan.


Add onion mixture to the lentils that have been simmering for 45 minutes.  Let simmer until lentils begin to fall apart (skin separating from bean).  You can add more salt, cumin, and chili powder at this point if its not flavorful enough.  Turn off the heat and add half of the lemon juice.


Now you're ready to eat.  Top off your bowl with some more lemon juice.  The end result should look like a soup, pretty watery but thick with the cooked lentils.  You can serve this -with rice, or eat it on its own like a soup, which I prefer to do.  


Cost:  About $5 for the batch (not including if you need to buy spices), which should be a good amount of soup.  You should go to an indian store for all your spices, they are much cheaper than chain grocery stores.

EDIT: Changed Lime to Lemon, which is better.

EDIT 2: Also forgot: Add whole mustard seeds at the end, about 3 tbs.  Gives it a nice crunch.

Usually the recipes on here (and in general) are servings for about 4 people. I either end up making the full recipe and having leftovers, which either go bad or cause other food to go bad because I'm eating them for 4 days; or, I end up wasting the other 3/4 of an onion, pepper, etc.

These high-protein, low-carb balls are here for your pleasure.

Simply combine:

* 82 grams chocolate protein powder (or 82 grams vanilla protein powder and 3 tsp cocoa powder)

* 3 Tbsp natural peanut butter

* 1 to 2 Tbsp hot water (add to reach desired ball handling consistency but don't use too much or your balls could become too sticky)

Mix these three ingredients in a small bowl. Scoop about enough ""dough"" to make a ball about 1 inch in diameter. Take each ball, and roll it in a small amount of powdered sugar, knocking off any excess sugar. Put your balls in the fridge for about an hour in tightly sealed container.

When you pull your balls out again, you've got a tender treat with a light outer glaze perfect for snacking anytime you want.  Be careful not let your balls rest on a hot oven too long or they could become a little misshapen.

A Schweddy Balls serving consists of 2 succulent balls with N-Facts: 

* 111.5 calories

* 12.5 grams protein 

* 4.5 grams fat

* 6.4 grams carbs (3.75 grams from sugar)

* 1 gram fiber

Some may complain that my Schweddy Balls are too sweet, or a bit grainy, but those with refined taste simply won't be able to keep their hands off. Serve your balls chilled. Makes about 6 servings (12 Schweddy Balls total.) [My mouth is already watering just thinking about those balls.](http://archive.evtv1.com/player.aspx?itemnum=1415) 

EDIT: I'm so confident you'll enjoy my Schweddy Balls, I challenge you to make some and try and pass them over on your friends as ""cake balls."" They have a similar dense texture and are just sweet enough to fool your friends into eating healthy(er) without even knowing it.

[high protein][low cal][cheap],74,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/ocdra/turkey_chili_recipe_w_stepbystep_pictures_high/,"This is one of my go-to Sunday recipes. Made in ""bulk,"" this ground turkey chili is perfect to reheat throughout the week for a quick and healthy lunch. 

I will go ahead and give proper credit to Cooks Illustrated, as I stole the recipe from them. 

What you will need:

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

2 medium onions

1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/2 pieces

6 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed (about 2 tablespoons)

1/4 cup chili powder

1 tablespoon ground cumin

2 tablespoons ground coriander

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

1 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Salt (as needed)

2 pounds 93% lean ground turkey

2 (15 ounce) cans dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed

1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes

1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree

Side-note: I hate beans and do not add them to this recipe. 

Now, here's what to do with the above-referenced ingredients:

1) Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until ""shimmering."" [Add onions, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, oregano, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon of salt.](http://imgur.com/XAYKz) Cook, stirring often, [until vegetables are softened](http://imgur.com/6LraK) (8-10 minutes). 

2) Increase heat to medium-high. [Stir in 1 pound of ground turkey](http://imgur.com/KMIVh) and cook while breaking up the chunks with a wooden spoon [until no longer pink](http://imgur.com/oB5h1) (about 3 minutes per pound). 

3) [Stir in the beans, diced tomatoes with their juice, and tomato puree](http://imgur.com/jKKaF) and [bring to a boil](http://imgur.com/3SQzx). [Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.](http://imgur.com/BTOMl) 

4) Uncover and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, and [add the remaining 1 pound of ground turkey](http://imgur.com/zj3xN), [rolled into balls](http://imgur.com/d2CFx), to the chili. [Simmer and cook until chili is slightly thickened \(about 45 minutes to an hour\)](http://imgur.com/2nCeA). [Pro-tip: if the chili begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, stir in 1/2 cup water]

For those wondering why the last pound of ground turkey was rolled into balls prior to adding, here is what Cooks Illustrated has to say: ""The technique for adding the ground turkey to the pot is a little different, and makes the ground turkey appear crumbled, like ground beef; otherwise, the turkey will have a stringy appearance.""

and here's the recipe

* 3/4 cup plain low fat or non-fat Greek yogurt

* 3 large egg yolks ( save egg whites for courgette fritters )
 
* 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice (you can add more just taste as you go)
 
* 1 generous teaspoon Dijon mustard
 
* 2 tablespoons melted low fat spread or you could use butter
 
* sea salt to your taste
 
* Pinch of pepper


I whisked all ingredients together. 

Fill a medium pot about a quarter full with water. Choose a stainless steel bowl that will sit partially inside of the saucepan without touching the water to create a double boiler and bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer. and cook the Hollandaise until thick and creamy, about 8 minutes :)

The recipe is here: [body building.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/video-jamie-eason-turkey-meatloaf-muffins.htm)

* Around 2 pounds extra lean turkey
* Around 1 cup of oats, I used quick cooking but I think rolled would work just the same
* I added green onions, green peppers and Celery, a total of two cups of veggies (recipe calls for one cup of celery, but you really can add any veggie that sounds yummy to you.)
* 3 egg whites (or whole eggs for MORE protein) 
* I chopped up 1 clove of garlic AND added 1 tbls of garlic salt (Recipe calls for 2 tbls garlic powder)
* I eyeballed a tsp of Cumin, Thyme, some dry mustard and Chipotle Chilli Pepper (chipotle gives it the flavor and mild spice, add more for more flavor and more spice!)

Mix everything together with hands, will be messy, Make into little meat balls, best if cooked in muffin pan because they do have a little juice that comes out as they cook. Bake at 375 for 40 minutes. 

Each one is around 180 calories, 22g of protein, and 4g of carbs. They are pretty filling, 2 would be a full lunch for me. 

The recipe makes 16. I added more veggies and made them a bit smaller, so I have 18 here probably around 160 calories. I froze 14 of them. I heat them up for 45 seconds if defrosted, a minute and a half if frozen, or if I am on a long bike ride I eat them cold. Absolutely delicious.

The recipe is ridiculously easy to make, and turns out as good as (if not better than) the best store-bought jerky. 

[Image here.](http://imgur.com/owCe0) This is a small portion of the total yield- we split it up and I had already eaten most of my share before taking that picture.

Ingredients:

2 pounds flank steak

2/3 cup Worcestershire sauce

2/3 cup soy sauce

1 tablespoon honey

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons onion powder

1 teaspoon liquid smoke

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:

0. Slice meat into thin 1/4 inch strips, or to whatever size/thickness you desire.

1. Combine the ingredients listed above (including meat) in a ziplock bag and refrigerate overnight or for 8-12 hours. 

2. Take meat out of marinade and place in oven at lowest temperature (we used 170F and it turned out perfect, but I believe you can go up to 200F). 

3. That's it. Watch the jerky and start checking up on it after 3 or 4 hours. We kept it in for about 6 hours and it turned out amazing. Pretty tough and chewy, which is exactly what we were looking for. 


Macros for the [whole recipe](http://imgur.com/HQlk4), and [per serving (assuming 4 servings)](http://imgur.com/KV1BA).

Notes:

- In addition to flank steak, you can also use loin, sirloin, rib eye, top round, eye round, or bottom round. I haven't experimented with any of those (although I plan to), so results may vary.

- For some more marinade ideas, [check this out](http://thefoodaddicts.com/foodbuzz-24x24-homemade-beef-jerky/).

- If you want to go full ketard, you can probably halve or drop the honey and go lighter on the sauces. I love carbs, so I made it as written. 

- Credit to [Alton Brown for the marinade.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe/index.html) That page also has another fan based method for drying the jerky, but the oven was significantly easier.

Ingredients:

* 225g (1 pack) of frozen strawberries

* 2 scoops of protein powder (I used berry flavor)

* Water (or skim milk*) to texture preferences (I used around 100 ml)

Instructions:

Unthaw the frozen strawberries by waiting for 15 minute or so. When they are choppable but still cold chop them up in small cubes and toss them in your mixing bowl. Now put in one scoop of protein powder and get your hand-mixer but dont mix yet. Mush everything together so that when you start mixing it your protein powder doesnt fly all over the place (happened to me on my first try lol). When everything's mixed up add in another scoop and add some water to however you want the texture to be. If you did everything correctly it should be just like ice cream now! You can eat it up now or put it in the freezer for later. My gosh this is so good!

Say it.  

Sounds awful, doesn't it?  Dry, crumbly?  Can you think of anything less appetizing than a nasty, dry, flavorless, gritty always-overcooked chicken breast that tastes more like particle board than meat?  Neither can I.

Well - get ready for this.  I present to you, fellow fitties, how to make a mofo chicken breast thats juicy, perfectly cooked and accompanied by some roasted veggies that will make you go 'Whaaaa!'.  We're gonna get a bit cheffy with this one, and it requires some doing on your part - so if you're halfway through a campaign on Skyrim and not trying to make a really nice dinner to impress your significant other - this may not be for you.

Let's begin, shall we?

Ingredients: (Serves 2)

1 Whole Chicken breast (this is bigger than you think it is - a 'whole' breast is actually two of what folks normally think it is a breast)  It should weigh about a pound total.  I used Bell and Evans chicken from Whole foods, but if you don't have access to this product, get it from the meat counter at the grocery store - not prepackaged Perdue crap.  It's usually about 5 bucks/lb for a nice brand of chicken breast.

About 1lb of vegetables of your choosing - I used Shallots, Asparagus, Zucchini and Beets for this recipe.

1/3 cup table salt (for brine)

1 tbsp sugar (for brine)

tbsp Kosher Salt

tsp Pepper

1/4 cup balsamic vinegar

1 tbsp honey

Pam Olive Oil (important if you want to keep calories down!)


Let's begin, shall we?

Start by putting 1/3 cup table salt and 1 tbsp sugar into a large bowl.  Fill bowl with about a quart of COLD water and use a whisk to dissolve the salt and sugar into the water.  Separate the breast into the two 'lobes' and place them both in the brine for 1 hour.  The brining is super important.  

Preheat the oven to 375.

Once the chicken has brined for 40 minutes, let it sit for a few to get down to approximate room temperature.  Spray a foil-lined cookie sheet with a light mist of the Pam, add your veggies, sprinkle kosher salt and crack some pepper on top.  Be gentle, roasting brings out huge amounts of flavor from the veggies and too much salt can make them...well, too salty!  Give them another light spray with the oil and pop them in your oven.  Set the timer for 20 minutes and relax.

Ding!  20 minutes are up...the veggies aren't quite done yet, but it's time to chef it up with the chicken.

Remove the chicken from the brine.  This part is important - pat it dry with a paper towel - you definitely don't want any water on the surface of the chicken for the next step.  If the chicken still has water on it when it hits the pan, we're talking a best case of ruined chicken and a worst case of a fire in the kitchen.

Spray the surface of a pan with pam - not too much, just enough to coat.  Let the pan heat, heat, heat until it's just about smoking.  Place the chicken breasts right into the pan.  When they hit, they should be sizzling hard.  Let it fry there undisturbed for 1 minute and 30 seconds.  I know, sounds like a pain in the ass, but trust me on this one.  

We then take the whole pan and put it in the oven with the veggies.  Set the timer for 5 minutes.  Let the chicken and veggies get to know each other.

Let's make some sauce!  Take the Balsamic Vinegar and honey and put it in a small saucepan (I use a baby egg pan I got at Target for 5 bucks for my sauces) heat it up and it will boil quickly because its so little liquid.  You want some water to boil out of it, so when its boiled down to about 2/3 of what it was when you put it in, shut the heat off.

DING! Looks like our chicken and veggie timer went off.

Alright, get your towel together and get this things out of the oven.

""But wait!  This chicken doesn't quite look done yet!  There's still a little bit of pink in there!""

SHUT YOUR MOUTH!  The chicken is done.  It will continue to cook after it has been removed from the oven, and raise the temp by another 5-10 degrees.  If you have an instant-read thermometer, stick it in there - it should say about 150-155.  I know, it's a bit lower than the gov't regulation of 165 - but the government isn't exactly known for their tasty chicken, are they?  Fuck those guys.  Trust me on this one.  

So now we're going to rest this chicken like a steak.  This part is also important - we want the chicken to retain its yummy juices, not lose them in the pan.  Give the chicken about 4 or 5 minutes to relax.

Let's get plating!

I like to start by putting our sauce in the center of the bare place.  The consistency of the sauce will now be slightly syrupy, but spoonable.  If it's gotten too thick, just heat it up a bit and it will loosen.  

Next, make with the veggies - they will have gotten some nice charred spots and smell awesome. The onions and shallots especially.  Put those on your plate, arranged tastefully.

Now, the piece de resistance.  Use some tongs to get that chicken off the pan.  You'll notice that the side that was facing down has a nice seared, brown look.  This is called the [Maillard Reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) and it looks sharp and makes chicken taste yummers.

NOW YOU ARE DONE!  I know, it was a bit more involved than some recipes, but I love the way this turns out.  I've made it about 5 times before I posted it, so the recipe/times/temps should work, but as always, YMMV.

I really hope you guys dig it!  I had fun making it and the combination of brining, ""undercooking"" and resting will make for a truly juicy and flavorful piece of chicken.

This entire recipe, including everything from the chicken to the Pam to the Honey used in the sauce is about 350 calories and incredibly filling.

ENJOY!

Step 2 - find a bowl about the same diameter as the bread. Break 1 large egg with yolk and one without. Crack some pepper inside and mix. Cover in saran wrap, poke a few holes, and throw in the microwave for 1 1/2 mins.

Step 3 - while both of those are cooking I sliced some tomatoes really thin to throw on top

Step 4 - Bread is ready, egg is ready, Put the bread on top of the bowl and flip, it should come out cleanly. Put your slices of tomatoe on top and the 2nd part of the bread

Step 5 - Eat

Wish I took a pic of it because it looks pretty nice. The egg rises in the microwave and is fairly thick. I was just too hungry so i digged in. You could always throw a slice of ham, cheese, or both on the bread as you toast it if you want.

1 head of broccoli (about 300g)

Half an onion (yellow or red is fine)

A clove of garlic

a chicken stock cube

a little olive oil

salt and pepper to taste



**optional:**

some crumbly cheese (stilton or goat's)

a slice of bacon



1. Chop your onion, and fry gently in the oil for a few minutes in a saucepan. Add a little salt to help soften the onion. Chop the garlic and add when then onion is almost done and don't burn it.
2. While those are simmering, remove the broccoli florets from the head.
3. Add the broccoli when the onion is soft, crumble in the stock cube and cover with boiling water. Grind in some black pepper.
4. Cover the pan and simmer for about 8 minutes or so. You know the broccoli is done when it still has a little bite to it, if you put a knife to it and it clicks against the side of the pan. Don't over cook it.
5. Strain out the liquid into a bowl, and dump the rest into a blender.
6. Pour the liquid into the blender until it takes up about half the volume of the broccoli. (You may have to experiment with this according to personal taste and the size of your blender).
7. Blitz until smooth. Taste and season.

Options:
Add some chopped bacon when you're frying your onions for more protein. 
Add some cheese after you serve it in a bowl.

All in, it's probably about 150kcal, with a good amount of protein and vitamins from the broccoli. More when you add cheese and bacon.

This makes 4 meals.  Divide into Tupperware containers.  You can adjust the amount more or less to make what you want.


You only need:

Tupperware (x4) 

Extra virgin olive oil, or olive oil spray.

1lb Lean ground beef (93% or leaner, I use 97%) (this is 4 servings)

Brown Rice (I like boil in bag rice, I'm lazy) (cook up 4 servings)

4 servings of your fat free cheese of choice (I used Kraft fat free 
singles)

Mustard

Ketchup (I only use organic)

Cook up your rice.

Cook up your ground beef in a little bit of olive oil.  (I used a little garlic power and pepper for flavor. This is of course optional.)

Put rice in Tupperware, lay down some cheese, add your beef, put some ketchup &amp; mustard in there, and enjoy your cheeseburger satisfying macro.  

I put ketchup &amp; mustard under cheese &amp; beef if I want to throw broccoli in there too to take to work.  

Make it your own, add some lettuce or what have you.  Just really enjoyed this and it broke up having chicken everyday.

Well, next to the pouch applesauce was ""Peter Rabbit Organics"", pouches of sauce-like stuff with flavors like ""pea, spinach, and apple"".  I check the ingredients, and that's ALL that's in this pouch!  80 calories for the well-sized pouch too.  It was on sale, but even the non-sale price was okay considering the per-unit--this pouch is bigger than other applesauce pouches.

Some say Shepherd's Pie contains lamb and not beef.  I've always heard it called Shepherd's Pie and I've consulted the wisdom of Wikipedia, Google and Ditionary.com and they seem to agree with me.  I ain't changing the name, this dish remains Shepherd's Pie!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This came out awesome, I was really thrilled with the results.  I love Shepherd's Pie but as a fat man trying to be less fat I really need to tweak this

So I set to work and made a few simple changes and knocked out over 40% of the calories vs a traditional recipe and reduced the fat and carb grams.  There was a also a small gain in protein and fiber.  And it is delicious, winner all around.

The tweaks... creamy mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes, using an extra lean ground beef as opposed to a standard 80/20 mix, using butter flakes and a bit of Parmesan for flavor in the cauliflower instead of butter and cream.

**[Healthier Shepherd’s Pie](http://timgetsfit.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/shepherds-pie-with-cauliflower.jpg)**

Serves 6

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb lean ground beef (93/7)
* ¼ yellow onion, diced
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* ½ cup beef broth
* 1 Tbsp corn starch
* 1 cup small lima beans (pre-cooked or canned)
* 1 cup sweet peas (pre-cooked or canned)
* 1 cup sliced carrots (pre-cooked or canned)
* 1 medium head cauliflower
* 2 oz low fat cream cheese
* 1 clove garlic, chopped
* 2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Preparation**

Spray a heated pan with cooking spray, set heat to medium and saute onions until soft then add ground beef and cook until it’s almost done.  Add sliced mushrooms and cook until beef and mushrooms are done.

Stir corn starch into cold beef broth making sure the corn starch is thoroughly mixed into the broth.  Pour the broth slowly into the pan of ground beef and stir continuously until hot.  Once heated it will start to thicken, you can add a bit more broth to thin the mixture or a bit more broth and starch to thicken.  You want the sauce to be very thick, but not pasty.  Add lima beans, carrots and peas to the beef mixture and cook until heated.  Add a generous amount of black pepper to the mixture and place on low to keep warm

To make the creamy mashed cauliflower:  Clean and cut the head of cauliflower into small florets.  Cook in salted, boiling water for 15 minutes or until fork tender.  Do not overcook as the cauliflower will be mushy.  Drain and place into a mixing bowl.  Add the garlic, low fat cream cheese and Parmesan and mix with hand mixer until smooth.  Taste to see if additional salt or garlic is needed.

Pour beef mixture into a casserole dish and spread into an even layer.  Top with the creamy mashed cauliflower spreading that into an even layer covering all the beef mixture.  You may add additional grated Parmesan, ground pepper or parsley to the the top prior to baking.  Place in preheated 400F oven for 30 minutes.  Remove and let stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.

**Tips, tricks and shortcuts**

* You can use any mix of vegetables you like for this.  If you don’t like lima beans, don’t use them.  Some people use corn, some simply the peas and carrots.
* Do yourself a favor and get some REAL Parmesan cheese, not the stuff in a shaker can but a block of the real deal.  It will actually last longer as the flavor is much more intense so a little goes a long way.
* The creamy mashed cauliflower makes a great side dish on its own.  Also, the cauliflower recipe is not my own, I found it on a Google search.

I was really impressed with how this turned out.  The bit of cream cheese in the cauliflower really helps to nail the consistency that makes mashed potatoes so damn good.   Since the veggies are mixed in with the meat and sauce mixture they have a ton of flavor as well, this one is a winner.  I guarantee you will like this recipe or I’ll send you a link to someone else’s recipe… you have my word on that.

1320771051.0,56,self.fitmeals,m4y3c,[LOW CAL][CHEAP] Spaghetti Squash with the Best tomato sauce EVER.,59,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/m4y3c/low_calcheap_spaghetti_squash_with_the_best/,"Alright, it took a while to perfect, but I've finally made the worlds most amazing tomato sauce, and it's got nothing but veggies and 1 tsp of Olive oil.  Full recipe costs less than 5 bucks, and makes 3 huge servings.  This is awesome served over spaghetti squash, of which 1.5 cups (a HUGE portion) is about 80 calories.  The sauce, for the whole batch is about 670 calories, which equates to 160 or 220 calories depending on your portion size.

Ingredients:

32oz of Canned Whole San Marzano Tomatoes (brand doesn't matter, but spend the extra 50c a can and get the San Marzanos, they're markedly different - better - than the usual canned stuff)

1 Head of garlic - suit your taste, but I used the whole damn thing.

2 tbsp of chopped basil (I used fresh, you can use dried)

2 tbsp Organo (I used fresh, you can use dried)

2 tbsp of Red Pepper Flakes (only if you like it spicy)

1 tsp Olive oil

1 tbsp Sugar

1 Chicken Buillon cube (veggie if you must)

2 tbsp tomato paste

S&amp;P to taste.

1 Large spaghetti squash

Direction:
Oven to 400. Slice Spaghetti squash lengthwise, remove guts and seeds (roast seeds at 400 for 10 mins if you'd like!) dash of salt and pepper and into the oven it goes for 40/50 minutes.  

While that's roasting, open your tomatoes and chop them up well, by hand is ok, but food processor or blender works, too.  Pop them in the pot with a bit of S&amp;P, let them simmer for a bit.  

Meanwhile, put 1tbsp olive oil into a small pan.  Just as it starts to smoke, add 1 whole head finely chopped garlic and stir to get the oil to coat.  Let that fry until it browns nicely and add it to the tomatoes.  Add spices, sugar, bullion cube and tomato paste.  Mix it all up and let it simmer until your squash is done.  If you want it super smooth, put it all in the food processor or blender.

DING! The squash is done.  It should be tender when you touch it with a fork.  Remove it from the oven carefully, drain any water in the 'ditch' of the squash.  Run a fork along the meat of the squash and it will start to shred up and look just like pasta.  Do this with both halves.  

Now you're ready to rock.  Put some squash in a bowl, top it with some sauce and you're all set.  This recipe will yield 3-5 servings of squash and sauce, it reheats amazingly too.

Total for HUGE portion: about 330 calories.  Perfect for killing those pesky pasta cravings, with the knowledge that if you had used regular pasta instead of squash you'd be up about 400 calories.

The problem was, we didn't have any ricotta cheese and we also didn't have enough cottage cheese to completely replace it. So I decided to use a combination of cottage cheese and greek yogurt instead! It actually turned out FABULOUS. Once it's cooked, the frittata has this gorgeous tangy flavor that sort of reminds me of feta cheese. 

Ingredients (I didn't really measure things when I was cooking, so this is a rough estimation), serves ~10: 

~2 1/2 cups of plain low fat Greek yogurt 

~1 cup of low fat cottage cheese 

6 eggs 

~2 cups of white cheddar cheese, grated roughly (I know, it's a lot! You 
could definitely reduce this amount if you want or switch up the kind of cheese.) 

1 10 oz package of spinach 

1 carton of white button mushrooms, very roughly chopped 

1/2 a small onion, chopped finely 

1 tbsp olive oil 

1 large or 2 small potatoes, diced 

1/2 tsp of salt 

Directions: 

-Heat the oven to 375 degrees F, or 190 degrees C. 

-Toss the spinach into a large pan and turn on the heat. Let the spinach wilt down until it releases most of its moisture. Set aside. 

-Heat the olive oil and add the onions. Once they turn translucent and just barely start to gain some color, add the mushrooms. Sprinkle a little salt over the mushrooms to help them release their moisture. Saute until they turn brown and have released most of their water. Set aside the mixture. 

-Dice the potato(s) and add them to a pan of water. Let it cook until the potatoes are just tender. No need to cook them until they're very tender, since they'll keep cooking in the oven. Set aside. 

-Whisk together the cottage cheese, greek yogurt, and eggs. Add the spinach, mushrooms, and potatoes. Add most of the cheese, but leave some to sprinkle on top. 

-Pour the mixture into a baking pan and sprinkle the reserved cheese on top. Pop into the oven for around 40 minutes, depending on the size and shape of your pan. Start checking at about 30 minutes. 

-Let cool for about 10 minutes, then serve! This is good hot, room temp, and cold. 

This comes out at around 260 calories per serving :D 

I bet a few cloves of garlic minced and sauteed with the onions and mushrooms would be delicious. We were all out, unfortunately.

It is awesome, and both my children loved it.

I did make a few modifications to the recipe and I think it improves it overall.

* I added a little bit of garlic.  About one clove's worth.
* I used parmesan and mozzarella.
* i didn't use cooking spray, I used parchment paper.

I pulled it from the oven after the initial bake and let it cool for a minute, then I flipped it to let the excess moisture on the bottom evaporate. 

In the end you could eat it with your hands, but it was a bit floppy.  I'm going to mess around with it and try to get a crispier texture out of it.

A local coffee shop has breakfast wraps that I wanted to imitate without the flour tortilla, whole eggs, whole cheese mess, so I put together this little guy.

Stats about me, I'm 6'3"", 190.4 as of this morning, currently doing 2250 cals a day.  Put together this with the following ingredients:

* 2 slices Hormel center-cut bacon
* 1 ""Flat-Out"" Light Original Wrap
* 1 egg, whole
* 3 egg whites

**285 calories, 12.5g fat, 16g carbs, 29g protein**.

Two variations (one or the other):

add: 1/4 cup 1% mozzarella cheese **355 calories, 16.5g fat, 17g carbs, 37g protein**

add 1/4 cup 1% cheddar cheese **395 calories, 21.5g fat, 17g carbs, 36g protein**

Obviously, this could be mixed up a little depending on what you're going for, but as I am cutting, this is a perfect start to the day.  I will make note that the wrap with mozzarella cheese is not that good (the cheese is just basic, essentially just a protein boost).

* 1 lb plus of vegetables. You can use any combination of carrots, onions, mushrooms, celery, or bell peppers here. Tailor to your own taste/fridge contents.
* Tbsp or two hoisin sauce
* Garlic, Ginger, and chillies

In the same pan cook your veggies and water chestnuts beginning with the onions and carrots if you're using those because browned onions are awesome. Once things start to warm up add your garlic, fresh grated ginger, chillies, stir and cook another minute or two. Return meat to the pan and add the hoisin sauce. Stir to coat.

I made it off the top of my head, so I don't really know how much of everything I used, or what the calorie content might be, but I know it uses only good-for-you ingredients, so it can't be too bad!

You will need:

Whole Sweet Peppers (Red, Green, Orange, Yellow, Bell Peppers)

Basmati Rice (prepared)

Ground Turkey

Mirepoix (The soup trinity: Onions, Celery, Carrot, and optionally Garlic)

Olive Oil

Some form of hot sauce. I used a Chipotle flavored one.

An egg (optional)

Ranch Dressing

First, prepare your rice. You may want to slightly undercook it, as it will be going into the oven later. I used Basmati rice, but you can use whatever. Next, sweat those carrots, celery, and onion (and garlic, optionally.) Let the rice and veggies cool to about room temp.  While that's cooling, go ahead and slice the peppers in half and get rid of the seeds and bitter pale parts. Rub some olive oil on them. Now get out your turkey, ranch dressing, hot sauce, and egg. Mix those together and season to taste. I used salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, some cayenne, and granulated garlic (I didn't have fresh). Now you can add the veggies and rice. Fill the peppers with this mixture, put a bit of ranch dressing atop each on, and some more hot sauce if you are so inclined. Bake at 350 until internal temp reaches 160, about 45 minutes I think. 

This recipe is very flexible and filling, while still remaining delicious. Let me know what you think. I'm a budding foodie.",,False,self,t5_2sd23,False,,,True,t3_o0j3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/o0j3e/buffalo_ranch_turkey_stuffed_peppers/,

* Raw veggie cuts for appetizer/snacking on the table. Maybe add some kind of raw salad.
* Only mineral water and juices to drink. I might add a nice wine, but I'm not sure. Also, tea to go with dessert later.
* Main meal some kind of lean cooked meat... A lot of it for protein. Here I need help to find a recipe for foolproof and healthy tasty meat....
* For dessert I'm thinking of making a cheesecake with low-fat cheese and only banana as sweetener (I've done it before, it is mild and it tastes good). Another option would be to have some fruit salad, but I'm kind of thinking that this cheesecake would bring the point home a bit better.

What I'm imagining is some sort of recipes that mix beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, grains, and various fruit/vegetables. I know Quinoa is great.  Warm or cold is fine. I'm just looking for something affordable, filling and quick on the go--preferably something that keeps well (~5 days). The plan is that I'd put them together during the weekend and eat them throughout the week.

Any tips on what works well together? Any spices or additions that improve the experience?

Thanks! Your input is greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR Looking for recipes to make small, healthy meals that keep well, are affordable, and can either be microwaved or eaten cold.**

Edit: I don't have any cooking stuff outside of the basic pots/pants. No george forman, no slow-cooker, no rice cooker, etc.

**Ideas so far:**

* **Southern Quinoa Salad**: Cooked quinoa, Chopped peppers (Red, green, whatever), diced onion, black beans, diced tomato, corn, olive oil, cilantro, salt, pepper. Optional: mozzarella or feta
* **Mediterranean Quinoa Salad**: quinoa, chopped tomato, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, olives, garlic, parsley, chives, salt, olive oil. Optional: feta
* **Simple Bean salad**: Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, Black Beans, Corn. Olive oil, pinch of cumin. Salt and pepper to taste.
* **Veggie Chili**: Diced tomatoes, tomato puree, zuchini, chick peas, kidney beans, black beans, onions, jalapeno, chili spice. Optional: mixed cheese (pepper jack, mozzarella, cheddar)
* **Lentil Soup**: Lentils, crushed tomatoes, onions, carrots, zucchini, celery, black pepper, salt, crushed red pepper.
* ** Cucumber Salad**: Chopped cucumber, tomatoes, bell peppers, onion. Salt, pepper, vinegar.
* **Tomato soup**: Crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato puree, onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, basil, salt, pepper. Optional: Crushed red pepper, jalapeno, or heavy whipping cream for a creamy-tomato soup
* **Yogurt Mix**: Greek or Plain yogurt, granola, berries/peaches/whatever.
* **Citrus Cottage Cheese**: Mandarin Oranges and crushed pineapple, mixed in cottage cheese.

Turkey Veggie Meatloaf Cups 7

Ingredients

2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini

1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped onions

1 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped


1 pound extra lean ground turkey

1/2 cup uncooked couscous

1 egg

2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

1/2 cup barbecue sauce, or as needed

Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 20 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Place zucchini, onions, and red bell pepper into a food processor, and pulse several times until finely chopped but not liquefied. Place the vegetables into a bowl, and mix in ground turkey, couscous, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard until thoroughly combined. Fill each prepared muffin cup about 3/4 full. Top each cup with about 1 teaspoon of barbecue sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Internal temperature of a muffin measured by an instant-read meat thermometer should be at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

I cut the pepper into long slices, laid them on a sheet of tin foil (one per chicken breast) put the chicken on top, seasoned with salt and pepper, cut the spring onions and the tomatoes (into quarters), laid them on top of the chicken, drizzled it all in olive oil, folded up the tin foil and cooked them in the oven for 25 minutes at 180C, (356F)

Serves 2 with pasta, 1 with a lighter side  

225g eggplant (about 1 medium or 2 small)  
2 C of whole peeled tomatoes (with the juice/puree from the can)  
1/4 t of garlic powder  
1/4 t onion powder  
1/2 t oregano  
1/2 t basil  
2 T plain breadcrumbs  
2 T panko  
1/2 C part skim mozzarella cheese  
salt  

1. Cut the eggplant into bite size chunks. Lay them out on several layers of paper towels and salt heavily making sure to hit all the cut sides. Let these sit for 45 minutes to an hour.  
2. In a small bowl squeeze the tomatoes until you have a relatively smooth sauce. If you used plain tomatoes (not san marzano) you'll want to add a pinch of sugar. Season this with the spices and salt to taste.  
3. When the eggplant is done sweating, put a few layers of paper towels over it and press down (I like to lay a sheet pan over it) to get the liquid out. Don't crush it to a pulp but give it a good squeeze.   
4. Take each piece and wipe the cut sides on a paper towel and toss them into a greased casserole dish. Then, pour the sauce over them. Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake at 400F for 45 minutes.  
5. Take it out, pull off the foil and top it with the breadcrumbs and cheese. A spritz of nonstick spray will help it brown up. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly.  
6. You can serve this over pasta or on it's own. If you want to serve it alone you could reduce the tomatoes to 1 C or so, but I like it saucy.  


Breakdown (for 2 servings, no pasta) : 192 calories, 26 carbs, 6g fat, 12g protein, 9g fiber.    

Notes:  

This is very reasonable, I served it with 1oz of orzo (1/2 a standard serving) and it added 100 calories plus a salad and I was FULL. This also reheats really well if you don't mind soggy breadcrumbs (I don't).    

This would also be good with some chunks of onion and pepper in there too, I think, but I didn't have any. :)  ",,False,self,t5_2sd23,False,,,True,t3_xq8q5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/xq8q5/cheapeasylowcal_eggplant_parmesan/,

1-1/2 cups buttermilk (I used 1/2% milk with 1.5 tblspn vinegar)

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce

1 banana

2 egg


Combine everything in a food processor or blender (I used an immersion blender) and mix until smooth. 

Cook 1/4c scoops on medium skillet until golden brown. I served with chopped strawberrys and fat free cool whip. Extras freeze well, I like to put them in the toaster to thaw/cook them but microwave works too.

http://i.imgur.com/1psQ4ak.jpg

Ingredients:
1/2 cup freekeh (I use Tamari flavored)
2 medium zucchini
1 medium onion
1-3 jalapenos (according to your spice tolerance)
5 medium mushrooms
3 eggs
soy sauce to taste
2 tsp butter

That's what I used, but you would easily add broccoli, edamame, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, bell peppers, whatever low cal veggies you like (or better yet, are on sale). 

1) Prepare the freekeh as you would white rice (in a rice cooker or a pan) according to the package instructions. Either set aside or proceed with the other steps while the freekeh is cooking. 

2) Chop all the vegetables and onions and peppers fairly finely (to about 1/3 inch cubes). I don't remove the seeds and ribs of the jalapenos before chopping but that's because we like it really spicy. 

2) Melt 1 tsp butter in a pan and then add all the chopped veggies at once. Stir constantly over medium-high or high heat, until things start to caramelize. 

3) Fry eggs in 1 tsp butter. Finely chop.

4) Dump the freekeh into a bowl. Add the cooked veggies, chopped eggs and soy sauce and stir it all up. Serve. 

Serves 4 as a side dish or two as a meal. When it's a side, I serve it with broiled fish or chicken.

So I came up with this simple variation that makes them quite tasty and satisfying. You'll think you are eating real chocolate pancake mix with this!

**So here are the ingredients you'll need:**

+1/2 a cup of oats

+1 cup low fat cottage cheese (I personally use Lyncott brand but whatever is okay)

+4 eggs

+A teaspoon of vanilla extract

+2 Spoonfuls of low fat peanut butter (I generally use creamy, but you can use the chunky kind for extra texture)

+2 spoonfuls of hersheys cocoa powder



**Preparation:**

Basically put everything in the blender and blend it like there's no tomorrow. I found out that this recipe makes the mix thicker than the original one, so you can get thick pancakes if you like them like that.

Once you get the pancake batter just put it in the pan and cook to your preference. One tip here is that since I usually get the batter really thick i use a spoon to better distribute it around the pan and actually get a round pancake shape.

That's it, just add some 0 cal maple syrup and you have some really tasty and healthy pancakes!

One of my major craving has been for Indian food. I've made Chana Masala in the past and it's turned out great, but [my girlfriend is eating Paleo](http://i.imgur.com/lQBX1wP.jpg) so garbanzo beans are out. The following recipe is a modified version of chana masala.

**Cook Time:** About 2 hours, less if you're lazy.

**Cost:** About $15 (I already had the spices)

**Macros:** ~100 calories per cup, probably less. I don't track anything other than calories and sodium so I don't know the exact breakdown.

**Ingredients:**

- 2 28oz. cans crushed tomatoes    
- 1 Medium Onion    
- 3 Squash (I used 2 yellow and 1 zucchini)    
- 1 Box fresh mushrooms (the little 5""x5"" container)    
- 3 Carrots    
- ~1T. Oil (I used vegetable)    
- 3 Garlic cloves    
- Assorted Indian spices*

**Method:**

1. Dice your onion and cook until translucent in the oil. Add the 2 cans of tomatoes and Indian spices*. Simmer on low heat for 45 minutes, uncovered. Make sure you stir every few minutes and keep an eye on the moisture level. We're trying to thicken this up but we're not making tomato paste. Add water as necessary.

2. Peel the outside of your carrots and cut into 1/4"" medallions. Wash your squash and cut off the ends, cut lengthwise, cut each half lengthwise again, and cut into 1/2"" ""pizza slice"" shapes. Wash your mushrooms and slice lengthwise into 1/4"" pieces.

3. Add carrots, mushrooms, and garlic to your tomato sauce at the 45 minute mark. Simmer for 30 minutes (we're at 1 hour 15 minutes at this point).

4. Add squash. Continue to simmer for 30-45 minutes or until the veggies are cooked to your liking.

My girlfriend ate hers with [cauliflower rice](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/1626071845/another-simpler-version-of-cauliflower-rice), I used quinoa.

*I used [McCormick's Curry Powder](http://www.mccormick.com/Spices-and-Flavors/Herbs-and-Spices/Spices/Curry-Powder), some Tikka Masala seasoning I had on-hand, some Garam Masala, and some dried ginger. You should be able to find most of this stuff at your local grocer. I'd start with about a tablespoon of each and adjust to your liking. I also suggest salting at the end.

It seems complicated but I assure you it's not. Most of the time is spent cooking the sauce down which I HIGHLY recommend you do. You might think you could skip all of that and just add the veggies in the beginning but I assure you it will be worth the wait.",,False,self,t5_2sd23,False,,,True,t3_1hiv4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1hiv4m/low_calcheapveg_vegetable_curry/,

* .5 - .75 cup blueberries(or some type of fresh berry)
* 2 bananas
* 1 - 1.5 cup strawberries
* 3 - 4 stalks of Kale(or handfuls of spinach)
* 1/2 cup greek yogurt
* 1 tbsp agave nectar(if the fruit isn't ripe enough)
* ice

My portioning usually giving me about 1.5 - 2 huge glasses worth of smoothie. My question is, are my smoothies healthy enough? I am using them as a meal replacement for breakfast and lunch and my worry is that the sugar from the fruit is out weighing the benefits. Is there anything I could do/add to maximize my smoothies?

This is a basic recipe and you could then add whatever it is you're interested in at the time - sweet or savoury.

Ingredients
(serves 4, but I split it between 2)

* 150g oats (I used rolled)

* 4 eggs (you could probably get away with 3)

That's it!

I also added:

* 1 tsp cinnamon

* 1/4 tsp stevia (but I'd leave that out next time)

Method:

Cook like normal pancakes but if you don't know how to do that, read on...

1. Heat a non-stick pan on a medium high heat - you want it high enough to cook 'em fast so they keep their shape (get solid fast) but not so high that they burn. (If you don't have a non-stick pan, use some butter or oil on a normal frying pan. It doesn't matter what kind for the cooking but it will make a bit of difference to the calorie breakdown.)

2. Pour on the batter letting it spread until you have the size you want.

3. Wait for a bit until it look reasonably solid (about 2 mins), enough so you can turn it.

4. Turn it over and wait til you reckon it's done. 

I ate mine with some agave maple syrup and a bit of lemon juice.

So just add or subtract if you want to alter. Original recipe called for chili peppers, but I couldn't find any in my area so I substituted below. If you want to use chili peppers the original recipe called for 8 Tablespoons of chopped green chili peppers, no green peppers or long peppers.)

**Ingredients**

4 chicken breasts (I've also done it with pork).

1 onion chopped

1 green pepper chopped

1 [long hot thin green pepper](http://img.21food.com/20110609/product/1305734238656.jpg) chopped (This pepper will make the chili a 7 on a scale out of 10 for the normal palette. If you want milder, try a jalapeno.)

4 cloves of garlic minced

2 Tablespoon of onion powder

2 TEASPOON of cumin

.5 TEASPOON of cayenne pepper

1.5 TEASPOON of oregano

5 cups of low sodium chicken broth

1 cup of low sodium beef broth

2 cans of great northern beans (rinsed)

**Method**

I cook by how the food looks but I will include time estimates for those who need it.

Heat a thin layer of oil in a large pot on med-high heat.  Throw in the garlic and onion and cook until the onions are clear.

Next, throw in the peppers and cook until they begin to soften (another 5 minutes or so).

Add the spices and the meat. Cook, while constantly stirring until the outside of the chicken is cooked. This gives your chicken a good texture. Should take about 7 minutes of constantly stirring while it cooks.

Add the beans and the chx and beef broth.

Put on high heat to bring to a boil.

After it boils bring it down to a simmer (I do just above a simmer due to my stove. You are trying to get the stock to reduce).

Let it simmer like this for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. 

EAAAAAAAT

**Portion**

This makes about 6 cups of chili for me. I portion it out to 4 meals and freeze the other three. 

Rough approx per serving:

Calories: 304 (Thanks Lati0s)

Protein: about 30 grams (depending on how much chicken you use)

Carbs: About 28 grams (low GI beans! yay!)

Ingredients:

* 2 cup brown rice
* 5 cup water
* Salt
* 2 pounds sweet potato, washed and scrubbed, 1/2-inch cubed
* 1 TBL olive oil
* Fresh ground pepper
* Sea salt
* Cayenne pepper (optional)
* 2/3 cup Craisins
* 1/4 cup apple cider (or any juice you like)
* 1/4 cup walnuts, chopped into small pieces
* 1 white/yellow/sweet onion, large chopped
* 1 TBL UNSALTED butter 

1.) Put the brown rice and water in a pot, cover, and bring to a simmer (or use a rice maker) until cooked.  When the rice is finished, fluff with a spoon and sprinkle a few pinches of salt.  Let cool.

2.) Preheat oven to 400F.  Wash, scrub, and dry sweet potatoes.  (Leave the skin ON!)  Cut the potatoes into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes.  (Slice the potatoes into disks, then cut the disk like a tic-tac-toe board into 9 pieces, or only 6 for smaller disks.)  In a medium bowl, toss the sweet potatoes with olive oil (use extra as needed), LOTS of fresh ground pepper, sea salt, and a pinch of cayenne.  Spray a jelly roll pan/baking sheet with cooking spray and spread the potatoes out.  Bake for about 25 minutes, flip with spatula, bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until lightly browned and tender.  They can burn quickly, so keep an eye after you flip.  When finished, let them cool in the pan (see step 7).

3.) Put Craisins and cider in a microwave safe bowl.  Use enough cider to just cover the Craisins.  Microwave on high for 90 seconds.  Lets sit for at least 5 minutes.  Drain the excess juice, add to brown rice, toss.

4.) Toast the walnuts in a large pan over medium-low heat, stirring regularly, until fragrant.  About 7 -10 minutes.  Add to brown rice, toss.

5.) Heat a large pan over high heat until is ridiculously hot.  Spray the chopped onion with a good dose cooking spray, enough to coat.  DO NOT SPRAY THE PAN!  Reduce heat to medium-high, add onions to the pan and constantly stir or pan toss the onions.  Cook until sweet-but-crisp, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Sprinkle with a pinch or two of salt.  Add to brown rice, toss.

6.) Melt the butter in a small pan over medium-low heat, stirring slightly.  The butter will melt, then foam, then the milk solids will brown and give a nutty aroma.  Pour/scrape the brown butter into the rice, toss.

7.) When the sweet potatoes have cooled enough to pick up and eat, add them to the brown rice and toss.   You want the potatoes and the rice to cool before adding to avoid steaming the potatoes after they have been roasted.  This helps them retain their firm texture.",,False,self,t5_2sd23,True,,,True,t3_ouh32,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/ouh32/cheapveg_nutty_sweet_potato_brown_rice/,

But I got to thinking, during the process you have to strain it, the watery stuff that comes it is called whey. I just assumed that what made Greek Yogurt so healthy as opposed to other yogurts was that all the bad stuff came out during this straining process leaving all the protein and good stuff. But then I was like, ""hey, protein powder is called whey powder"", I look it up online and sure enough I find out whey powder is made from the whey stuff that is strained out. I also found a bunch of articles that said that whey was really healthy. So if I'm trying to load up on protein why am I throwing away the whey?

* 1 tablespoon melted margarine (not really necessary)

1344237066.0,38,self.fitmeals,xr7ba,[LOW CAL][CHEAP][QUICK] Roasted beets with arugula and feta (semi x-post from r/cooking),45,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/xr7ba/low_calcheapquick_roasted_beets_with_arugula_and/,"I recently discovered this awesome subreddit, and I thought I'd share this here. [It was good!](http://i.imgur.com/UiXzU.jpg)

If you roast the beets beforehand, it takes less than 10 minutes to put together.

Roasted beets with arugula and feta

* 2 medium beets

* 4 large handfuls of arugula (about 3/4 of a bag) 

* 1/2 tsp olive oil

* dash each of salt and pepper

* 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar

* some lowfat feta cheese (I used a small corner of a block of feta)



1. Roast your beets: Preheat oven to 400F. Wash beets and cut off the greens (save for later, they're yummy), leaving about 3/4"" to grab later. Wrap each beet loosely in foil, place on baking sheet, and bake for about an hour. Halfway through, flip the beets. Bake time will depend on the size of your beets; they are done when a fork slides easily to the center. 

2. After beets have cooled, peel them. The skin should come off easily if you rub it; if it doesn't just peel with a knife. At this point, you can refrigerate the beets for up to a week and take them out as needed, so bake a bunch in batches!

3. In a heated frypan or sautee pan, drizzle about a 1/2 tsp of olive oil. Put in all of your arugula and add a dash each of salt and pepper. Toss quickly so that all the arugula wilts at the same time. After mostly wilted, drizzle in a 1/2 tsp of balsamic vinegar and toss to coat. Arugula should have wilted dramatically; taste occasionally and put it on a plate once it's wilted to your liking. It should be flavorful and moist.

4. Cut your beets into large cubes about 3/4 in to an inch thick. 

5. Toss your beets and arugula together. Crumble feta on top, to taste.

6. Enjoy :)))

Total should be around ~140 calories for the whole thing, [more nutritional info here](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+beets+and+1%2F2+tsp+olive+oil+and+1%2F2+tsp+balsamic+vinegar+and+4+cups+arugula+and+3+g+lowfat+feta) (note that feta is not included in this). 

Roasting the beets makes them wonderfully sweet and silky, and combined with the salty taste of the feta and savory arugula - NOM. :)

Really simple recipe, the hardest part is browning the meat. 

Ingredients:

Ground Chicken 1 lb raw

Lean ground turkey 1 lb raw

Lean ground beef (I used 90% lean) 1 lb raw

3 cans of diced tomatoes

1 Green bell pepper

1 sweet onion

Chili Powder

Directions

You need a large pot (I use I believe a 8 quart deal)

Pour diced Tomatoes into large pot (save one can for grease if needed). You do not have to put them in first, but it makes stirring the meat in after easier and gives you a grease can.

Brown Meats and place in large pot once done, once all meat is in pot mix.

Dice onion and pepper while meat is browning to save time. Produce about a 1/2-3/4 cup of each depending on your preferences and add to pot.

Once all meat and veggies are added, add 1/2 cup of chili powder, and a cup of water.

Turn on med-low heat and bring to simmer, stirring occasionaly, then reduce to low.

With ten successful rounds under our (much) smaller belts, we’re excited to start Round 11 and we’re hoping others will join in.

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people’s updates. There's a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1i0967/mod_official_introduction_thread_for_round_11/). Round 11 will officially begin on Monday, July 15th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on your age, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later).

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we're not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days!  We've split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long plus a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint!

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

Sprint 2: August 19 - September 17

Recovery: September 18 - September 22

Sprint 3: September 23 - October 22

TLDR; If you’re interested, subscribe to /r/90daysgoal. Day 1 is July 15th. There will be informational posts throughout the first couple weeks to get everyone started toward their goals. We'll have a progress/recovery week at the end of each month. The final day will be October 22nd. I hope we’ll all have something to celebrate in three months!",,False,self,t5_2sd23,False,,,True,t3_1i6ebd,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1i6ebd/new_round_starting_on_r90daysgoal/,

It's a little daunting to sit down and figure out what we need as far as our diet goes, timing meals and getting the right amounts of everything, etc. So any resources, tips, and suggestions would be much appreciated!

Ok so this usually takes me about an hour to make, but it might take more or less depending on how good you are at chopping up chicken and onions. It's worth it anyway, since it gives me meals for a whole week. Also, to make the full thing requires a large sauce pan and also a large skillet or frying pan (large enough to cook 2.5 lbs. of chicken in), but if you only have smaller pots and pans you can always halve the recipe. Anyway, here goes.

TL;DR: READ IT. I SPENT LIKE AN HOUR WRITING THIS UP. IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY IN THE LONG RUN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BULK ON A BUDGET.


Ingredients:

2 lbs. dried lentils

2 cups + 4 tablespoons of olive oil *(about 17 oz. or 500 ml. they sell bottles of this size at my grocery store for $5)*

1 cup red wine vinegar

3-5 tbs. ground Cumin

3-5 tbs. Chili powder

2-3 teaspoons garlic powder *(for all the spices, if you don't already have them and just want to make this recipe as cheaply as possible, a lot of grocery stores have a spice rack where you can get small 0.5 - 1 oz. spice containers for $1 - $2. 1 container for each spice should be sufficient, but obviously unless you want to be eating garlic for a week, you'll have left over garlic)*

2 large onions, chopped

2.5 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast *(they sell big bags of frozen chicken breast at most grocery stores. where I am, you can get a 2.5 lb. bag for about $6.50 and this is by far the cheapest way to get it)*

Directions:

1. Cook the lentils in a large sauce pan. Basically, you just dump your 2 lbs. of lentils into the pan and then fill the pan up with water so you have about a 2:1 ratio of water to lentils, it doesn't have to be exact. Bring to a boil on medium heat and then reduce heat and let that shit simmer. They should be done in ~30 mins of simmering, but it's highly variable so check them every now and then to see if they're tender. Once they're tender drain them using a large colander. I usually need to use two colanders at this step because it's just so many goddamned lentils, but I'm sure a more clever man could figure out a way to do it with just 1 colander. Anyway, after they're drained dump them back in the sauce pan.

2. While the lentils are cooking you can chop up your onions and chicken. If you got frozen chicken make sure it's thawed first (easier to cut) and then cut it into small pieces &lt; 1 inch square.

3. In a large frying pan, heat 4 tablespoons (or more) of olive oil on medium heat. Once the oil is heated, add the onions and cook until they're nicely browned but not burned. *(Stir them around from time to time so they don't burn. Adding extra oil helps too.)*

4. Add the chicken to the browned onions and cook for about 5 - 10 mins, stirring occasionally. After that time, mix in half of your cumin and half of your chili powder to the onion/chicken mixture. Continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. *(This should take 15 - 20 minutes depending on how large or small you cut the chicken, but you'll have a good idea it's getting done when you don't see any pink and the chicken starts to take on a firmer texture. Obviously you can also cut open some pieces to make sure.)*

5. Now take your remaining cumin and chili powder along with the 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, the 2 cups of olive oil and the 1 cup of red wine vinegar and mix it all together in some kind of a mixing bowl or whatever you have on hand. Now dump the cooked chicken and this olive oil/vinegar sauce into the sauce pan with the lentils and mix it all together.

Ingredients

* 1/2 Onion
* 3-4 Garlic cloves
* ~1lb chicken breast - cut into bite size chunks

* 1 can corn - Drained
* Oregano
* Cumin
* Garlic Powder
* Onion Powder
* Salt, Pepper
* Balsamic Vinegar (3 or 4 Tablespoons)
* Brown Rice (2 cups uncooked) ( might need more for next time)
* Olive Oil

Put 2 cups UNCOOKED Brown Rice into rice maker (or cook on stove according to directions)

Cut chicken into bitesize chunks, season with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. Set aside.

Dice onion, and garlic cloves.

Heat up some oil (1 or 2 Tbsp) in a skillet, saute onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. 

Add in Garlic, and saute 30 seconds or until it smells really good.

Add in 1 tsp Oregano, and 1 tsp Cumin, stir around for 30 seconds.

Add in Chicken and cook until cooked. All white on outside (Add more oil if needed before putting chicken in)

Transfer this chicken and onion mix into a big stock pot. Add in Black beans, Rotel, Black eyed peas, 3-4 Tablespoons of Balsamic Vinegar, 1 tsp Oregano, 1 tsp Cumin. Stir around a bunch to mix it all up and bring to a boil.

Let it simmer about 5-10 minutes. Taste and add any seasonings if needed.

Add in corn and simmer a few more minutes.


Serve over cooked rice, add in some hotsauce and shredded cheese if desired.

A nice mix of protein and healthy carbs. Should last in the fridge for a while. I made this on Saturday.
It reheats nicely in the microwave, 1 minute, stir, heat 1 more minute. Been eating this for lunch since then.

If you want to make it vegetarian add in tofu instead of chicken, or just leave it out.

My girlfriend was raised in a typical ""if it doesn't have carbs, it's not a meal"" Mexican family. She's receptive to low-carb meals, which I've been making, but she also says that she doesn't feel satisfied with all the ""clean"" food we're eating and often rebounds later with various cravings.

I've tried different spices and various high-fat meats, but there seems to be something about the mouthfeel of certain carb sources that she craves (mostly corn- or rice-based carbs). Most of my cooking repertoire consists of food presented at face value, so I'm having trouble coming up with meal ideas besides the standard ""nutmeal-crusted meat."" I've made some of the recipes I found here, but some of them can be pretty complicated in execution, and one of my problems is constructing meals rather than individual dishes and/or cooking a reasonable enough quantity for leftovers.

If anyone knows a good low-carb way to replicate corn chips, that'd be a definite plus. I tried the almond meal and cheese approach, but that was mostly a disaster. Parmesan chips are okay, but mine tend not to be very sturdy.

EDIT: For example, I really like chicken thighs with crispy skin and broccoli or cauliflower as a dinner, which I figured would have enough fat, protein, and texture for satiety and am perfectly happy eating, but she isn't.

Since I live in NC, this is not a problem for me, but I think for the rest of the world, ""Carolina barbeque"" is synonymous with a tomato-based sauce, and is probably not low-carb. I recommend [Scott's Barbeque](http://www.scottsbarbecuesauce.com/), but just check the ingredients of the sauce to make sure you get the right type.


I've been making this for a couple of months, and I figured I would share it with you people. Barbecue is typically made of pork, but I've been using beef roasts...it's also not usually made in a crock pot, but whatever.


This is ridiculously simple. What you'll need is as follows:

* A Crock Pot (perhaps some olive oil)

* Beef Chuck Roast, Boston Butt, or Pork Shoulder (this works with any pork/beef roast)

* Vinegar-based Barbeque Sauce

Start by rubbing some olive oil on the inside of the crock pot to keep the roast from sticking to sides of the crock pot. I've skipped this step before without problems, but you might want to do this anyways.


Place the roast in the bottom of the crock pot and pour on half of the bottle of sauce. Turn the pot on low, and let it cook for about 7-7.5 hours. By the time you check on it, the roast will have shrunk a bit and will be soaking in its own juices.


Drain the juices out of the crock pot. The roast should be tender enough at this point that you can separate it with a fork. Take two forks and break the roast apart. Place the separated beef back into the crock pot and pour on the remaining half of the sauce. Stir it around a bit and let it cook on low for another hour. That's it. 


I usually refrigerate the extra barbeque and microwave it when I need it. Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/agWz4.jpg) of it on a sandwich.


I don't have a caloric breakdown for you, but if you can find the right barbeque, it will be completely determined by the leanness of the  roast you use. The aforementioned Scott's BBQ has no calories, and most vinegar-based sauces have negligible carbs. 

Edit: I've been using beef instead of pork because I prefer leaner cuts of meat. By all means, a pork roast can be substituted, it may even be cheaper.",,False,self,t5_2sd23,True,,,True,t3_hse24,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/hse24/low_carbhigh_protein_crock_pot_eastern/,

Awesome, and for about $10, you can make about 8 nice servings...possibly more.

Ingredients:

4 15.5 oz cans whole black beans, drained and rinsed

2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into small/medium cubes

2 qt broth (veggie or beef is best)

3 medium yellow onions, chopped

5 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped

1.5 t ground coriander

1/4 t aniseed

2 t ground cumin

1 t chili powder

fresh ground pepper

kosher salt

red pepper flakes (optional)

splash of red wine (optional)

limes

plain yogurt

----------------------

In a stock pot, heat about 2 T vegetable/olive/grapeseed oil over medium high heat until shimmering. Add onions and garlic, stir, cook until beginning to brown, stirring occasionally. 

Add cumin, coriander, some ground pepper, chili powder, anise, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for 30 seconds or so.

Add red wine if using. Then add broth and raise flame to high. Add beans and sweet potato chunks (did I mention its also good with butternut squash? butternut is a fun word to say). Let come to boil, turn down and simmer until sweet potatoes are soft. 

Using a slotted spoon, remove about 2 cups of solids from the soup and set aside (you can adjust this after your first time depending on how thick/chunky you like your soup). Toss the rest in a blender (or use an immersion blender...which is much easier), and blend until smooth. Put back in the stock pot and stir the chunks back into it.

Serve with a dollop of yogurt and a thin slice of lime (not necessary, but delicious).

Now, I love me some  broccoli but I realize it can get boring after awhile.  It's ok raw but I much prefer the texture steamed and I like having contrasting warm and cold things in my meals. I buy the large bag of florets from Sam's Club for price, bulk and convenience.   

To cook it, I take my florets and put them in a glass bowl with a little bit of water and season with kosher salt.  Cover tightly with saran wrap, poke a couple holes in the top and microwave for 2:30 - 3 min.  Bam.  Perfectly steamed and delicious just like that.  

Variations? I got you covered.  Proceed to steam a perfect batch of broccoli and then add your choice of:

* Black pepper. Aw yeah.  

* Zest a lemon, lime or even an orange and toss with a bit of the juice.  Refreshing as all fuck.  

* Whisk some soy sauce and sriracha together and toss in that.  You just made spicy asian style broccoli you suave motherfucker.  

* Whisk together your choice of vinegar (I switch between red wine, apple cider and rice wine) a bit of dijon mustard and some extra virgin olive oil.  Can you say warm broccoli salad? You sure can you sexy son of a bitch. 

Oh, you want a dipping sauce? I'll give you the business on dipping sauce. 

Take some greek yogurt and mix in the zest of a small lemon and some of juice to taste.  Peel, seed and dice some cucumber and throw that in.  (Note: if you're not going to eat all the dip in one sitting, salt the cucumber after dicing and let it drain for 20 minutes or so.  It'll keep your dip from getting watered down) Add a clove or two of minced garlic, some fresh mint and dill and add salt and pepper.  Look at you! You just made tzatziki sauce which is not only tasty on anything, but it's low cal, high in protein, zero fat and low carb and will keep that waistline in check.  It's my favorite veggie dip but it's also great on chicken, fish, as a mayo replacement for sandwiches, salad dressing, the sky's the limit.

In the recipe I'll note the exact thing I used, as it will affect the calorie count.

Pizza Frittata (serves 1)

2 large eggs
1/4 C tomato sauce (I used my homemade, recipe to follow)  
1/4 C shredded mozzarella (I used Kraft fat free)  
4 slices pepperoni (I used Hormel Turkey)  
other desired toppings: onions, mushrooms, peppers, other meats, etc (I would recommend cooking them to release some of the moisture and make sure they're cooked through)  
pizza seasonings/herbs (I used Penzy's Pizza Spice)  

1. Beat the eggs in a small bowl. Add in any spices, 2 T of the sauce, and 1 T of cheese. If desired you can add some toppings into this mixture. I would recommend it if you have a lot of toppings.  
2. Lightly coat a pan in cooking spray. Dump the egg mixture in the bottom and don't disturb it. Let it cook over medium heat until it's mostly set, but still a tad wet on top.  
3. Spoon on the rest of the tomato sauce and add toppings as you see fit. You can either finish it under the broiler or let it finish on the stove, covered to help melt the cheese. You'll want to pull the cover off once the cheese is melted to help evaporate any moisture.  
4. Serve this bitch up! It's a fork meal, the ""crust"" is pretty soft (but mine did have some nice color on the bottom).  
 
You could go full frittata on this and cook it 100% in the oven, either mixing all the ingredients in or pulling it out and topping it as described above. My skillet wasn't ovenproof so I didn't do that.  

**Counts (using the specified ingredients): 225 calories, 10.9 g of fat (3.3g saturated), 7.1g carbs, 1.8 g fiber, and 23.6g of protein.**  

These macros fit my diet, but obviously all ingredients can be changed around to fit your plan better. :) I found this filling and really good. I'm trying to eat more eggs and this was a painless way to get them in!    
 
       
My Tomato Sauce (makes 7-1/2C servings)  
  
1 large can whole san marzano tomatoes  
1 6oz can tomato paste  
1 t olive oil  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
sprinkle of splenda (to cut the acidity)  
salt  
herbs to taste  

1. Crush/puree/etc the tomatoes to whatever texture you like.  
2. Put the oil and garlic in a pot and turn the heat to medium. When the garlic is just barely golden add the tomatoes.  
3. Heat it up and adjust everything to taste. I like to let it simmer 10 minutes or so, I don't like a super cooked tasting sauce.  ",,False,self,t5_2sd23,1337786391.0,,,True,t3_u13bo,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/u13bo/quicklow_calcheap_pizza_frittata_xpost_rketo/,

**Prep Time**

10-15 min (easy)

**Ingredients**

- Marinated steak tips, any amount (for me, the more the merrier)
- Kale, 1 handful, organic
- Collard greens, 1 handful, organic
- Spinach, 1 handful, organic
- Olive oil, extra virgin, 2 tbsp
- Salt, pepper, all spice (to taste)

*Cost:* This varies greatly depending on the quality of the ingredients. Leafy greens are most susceptible to pesticide deterioration, which is why I stress you get them all organic, though it adds some cost. Steak obviously varies whether you get it from a supermarket, a butchery, organic, grass-fed...the list goes on. So I can't really put a price on it, but I can almost guarantee it will be less than a steak salad you order at a restaurant.

**Directions**

Throw the steak tips on the George Foreman. Depending on how rare you like your steak, this can take anywhere from 7-15 min, but I like my steaks rare so I basically keep it on the Foreman as long as it takes me to sauté the veggies.

While meat is cooking, add some olive oil to a pan and start by sautéing the kale - it takes the longest to soften up. After a few minutes add in the collard greens. Add in salt, pepper and all-spice to reduce the bitterness of these veggies. Just when these are soft, add in the spinach - it should only take a minute or two to reduce.

Right about now the meat should be done as well, so kill the heat on both and serve.

* 2 tbsp cocoa powder

You can make it sugar free and use splenda(what I do) or you can use sugar, up to you. Put anywhere between 1/4-1cup of splenda depending on your taste. Mix it all up at the end and taste for sweetness before baking it, adjust amounts to your taste(Start with 1/4 cup).

Form them into squares and bake them in the oven at 350* for 10-12 minutes

They're tasty and very filling, I eat them as a meal replacement when I'm in a rush.

Alternatively, if you are on a low-carb diet, you can do the same ingredients but just leave out the grains.

If you're worried about the high fat content, put less peanut butter as that's the main source of fat.

(x-posted from /r/fitness).,38,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/ndz6f/its_getting_cold_heres_a_low_carb_and_reasonably/,"My roommate and I made this stew a few times last year, have made it four times already this year, and we plan to live off of it as much as possible through the winter. I thought Fittit might enjoy it. (Full disclosure: it's mostly not mine. My roommate introduced it to me, and we've been tweaking it together.)

**Ingredients**:  
3 lbs stew meat (the more fat, the better)  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
1 onion, minced  
1 lb rutabaga, diced  
1 lb turnip, diced  
1 lb celery, chopped  
1 lb carrots, chopped  
.25 lb mushrooms  
1 bottle of red wine (merlot works best)  
1/4 cup butter  
Beef bouillon (cubes or paste)

**Directions**:
Chop the vegetables first; this can take a while. Pour yourself some wine, because you're working hard and you deserve it. When the vegetables are chopped, throw the stew meat into a piping hot cast iron or stainless steel skillet. As soon as the fat starts rendering, add the garlic and onions. Pour the wine into a big stockpot with the beef bouillon and turn it to high. When the onions and garlic have reduced and the beef is browned all over, add it to the (now hot) wine. Bring to a boil and then turn down to simmer. Add butter and mushrooms.

After 30 minutes, add the rest of the chopped vegetables, and some water (depending on your preference). Bring to a boil again, then let simmer. Keep it simmering for as long as you can stand it (it just keeps getting better!), and then eat.

This is about 7 pounds of food, which gets us each about 3 meals, depending on how hungry we are. It keeps very well.

Right now what I've been eating is:
breakfast: eggs with goat cheese, spinach, canadian bacon, and for carbs I'll mix in some flour (gives it more of a pancake-y texture the more you add)

lunch: grilled chicken breasts with cheddar cheese, ranch, buffalo sauce (0 cal franks), broccoli, and whole-grain toast if I'm having carbs

dinner: super lean ground turkey, avocado, taco sauce, sour cream, red/green pepper mixed with zucchini, garden salsa, and brown rice if I'm having carbs


so I keep my protein sources lean (except for the eggs, since you don't lose the fat from the yolk during cooking and they're pretty uniformly distributed in terms of how much fat/protein is in each one), my carbs really just straight carbs (brown rice, toast, flour, etc), and have a dedicated fat source.

You need:

* Blender
* Med-Lrg Bowl
* Spoon
* Spatual
* Non-stick pan
* Cooking Spray (butter if you like)
* 1 cup Old Fashioned Oats.  I used the quaker ones in the cardboard cylindric container. Real Cheap.
* 2 scoops protein powder (heaping scoops if you choose protein over exactness).  This is where the macros vary.  Mine is 20 grams/scoop.
* 1 cup cottage cheese.  I used 1% milkfat Publix brand.  On Sale.
* 1 cup Egg Whites.  Pick a container in the egg section. $2-5 and you'll have some left over.

It puts the oats and protein powder (dry ingredients) in the bowl.  It mixes them.  It puts the mixture in the blender.  It blends them until they are combined (it will see lil specks of oatmeal).  It dumps them back in the bowl.

Put the cottage cheese into the blender and blend until smooth.  Then add the egg whites, blend again, 4-5 pulses or until is seems well mixed, but not frothy. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture while stirring.  Stir until combined.  If it seems really thick, add some milk.  The mixture will thicken as it waits to be cooked, so keep some milk handy to add as this happens.  Try to keep a similar consistency throughout, just cause.  I only added milk once.

Heat the non-stick pan to med/med-high (6-7 on my stove).  Coat with cooking spray or butter. Cook like they were pancakes.  Mine were 4-5 inches across.  Made 8.

(For those that don't know how to cook pancakes.  Pour into a pan, leaving room for the batter to spread as you pour, though like 'merica, these cakes don' run... too much.  Don't touch them until the edges look rounded off and you see bubbles or tiny holes form all across the pancake. Think 10 holes, not 2.  Flip and cook for another minute or two.  Flipped side doesn't take too long. Easy.)

They are pah-retty heavy.  I ate two, a banana and a protein shake and was good to work out.

The important stuff...

**AS A BATCH**  The macros read as 8g fat/64g carbs/215g protein at about 1200 cals.  So just divide by how many cakes you make.  These are good for cutting.  Using butter instead of spray, whole cottage cheese instead of 1% and whole eggs instead of just whites (or any variation thereof) can really up the calories for mass gainers.

Side note:  They are a little bland as made above.  I added a pinch of salt and it helped a bit.

When I make them again I will take some process pics if I remember.

Have Fun!

Any ideas?,41,13,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/xbtje/question_living_on_food_stamps_but_wanting_to/,"I apologize if I have done this wrong (this is my first thread on Reddit), or if this is in the wrong place. I am also fairly new to Reddit, so I may be ignorant of something I've done incorrectly. Once again, my apologies!

Basically, my story is I've *always* been skinny. When I was 12 I was nearly 6' and weighed about 115lbs, and since then I've grown to 6'1 and weigh between 120lbs to 125lbs. Over the years I've been told by many doctors that I am indeed healthy, eat enough, and so forth, but could definitely benefit from gaining some weight, which is something I've **always** wanted to do. Hell, even when I was playing a lot of sports, specifically soccer, riding bikes, and running all the time I never saw a big change in my body, other than maybe gaining a small amount of muscle.

From what I've read here and other subreddits is that, at least part of my problem is I've never really gone out of my way to eat ""healthy."" I'll be completely honest and say I really don't know what ""healthy"" is as far as foods go. I'm part of a family that had fast food or take-out 3-6 days a week for the last 9 years. I recently moved out and have pretty much been living on ramen, other pastas, and pre-cooked meals.

Blahblahblah, the rest is unimportant. My real question is, what exactly can I do, while living on food stamps for food, to eat healthier? I'm not that great of a cook, but that's another skill I am trying to improve upon. Are there any recipes, meal plans, or resources I can look for? I remember finding a cookbook for college students, but I highly doubt that's going to fit the bill for 


**Edit 1**: I get about $250~ a month in food stamps, if that helps. Also, I hope anyone in a similar situation can find help here as well.

Day 1      

* Breakfast      
Oats with honey and strawberries      
**381C/81C/5F/8P/12S/44S**

**TOTAL:      
1,791C/200C/76F/87P/341S/52S**

In comparison with my set guidelines, I am eating 419 less calories, 104 less carbs, 2 extra fat (minor difference), 4 extra protein, 2,159 less sodium (wat) and 8 extra sugar.        
      

Day 2      

* Breakfast       
Whole milk, banana and sweet potato.     
**351C/59C/8F/12P/171S/36S**     

* Lunch       
Protein drink (I drink this after workout, so pretty much I just skip lunch, or should I drink this before workout?)       
**467C/40C/15F/45P/322S/27S**

* Dinner       
Pasta sausage thing      
**1,369C/79C/50F/44P/809S/13S**

**TOTAL:      
2,157C/170C/73F/101P/1,302S/76S**     
     
In comparison with my set guidelines, I am eating 53 less calories, 134 less carbs, 1 less fat, 18 more protein, 1198 (wat) less sodium and 32 extra sugar.            
         
I've only included the first 2 days of my plan so I can get feedback before continuing, is this kind of diet suitable for me? **I AM EXTREMELY SORRY** if I didn't properly follow the guidelines of posting for help. Please give me feedback and I will learn from my mistakes

My mother has pancreatic cancer and has been going through chemo since January.  She has lost too much weight due to lack of appetite and a restrictive diet.  She eats gluten free because gluten is very upsetting to her stomach.  She also limits her dairy and animal protein intake since they are both hard to digest and her pancreas needs to devote as much energy as possible to fighting off the cancer.  

Currently we're having her snack on nuts as much as possible, and I'm buying a box of ""Boost"" nutritional drinks.  Hopefully she can drink at least one of those a day.

What are some high calorie meals that my brother and I can prepare for her within these restrictions?  I would like to have her eating at least 1500 calories per day.

**Spinach Salad with Roasted Cherry Tomatoes and Poached Eggs**


Difficulty: Easy

Yield: 4 servings

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cooking Time: 40 minutes

Attribution: Glow Magazine, April '11



**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups Cherry Tomatoes, halved
* .25 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil, divided
* 1.5 tsp Garlic, chopped
* 1 tsp Fresh Thyme, coarsely chopped
* 1 Tbsp Fresh Parsley, coarsely chopped
* 4 slices Whole Grain Bread, torn into 1"" cubes
* 6 cups Baby Spinach, packed
* 1 Tbsp White Vinegar
* 4 Eggs
* 2 Green Onions, thinly sliced

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 435°F.

1. Toss tomatoes with 2 Tbsp oil, garlic, and herbs and season with salt and pepper. Scrape mixture into an oven proof baking dish just large enough to hold them in a single layer. Roast for 25-30 minutes, shaking dish occasionally until tomatoes are shrivelled and slightly caramelized around the edges.

1. In the meantime, toss bread cubes with remaining 2 Tbsp oil and season with salt. Place on a baking sheet. Remove tomatoes from oven and place bread cubes in oven. Bake for 10 minutes turning once, until golden. Set aside.

1. Divide spinach among 4 plates. Top with roasted tomatoes, spooning any juices overtop. Top each salad with a few croutons.

1. Fill a large wide pot with water, add vinegar and bring to a boil over high heat. Crack each egg into a small ramekin. Slip 1 egg at a time into the pot. Reduce heat to low. Let egs poach for 3 or 4 minutes until white is set but yolk is still liquid. Use a slotted spoon to individually remove eggs from water. Place an egg on top of each portion of salad.

5 large eggs, lightly beaten

1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt

1/3 cup/ .5 oz /15 g finely chopped fresh chives

1/3 cup /.5 oz /15 g finely chopped fresh dill

1 cup / 1.5 oz /45 g finely chopped kale

1 yellow or white onion, finely chopped

3 cloves garlic, finely chopped

1 teaspoon (toasted) cumin

1 teaspoons baking powder

1 cup / 3.5 oz /100 g whole grain bread crumbs, plus more if needed
water or a bit of flour, if needed

1/3 cup / .5 oz / 15 g crumbled feta

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or clarified butter

Preheat oven to 400F / 200C.
Combine the quinoa, eggs, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the chives, dill, kale, onion, garlic, and cumin. Stir well.
Add the baking powder and bread crumbs, stir, and let sit for a few minutes so the crumbs can absorb some of the moisture.
Gently stir in the feta.
At this point, you should have a mixture you can easily form into twelve 1-inch / 2.5cm thick patties. I err on the very moist side because it makes for a not-overly-dry patty, but you can add more bread crumbs, a bit at a time, to firm up the mixture, if need be. Conversely, a bit more beaten egg or water can be used to moisten the mixture. If you're still having trouble getting the mixture to hold - mix in flour, a couple tablespoons at a time.
Oil a baking sheet, and arrange the patties with a bit of space between each. Bake for ~20 minutes, or until the bottoms are brown. Flip and bake for another 5 minutes.
Enjoy hot, or allow to cool to room temperature on a cooling rack.
Makes about a dozen patties.

*To cook quinoa: Combine 2 cups/ 12 oz/340 g of well-rinsed uncooked quinoa with 3 cups / 700 ml water and 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover, decrease the heat, and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, until the quinoa is tender and you can see the little quinoa curlicues.


**Alternately, you can cook the patties in a skillet. Here's how - Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-low heat, add 6 patties, if they'll fit with some room between each, cover, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms are deeply browned. Turn up the heat if there is no browning after 10 minutes and continue to cook until the patties are browned. Carefully flip the patties with a spatula and cook the second sides for 7 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties. Alternatively, the quinoa mixture keeps nicely in the refrigerator for a few days; you can cook patties to order, if you prefer.

Boiled white pasta: 150g, 543kcal, 18g protein, 112.5g carbs, 2g fat

Grilled Pork chops: 150g, 213kcal, 36g protein, 0g carbs, 7g fat  

  
  
  

Pretty easy to prepare.  



1) Put the pasta in boiling water (10 mins).

2) Meanwhile, peel and chop your carrot.

3) Stick the pork on the grill (I use a george foreman).

4) When the pasta has been on for 6 mins (ie 4 mins before it's finished cooking) throw your chopped carrot and peas in the water with the pasta.

5) Once the pasta, peas, and carrots are cooked, drain them off.

6) Chop up your pork steak (should be cooked by now) into small chunks, and put it into a bowl along with the pasta, peas, and carrots.

7) Add pesto and mayo to the bowl and then mix the FUCK outta that bad boy. You're about to devour 1.5k worth of calories, but you gotta earn it, so mix that shit like your Girl Talk! Or madeon! or some other awesome DJ. Hell you can mix it like Mozart for all I care (I hear he was an animal on the decks!) Once it's all well and stirred...

8) Sprinkle your pumpkin and sunflower seeds on top, grab a fork, and chow down.   

  
  
  

What I like about this recipe is you can tweak it to your needs pretty easily. Less fat? Forget the mayo. More protein? Add some more pork! Or turkey! Or whatever! It works with most meats. And most of the fat in there is mono or poly-unsaturated as well. It's great!  


So I hope you enjoy it and good luck with your gains!

It is a blanket recipe that can be fucked around with to fit your dietary needs.

Basically, it is [these packets](http://i.imgur.com/kcJbb.jpg)

Get them from your local indian/ethnic store for about 1.50-2.00 each. They are spice pouches for different indian dishes. I usually ignore the directions on the back and make it how I want (the pouch recipes usually just add yogurt and paneer, which is cheese. I like to get more bang for my buck so add meat, veggies, etc.).

My go to recipe:

1) Cube about 3 lbs of chicken and 3 lbs of pork

2) Cut up some onions, grab some mushrooms. The last batch I also threw in some zucchini. Basically whatever you want.

3) Take my big ass cast iron pan and throw in a few healthy spoonfuls of coconut oil. Put on medium-high (like a 7 out of 10).

4) Throw in the veggies and let them cook a few minutes (not too much, don't want them mushy)

5) Throw in the meat. Continually stir so that the outside of all the meat gets a bit cooked (but the inside will still be raw)

6) Throw in the spice packet. Continue stirring since the cast iron is hot as fuck and I don't want the spices to burn to the pan.

7) Throw in a can of coconut milk (ie. nectar of the gods)

8) Stir everything around until mixed together nicely. Sometimes it is necessary to add a bit more water to cover everything. You want it to look like a nice stew.

9) Put on low heat and let it simmer until meat is done and veggies are tender. If it gets hot enough that it starts bubbling turn it down low. If it gets too hot the coconut milk starts to break up and thins out, which tastes fine but isn't as good of a texture.

Optional: Throw in some plain greek yogurt to thicken out and give a tasty texture. Just make sure it doesn't get too hot or the yogurt breaks up as well. Just think low and slow.

10) Eattttttt. As a reference, here is the [batch I made Monday](http://i.imgur.com/VvA6r.jpg) Trust me it tastes so fucking good.

I get three meals out of the above. The other plus side is it is really easy to add more calories to if you need it. Just throw in a few eggs over easy, some avocado, or greek yogurt if you eat it. Any of those will compliment the taste of the curry and add more protein and fat.

Each packet is a different flavor so you won't get tired of it (also changing up the veggies and meat with whatever is in season/cheap). Seriously, this stuff has kept me lean and mean for awhile and I thought I would pass it on. Obviously you can fuck around with it depending on what you eat. If you aren't paleo or keto you can throw it over rice or pasta as well.

Happy eating.",,False,self,t5_2sd23,1348069039.0,,,True,t3_1050q7,http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1050q7/recipehow_i_eat_cheaphealthyadventurous_every/,

I am lazy (which is why I get so hooked on fast food) so I took a lot of short cuts...

Anyhow, 

In a soup pot or crock pot, throw in:
-3 cans kirkland chicken chunks
-2 cans Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilies)
-2 small cans diced green chilies
-2 cartons chicken stock (I used green chili lime flavored chicken stock)
-2 cans enchilada sauce
-liberal shakes of cumin powder, garlic powder, and onion powder to taste 

Cook till warm. Makes 8 servings at around 174 calories a serving.

Again, I went for lazy (hence all the canned ingredients). I am sure that if you use fresh ingredients it would taste even better! 

Also, I went for low cal, but some good additions to this soup if you have more caloric room could be onion, corn, and even black beans. However, for me, I am also trying to go low carb so I omit those. I used to eat this soup with those ingredients, and then topped with tortilla chips as well as cheese.

ingredients:

* 1 Cup sliced carrots  (cut on a bias or just into little circles)
* 4 Cups Broccoli Florets (steamed)
* 1lb Ground Chicken
* 4 Bell Peppers
* 1 tbs fresh cilantro
* A little cooking oil (I used PAM)
* Cumin, Red Pepper, Salt, Pepper (all to taste)

Turn on broiler.

Cut tops off of the bell peppers.  Pull the seeds/ribs out.  You want to end up with the peppers being like cups.  Add a pinch of salt the inside of the peppers, rub the salt around the inside of the pepper.  Let sit for a few minutes.  (You're trying to both flavor and draw out some liquid)

After a few minutes there should be some liquid inside the peppers.  Dump this out.  Put the peppers on a baking sheet, and place under the broiler.  Let the peppers sit under the broiler until the edges start to brown (no guess on time, just check 'em every few minutes).  Pull the peppers from the oven when they're done and set aside. If there's liquid inside, dump it out.  You can do this in parallel with the other steps.

Chop your carrots.
Cook your broccoli  (I use the steamfresh bags)
  This isn't technically needed, you can cook fresh broccoli with the 
  carrots.

Spray pan with cooking spray

Get pan hot (to the point where the cooking spray just starts to smoke)

Add carrots (and fresh broccoli if you're not using frozen) with a pinch of salt.  (again, this is to pull some water out of the veggies)

When the carrots start to brown a bit, add the chicken.

When the chicken is almost done add your spices.  I used about 1/2 tbs of cumin, 2tsp or so of salt, black pepper, and some red pepper flakes.  This is all optional, spice it how you like it.

When the chicken is cooked turn off the heat on the pan and mix in the cilantro.

Fill the peppers with the chicken mixture.

I put a bit of cheddar cheese on top of the peppers, but you don't have to.

Put the stuffed peppers back under the broiler for a few minutes.  Check them every few minutes, and pull them out when they look tasty.

Below is calculated using loseit.com.  I didn't add the 2-3tsp of salt, or the 10second spray of cooking spray.  (forgot to)  This should be pretty close though.

[SPAGHETTI SQUASH CASSEROLE](http://i.imgur.com/yTRwS)

SERVES 4
 
**INGREDIENTS**

* 4 cups cooked spaghetti squash
* 2 links Jennie-O lean Italian turkey sausage (hot or sweet) (Leave this out for [VEG])
* 1 cup Marinara
* 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
* 1/2 green bell pepper, diced
* 1 cup shredded 2% mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 cup red onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic (adjust to taste)
* 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

**DIRECTIONS**

If you don’t know how to cook a spaghetti squash check out this link - http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/cooking/a/spagsquash.htm

Cook sausage, garlic and onions in a pan and drain any excess fat, if you used lean turkey sausage there probably will be little to none.  Add the peppers and mushrooms and cook until almost soft, pour off any excess water.  Add marinara and heat through then add spaghetti squash, stir to mix and then pour into a casserole dish.   Top with mozzarella and parmesan and chopped oregano then bake in 350F oven for about 15 minutes until cheese is melted and casserole is bubbling.

This is my first time making this and I really enjoyed it. I think you may need to play around with spices depending on your tastes. 

(This is also my first time creating/submitting a recipe, so I apologize in advance if it isn’t written perfectly.)

Ingredients 

- 100 grams dehydrated soy chunks

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

- 2 onions

- 4 cloves of garlic

-  ¾ can of diced tomatoes (796 ml)

- 2 cups rinsed spinach

-  ½  head of cauliflower

- 1 ½ cups water

-  4-5 tbsp chili powder

-  3 tbsp cumin

- ½  tbsp turmeric

- ½ tbsp ground coriander seed

- 1 tbsp pepper

- ½ tbsp garam masala

- 1 tbsp salt


1.	Soak soy chunks in water for 15 minutes or until soft
2.	Chop onions and garlic and pan fry till soft and slightly brown (add a tbsp of water if it starts to stick to pan)
3.	Add tomatoes, spinach, water and spices. Simmer on medium for 10 minutes.
4.	Take off stove and blend (I used a hand blender).
5.	Return to stove and turn heat to medium low.
6.	Rinse cauliflower and chop into small/medium florets and toss into curry
7.	Squeeze water out of soy chunks and toss into curry
8.	Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until cauliflower is soft.

**Macros:** [The potatoes are 86 calories per 100g uncooked](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2666/2). I used a 345g potato, so ~300 calories + 80 for the oil. (Buy a kitchen scale if you don't already have one. They're $10 on Amazon).

**(My potato, with oil):**

* Calories: 377

* Fat: 9.3g

* Potassium: 1,163mg

* Carbs: 83g

* Fiber: 10g

* Sugar: 14.5g

* Protein: 5.5g

* Vit A%: 980% DV

**Ingredients:**

* Sweet potato

* Oil (vegetable/canola) 2 teaspoons

* Seasonings

**Method:**

1. Peel or don't peel, I don't care. Cut into fries at your desired thickness. I'm impatient so I cut mine into McDonald's-sized fries.

2. Put fries into large bowl and drizzle 2 teaspoons of oil (more or less). Toss to coat with your hands. Liberally apply your seasonings, toss to coat again.

3. Spread them out, single-layered and with room to breathe onto a foil-lined cookie sheet. **Bake at 400F** for 20 minutes, flip each one over, bake for an additional 10 minutes.

Obviously, you'll want to adjust cooking time depending on the thickness you choose. Just keep an eye on them.

According to Calorie Count's Recipe Analyzer my recipe is good in these areas:

**Good points**

* Low in saturated fat

* Low in sugar

* High in dietary fiber

* High in iron

* High in manganese

* High in magnesium

* High in phosphorus

* High in thiamin

**Bad Points**

* I ate almost all of it over the course of two days, for every single meal

It's really easy to make and took me about 2 hours; half an hour of which was spent on reddit and another 15 minutes cleaning up.

**Props to [this blog](http://fedandfit.com/2012/02/24/paleo-chili-relleno/) for the tomato sauce recipe**

**Two Bean Beef and Quinoa Chili (~8 servings)**

**Ingredients**

* Can of black beans, rinsed well

* Can of red kidney beans, rinsed well

* 1 lb ground beef

* Package quinoa, soaked and rinsed well (edit: Casbah brand found in Walmart, 225g uncooked)

* 2 1/2 cups Campbell's No Salt Added, No Fat Chicken Broth

* 1 cup chopped onions

* whole bulb of garlic, sliced

* 2 stalks of celery, diced (you can add more if you want)

* 1 container of whole white mushrooms, sliced thickly (package says it was 8 oz.)

* 1 carrot, sliced thickly (I'd used 2-3 carrots next time)

* 3 large tomatoes, cut into thick chunks

* 2 tablespoon cumin

* 1 tablespoon chili powder

* 2 tablespoons dried oregano

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt

* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon


**Method**

1. Saute half of the onion and half the garlic in a little olive oil on medium-high heat. 

2. When lightly browned, add half of all the spices and the salt (do not add the garlic salt or cinnamon). 

3. Let saute for 2-3 minutes, then add the tomatoes. Cover the pan and let it sit on medium heat until the tomato breaks down, about 15 minutes. 

4. Transfer to a bowl and use an immersion blender to puree or transfer to stand blender and puree. Set aside.

5. As you're preparing the sauce, cook the quinoa according to the instructions on the package. I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of water.

6. Return burner to medium-high heat. In the same pan, add the rest of the onion and garlic. Saute until lightly browned, then add remaining spices including garlic salt and cinnamon, carrots and celery. Let saute for 3 minutes, stir if you notice things burning.

7. Add the beef, cook and crumble.

8. Add the sauce you created in steps 1-4 back to the pan with the beans, mix well and simmer for 30 minutes on medium-low heat.

9. Lastly, add the mushrooms and mix well again. Turn off the stove and just let it sit.

**Suggestions**

You can serve the chili on top of the quinoa or just mix it straight in somewhere between steps 8-9.

Add any vegetables you see fit.

Transfer everything to a larger pot/pan after step 7 if the rest of the ingredients won't fit.

**[Nutritional Information (Courtesy of Calorie Count's Recipe Analyzer)](http://i.imgur.com/8eujR.jpg)**. This is just an approximation that is highly dependent on what veggies you put in and the method you chose to cook the quinoa.

They've turned out quite well and are tasty but plain, so depends on how you like things whether you want to add nuts, dried fruit, spices, etc. I prefer to make them plain and add things depending on the day or keep 'em plain. These can be eaten hot or cold.

Serves 8 or 16 (depends on how you cut 'em)

Prep time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 30 minutes (at least)

Ingredients:

•	2 eggs, beaten

•	95g stewed apples

•	1/4 cup honey

•	2 tsp baking powder

•	1/4 tsp salt

•	250g uncooked oats

•	2 tsp cinnamon 

Method

1.	Preheat oven to 375F/Gas5
2.	Mix all the wet ingredients. 
3.	Stir in the dry ingredients, mix well.
4.	Grease a 8x11 pan*, spread, push in batter.

6.	Cool and cut

*This is what the original recipe says but I just used a casserole dish that I greased up with butter. I didn't include the butter in the calorie count as it was so small of an amount.

4 - 4oz Pork Chops. (You can use boneless, bone in Loins, whatever.)

2 Red Apples, thinly sliced.

1 Medium Onion, thinly sliced.

1/2 cup of Apple Juice.

2 tbsp. of Oil

1 tbsp. of Flour

1 tbsp. Brown Sugar

1 1/2 tsp. Rubbed Sage

1 tsp. of Salt

1 tsp. Minced Garlic (Dried or fresh.)

1 tsp. Thyme Leaves

1/2 tsp. Ground Allspice

1/2 tsp. Paprika


Mix the flour and all of the spices (except the brown sugar) together in a small bowl.  Sprinkle a tbsp of the mixture on each side, patting it into the meat.  You may have to gather the excess back up from your breading station so you'll have enough.

Put a large skillet on Medium High heat and let it heat up for 5 minutes.  Then add your oil and wait another few minutes.  Brown the pork chops on each side.  Remove them from the skillet for the time being.  

Add your onions to the skillet stir for about 3 minutes or until they're tender.  Next, stir your apples in until also tender.

Stir in your apple juice, brown sugar, and any remaining seasoned flour you have until well mixed.  (I had no seasoned flour left).  Return your pork chops to the skillet and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 5 minutes or until desired doneness.

I really didn't want the extra calories from the bread since I have been kicking ass with the diet/exercise thing and I felt amazingly lazy at the same time so didn't want to saute onions and the like.  So I came up with this soup as a treat and it was so tasty I had to share.  I apologize for the fact I never measure my seasoning.

**Equipment**

1 Pan

1 Spatula/turner

Blender or immersion blender



**Ingredients**

1 Can stewed tomatoes *about* 122 cal

½ cup 1% milk *about* 55 cal

1½ ounces of shredded cheese *about* 165 cal

1TBS olive oil *about* 120 cal

*Spice to taste with:*

Crushed red peppers

Garlic powder

Onion powder

Pepper

Oregano

Parsley

Sage

Rosemary

Thyme


Drain tomatoes and reserve liquid.  Heat the pan with the olive oil.  When the pan is hot pour in the tomatoes(Careful they can splatter badly).  Cook the tomatoes till they begin to fall apart, less than 5 minutes usually.  A small amount of browning is good, it brings flavor to the party.  As the tomatoes start to thicken add the reserved tomato juice and seasoning.  Continue to heat until it thickens, make sure to stir occasional to avoid burning.  Add milk and blend soup until uniform consistency.  Remove from heat and stir the cheese in till it melts.  If cheese does not melt return to heat until melting is complete.  Pour into bowl and place spoon in hand.  Scoop the soup up with spoon and place in mouth, be sure to swallow.
