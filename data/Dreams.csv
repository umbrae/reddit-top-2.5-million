I'm in a narrow underground tunnel of some sort at the head of a long line of faceless, voiceless, type people.  They aimlessly shuffle along behind me as I walk deeper into the tunnel.  Suddenly the tunnel gets narrower and narrower until there is a dead end.  This is the fucked up part: the zombie things just keep walking smashing me against the walls of the tunnel.  I panic and start shoving and ""swimming"" through the arms and legs of them until I'm trapped suffocate and die.... EVERY FUCKING TIME!!!!  Only then do I wake up covered in sweat.

I cannot wake myself up once this dream starts although consciously I know what will happen as my mind has experienced this dream countless of times.  I cannot control myself in the dream though, which in turn makes it a much more panic induced, helpless, feeling as I watch myself march to my death unwittingly.

Done talking about it because it gives me goosebumps.

Things got weird.",67,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/14i1k6/when_i_turned_20_i_asserted_i_would_never_have/,"I was at some kind of Skype setup inside of a car (that wasn't mine), and the speaker looked like an old payphone headset. The whole thing seemed like it was running inside of a briefcase - there were no numbers to dial, so it only received calls.

I remember this because I was walking by this car when it began ringing. No one was answering, so I broke in and picked up the phone. There was static, and then I heard a voice that sounded eerily like mine, but not quite. He asked me a few questions that only I would know the answer to. After obliging, there were a few moments of silence, and I hear ""...dad?""

I catch on pretty quickly. I'm ecstatic to be talking to him, and I try to ask as many questions as I can. I ask him what year it is, what his name is, how old he is, why he wanted to talk to me... but the boy was pretty tight lipped. His name is Anthony. I joked that I would have named him Adam, and asked if his name was Adam now (Ripple Effects and all). He sounded confused, and said ""you never named me, you weren't there.""

Fuck. This doesn't sound good.

I asked him who his mother was, and again, he didn't answer, only saying ""She told the doctor what to call me before she died.""

I ask him why he called me. Another moment of silence, and he says ""You never meet me. I wanted to call and tell you I made it without you.""

I start tearing up, saying how I would never abandon him, how I would love any kid I had, even if I had said on my 20th birthday that I would never have them. I would never resent them in any way. 

""I know, dad.""

I ask him if he ever knew me in the future, and he says the most chilling sentence I've ever heard. ""No. According to the records, you are hit by a car today. The accident leaves you in a coma for a few months. You told grandma and grandpa at some point that if you wouldn't wake up to just pull the plug . They love you, so they do.""

I ask him how much time I have left. He replies ""not long."" I try to open the car doors, but they're jammed shut. it dawns on me that this is the car that gets struck. I'm in my tomb. 

I tell him to give my love to everyone I knew, if they're still around.

""We're here, son"" Another voice answers from the back. ""We never had a chance to say goodbye.""

I'm crying so hard I'm incoherent, but I tell them that I love them with all my heart. I say my goodbyes to my family one by one, and then my son comes back on the phone.

""I love you, dad. They took good care of me. I'm going to be ok.""

The line goes dead. I still can't open the doors. I hear a semi horn blaring behind me, and I close my eyes. Then I woke up.

I'm still shaken. I have an exam in 4 hours, and I couldn't focus while this was still running around in my head. Hopefully this helps a little bit. I don't know. I just don't know. 

-----
My exam went well. Most of the details of my dream were gone by the time I was out, so I'm glad I wrote it down here first. I'm no shrink, so I'm not really sure I can speculate on what any of that meant - thanks for the interpretations, it's helped me wrap my head around this.

Two weeks ago I dreamt I killed myself. A lot of stuff happened but it was pretty much about a zombie attack in a neighbourhood I used to play in when I was a kid. Near the end of my dream I got bitten by a stray zombie head that was rolling around on the ground, I panicked and thought ""I have to kill myself ASAP before I turn into a zombie too"". Saw a big pair of garden shears and cut my own throat with it. First cut was too shallow, I felt the blood flow down on my chest, it was so WARM too! I've never realized before that blood would be warm, kinda crazy that my subconscious mind would think that detail up. 

Anyway the second cut I charged more power with my arms in some odd way and cut half my head off, I felt it fall back and I got very light-headed (haha). This is where I died. Felt my body or soul float up over the neighbourhood I was in, saw some zombies run around on the streets, kept going up towards the sky until it got too cold and hard to breathe (space?) and the dream ends.

While these dreams are interesting and fun to think about, they're often nearly impossible to interpret, because they are relative to the user that submits them, and only someone who knows the person very well could have a chance of helping them. Sometimes we can pick up on obvious things, but symbolism in dreams is not universal, different symbols and ideas are linked to different experiences for every individual. We can ask questions about the user's personal life, but these questions are based off of their dreams, and while we can ask certain things, we cannot know everything about the person's life, and this can make it very difficult.

I would suggest that when people share dreams that are very convoluted and/or emotional, they also share about anything significant happening in their life, and they try to figure it out themselves by re-reading their own submission, and they can update their submission if they figure it out on their own.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_14xm9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/14xm9v/the_problem_with_this_subreddit/,

 that's pretty much a feature length with an awesome story about love and sacrifice. Also it gets a little weird but its a dream so get over it.

 It starts out in the rain forest outside this broken arena. The arena looks like it has been in disrepair for awhile and it has a really Aztec look to it. I am a teddy bear, which is not addressed by the dream but the teddy bear is a mystic shaman in the culture of the people of this forest. I am with an extremely beautiful amazon woman and we are trudging through the forest. We find a dead young man who looks battered and broken, so I raise my staff and everything turns white.

At this point my point of view changes to the young warrior. I wake up on a stone slab with the woman and teddy bear over me. Next to them is a gruff old man. I awake and tell them my story. I was fighting a tyrannical ruler of an ancient kingdom in the arena. I was defeated by him because he can harness the power of the ""shock wave"" to batter his opponents (kinda like fus roh dah) This king has been known to take beautiful women to a cave beneath a water fall where he sacrifices them to keep his people obedient. 

The old man begins to teach me how to fight and harness the power of the shock wave. He tells me he taught the king the shockwave to defeat ""Stone giants"" and become king. He feels guilt for the tyrant the ruler has become, and begs me to end his rule, and not to abuse my power. 

So later after I have become  skilled in the art. Me and the woman are walking through the forest together. I feel love towards her and I am constantly admiring her beauty. Suddenly the king shows up. He uses shock wave to knock me into the canopy where I am bound by vines. The woman and the king fight for a time, and just when it seems she will escape he captures her.

When I finally free myself I feel a lot of grief. I know where he has taken her, and I know I cant beat him. Regardless I make the journey to the cave beneath the waterfall. The suction of the water has been known to kill all who enter. I feel as though I have to enter, and I know that to enter means death. I have to save the girl and that pushes me to dive into the water and swim into the cave.

When I enter I see the girl tied to the far wall, she has a vase and a hose that give her air. I look around and suddenly the king attacks with shock wave from above and I use my shock wave to block it. It ricochets and cuts the air hose to the girl and I panic. So I fight the king fervently using my sword. He has a spear and he injures me, but I use the shock wave to throw him against the back wall.

The interesting part is I knew what would happen if I made this choice. But I decide not to finish him and save the girl. I pull air from the vase using my mouth and breathe it into her. I can see her coming back to life so I cut her bonds. We make eye contact, it has a really romantic feel. I can feel whats about to happen I don't break eye contact.

I wake up on the stone slab and the girl is naked and crying. She lays her head on my chest and it fades out, I am pretty sure I didnt make it.

1358508520.0,27,self.Dreams,16t8l8,I Dreamed about Salvation in Hell,31,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16t8l8/i_dreamed_about_salvation_in_hell/,"I had a dream last night.

It was a dream about Hell.

It wasn't fire and brimstone and demons with pitchforks Hell.
It was much worse.

It was a flat plain, almost featureless.  Winds howled constantly, strong enough to carry you away or rip flesh from your body.  At the edge of the plain was a series of cliffs and crevices where people huddled in dark caves.

There was no light in the sky.  There was no reliable way to tell time. Only fire provided light, if you were lucky enough to find something to burn.  There was no wood, no coal, nothing we rely on as a modern fuel source.  The few fires I saw were people burning their own refuse.  How they started those fires with only bones and refuse was a mystery to me.

There was no water and no food.  Everyone was hungry, thirsty, and afraid of each other.  Every now and then someone would give in to the madness of the hunger and eat someone.  With almost no access to fire they ate them raw.  The worst part of being eaten was that you would survive and regenerate.  It was painful to even watch.

At the bottom of the cliffs nothing could be seen, but a horrible grinding noise erupted from the darkness.  If someone got too high on the cliffs the winds would knock them off into the pit, or simply tear them to shreds.  If you went down too low the pit would still get you.  So the cliffs got crowded with people whose only source of food was each other.

I was relieved to see that there were no children, but then I saw something about the people that disturbed me.  Everyone looked the same.  They had emaciated gaunt faces, with no sexual distinctions, and everyone’s skin was pale along with their eyes.  No one had any hair.  Everyone was naked, but disfigured to the point that other people could be desired only for food.  Lust was forgotten.  Pride was forgotten.  

One man caught my eye.  He worked hard carving bowls out of stone, and then he would weep into the bowls.  Strangers would come to him and he would offer them bowls filled with his own tears so that they could briefly sate their thirst.  Sometimes a stranger would take the bowl and smash the man’s head, and then eat bites out of his arms or legs.  Sometimes though, they were so overcome by his generosity that they sat next to him appearing almost numb.

He would spend a long time with anyone who spoke to him, and would take the time to learn their language.  This could take years, but these people had a wealth of time on their hands.  He taught people how to fast and meditate in order to overcome the hunger, and reminded them of the simple joy of being with another person and treating each other as human beings.  In time, he taught people how to remember parts of their former lives, and how to draw strength from those memories.  He was simply known as the Teacher.

This went on for a long time.  This place was horrible and oppressive, but he was making a great difference in the lives of the lost.  His followers no longer ate anyone, even outsiders, and defended each other and strangers from being prey.  A semblance of a society began to form in a remote corner of this world, with the Teacher and his word forming the basis of a new code of ethics.  The most basic precepts of his teachings were carved in stone and pilgrims carried his words to the farthest corners of the abyss.

I was most surprised though, by what happened next.

Flanked by angels, a figure robed in light appeared.  It was obvious to anyone who saw Him that this was Jesus, the Lord.  He came to the Teacher and said, “Take my Hand, and let me take you to Paradise.”
The Teacher smiled genuinely, and bowed graciously to the Lord.  “I fear I cannot, for I am needed here.  But you are free, great King, to join me here and help me restore these people to themselves.”

And Jesus was sad.  For several more days he approached people, those who had overcome their hunger, and offered them salvation.  Those who took the hand of the Lord vanished in sunlight from the darkened world, leaving it forever.  Almost all of the Teacher’s followers went with Jesus to Paradise.

The Lord returned to the Teacher and said to him, “Only a few of the faithful remain.  Come, bring the rest of your followers and let us ascend to Paradise.”

Once again, the Teacher bowed. “Thank you, Lord, for your mercy on these wretched souls of ours.  I fear though that you have made the need for me even greater where I am.  Please, take with you the last of my people, and let me remain here to minister to the lost. There are many who have not yet learned the Way, and many more yet to descend into this darkness.  It is better to attend to the lost than to rest in luxury. ”

And Jesus was sad, and he left with the last of the Teacher’s followers to Paradise.

Smiling, the Teacher began all over again, forming bowls of rock and weeping into them.  But he was smiling.  It was only then that I recognized the Buddha.

I was dreaming some random stuff, nothing really special. In the dream a bear, a regular brown bear, was coming and going. I saw the bear chase a friend up a tree. Suddenly I was standing with the bear behind me and I was terrified as fuck. I could feel its pure animal strenght. I was trying to get away from it but it kept pushing me forward and I didn't wanna upset the bear so I followed with him.       
The bear was laying on his back and.. somehow he spoke to me. I can't remember what he said but he didn't move his mouth or anything. As the bear talked to me I...(I can't believe I'm typing this..) found his little red *shrugs* penis and I jerked him off until he came. After that his penis fell off. And I was going.. uuh, should this come off? Should I put it back? It looked like something that should come off. I heard in my mind that I could just leave it, a new one will grow out. Where the penis was before was just a little plastic tube, like something that the penis should be attached to.

Dreams are a representation of our subconscious, and most of the times what we dream is related to our waking life.

Interpreting dreams is to try to give the right meaning to the different symbols in our dreams (like the persons, the locations, the action itself, etc); which means not only to try to understand the dream itself, but also to make the already mentioned relation with our lives.

For the more skeptical, interpreting dreams is not a magical super-power that allow us to live our lives through understanding what our dreams means. It's purely a way to try to understand what is going on our mind ""deepest layers"". Also, the meaning of the different symbols ain't linear; in other words, there are a lot of interpretations to similar dreams/symbols; but since some dreams like ""my teeth are falling"" are common, a general meaning is given in order to get closer to understanding them.

Also, dreams are sometimes just random, and therefore interpretations are more accurate when someone had a more impressionable dream or when it's current life may be going a little bit under.

I've found this ""dream interpretation experience"" quite impressive, it feels good to understand us a little bit better and it does work!

I hope you guys find this interesting and participate, but please try to keep the posts not too long! xD

I was on a conveyer belt with a lot of other ears of corn going to be sliced up and cut into pieces. This was inside a HUGE factory, and because I didn't want to get sliced up, I got off this conveyer belt just in time. 

The guy operating the conveyer belt was mad at me, saying he was disappointed that I didn't do my duty and stay on the belt. I said ""well I can just get back on the belt, right?"" and he said something about me now being unclean. I asked if I could buy my worth, as an ear of corn I should only be worth 30 cents or so. He said alright, and for a few minutes I scrounged around and found 30 cents on the factory floor. Unfortunately, the operator double crossed me and didn't accept the deal after I gave him 30 cents. It occured to me that he probably just wanted to buy a soda, which then made me realize that I was set to probably sweeten sodas just like that one. 

Terrified of being turned into sugar, I ran out of the factory. I am not sure how I got there,  nor am I sure how I am moving at all, being a ear of corn and everything. I got outside the factory, and noticed how BIG it really is. 

This factory is about 50 levels high. But it could also have just looked huge because I was corn. Anyways, I was intercepted by the conveyer belt guy out here who told me again how disappointed in me he was, and implored me to get back to the factory. After I said no again, he held a glass with some kind of knock-out poison in it. 

I felt my consciousness fleeting and tried to get away from this guy, and decided to go to parts of the factory that I wasn't supposed to be at. I found this really deep holding cell, where at the bottom was a bunch of sheep. I also noticed that there was multiple of these holding cells lined up, but the others were too deep for me to see what was in them.

I jumped into this holding cell, falling a great distance. One of the sheep said something like ""crap, il get him"" and he braced my fall. There were about a thousand sheep in this cell, and all very relatable to me even though I was corn and they were sheep.

At this point the manager of the entire factory comes into this room and says that he is mad at all the live stock and produce, because apparently undesirable behavior is spreading through the factory. 

He grabs a pretty girl sheep and tries to pull her into another room. I then stand up and say ""YOU CAN SAY NO!"" and look around, saying ""come on everyone, YOU CAN SAY NO!"" at this point clapping and stomping at the word no. It takes about 3 times before all about 1000 sheep join in. They don't sound like sheep, mind you, and I don't sound like corn. We all sound like people. ""YOU CAN SAY NO, YOU CAN SAY NO, YOU CAN SAY NO."" 

At this point the manager drops the pretty girl sheep with a look of terror in his eyes, and slowing backs away. We fucking trample him. 

As a huge mass we move toward an open door on the other side of the door the manger was going to use. We surge in, but for some reason we all get split up so it is just a few of us in this maze and me. 

This is no ordinary maze. It has spikes shooting into the walk way, and long corridors that has giant buckets of boiling water poor on them randomly. Just imagine a video game maze of some sort. 

After about three obstacles the pressure gets to me, and I break down crying sitting on a toilet. Thinking ""god I am such a little girl!"" At which point my alarm went off and I woke up. 

TL;DR: I was an ear of corn in a factory. Got out, snuck back in, and started a revolution among the live stock and other produce.

For some reason I'm hanging out with these three obnoxious horses at their shitty apartment in the ghetto, and as I'm hugging them all goodbye a little bag of crack falls out of my pocket. 

They all see it and immediately start freaking out. 

""hey, what is that?!"" 
""oh, let me see!"" 
""I want some!"" 

They frantically grab it off the ground (I guess for a second they had hands) and they smoke the thing down to ash really rapidly, then start cutting up the ash into lines and blowing them.  As soon as the ash is gone they start bugging me to get more. 

So I did what anyone would do when some dream horses ask you for crack: I called my crack guy, who, apparently, was also Cedric the Entertainer.

So in my dream i was in some room where i could choose basically load a virtual machine snapshot (no idea how, it just *happened* in my dream)
These vm snapshots were snapshots of a localized area of earth from a point in my history. The rendering machine was a full immersion thing, where I went to sleep and popped into the vm. The area that I went to was a chunk from terre haute, the time had a few problems in it. For example, ""I""(me from inside the vm) was working on my college research project (2008-2009) but N64 was the newest gaming conosle out(1997). Also vm me knew people that I didn't meet until 2007ish. 

I also still had my phone in the vm, which let me use the internet outside the vm for doing things like, using google and downloading apps. Someone had a coke can
with a bar code on it that was ""scan to see if you win a prize!"" so i downloaded a barcode ap on my phone and scanned it. (I don't remember what it returned). 
It also let me do things like put a cursor on a point elsewhere (like point it down the street) and then ""warp"" there. I could also use it like the worldedit mod for minecraft. So it was my VM controller (presumably that device had play/pause/rewind/etc...). 

I didn't really do too much in there, I talked to a few people I knew and re-visited some places. However I definitely felt like I experienced technology that doesn't exist yet.

I was in a really cool, fashionable apartment at a party, having tons of fun with people I've never met before. I had my first kiss (I'm 20 and still haven't had one) with a really attractive guy that was vaguely familiar.           
            
All of a sudden things started to change.       
              
The modern and well-furnished apartment started to slowly deteriorate, along with the people around me. Wallpaper was peeling and guests were hunching into gross, obese, drug-ridden forms. As I realized it was happening, I also found myself becoming weaker, falling to the floor.          
                 
I look up as a sweaty, fat man sits on the sagging couch in front of me. He looks into my eyes, around the room, and then suddenly pulls out a revolver. He sticks it into the back of his mouth and pulls the trigger. The mess and matter sprayed behind his head, and somehow onto my body, was one of the most horrifyingly vivid things I have ever seen in a dream.        
               
Looking at my bloody hands, I realized that whatever was happening to those around me was also happening to me. I felt the need to purge whatever was in my body. However, I couldn't stand. So, I crawled with weak arms to the disgustingly dingy bathroom. I grabbed hold of the toilet and looked into the conveniently placed full-length mirror next to me.        
              
I was destroyed: covered in blood, left eye swollen shut. My jaw was dislocated from my face, and was hanging loose, nearly resting on my chest. The shock of my appearance caused a very real gasping and convulsing reaction out of me. The first intake of breath was what woke me up.        
                  
Waking up at 4AM, I sat, breathing raggedly, unable to fall back asleep again.

Ever since then, I've had dreams that he would come to me in.

The first, him telling me that he was fine.

The second, we hungout in a town that, to me, looked like we were in London somewhere.

So on and so forth, the only sad part is that they started to die down.

Until last night.



My dreams are extremely vivid. I don't know where I was, but I was basically in another town.

I remember..not really knowing this was a dream..but somehow I knew that where I was, I could do dream-like things. I jumped... and floated a bit.

I subconsciously knew that, if I wanted to, I could fly.

I decided to walk.

Best decision of my life.


Down the sidewalk a little.. I see Ryan. He's walking towards me. I notice it's him. I'm pretty sure I'm dreaming..

And I'm so happy that my brain has remembered what his face looks like.

I miss that face.

But he smiles like a stranger just being nice. I think, ""Shit, this is one of those dreams where it's someone who looks like someone I know"" and keep walking.

I can't take it.
I'm only 5 feet away, I turn around...start to cry and he says, ""I knew that was you!""

Of course, I spend the next bit crying and telling him how much I've missed him.

We go for a walk. He's laughing at me and my crying. I'm laughing and telling him how I can't really help it. It's going to happen every time I see him out of pure happiness. The last dream I saw him in, he laughed at me for being such a baby. Typical Ryan.

We end up walking to what seems to be his car and start driving.

Me, feeling better, start to ask loads of questions about where I am.

I am where he's ended up.

I ask about God.

He says he hasn't met him.

""So, you just showed up here? There was no one to tell you what's going to happen, where you're going, or what you can do?""

""Yeah.""

""So you've been here all this time..which is why you haven't visited me in my dreams lately? Can you hear me ask for you at night?""

He can't hear me when he's in this place and didn't know I needed him.

I remember hugging him and telling him how much I've missed him.

""I have to hug you now..because I didn't get to hug you while you were alive.""

I've felt so shitty since the day I realized that I've never even hugged him. This hug now would be the third.

All three were only in my dreams.

We sit there in his car watching people. I can't really describe the scene well enough.. but it's like they were all coming out of a ball. Casual dress though. It just seemed like a big important thing for all of them to be at.

I then realize how long I've been with him and ask, ""What if I'm here because I died? Is anyone going to come and tell me? Am I just going to slowly find out by how long I'm here?""

I don't feel scared. In my dreams where I die, I'm never scared.. I have Ryan to hangout with.

The only thought that passes my mind is how I'll miss everyone as he says, ""I'm not sure.""

I remember hugging him again. Soaking in his arms and missing him even though he's there.. and I wake up.

At any rate the dream was a bit disturbing. I'm hoping that by sharing this dream, I might be able to think about something else. So.... here it is.

I am a war prisoner. I do not know who my captors are, nor do I have a clue what war caused my incarceration. My leg is broken so that I cannot run. I am malnourished and weak.
I'm sitting on a stool in a large barren field, with a mobile computer station. This is how they communicate with me. They tell me I am to hit the button when I see something drop into one of the five gaping pits some distance in front of me. The things I am counting are not revealed to me until I see them. Hanging from cranes, suspended above the pits are very large shipping crates. They are opened remotely and objects begin to fall. The objects that are falling are damaged. The objects are bodies. The objects I am tasked to count are partially eaten, human bodies.

I wake up. I collect myself and go back to sleep.

I am covered in puke. They are angry with me. They have reloaded the bodies into the crates while I was ""passed out"". They demand I do it right, or they will not feed me for a long time. The crates open. I begin to press the button, but am not able to count the bodies falling from all five crates simultaneously.

I wake up again.

my nightmare started out relatively normally...i was being held hostage by terrorists (not the religious extremist kind, just assholes), and my friends and i managed to find a way out to escape. we tried hiding under a bush, but they threw a grenade at us. one of the girls said not to worry, the grenade was probably just a smoke bomb. she was wrong, it blew up into epic proportions. flames engulfed everything. i tried running to the nearest building but the door was locked, and a severed head flew through the door...i tried to open it from the broken window from the severed head but...the flames got to me. I was absolutely dead. 

Instead of waking up, I just walk to my car and decide to get a car wash...as if that never happened. I try to start my car when I'm in line for the car wash, but it doesn't start. So I put it in neutral to push it out of the line...ended up knocking over a gas pump and bumping into a guy. I apologize to him and put the gas pump back on its handle. the guy looks at me, horrified, and runs away. 

then i see this really great forest with some sweet bike paths on which i can take my mountain bike. i start riding through this nice forest, and then i see this HUGE hill. i feel 100% compelled to climb it. then i remember the grenade, and the fire. i am obviously dead. this is why i couldn't drive my car, and why i got a strange look from the guy (probably because he just saw the gas pump being put back on its own). 

i walk to the top of the hill, and it's beautiful - everything i like. there is a ski lift and perfect powder snow patches, but also tall green grasses and exotic flowers, existing side by side. soon i see some people running towards me. it's my grandparents, who had died several years ago. they were so happy and welcoming and were glad i could join them. i said that's all well and good, but i want to see my parents. my grandmother said ""ah"", in a sad disappointed way. 

suddenly, i'm sitting on the futon in my apartment. my parents are pacing back and forth, wondering where i am and why my cell phone is dead. i realize they don't know what's happened. i try to talk to them, to tell them that i had died but it was okay and i was in the room with them...but they couldn't see or hear me. i go up to my dad and try and get his attention while he's pacing. eventually i scream ""DAD!!!!!"" in his face. he stops and squints at me. he holds out the palm of his hand, looking very stern. i know immediately what to do. i trace a ""D"" in his palm. He nods, still looking stern. I trace a ""E"". He nods. I trace an ""A"". He turns his palm into a fist and starts screaming ""NO! NO! THIS IS IMPOSSI-""

...and then I woke up. It was horrific waking up from that. Everything was frightening and I had the sinking feeling that something horrible was going to happen. I then had a panic attack (I have anxiety issues so this happens every so often) and kept repeating ""I was supposed to wake up after I died...why didn't I wake up...I wasn't supposed to see that..."" It was all very creepy. 

Any advice or interpretations you guys might have would be great, since I'm still pretty shocked over this whole thing. 

TL;DR: I dreamt that I died, but didn't wake up. Instead I climbed a tall hill and met some of my dead relatives. I wanted to go back home, so I met my parents and had to get their attention without being alive.

Yesterday she spoke to me for the first time.,18,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1fmyuq/ive_been_seeing_a_girl_in_my_dreams_whom_i_have/,"As the title suggests, I've been having instances for about 3 months every 2-3 weeks, where I see a girl with red hair, often very dark-colored lipstick, and shifting eye-colors in random dreams-regardless of their setting. Now when I say shifting eye-colors I don't mean like before my eyes color gradient shifting, but with each different night I see her she has a different hue like brown, yellow, or even as far as purple.

For reference, she's roughly the same height as me and has a facial structure similar to [Dodger](http://25.media.tumblr.com/16866df352792a6ebe9551af10194b54/tumblr_meuc7n5un31qdkff7o1_500.png), but she wears very punk-like clothing, kind of similar to [the 'Mechromancer'](http://i1.cdnds.net/12/15/618x348/gaming_borderlands_2_mechromancer.jpg) from Borderlands 2(disregard the robot stuff.

Tonight however, I had a dream where she decided to speak to me for the first time since she manifested herself. 

It took place in a bar-like setting, with a stage up front and some bizarrely shaped performer doing some strange act involving a cage. After a while of me sitting there watching it, I spot her ominously walking across the room from me carrying a small dessert in her hands. Now when I spot her from across the room, I'm somehow transfixed on just what the hell she's doing there, like really contemplating what meaning she's brought to this place. Now when this happens, she spots me too, and I make a slight smile at her for some reason I still can't comprehend. She smiles back, and I turn around to resume my business with some unknown figure I still can't remember even now.

A few minutes pass by, and I turn around to see her walking towards me very briskly, with a strange mixture of what seems to be both confidence and apprehensiveness, with the same strange treat still in her hands. When she arrives at the table, she has her back turned to me, acting as if she has no idea I'm even there, in a strangely flirtatious way. When she finally turns around to acknowledge me, she smiles, does a small giggle, and then with a small twinge of relief says to me...

""Hi.""

And then I woke up...

It's a loaded question. If you say “no” you ignore the many dreams that appear to accurately predict the future. If you say “yes,” the next question begs to be asked: How? Some people might phrase the questions as, What the hell have you been smoking?

We love tough questions here at /r/dreams and invite the community to weigh in with their experiences and opinions in the comments.

To kick off the discussion, two experienced dream interpreters – Archer'sAdvice and RadOwl – give their opinions on whether dreams can predict the future. The short answer from both of them is “yes,” but for different reasons. First up is Archer; his reply is next. [RadOwl](/u/RadOwl) gives his opinion in the comments [direct link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16ybgn/can_dreams_predict_the_future/c80hgo7).

____

From [Archer](/u/archersadvice):

Do dreams predict the future? Yes, of course they do! Not all dreams are prophetic, but most of the ones that you've heard about are. Dreams are direct messages to us from God. If you are Jewish or Muslim or Christian, your religious scriptures will tell you this. (If you are atheist, “No”, I cannot prove it to you.) Every dream that is interpreted in the Christian Bible is interpreted by a devoutly religious person. The dreams are ALWAYS messages from God. Some of the messages are prophetic, most notably, Joseph’s interpretation of the dream of Pharoh (7 years of wealth followed by 7 years of famine). So if you are a person of faith, you can definitely have faith in prophetic dreams.

How about now, do people have prophetic dreams today? Yes, they do. But, not commonly. Not often. And, seldom privately. The purpose of the prophecy is to communicate an important message from God. So the prophetic message is probably NOT going to be “your car will not start tomorrow”.

Many ambitious goals begin with a real dream. We even use the word dream to mean goal, as in “I dream of becoming a doctor”. But the origin of this usage is being led to action by real, actual dreams.
Prathia Hall had a real dream about rebuilding her church that had recently been burned down. Martin Luther King Jr. heard her talk about it and built her “I have a dream!” speech into the defining moment of the civil rights movement. He gave his famous speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and he only mentioned the dream because of an artist that often dreamed and heard the voice of God, Mahalia Jackson. In the middle of Dr. King’s speech, she said loudly said to him “Tell them about the dream, Martin!” Watch the film footage and you’ll see Dr. King’s speech come alive at the exact moment that he leaves his scripted notes and begins to talk about his dream and says “I have dream!”.

So yes, some dreams are prophetic and tell us important information about the future. But many dreams are just personal, about helping us work out internal conflicts. (More about these ‘weird’ dreams in a future installment). And some dreams are just gibberish, a collection of random thoughts and exciting television moments crammed together into a meaningless series of images (watch TV for a few moments, then think about your thoughts while watching … mostly meaningless entertainment).

So how do you know if your dream is prophetic? That’s what dream interpreters are for! We can interpret your dream from God language to people language. When interpreted correctly, the dream message is instantly recognizable, and no longer a mystery. You are not able to interpret prophetic dreams on your own. But you will know that the dream is powerful. It will repeat. It will give you headaches or wake you up at night. It will trouble you. You may not realize it is a prophetic dream, but you WILL know that it is an important dream.
What about people who say, “I dreamed that Uncle Jim was in a car wreck and the next day, I found out he was in a car wreck!” These are not prophetic dreams, nor are they particularly messages from God. I cannot really explain them in any modern scientific way, and I have been given no special knowledge about these dreams. But my speculation is that these are occasionally real and result from some sort of psychic energy or thought transference that I do not know about.

BUT, I also speculate that this is very widely OVER reported. In the same way that every amazing thing that happens is OVER reported as having happened to your aunt, I suspect that these types of precognition dreams DO happen, but not very often. (I believe that there is life in the universe besides on earth, but I also believe that 99+% of UFO reports are “not real”.) I have never known a dream interpreter who can find any meaning or value in this type of sensationalized precognitive dream.

So, can dreams predict the future? Yes, they can. Can I use this information about the future? Probably yes, in a very directed way, if your dream is properly interpreted.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,1358889341.0,,,True,t3_16ybgn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16ybgn/can_dreams_predict_the_future/,

I was living with Beth, and we went to check out this new house. It was a beautiful corner row house, in what I believe to be Brooklyn. It had tall windows and was always well lit. We took in a roommate, who was a single mother of a newborn child. I had acclimated myself with my new surroundings. However, I woke up one morning and I could not recall where I was (upon waking up in real life, it was the same row house, but I could not recall it in my dream.) I was frightened and embarassed that I did not realize where I was. I told Beth that I couldn't remember anything from the past month or so. Also, I could not find my cell phone, and I couldn't call my parents to tell the what happened. When I left the house, nothing was recognizeable, even though it was the same neighborhood and city that I remembered before I lost my memory. I had some very dreamy experiences. One of them involved parkour, where I was lightly jumping around stones and benches in the city, kind of floating. At one point in my dream, Beth and I went to see a new Coen Bros.  flick about a man that is studying a gene that makes people lose there memory, and they can only remember a weeks worth of experience. Brad Pitt, the main character, was in this relationship with a woman, and he was gaining all this progress on his research. I can still see the sketches he was working on in the film. After seven days, in the film, Brad Pitt's memory kind of resets and he becomes this totally different character. He abandones his girlfriend and immediatly has a new one. He apparently suffers from the same condition he is researching. After that, the plot got CRAZY metaphysical. I can't even describe what went on, but it was amazing. It was like people posessed this ability to conciously switch there entire being. All of there interests and emotions would completely change. After the movie, Beth and I were leaving, and this film obviously had a profound effect on my memory loss. At this point I did some more dreamy things. I raced a bunch of people down this huge slide. I was on my feet, and you had to scrape your shoes to slow down. It was kind of like snowboarding, but with less control. Throughout the entire dream, I would get lost and have to take these winding underground escalators to get to where I needed to be, but then I wouldn't remember where I lived. Beth and I decided to go to this book store/bizarre to find some books to research my condition. I didn't want the book we found, but I did purchase some really good loose teas. They tasted delicious. Then there was this small counter and a man was standing behind it. There were different types of incense in his stand, and also a couple of things marketed as ""lucid dreaming"" enhancers. I asked about all of them. With the last one, he said ""this is my personal favorite. You hang it around your bed post. Then he said the same thing in Spanish, but mentioned that he can only speak Spanish when he is dreaming. I realized that I was dreaming and I immediately fell back into a weightlessness of darkness. I woke up in a fright, still in my dream. I felt my pockets and I had finally found my phone! Throughout my whole dream, I had been looking for my phone. Upon realizing it was all a dream, I walked into my new roommates room, and she and Beth were playing with the baby. I told Beth that I had just had a dream that lasted an entire week and I couldn't remember anything in the dream. I broke down and started sobbing uncontrolably. I was then driving across the Brooklyn bridge when my alarm went off in real life.

tl;dr I had a dream within a dream that lasted a week and now my day is all fucked up. ",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_m8ptd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/m8ptd/i_dreamt_for_a_week_last_night/,

There is a Tl:dr at the end for you lazy ones out there:


Starts out in a friends Parents House- We are all eating, for some reason I'm trying to find an image on my friends iPhone of 2001 A Space Odyssey to have spray painted on my body by this chick Elena, who happens to be making some of the most beautiful body paintings I've ever seen, but in the meantime my friends from montreal are eating all the food. So- I try and ask for scraps but nay- they ignore me... 

Suddenly we hear the call- We all have to leave because someone they know just died. So we all start leaving the house, and I'm looking for my things... I get this impression that the whole time my brother has been pushing me around and bothering me- My parents run into us and I mention that my brother Michael has been pushing me around the whole time- I tell him to fuck off which he suddenly does : He laughs and runs away to chill with his other friends.

 I exit the house, outside it is nighttime and raining, and we all gather as we watch someone turning the key into one out of about 25 different lock mechanisms on some sort of panel to the right of the entrance to this gigantic modern mansion, and then I realize that I must enter MY key to the left side and everyone is waiting! I return to the inside of the house and discover that my brother has forgotten his jacket. I grab it and my key simultaneously  somehow but it seems as though Ive become extremely drunk upon trying to find my way out. At some point I fall and hurt either my leg and/or my hip. Once outside again, I place the jacket in the middle of the driveway to the house, which is hard for him to see because now its dark blue outside and its raining hard core- I return to left side where my brother taunts me as I try and find the lock and turn the key. I manage to! I manage to get to my car that is waiting for me, inside are my mom and dad. 

But wait!

 Just maybe five feet away from the back right door of the car are my dad's shoes laying on the lawn- My dad mentions ""Oh I've forgotten my shoes,"" and I think 'No Matter, I'll just stretch and grab them for him'... My mom begins to back up the car, but I protest, still reaching for them to say ""Its okay I got em-"" She ignores me, ""Its okay I'll get them!"" I protest! My dad protests too. Suddenly she starts to drive over them, and I retract back inside the car and close the door to avoid breaking it, and I look at my mom and think- 'What is she doing?' I notice that now we are in a graveyard- (I suppose it had been a graveyard the whole time but it just got bright enough to notice!) I look back at my Mom and realize there's something very wrong with her driving. Suddenly we swerve to the left and begin our downward descent into some GIANT PIT- of course we had gained some momentum forward from the car so our motion is somewhat of a whirlpool- the first time we hit- SMASH I hit my head hard! From this point on in the dream my head is in the worst pain I have ever felt. 

We seem to stop so I'm relieved and we all sort of chuckle, but it isnt over.. we keep tumbling and my mom starts laughing- I figure everything must be reletively okay since she is laughing and she can see though I cannot. We tumble deeper and deeper in this whirlwind and she stops to interject: ""Are you wearing your seatbelt?"" NO! I say- but in my mind think 'I was trying to get my dads shoes!' We keep on falling and smashing into rocks and at this point I have absolutely no sense of direction. It is a huge mess! We continue our falling. Its so dark I cant see anything and we've tumbled so much I dont know if I'm dead, were still falling or if we've stopped completely, one thing is for sure: I cant really sense anything except the memory of my self.

I seem to wake up and again me and my mother and father are travelling in this shiny black vehicle with beige interior. I realize, this is not okay, we've all been badely hurt and despite the fact that we are still on some sort of highway/road we all need help: So I call 911 from my cellphone, for some reason the Police answers with this long ridiculous informative update about updates to their system and to please be patient with the new bullshit and I scream at him to SHut the FUCK UP and Listen! ""We are at the cemetary, we have just fallen into a pit- we need help right away because we are all badly injured-"" Suddenly, my mom swerves again and this time we sorta just bounce into a ditch but I see her go flying out the window of her door over to near a pond- the car flips a bit, but as soon as it's still I run to the side of the pond where I see her slipping through the mud into the pond- I look back quickly where my dad is sitting on the side completely dazed and just out of this word- he mutters something inaudible.

I run over to my mom where i see here slip into the darkness of the water- FUCK! I try and see where exactly i should dive to get her but its impossible to see so I just jump in... I manage to grab her legs and I slowly pull the rest of her body toward me- to my relief shes still holding her breath or something and when I lift her head out of the water but she's too heavy and just gargles water. I have soo much goddamn trouble and my head feels like its been broken that I just keep struggling on but I think to myself ""My mom just had a Stroke!... 


Suddenly I wake up again, 'Holy Shit' I think: It's just a dream. But wait a second, my head is in even more pain then before. I lift my face out of the pillow and sure enough I find blood covering some beautiful sheets. It doesnt seem unnatural at the time but I happen to be in a beautiful loft in Downtown or Westmount Montreal. Im tripping balls, my head is bleeding everywhere and I can't move the right side of my hip/leg mostly. I think; Oh this stupid hip- its been bothering me for a while and now its really fucked up Ill have to get a new one and I'll be doomed to bad hips the rest of life till Im an old geezer in an old age home. I manage to get up and hobble my way to the entrance of my luxurious room all the while screaming: Help- HELP HELP HELP- (This reminds me of all the times that we crashed our car- I screamed a blood curdling scream of doom)

 As I make it to the entrance of the room, outside of which is a luxurious kitchen, I see the shadow of someone in a bathrobe coming towards me; THANK THE LORD I""M SAVED&gt; It turns out to be BILL FUCKING MURRAY. This isnt that strange to me, I just tell him: My head is badly hurt- I need to go to the Hospital: he sorta hops over to the top of my bed and I sit down on the end of it- holding my skull. He says: No it's just the hangover from last night dont worry about it. I frown, stick my fingers into my hair, feel the blood- look at my fingers: see the blood. ""Dude I have to go to the Hospital!"" At this point shit kinda gets weird when Dakota Fanning as a child comes into the room and sits between me and Bill Murray... again I say ""I have to go to the Hospital my head is bleeding!!"" Bill says something dismissive again and then I see Dakota bury her face into her hands. she starts to cry. This is the first time I laugh: ""Oh don't cry- its okay, Im not gonna die!"" 

I get up again and Bill is eating some delicious pastries like donuts/timbits/other things from a silver platter on a roomservice table next to the bed. At this point I look outside and I see the two Trade Center towers and the view in between them is of a glowing sky (sunrise) and hazy Montreal below. I turn to Bill and I pick up some pastries, throw them in a smaller platter- He smiles while I say ""How's this, We can go to Hospital and take the wonderful pastries with us!"" Again he dismisses my need to go to the hospital and I begin to really freak the fuck out, I think : ""I dont want to Die!"" (I begin to believe that I'm losing blood from my brain extremely fast, since everything is so fucked up and my mobility is wack- and I have a blood clot in the brain.) 

Like Dakota Fanning previously I begin to cry. At this point he really laughs at me and says"" your Freaking out man just take it easy""- (I've never seen such a Disheveled looking Bill Murray laugh like that before...) Suddenly the worst ringing begins- like the one on 2001 a Space Odyssey, and yes- it hurts like hell. Not just my ear, which feels like it's eardrum is about to burst, but my head too! (Definite sign of stroke right?) I tell Bill Murray and he laughs again and continues to eat his sweets and now even Dakota Fannind doesn't believe me. FUCKERS!! So much Rage towards these incompetent assholes.

 I decide to take action and I pick up a phone to call 911 again. This time though, the buttons on the phone seem to be sort of abstract; melted into each other or a mixed design, so I take a while to find the 9. I remember the TED talk where the woman describes her experience with a Stroke being similar. Oh god- at least I can call the cops. I manage to get a one but then I notice that Bill Murray is in the kitchen with me, and he has just used another phone to hang up/disconnect the line. I realize then that he would like to see me die, and I just freak the shit out of my soul and sort of try again on the phone half heartedly. His serious smirk gets even more grim.

FINALLY, after all this horrible torture, I wake up in Real Life. Its only been two and a half hours of sleep so maximum 1-2 REM sessions.

Tl:Dr Experienced shitloads of physical pain while watching my parents about to die twice- then woke up (in another dream) to the experience of having a stroke- tried to get Bill fucking Murray to help me but he just laughed and when I tried to call the cops he kept disconnecting the line like the disheveled Bastard that he is (was).",,False,,t5_2qmbx,True,,,True,t3_ixu1l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ixu1l/horrific_beyond_comprehension_starring_bill/,

The drive was crazy- everyone on the roads was driving very dangerously; there were lots of side-swipes and fender benders all over the place. In the end my friend and I get t-boned by a truck, end up rolling down a hill only to conveniently land in the parking lot of the movie theater we wanted to go to. 

So we get out of the car and go into the theater. The exterior was completely normal like any strip mall movie theater in America, but the interior was like a classic Victorian style bed &amp; breakfast- all vintage woodwork, well maintained but all still very old and dark.

We go up to the front counter behind which was a woman from whom we bought our tickets. She was quite old and worn down looking, like someone who you can tell has smoked 2+ packs a day for the past 60 years; she wore a simple period dress and had her hair up in a small beehive.

After purchasing our tickets we went into the theater it's self. I don't recall what the movie was at all, but I don't think we were paying much attention to it. We are the only two people in the entire theater.

Here's where it starts to get interesting.

My friend and I decide we'd rather watch the movie from the balcony, so we leave the theater hall and go back out to find the balcony. We begin walking around the building, but can't seem to find our way. We would walk up some stairs, turn a corner, and find another staircase going straight back downstairs with nothing on the landing up top. We would find a hallway, but it would contain absolutely nothing. We'd find doors, but they either wouldn't open or simply didn't lead anywhere.

Eventually we walked up a flight of stairs, turned left and found ourselves on a landing with a banister perhaps 4 feet off the ground bordering another hallway (like [this](http://i.imgur.com/tEwUw.png) . On the other side of the banister, in the other hallway, was a stretcher. As we approached it we realized it was a old man (a corpse) covered in a sheet with it's head exposed.

Suddenly we see the old woman coming down the lower hallway. When she got to us we asked her how to get to the balcony. I don't remember the conversation exactly, but her response was something to the effect of 'This isn't a normal theater, so you will have some difficulty finding it.' She then began to roll the corpse away, out of sight down the hallway.

So now my friend and I decided that this place was creepy as hell and we didn't really want to be here anymore; we decided to leave. We walked back downstairs and were able to find the exit fairly easily. The exit of the building was modern - a set of double glass doors with a small entry/exit room followed by another set of glass doors like you'd find on most retail/restaraunts these days. I could see the parking lot through the doors.

We exited the first set of doors into the entry/exit room, anxious to leave. Then I opened the second door to go outside... only to find that once you opened the second set of doors it simply put you back into the entry/exit room as if you had just walked through the first set again.

We turned around. There, behind the first set of doors, standing in the lobby was the old woman. No expression on her face, just staring at us. 

It was at this point that I realized we had died in the car accident, and this is where we would be for the rest of eternity.

 I was in the shopping mall and needed to use the bathroom, as i entered the stall all of the lights went out. The next thing i new i was on an operating table. I could see scalpels and knives on the tables next to me and I had a white towel over my chest. Out of the shadows comes a man with a black stubble and a rather crazy look but not completely insane looking. He walks behind me and whispers in my ear "" you thought i was going to kill you, Ohhh no, that would be too easy. What i did was much more fun "" he is now right in front of me and he pulls off the white towel. Where my abs were, are now 6 pieces of glass stitched into my skin. I can literally see my organs. He laughed at me. "" you see this glass, "" he says tapping it "" its going to kill you, very ,very ,very slowly"". "" but you see i am not the best at stitching, and some of them are rather loose, so one slip or trip will kill you "" At this point is was becoming hard to breath [ this was also probably because when i have nightmares i stop breathing ]. Everything fades to black again and I am now in the same mall as i was before. I run up to any person i can telling them about the crazy man who did this to me but even though he is right next to me no one believes me at all. I run around the whole shopping center shouting it out but still no one cares. Except one person. I see one of the check out attendants has been watching me the whole time and i run over to him. i tell him the whole story and show him my chest.

They're so nice when I'm in them, but afterwards I always feel really empty and strange.


 #1


I was getting married to a girl from one of my classes at University and the wedding was actually there. We slowly walked down the path to the altar, but we stopped to put on a puppet show. And then all of a sudden we were getting married. As soon as we said I Do everyone ran away in every direction and I was alone.


So, #2. Last night.


I dreamed that I was at Uni, but it wasn't my real University, it was a strange one. I had met this girl (the dream didn't include the meeting) and we were choosing a place to eat. It was like this massive long hall with banquets set out on every table. Anyway we sat and ate and talked and kissed and it was nice. Then I think we had sex. The sex itself is never part of the dream, but after it ""happens"" you know. So I was walking her home and she was saying that she had to leave tomorrow to go to Croatia. Then we decided, to hell with it, she could get a later flight and we went to the beach together. I think there was more sex. Then it was the next morning and she had to leave and we had this really long, passionate kiss. And then she left, and I saw a noose and some hanging feet. I think they were hers. Then I woke up.

The mosque was located in a strip mall, and its Imam looked more like a Yogi. He sat cross-legged and hovered a few feet from the floor.

I was supposed to bring my Koran with me. The problem was, I never *owned* a Koran. This is pretty typical of me. I'm rarely prepared for anything.

I told my girlfriend that I ""forgot"" the holy book, and left to ""retrieve"" it from my apartment. After a long search on foot through the city, I finally found a shop that sold Korans.

All the Korans in the mosque had three names written on the flysheet. I wasn't sure what the three names represented, but I knew I had to have three names on *my* flysheet. But I didn't have a marker. So I scoured the city for a shop that sold markers. By that time I was completely lost.

As I attempted to retrace my steps back to the Mosque, I wondered what, approximately, the three names on the flysheet represented. I wasn't able to figure it out, so I just scribbled my dad's name, my grandpa's name, and a third name that I can't recall.

It was late now, and I still hadn't found the Mosque, so I asked people on the street for directions.

""Can you tell me how to get to the Mosque?""

""The Mosque? What's the Mosque?""

""It's like a church...""

""You mean where the brown people go?""

On my way back to the Mosque, I thought of lies I could tell the Imam. Then I pondered the moral implications of lying to a holy man. Would he know I was lying? What if God was real? Should I just tell the Imam and my girlfriend the truth?

Background: I've been sick all day and had this nightmare during an hour-long nap in mid-day. I have an eight-year-old son.

So ...*in the dream, I was standing in a wood-paneled room with my son and some other guy that I don't recognize. The guy is tied to a heavy Captain America shield for some reason. I have a flamethrower pointed at him, and my son is extracting the guy's blood with a syringe. My son squirts the blood onto a metal plate and I burn it with the hot tip of my flamethrower. No reaction. Then I tie the guy to the couch and my son helps me tie myself to the shield. He extracts my blood, squirts it on a metal plate, and tests it in the same way. No reaction.*

*Next I test my son's blood. For some reason I don't tie him to the shield. He just gets to sit on the couch next to the other guy, who is strangely quiet. I drip some of his blood onto the shield and burn it. The blood shrieks and tries to run away from the flame. He's infected with the Thing.*

*He starts crying. I start crying. He says ""Dad what does it mean?"" I say, ""I really want to hug you right now but I can't,"" and we're both crying hard now. I say, ""Honestly, everybody who has died from this has died because someone else killed them when they found out they were infected. Maybe you won't die, OK?""* 

*My son puts on his bravest face and wipes his wet cheeks. ""Okay, Dad,"" he manages to say. But I know that sooner or later, either he will die, or I will have to kill him.*

Then I woke up and immediately started crying. I can't even remember having a worse nightmare.

Seriously.,18,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1brist/translate_this_and_youll_blow_my_mind_seriously/,"Had this dream when I was in my early-mid twenties. I've never been able to forget it... Outside perspective always appreciated. Apologies for the wall of text. Occasionally I'm able to remember a lot about my dreams... This one is one of those.

A young man around my own age, that I've never seen before (probably my animus), and I are walking around a shopping plaza. We encounter an old man that appears to be homeless. After a brief conversation, we suspect that the old man suffers from dementia or the like. We ask if he has somewhere to go, or is there someone we can call...

That is when he realizes that we suspect he is homeless. His dirty, weathered face breaks into a grin and he tells us that he isn't homeless, that he actually lives in a house not too far away, and he is touched by our concern. He says that young people don't pay much attention to him anymore and asks if we will follow him home; he wants to cook us dinner.

I am pretty sure this is a really bad idea. My friend, however, takes the old man up on his invitation and ropes me into going along. While we are walking, my friend tries to sooth my nerves by telling me that the old man probably lives in a cardboard box under a bridge and the sooner we find out, the sooner we can get him somewhere safe and be on our way.

The old man's house is a rundown, one-story affair that the word ""neglected"" does not adequately describe. Upon our arrival, the old man invites us in and quickly disappears inside...

Looking through the door... All I can see is darkness. Pitch black. My friend goes inside and I follow him. Once we enter, a light comes on in the hallway... And that's when this dream takes a turn for the weird.

The hallway is a single, narrow corridor that stretches on _forever._ Yes. Literally. Forever. A thousand doors... Both sides of the hallway, one right next to the other, all closed. The old man is nowhere to be seen. Both my friend and I panic, turn to the door we came through, and jiggle the knob. It's locked from the outside.

And so we randomly start opening doors, looking for the old man. It's like being in Wonderland, a surrealist painting, and a myriad of parallel dimensions all at the same time. A room where everything is upside down. A room that is another corridor, only the passageways lead to places they shouldn't... Namely, a staircase that stretches upward from the ceiling. 

We stumble upon a room that looks a bit more normal than the rest. There is a simple bed with dirty sheets, covered furniture, refuse, and something _stinks._ Is this the old man's bedroom? What is that smell?

And so my friend and I start poking around the room. I discover a dismembered prostitute under the bed, a syringe still sticking from her arm. Did the old man kill her? 

Footsteps. Oh shit... The old man is coming... Hide. My friend pulls me into a dark closet and we listen, holding our breath, as the old man walks into the room, pauses, then leaves. Once the sound of footsteps has faded into the distance, my friend flips on the closet light.

The closet is a warehouse, filled with shelves that start at the floor and end at the ceiling. Each shelf is filled with identical, white, cardboard boxes. My friend starts to pull boxes off the shelf and open them; I do the same.

The boxes appear empty... But they aren't. Each box contains a thousand memories. Memories of the creation of the universe... Memories of watching every child ever born breathe it's first breath... Memories of murder. Memories of every beautiful and ugly moment that has ever unfolded on this planet.

And that's when I realize that the old man is God... That he observed humanity until our cruelty drove mad. So he packed all his memories away in boxes and filed them away in the most unsuspecting of places.

Sometimes, like when he found the dismembered prostitute stuffed in a trashcan, he remembers that he is God. He picked her up, piece by piece, and carried her home, thinking that he would fix her.

Once he returned home, he forgot who he was again...",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_1brist,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1brist/translate_this_and_youll_blow_my_mind_seriously/,

There have been about a dozen occasions now when, if I haven't talked to someone close to me in a while, I'll start having dreams about them.  These dreams are unlike my usual dreams.  When I talk to people, our mouths don't move, as though we're communicating telepathically.  The other person tends to show up unexpectedly.  When I wake up, I usually can't remember the conversation, but every other detail of the dream remains clear.  Sometimes I can remember pieces of what I said, but not what the other person said.  After I start having these dreams, the person I've been ""talking to"" ends up contacting me suddenly, saying that they just feel like they need to get in touch with me.
The most bizarre of these dreams are the most recent, about a friend of mine.  We went through some things and didn't talk for about a year and a half.  Suddenly, he started showing up in my dreams.  I would ask him what he was doing there, but then the rest of the conversation is a blank.  One night, I dreamed that I was alone in a room with someone.  At the time, I knew who this person was, and I was saying some pretty strange things to them.  I don't remember all of it, but I remember saying, ""People can communicate in dreams.  Most people do, but don't remember it when they wake up.""  I ended the dream by saying, ""Let me know if you remember this conversation.""  I'm sure the person talked back to me, but I have no recollection of who it was, what they said, what their voice sounds like, absolutely nothing.  If this is actually happening, I believe it was my friend, whom I was talking about.  He ended up talking to me the next day, after a year and a half of zero communication.
While I have difficulty remembering dialog, I am always left with distinct feelings and impressions when I wake.  After I have these dreams, I tend to feel disturbed, like I know the information is there...I just can't retrieve it.
After I got back in touch with my friend, we were okay for a while, but then we had more problems and haven't been talking for the past six months.  For the past month, he's been intruding upon all of my dreams like before, only now when I see him, I become aware of the fact that I'm probably dreaming (I usually am unaware), and this realization causes me to wake up.  For example, I was dreaming that my roommate and I were throwing a house party, and I went to downstairs.  I saw him there, and I stopped, thinking, ""Wait.  Why is he here?  Oh my god, this is a dream.""  Then the house started to flood, and the water was carrying away the dream.  My friend reached out to me, saying he could anchor me there if I held on.  I freaked out and ended up disappearing and reappearing in a new place, where I once again forgot I was dreaming.
The very last one I had was about three nights ago.  I often dream about this isolated beach where I go to be alone.  I don't know how to describe it other than: I become a part of the ocean and ride the waves, not thinking, just being part of the sea.  I've been having these dreams for years, and I'm always alone there.  This time, I was startled to find that my friend was standing on the shore, watching me.  I was upset to see him, because this place felt personal to me.  I asked, ""How do you keep finding me?""  And, of course, I can't remember a word of what he said.  But the last thing I said before the water washed my dream away was, ""The rules of time and space do not apply here.""
I don't care if you call me crazy, because at this point I almost think I must be.  Does anybody have any similar experiences?  Anything helpful to say at all?

Usually I have pretty vivid dreams to begin with, but when I described this to my friend she couldn’t believe that it even happened it was so extreme.
It started when my dad lost his job, and the world felt as if it was falling apart. We had to move into a home with terrible conditions, and things that seemed “normal” in this dream were extremely unusual. Terrorists would constantly stop by and inspect the housing, and things nearby often got bombed because it was in such a horrible area. One day, someone set the house on fire. I was screaming when my room set on fire and my window crashed, and my family was in a panic. My dad kept screaming “no air, no air, get air!” and I was freaking out and all the sudden everything went black.


I realized that what I had was a dream and I thought this was my body waking me up, but no, not quite. I tried “standing up” but my body was paralyzed. All of the sudden, I saw myself face to face with not a man, but multiple spirits. I was sitting on the clouds, and the stars and the moon were talking to me. The cloud moved over to the crescent-shaped moon and had me sit on his “lap” so it was a comfortable seat while they explained to me what was happening. I was crying, and nervous, when all the sudden I heard a dark voice telling me I was no longer a human. He explained to me that everyone was set out to have a plan in life, and my plan was to die that night. It didn’t make sense at first, but he explained how there was no actual “god” controlling humans, they make decisions for their own and that leads them onto a path of good or bad. He also explained to me how I could’ve changed what happened, and how the path my dad went down caused all of this. I felt guilty and only imagined what people might think of me not being alive on earth. This deep voice talked to me again and said “Any questions?” I said “Not a question, but I would like to explore the universe.”


My wish, granted, gave me a whole new set of ideas I never knew the human brain could even process. I saw a parallel universe, where people were having the same conversations as my friends and I did, except they were 24 hours ahead. I saw my friends and family crying over my death, when my brother and father made it out safe. I realized that humans and animals definitely weren’t the only life in the universe, that’s just what seems normal to us. I saw faces of what were called creatures that I’d never be able to process on my own, which was what scared me. They just weren’t something you’d be able to imagine. It’s hard to explain but they weren’t something would think of naturally.


After a long day of searching the universe, I came back to the crescent seat and these spirits told me in unison “You will now be reincarnated.” Before I even had the time to ask, I got sucked into what was a black hole. I couldn’t see anything, I could breathe normally but I couldn’t hear my own breathing. I could near other voices but not my own, which didn’t make sense to me of couse cause it was a dream. I asked, frightened, “Hello? Anybody, where am I?” A voice replied to me, sounding like it was casting from above, “you’re in the center of time Eliza.” I asked “how can I escape?” with a hesitant pause, and a sigh, the voice replied “there’s no escaping. There is no east, west, north or south. You could not find your way out of here, now or ever. Millions have been here, millions still are here, but you cannot escape. None of them can.” I started to cry, and heard my tear drops fall for miles.
All of the sudden, my body went into “shut down mode.” Everything was white. After a few moments, I woke up, in a complex situation. I was reincarnated into an eight year old girl from France going through a brain surgery, and I needed to take over her soul. Everything from my mind was supposed to vanish but whoever did the “procedure” did it wrong because in the back of my mind I remembered my past life perfectly. It turns out my soul wasn’t needed and I turned into a spirit up in heaven.


From that, I could see everything happening on earth or any other planet I wanted to explore. I saw my friends from above. My best friend was crying over a picture of us. The next night she went to a concert and I felt like I was cheering her on, and she felt my spirit with her and took notice of it. Also, I saw the boy I love flirting with another girl. I was screaming “no, please stop.” but he couldn’t here me. I watched him do what he did, and I was happy for him but I cried like crazy knowing I wasn’t there for him. I also saw my family at my funeral, and I cried over that too. I think my brain was sub cautiously trying to tell me that I don’t feel like I’m heard enough and that people pay attention to me but not enough. Maybe I’m just lonesome, I’m not sure.
The dream ended in me sitting in a rocking chair, alone, in the clouds. I had the same body and face but I was translucent. I’m still terrified because the things I saw in that dream were completely irregular thoughts and I’m trying to convince myself that I died in my sleep and must have stopped choking, hence why my dad was screaming “no air, no air, get air!”

In the dream I was in a big white room, with springs and little green plants. For some reason Gandhi was also there. I talked to him and asked him what he was doing here. I am not sure what we actually talked about but after a while he told me that lucid dreaming would be the only way to remain consciousness of your own existence after death.

He said ""Oh yes, lucid dreaming is the only way to know that you still exist after death. If you do not die while in a dream, you will just stop existing. So its very important to time your death wisely. Be extra careful not to die in an accident or die of an unexpected death"".

I got a bit upset at him and asked him how I was supposed to not die of an unexpected death, since after all that death IS unexpected.

Gandhi just told me that I was silly and then proceeded to laugh. It sounded like an old Chinese man, like the grandfather in Jackie Chan Adventures... he seemed to laugh for hours

It was brown, and in the middle of a pleasant suburban neighborhood. When looking at the house from outside, the left half was black. Not so much the color, but a void of nothingness.  Going in, the house was a bit creepy. There was a staircase directly after walking through the door, that led upstairs. At the top of the stairs was a hole in the ceiling. One of my family members would stand underneath it and cheerfully say, ""Falling UP?"" and get sucked into the void. To the left, after a bit of hall, was the edge of the hardwood floors. they jaggedly ended at the left side of the house, the void. I remember it being the scariest thing I'd ever seen. There was nothing to be seen, just darkness. There were windows with tatters of plastic sheeting and the faint sound of wind that seemed to carry past the walls of the house, as though it went on forever. 

I had this dream for years. I stopped having it for awhile, and my sister had an anxiety attack/nervous meltdown. She was about 17 at the time, and my stepmother found her journal. She read about a traumatizing experience my sister had when we were kids. Actually, the worst of it happened to her. My memory switched on and I remembered what happened. That night, I had the dream again, and the house was whole, and I didn't feel the need to go inside.

Later on, I read that a house is a representation of the self, in dreams. It fit perfectly. The repressed memory was a piece of the house missing, and when I remembered, the house was complete. Interesting the way that works.

I will say, that some dream books are BS. Some of them are as useless as magic 8 balls and attribute all symbols to love, or fortune in a superficial way. I lucked out and found one that involves interpretations from different cultures from the past, as well as different historical shrinks, and lists of puns (because sometimes dreams work that way).

Alright, so I'm on a beach, and there's like a little gazebo-type thing on the beach. And for some reason, I'm with Leela from Futurama, as well as a few friends. So, we go into the gazebo, and Leela shows us her tits. They're tiny as hell. 

So, we go out onto the beach, and there's a hotel behind us. From the balcony of the hotel, there is an army of Japanese soldiers attacking us. So, we get on to the beach and take cover. We find all of the sharp things we can find and use them as poison blow darts. We take out a large amount of the Japanese and we go into a random building. Turns out that building is a thrift store.

Leela's gone, and me and a few friends (some of which I don't know at this point) are walking around shopping, when suddenly we're in the military and we're on some sort of secret mission. The thrift store has turned into some sort of army base. I'm dressed in camo and I pick up a gun off the ground and run off over towards the hotel, where there's a pool and more Japanese attacking us. 

Suddenly, I'm at a house I used to live at. I'm sitting on the deck of our pool, and I look towards our house. In our yard, Kid Rock is standing there. He tells us that he released one of our horses and it's causing havoc in the neighborhood. We see it in the yard of our former neighbors, barking at their dog. You read that correctly, the horse was barking at the dog. So I distract Kid Rock by talking about a song he did with Snoop Dogg, and we go and retrieve the horse, which was easy.

Here's where it gets weird and I can't recall if I was dreaming or not.

I awoke suddenly and saw this bright light coming thru the openings around the black out curtains I had in my room.

I tried calling my boyfriend at the time and he wouldn't answer. So I ran out of my apartment into the hallway and there stood my neighbors and landlord. We went into my next door neighbor's apartment, which I had not been in before, and tried seeing if anything was on the news about the craziness that was going on. Next thing we know there is a bright light shining thru all of his blinds and runs out to see what's going on. I run after him, yelling for him to stop and when I reach the door to the outside, I'm immediately caught in a trance. I could no longer see my neighbor. All I could see was bright, white light, the opening to a ship, and these beings looking down at me that I can only describe as looking humanoid, but with a cow's shape of face... it was very odd.  I felt complete peace while in the trance, but knew I had to break out of it.  The hold was so strong that when I finally broke out of it, I ended up falling on my ass. I scurried inside and the next thing I know, I'm being woken up by my boyfriend.

I can't tell if it was a dream or not because everything was so vivid.

Then he said something strange: 'if you don't like it, there's the door.'

But he didn't point towards the door: he opened his window, and then a gust of wind entered. We were on top of a skyscraper, and high up. Without hesitation, I walked over there and jumped out the window, falling with my eyes closed.

But then I heard a distinct *splash*, and then suddenly I was floating, seemingly underwater. I saw a distorted vision of the sky as it shimmered underneath the waves, and then saw stars shining in a night sky. I started crying as i watched them shimmering from underneath the water, and that's how I woke up.

I had a nightmare about 4 years ago that to this day gives me chills when I think about it.  I was at my school, and health inspectors were coming around checking for some virus that was spreading really quickly.  I got called down as one of a sample of students they were going to test.  They did a few things, and then let me go.  The dream kind of jumped to the next week, and I saw the health inspectors' van back at school.  One of them saw me and brought me into the nurses office to tell me that his partner had unknowingly transfered the virus to my school, and that the kids he had tested needed to be retested.  I came up positive for the disease, but not contagious.

This was where the dream turned into a nightmare.  I was told I had 3 days left to live, and that I could feel free to come to school and everything, and that I'd feel fine until my last few hours.  Then they let me go.  The next ""three days"" in my dream started passing really quickly.  I didn't tell anyone, but I started really focusing on life, and living.  And then, on the morning of my last day alive, I woke up.  For real.  And I was convinced that I was going to die that day for about 15-20 minutes as I sat there in bed.

- I was inside a castle, searching for someone, I passed the lord of the city I was in and went into his chambers, I kept searching for that person, I walked around the upper level until I exited through a door to an outside balcony, this was a really small one and I thought of this as a dead-end.

To the point where I can remember things in great detail. 

I've had dreams of people being killed in certain areas, which I've never seen. Ever. I know they aren't places I've seen because they have landmarks that are distinctive to them. 

Fast forward a few months and even years, and I'll pass these certain places. With some of these places, I've done research on them afterwards only to find that murders or other bad occurrences have taken place there.

I've had other dreams that deal with people in my life saying certain things and wearing certain clothes, and wouldn't you know... the scenario comes up in real life. Down to a tee. Exactly what they were wearing, the exact surroundings, and exactly what they've said. 

I also have had other kinds of dreams... ones that aren't so... clear. I mean that in a way where I can still remember everything, but they are so outrageous that they can't possibly ever come true...

However, what happens in them almost seem like examples of situations in my life. I've had a set of recurring dreams for the past 2 years that involve dark figures. They're almost like shadows... but they are capable of harming others. Physically. They also have the power to assimilate with you. The striking figure with them is that they have glowing orange eyes. 

I think they are a symbol for evil. Anger, hate, revenge, bitterness. 

Anyhow, these figures they come to me in my dreams. I'm put in situations where I'm dealing with people who are part of my everyday life. Instead, these people are the figures...and they represent them.. in every sense. It's almost like... these figures are trying to make me weary of certain people. 

One of the most scary things about the figures... is that I had a dream where I fought one, and it assimilated with me. Except that we were half of each other. One of my eyes was orange, and I had black swirls around parts of my body. Almost like it was telling me to live with my problems and not fight them... but learn to keep myself in check.

I did research on these ""figures"" and found out that many people around the world have dreams of the same kind of figures. That really scared the shit out of me.

I've gone throughout my whole life not believing in the supernatural or paranormal...

But the things I've had come to me in my dreams are just too coincidental sometimes for me to just toss aside.

The hall is dark and the only light is coming from behind him.  Its like I'm seeing his shadow through the wall almost.  All he does is knock slowly, with the knocking hand about a foot away from his head.

About a month ago, I listened to the tapes my mom made of me talking about the nightmare when I was about 3 or 4.  I seemed very calm about the whole thing, and described perfectly the dream I am still having (about 2-3 times a month).  My mom said she was worried for a while, but by the time I started school I had stopped bringing it up.

I know they didn't stop (obviously), I remember trying to get the doors open when I was in high school, but I can only remember ever getting one open once.  It was the door just to the man's left and all I saw was a box, small like the size of a jack in the box and it looked like it was made of steel.  I woke up screaming that time, I've never tried another doorknob again.  Usually now, the second I realize where I am I stand perfectly still, try not to breath and wait for it to be over.

Also, I always feel like I have control of my own actions during these dreams, its not like other dreams I have that feel more like I'm acting out park of a script to a bizarre movie, if that makes sense.

I was on a commercial plane that was coming in for a landing, but I could tell we were too short.  I knew this was the end.  This is a pretty typical nightmare, I know, but what followed was not.

When we hit the ground, it seems natural that I'd wake up, but I didn't.  Everything went black and suddenly I began seeing this bright light -- small at first, but growing.  I knew I was dead and the feeling of this bright light was beyond anything I had every felt.  The light grew brighter and brighter, eventually becoming blinding and I was feeling pulled towards it.

At the climax of the light (when you would think you'd enter the next world) I woke up gasping, certain that I was now dead and somehow a ""spirit"" in my apartment.  I felt so bad for my parents to have lost a child.  I racked my mind trying to remember why I was on that plane and where I was going, which finally led me to believe it was only a dream... despite still feeling like a ghost.

I should mention that it was still pre-dawn outside when I woke up and I sleep with a sleeping mask, so the bright light wasn't from any ancillary source.

Earth has been destroyed for reasons we humans cannot remember. We did not perish however, as we were given asylum by another race of aliens which were vaguely humanoid, but far larger than any human. I remember them to be up to 15 feet tall or more, but they were a gentle and benevolent race who sought to aid us in our struggles.

Those of us who survived were allowed to live on a lush and fertile planet, similar in all aspects to Earth, down to the atmosphere, flora and even buildings. My family and I touched down on a spacecraft, and I took the first step out to behold a vast open field of green, and I knew this was indeed to be our new home.

I beheld no less than 3000 fellow humans alongside us. We truly were the last remnants of our race.

My family and I hurdled close together. We traveled in a file with the other humans, somehow knowing where to go and what our destination was. We sought to reach the top of a valley...but how were our frail and tired bodies to handle such a daunting task?

The answer lied before us. To our convenience a flight of stairs had already been established, and strangely enough it was protected on all sides by metal and fence. It reminded me of the long rectangular enclosures I had seen in zoos that allowed primates to travel from a housing area to a play area, while visitors could safely enjoy the view from a distance away. Were we the animals now? It didn't matter. The gate was open, and people were already going in.

Holding my mother's hand, we ascended the stairs. The place was cacophonous with the repeated 'clank clank clank' of hundreds of boots and feet slamming into metal steps. I gazed through the metal fence into the distance, seeing nothing but greenery and plants...and to my immense surprise, a school. It was my school, and yet it also wasn't my school. I had no idea why I felt so, but I just knew it to be true and false at once.

Without any warning, a huge being walked alongside on tree trunk-sized legs. It bent down to peer at us through the fence, and I stared at his eyes in surprise. A human! But far bigger than any human could ever be. He was a giant, easily the size of a T. rex! ""Just a little more!"" he said in a surprisingly gentle voice. We knew not who he was, nor what he wanted, but we continued to climb the stairs.

At last we left the confines of the metal caged stairs, and I entered the school.

There I learnt plenty. I learnt that there were 3 races here on this planet. We humans, the friendly giant humanoid ones, and a third unseen race that I somehow knew to be smaller than humans. But what about the giant human I saw? He fitted none of the description.

I knew I spent a great deal of time in the school and there was much more I learnt...But that knowledge is lost to me now. All I remember is that the friendly giant aliens were called B1000. It was an apt name, for there were only 1000 of them, and I also learnt they were strong and powerful beings with a noble culture.

I closed my eyes briefly, and when I opened them again, I saw a bloodbath before my eyes.

The giant human I saw earlier? He was, I dunno, a monster or a shape-shifter perhaps. For now he had morphed into a terrible form indeed. Gigantic talons capable of rending flesh off bones were his toes, he was balanced on two enormous dinosaur-like legs with immense muscles, he stretched his wings and I saw the incredible form and flesh that spoke of his ability to fly, and his head which was as big as a car, held two hungry malevolent eyes along with an enormous beak that could surely swallow me in a gulp. He was terrifying, a mix of a terror bird, the size and ferocity of a T. rex and the wings of the biggest bird-of-prey that had ever existed.

And that bastard was hungry.

I saw nothing but chaos as he charged into a crowd of frightened people and lowered his enormous head. When he raised his head again, several unfortunate victims hung from his beak, grabbed by their limbs and unable to break free. He tossed his head up letting them fly through the air before dropping into his open mouth. But he wasn't satisfied yet. He wanted to eat, and we helpless humans were on the menu.

We fled before his onslaught like sheep fleeing a voracious wolf. Somehow I was in a city, and I wanted to know why and when that occurred, but details could wait. Now I had to run. The city provided no weapons and no cover, or at least none he could not breach. Again and again he fed and ripped and gnawed, leaving a trail of blood and bones. This was impossible! Granted he was an enormous dinosaur-sized predator, but even he had limits to his stomach capacity! That was like what? His 100th human?

The screams of fear and frightened yelling was deafening, and I thought I would die. What was this happening?! We had 3000 humans. He was just ONE monster, why couldn't we win? But I wasn't about to volunteer to fight.

I heard a roar of defiance and a B1000 alien slammed into him. Yes! Help had arrived!

A group of B1000s stood on standby as the lone hero grappled with the giant bird-dino thing. He held a spear, but he was ill-matched against the monster's feral instincts. He was skilled and determined however, and possessed enough physical might to push back the monster. Neither of the giants gave way and I allowed myself a brief moment of hope.

Again and again the titans tussled for control and we weak humans simply stood nearby to watch the awesome battle unfold.

The bird monster flapped his wings and took into the air. Before the heroic B1000 could react, the bird monster slammed into his back with horrifying results. Talons tore through flesh and the beak went for his throat.

I glared at the group of B1000s watching nearby. What were they doing?! They were many, and though a single B1000 was no match, surely the whole group could take the monster down!

His flailing and moans weakened, and the B1000 succumbed at last. The monster bird stood to his full height and roared in triumph to the heavens.

Goddammit! Goddammit! He was just one! JUST ONE! Why couldn't anyone or the B1000 stop him?! But at least he was satisfied now. He swept his gaze across all of us and licked his beaks, knowing that he could easily eat any of us when he wished. Then he took off into the skies and disappeared into the clouds.

And I knew this was only the first night. Every night this scene would unfold once more, because the monster bird needs to feed daily. And I also somehow knew the B1000s numbers would dwindle slowly and surely, even though there was only one opponent.

The next day did not come....because for a strange reason, one night led to another night. There was no morning or afternoon on this planet. But this night was not dark, for I beheld hundreds of lit torches and campfires. I was in an unusual place. The terrain was rough and harsh, but lines of spirals hundreds of meters long were cut into the ground and even cliffs. Somehow we human beings had descended back to the level of tribal village people, and now there were hundreds of tents strewn all across this strange landscape.

In the center of the spiral which was hundred of meters away from me there was a commotion. Perhaps the village elder speaking? It mattered not. I cared little and hurdled in my tent with my family.

""Humph!"" The giant human appeared again and sat beside us. We gaped at him in fright and shock, but his expression was one of haughtiness and indignation, not hunger. ""Not intending to eat you.""

He didn't wear his monster bird form either, so I guess we had to take his words. My family did not intend to tempt fate however, and we hastily beat a retreat to another area as the bemused giant stared.

My family ended up in........a bread shop? I had no idea why or how, but that mattered little. There was all manners of dough, croissants and spiral cake-things throughout. I had a strange idea. I knew how to deal with the giant! And I shared this idea with my cousin. Again for reasons unexplained, I was aware that back at the camp, a man stood before the giant. He was a stranger to me, but he looked arrogant and unpleasant. I knew not what he said to the giant, only that by the end of the exchange, the giant was practically leering at him.

""You best be running little man,"" the giant snarled. ""When I turn back into a bird I will eat you.""

I do not know what happened to the man, or even what ideas I had shared with my cousin. All I knew was that the hour of feeding was fast approaching. First I needed to return to the village.

I went back to my tent and peered inside to look for supplies. When I looked out again the giant stood before me, and I sensed that he was hostile this time.

Grabbing a bench that was near my tent, I retreated into my tent and wedged the bench on the entrance, somehow foolishly hoping it could prevent the giant from reaching me. He intends to eat me now, I am sure of it.

He lowered his enormous face to the entrance of the tent, and I stared from under the bench in terror.

""We both know how this ends.""
""Yes I can wake up.""

And so I did. I took the coward's way out and woke up to escape from his wrath. It was 6.30 AM. Still a tad early, my alarm clock only rings at 6.55. And so I drifted back to sleep, and thankfully no giants disturbed me this time.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_1cgrpj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1cgrpj/epic_unusual_and_very_frightening_dream/,

Weirdest/best/happiest dream of my life. ,16,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1928v5/turtle_talks_to_me_in_a_dream_part_of_dream/,"(Sorry this is so long. It's hard to shorten it without losing something important.)

A little back story first:

A couple years back a friend was backing out of a driveway when something in the rear view mirror caught his eye. He stopped to see what it was. It was a turtle in the gutter that was trying to get out of the way of the truck. It was an aquatic turtle (western painted, to be exact) that really had no business being in a suburban neighborhood like that. It was most likely a pet someone had let go or had escaped. He picked it up so it wouldn't be left in the street to get run over. I just happened to be walking to work when my friend passed me in his truck. He pulled over and asked me if i wanted a turtle. I was totally confused, but he explained and i told him i would take the turtle and figure out what to do with it. At first, i was just going to find someone on craigslist to take it since i wasn't really prepared to take on a pet that required large aquariums and such. In the meantime, i bought some turtle food and filled up a large tupperware bin to keep him alive for a couple days. After the first day i got attached to the little guy and decided to keep him. I named him Zeus. I really bonded with this turtle. He was way more interactive and responsive than i ever imagined a turtle would be. When i would get home from work he would splash around to get my attention. I would take him out of the tank and he would hang out with me. He loved to be held and would just chill on my lap. He loved attention. He was seriously like a dog in a turtle body.  Once people found out i had a turtle, people started giving me turtles that were rescued or in situations where people couldn't take care of them properly anymore. I ended up getting multiple tanks to keep them all. While i loved all my turtles, none of them interacted with me the way Zeus did. Most didn't want to be held. They interacted with me when they wanted food, but that was about it. Zeus was different than the others. 

And now to the dream:

Nearly a year had passed since i first got Zeus. I had a dream that i was floating in a pond with my best friend i'd known since high school. We'll call her Cindy. The pond was beautiful. It was surrounded by lush vegetation. There were a few small streams that flowed in and out of the pond. We were floating in the pond on those cheap inflatable pool rafts. We were just floating there soaking up the sun. I felt totally at peace. All of a sudden, Zeus came down one of the streams and swam over to us. I was so happy to see him. He hung out for a while. He then told me (can't remember if he actually talked or if i just understood what he wanted me to know) that he had to leave, but he would come back so i shouldn't be sad that he was leaving. He floated down stream and was gone. Some time passed and just as promised, Zeus swam down stream again and said ""See, i told you i would be back. I will always come back."" This happened a few more times. While the times he was away in the dream seemed to be only minutes, in my dream i knew somehow it represented a longer time. Like months or years passed. It's hard to explain exactly. It was such a happy dream too. I just felt complete joy and peace like i've never felt before in a dream. 

I woke up and just felt amazing. It was the most beautiful dream I'd ever experienced. It was more than just the events, but the emotion i felt while dreaming. It was unlike any dream i've ever had. I was in the best mood when i woke up. I can't even describe it. I went straight to Zeus's tank and got him out to hold him.

But here is where it gets weird. 

A couple weeks later i was feeding the turtles in the morning. I noticed Zeus wasn't swimming up to get the food like he usually did. He was just kind of hanging out at the bottom and wasn't moving much. I just knew something was wrong. I felt sick to my stomach. Just the day before he was fine. I took him straight to the vet. He didn't make it that far. He died on the way on my lap. This was exactly a year to the day that i got him. (I remember this because it was my roommates birthday.)

I was absolutely devastated. I mourned for this turtle the way i would have a dog. (It's years later and i'm still getting teary eyed just typing this.) The next day i was still a mess over it. Cindy called and invited me to go on a weekend trip with her and some friends. I declined saying i wouldn't be good company since i was still so upset. She convinced me that i needed something to take my mind off it. I reluctantly agreed. We arrived at the hotel. The boys all headed off to the casino to gamble. Cindy and i decided to head to the pool. We went to walmart first to buy some floaty pool toys. We were looking for those cheap inflatable rafts, but oddly enough, walmart didn't have any. All they had were these huge inflatable turtles. Of course we got those instead. I name mine Zeus.

So there we were floating in the pool on our blow up turtles when it hits me. OH MY GOD. It's my dream. I'm floating in a pond (pool) with Cindy and Zeus. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I got an odd sense of peace as i remember zeus telling me that he would come back. He will always come back.  

It's been a couple of years now and i still miss that little guy. I currently have 9 turtles. I love them all, but they are just pets. I feed them and take care of them. They swim around and do their thing. There is no weird connection like I felt with Zeus.

I have my own theories of what that dream means, but i'd love to hear what you guys think. Sorry that was so long.

TL;DR: Got a pet turtle. Had a dream that turtle told me he had to go away but he'd always be back. He died a couple weeks later out of the blue. Experienced part of the dream in real life.

 I have a very vivid dream every week or two, and almost every one i have involves a girl, named Alice. She has been in my dreams ever since i was little (around 4-6). Every dream she's in, we remember past experiences from past dreams. The only difference is we have both grown up at the same pace, when i was a toddler, so was she, and she is the same age as me now, and her hair color slowly changed from red to black over the years (i'm almost 16 now, we are still the same age) The dreams usually go something like this. Were hanging out, talking about things we've done (all of which have happened in dreams before) then a problem will arise, sometimes multiple ones, one or both of us will be in mortal danger, whether it be kidnapping, rape, fires, ETC. and the other will rescue them or we will work together to get out alive, which we always do. Over the years we began a romantic relationship, we would kiss and cuddle in some dreams.

In the most recent one, her family had a weird flesh eating virus that she didn't catch, to get away from the stress, I took her to my school,, a place we usually go to (when i was in grade school, we go there, i'm in high school now so we went there)  we were running around inside, getting chased by the staff and stuff (it was night time) then we run to another place we normally hang out (a shopping center like the one near my house in real life) While we are in it, it catches on fire, no way out. after a good while helping each other to... not die? the fire department came in, put out the fire, and got us an exit. 

We were taking some stuff from the store because it was destroyed anyway, and i told her to go out and i'd catch up in a minute. I walk out and our families were there. Her's had a flesh eating virus that was terribly turning their skin green, weird tentacles were shooting out of them, then it ate their skin away, but she's not anywhere to be seen. I ask my family (perfectly fine) where Alice is, they point to a place we would normally sit together, (to give some info on what it looks like, it is the emergency exit for the building we just escaped from, theres a concrete staircase that is REALLY tall, and a large tree which we would sit in and talk/kiss) i go over there and look up to see her hiding in the tree, i call her and she jumps down, Her body is green, her chest is flat, her hair is gone and her skin is falling off, she has the flesh eating virus that her family has. she pushes me away and says i'm sorry, and is crying. she looked my in the eyes and looked more sad, and scared than she ever had in her life. after a few seconds she turns and runs back to her family. i chase her for a second but then look down and realize my skin is tingling where she touched me, like i got the virus to, I decide to kill myself by jumping off the staircase. Right when i jump i wake up.

This dream is very vivid to me, i could go into more details if you would like. Does Alice mean anything? Will i see her in my dreams again? Could Alice be a real person I haven't met yet? Because that has happened before.

I woke up like 10 minutes ago.**

The dream started with me and a group of people outside a tall building. The past memories of this building and what it represented were already well established. This was the central building for an oppressive government that ruled over the area that we all lived in. Like a Feudal Lord of our city. We were prisoners, there was about 100 of us and we all wore Green shirts. Men, women and a bit of older children were all kept in these areas like slaves, working around the base of this building and living in these shacks. Like a shanty town. One day seemingly out of no where, I hatched a plan to capture one of the guards as he drove by in his car and we'd take his gun and we'd use it to break out of this place. The oringal group of people in this plan consided of 9 people. We had someone lay down in the street and when the car came and stopped we all jumped out and rushed the guard and took the gun. Then from there we moved forward to capturing more guards and more guards until our forces were well poorly armed. By then we managed to cause a bit of a rucus and everything was pretty hetic. A few days had past and we were held up in this building quarters and sort of in martial law because of the uprising. More government people and guards had been called in and we were planning our next move. I had a meeting with all of the prisoners/slaves. They all wanted to come and swear their allegence to me and decided that they would follow me to overthrow the Feudal Lord I took the original 9 people aside and I told them to get name tags because they were the ones I trusted the most and they would become my personal guards and right hand. There was this one girl an asian girl she was about 5'2, thin very agile and atheletic studied martial arts and I started to like her after fighting with her for a while and she was also apart of my guard. There was this big black guy I called him Tank but he wanted to be known as Nato, and I always put him as my look out, and then there was this other guy name Charlie who I had follow me around all the time cause he was really strong. I can't remember the others names but they kept their original green shirts so I'd know who they were. 

We ended up leading the charge against this building and it was a crazy ass gun fight. We charged inside of the ground floor me and all of the slaves/prisoners and we ended up taking one of the higher ups captive and killing them and freeing the other slaves under his control and adding them to our army, they wore blue clothes. Then we merged with another army that we liberated from the otherside of the city around this building they wore red clothes and they all came together under my new banner which was this kinda orangish color with chinese designs on it that the girl I liked designed. Time passed very quickly in this dream so it was hard to tell how long had passed exactly since we took over the building but I had become well estiblished as the leader of this organization and we secured the tower for ourselves as the Fuedal Lord fled during the fight in a Helicopter and I pretty much owned the city. 

2 years past, and me and the asian girl are married and we have a little kid, a son. Her name was Mai, or something with an M. Her brother was Lee I had sent him away for 2 years to train in martial arts because I would want him to be my splinter cell incharge of personally overseasing the saftey of my family in the event of an emergency. He was like this super bad ass killing machine. One night we were having a meeting and interrogating a spy we captured. When they attacked us, I immediately sent him to secure my son and wife, and her caregiver while we fought off the forces. My family was hiding in this secret compartment in our house that we had to access underground. I immediately fought my way over there and we ended up rescusing them and then having to make it to our cars where we would drive to saftey. We drove out of the main area we lived in to this gas station where we'd meet up with the rest of my Royal Guard but this giant truck comes at us and its gunna explode and so Lee jumps out of know where and runs at this truck jumps onto it and then kills the driver jumps in the driver seat and steers it away barely managed to avoid us then climbs out the window runs along the back, and jumps from it to a car behind him as it blows up going over the ledge. This has me mad, that they tried to kill my family and we managed to capture two of their commanders during the fight and we interrogate them to find out that the Fuedal Lord is heled up a few towns over in this mountain area. So we start having over there in this giant car convoy. My wife and I leave our son with the caregiver this older asian lady and my wifes servant comes with us, this pale blonde girl and I take Lee and my right hand guard Charlie. We are walking up the street and my wife and I decide we wanted to race to the car, so we start running and I feel this giant boost of energy as I start to sprint the the car. She makes a comment to me that I only won the race because of my special powers that I have that are developing. So we get in the car and we drive to this train station where we're going to catch the train to this mountain resort town not far away where we would then go to launch our attack from a nearby outpost to the resort.

By this time 5 years has randomly passed. My son is about 5-6 now. My powers have fully developed after training them in the moutains for so long. We are heading out to the spa area where the men and women seperate and we hear an explosion. I panic and start sounding this alarm a high pitched noise I can make from my mouth. All of my guards run with their guns out to the womens facility and we try to make sure my wife is okay, we see one of her servants and she's buy herself and not with my wife and she looks like she was in the blast but was uninjured. I panic and I start to fan out asking people where my wife was, I jump onto a pillar and then leap from pillar to pillar searching around for her bouncing like spiderman, and a police officer flags me down and I call my guard to secure the area. Everything seems fine, the police man ask if I want to check and make sure my family is okay even tho they are on the female spa side of the resort and I ask if there was someone I could task with the job of making sure that my family was currently safe since I was being respectful and didn't want to go into the womens area where they were bathing. Some really pale long haired young girl decides she'll do it, very quite kinda girl and she says they're fine.

Then I say everything is okay and we put our weapons back and are heading back to the otherside of the compound. I am talking with my dad and he goes that person looks like they may come in handy in the future, and I go yeah like an anime character that no one talks to but then turns out to be really cool and helpful lately and we laugh. I tell him, ""When this is all over I'll tell you the story of how it all started, you'll be really surprised how much we've gone through these last 7 years."" And he says ""I'd like to hear it."" and we laugh. Tomorrow was the day we would launch our attack and finally win this long war to retake the area and secure our cities.

There were so many more details, cities, and events that happened that I can't quite put into actions or words, but it was such a crazy dream. It actually spanned 7 years and I played out almost all of the days during the course of this dream. I started the up rising, lead the rebellion, met this girl, we fell in love, fought to free our city, captured other cities, had a family trained in martial arts, I developed super powers, we captured close by cities, were assulted by spies and had crazy as battles. I developed relationships with my 9 guards and they all had names and back stories and friends and families, and I got to know them all, Lee turned out to be my savior when he pulled this super mission to help me rescue my family during this crazy ass hostage situation I can barely remember what happend by two people were holding my family hostage some spies or terrorist from the government and we snuck in and took em out somehow and it was this super elaborate plan that we hatched that included decoys and secret doorways tricking people, and all this really deceptive spy type stuff and a big ass brawl with swords. This dream was so expansive and massive and detailed, and I could feel time passing and myself and others around me getting stronger learning more and growing as characters. It played out like a movie but I woke up before the last day and I didn't get to see how it all ended. It was easily the most amazing and detailed dream I have ever had. 

**TL;DR**

My father shows up in a mini-van and tells me we're going to Florida. I get in the van and a couple of my old friends are inside. We cross the border (it took all of 5 minutes) and there's chicken and burger joints everywhere so I knew we were in the US (no offense-- dream logic). Now I'm sitting in the pews of a massive church with my friends beside me, and on my right Arthur (my irl friend, not the cartoon character) is holding a pot with a small, 2-foot marijuana plant in his lap. And we're just sitting there while some kind of conference is going on. Suddenly, a lady at the front spots me and my friend, gives us an incredulous look and walks over. She screams ""WHAT?"" and I say ""What?"" then she positively screeches ""WHAAAAAT?"" so loud it made my ears hurt. No one says anything, the lady just stands there panting with a crazy face on. Then I stand up on the pew and scream to everyone ""DO YOU MEAN I HAVE A BOX OF CRAYONS, AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO COLOUR WITH IT?""

Would greatly appreciate any feedback about a certain part.,19,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/j1gvn/the_creepiest_thing_ive_ever_dreamed_would/,"i tried to post everything from this dream session, but it's far too long. so i'm just going to put the really creepy part that i'd most like to share here. the other parts are bizarre as dreams tend to be, and there's a lot of context missing from this, so i'll put them as comments. but this is the freaky bit also, sorry for the horrible grammar and zero punctuation, but when you've just awoken from a crazy dream and you're furiously typing, it's hard to give a damn about that sort of thing. :)

so i'm walking down this long hallway with tons of doors.. not particularly creeped out, just exploring... at the end of this hallway, i see a massive portrait of myself, like fuckin huge, in this big frame, bigger than poster size.. it's fascinating to me because i don't remember ever taking that photo or seeing it... i stare at it for a minute... there are all these multicolored bottles in the foreground, i look to be maybe 7-9, but i suck at guessing ages so who knows... i'm just kind of posing there, smiling, looking kind of normal, kind of pretty for a child (which i don't normally think, photos of me as a kid tend to just be quite meh, very awkward sort of kid, sometimes kind of ugly, sometimes bearably normal, so the fact that i thought i looked pretty was quite different), yet quite recognizably me, which i was pleasantly surprised by..

(i tend to find photos of myself as a child slightly disturbing because i don't recognize myself at all in them, i mean with other people if i look at pictures of them from their childhood of course they can look very different, but i've looked at photos of me and they just freak me out a bit because i don't recognize any similarities at all, it really feels like a different person. i don't remember ever really looking in a mirror much as a child either.. i don't really have a view of how i looked as a child.. all i have are old photos but they just don't look like me)

right so the fact that i was seeing this picture, and i had instantly recognized that it was me... that was shocking in a wonderful way to me... finally someone had captured me at a moment where i look like myself... i had to get a copy of this.. i had to see it closer... so i look away from the picture for a couple of seconds and walk up closer... i look back up at it and am confused as my eyes start from the bottom of the picture up.. i see the bottles in the foreground as before, but as my eyes go up, i keep seeing the bottles. they've elongated to take up most of the picture. i see part of my body, my chest and arms, all looks normal except for those bottles.. keep going up... there's my smile... then ahhhhhhhhhhhhh moment of horror as i see my eyes upside down, placed right above my mouth, and i swear they're looking right at me...

look away! panic panic breathe breathe ahhhh... if i look back, it'll be back to normal, it's just my imagination, i'm just creeped out by all this, everything's fine...

i look back, and yay! all is normal... i look fine... i'm just looking at the camera... not at me... the picture looks exactly the way it should.. everything's all right.. i stare at it and try to take it all in, because now i'm afraid if i look away again everything will be fucked up... i keep staring and looking and just committing it to memory because fuck, i don't want to look away and back again... as i stare... features start to shift a bit... i watch the smile slip slowly down, the nose following it... i look up at the eyes in panic, they're staring right at me, almost through me... i blink... those eyes blink... i look... i see the fear in those eyes that i feel in my own... the confusion, the panic, and the fact that i'm seeing this is overwhelmingly frightening.. by now in the picture my eyes have slipped down around my nose, which is really where my chin should be, and i know, i just know that this is really happening to my own face, i can feel it, my features sliding down my skin, everything melting, and all i can do is watch this mirror in helpless horror...

i wake up. keep my eyes squeezed shut. justadreamjustadreamjustadream. open my eyes tentatively. see the familiarity of our bedroom. ahhh just a dream. god i was so fucking scared for a couple of minutes. eventually i felt i had to get out of bed as i had to piss like a motherfucker, which may have been part of what thankfully woke me up. i kept my eyes down though and purposefully avoided the mirror. i wasn't really afraid of finding that i hadn't really woken up, that i was still in this dream... i knew there was really nothing to be afraid of... i was scared all the same though, i didn't want to see myself, i felt like if i looked my eyes would be all wrong... i just couldn't get that image out of my head...

*deep breath*

ooooooooookay so yeah that was my dream... sorry for the ridiculous length... it was quite a nice exercise for me though to get all this out... even if nobody bothers reading it, i enjoyed writing it all out :P",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_j1gvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/j1gvn/the_creepiest_thing_ive_ever_dreamed_would/,

Initially everything seemed great (they even gave me free housing, which was good, because there was no way I would otherwise have been able to afford rent), but then the dream took on this sort of mystery movie tone where I began to uncover some kind of conspiracy about the film, and about Spielberg.

First, the set's supply of water became undrinkable -- tasted like soap and took on a purple-brown hue. Any additional water we brought in met the same fate. Then, the set slowly started to flood with the water. Not dramatically, or anything -- first I noticed small puddles, then they got bigger, and then a few days later we had to wade through a good six inches of water no matter where we were going. No one seemed to be trying to fix this, and Spielberg was nowhere to be found.

Then I started hearing all these complaints -- first from people working similar jobs as me, but then from the higher-ups, and then from the big-budget actors and actresses working on the film. All about how Spielberg wasn't just a horrible director (?), but also just an all-around bad person. There were implications that he had something to do with the water, which was by now nearly up to my waist just about everywhere I went, except for my room.

Then one night, as I was in my room and about to go to sleep, I noticed that my sister/daughter was wearing a necklace that she hadn't had before. Attached to the end of the necklace where a locket or something like that would usually be was a small glass sphere... and contained within it was more of the water.

""Give me that sphere,"" I said to my sister/daughter, fear in my voice.

and because there was no thing that could stop my motion I kept going further and further.

When I looked back I saw the milky way, and other galaxies. It was all quiet, and my acceleration ceased. I did know that I was immortal, and wanted to fly back, and I could do that, but which of all those stars was the solar system I didn't know.

My grandmother had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and so my mother moved her into our house to live out her final days. For the final two weeks of her life she was mostly unresponsive.

I was never very close to my grandmother, due to the fact that she lived 800+ miles away, and so I didn't spend much time in her room when she was dying; her dying didn't really have any meaning to me (I didn't really understand death, even at the age of 13 (aspergers)).

One morning, I woke up to my grandmother standing next to my bed. She told me that she was feeling much better, and she had to go. She told me to watch after my mother. She told me that she loved me very much, and I told her that I loved her too.

The next thing I know, my mom is walking up the stairs; she wakes me up to tell me that my grandmother had just died. I smiled at her, said, ""I know"", rolled over, and went back to sleep.

The strange thing is: My mom told me that when my grandmother died, she: 1)Sat straight up in bed (after being comatose for a week); 2) Looked in the exact direction of where I would be from her perspective; and, 3) Smiled.

I've had various intricate dreams over the years, and I'll start posting them here because I think they'd be interesting .
I also want to write short stories based on them someday. They are my main source of inspiration.

-----------

In my dream, I am constantly frightened. Omens follow me. Birds of all types appear, and in the wholeness of it I am with my headphones.


An egyptian spirit is trying to show its interest towards me. Needless to say, I am frightened. I have the impression this spirit is traditionally scary. Birds fly above me and near me. An explosion in the street as I go out of a school building; the black smoke turns into birds.

I go to a museum with my boyfriend, deciding to learn more of this thing that is interested in me. I am very afraid, and she says she will tell me about him. She takes out a scroll made out of purple wool, and says that she will write on it all of the important information I need. She charges a big sum of money for this, so I decline. Sad, she still talks to me, not wanting to leave me uninformed.
&gt;
&gt;""Why is he interested in me?""
&gt;
&gt;""Because of your love for music.""

Music explodes in my ears and I run away from there. This deity scares me. He deals with things that frighten me, dark, unknown things that drive me primal with fear.


Me and my boyfriend are in a school. He gives me weed, and tells me to keep it safe. I wrap it up, but the wrapping makes it catch fire. I try to put it out, but the fire consumes it whole. I am afraid I will burn the whole building, but he comes and the fire stops.

I am upset by this. He tells me not to be sad, and takes me to a large notebook store. The keeper is an aged old man, and tells me I won't find any large notebooks in there, just small ones and books. The books are weird - they all have white covers and are rather flimsy. Books and wood everywhere; music on the background. Birds as we come out.

He tells me he knows where to find answers. We go to an egyptian cafe, and at the entrance, there is a cabinet filled with statues of the gods. They are colourful and beatifully crafted, and I keep glancing back at them as we sip our coffees. We find no answers, only more confusion. We decide to head home.

My boyfriend stood in the living room, apparently stoned out of his mind, and stares into the hallway.

&gt;
&gt;""Are you alright? What are you doing?""
&gt;
&gt;""Looking at the shadows in your hallway.""


Going from the kitchen to the front door, shadow creatures in a neat row. They have no form, they are just shapeless shadow things. Head of a dog, almost hunch-backed, tails, they are all bulky but moving gracefully on their thick legs. I am terrified.


Scared, I whisper, almost in tears
“Athena, oh please, let it be a dream. I’m scared, please let it be a dream.” (i'm a pagan in real life)


I can't remember if I actually woke up and was whispering that, and then fell asleep immediately, or if I was dream-talking.



A figure appears. He has the oddest colour of hair - a dark strawberry blond, almost reddish. He is dressed in egyptian garb, with colourful jewelery and pure white linen. He looks at me with very pale green eyes, with a gentle expression. He approaches me slowly, like a scared animal. I am terrified.
All of my fears vanquish as he puts his hands on my cheeks and draws me closer to him. I feel calm and sedated.

&gt;
&gt;""Please, please let it be a dream."", 
&gt;
&gt;“This is not a dream”

he whispers, his mouth near my ear

It happened to me half a year ago now, yet it still haunts me to this day. I've tried to decipher meaning from it for a while now but I am hoping Reddit can help me:

Background: Around the time of the dream I had been suffering from a lot of anxiety which had resulted in me smoking a lot of weed in order to sleep. I have since quit this habit, but the anxiety still emerges every now and again and nightmares like this are still an issue whenever I drift off to sleep.  

The dream starts in a similar fashion to many of my dreams. I awake in my own bed and it’s still night time, or so it seems. I can remember searching around my room for my clock, but unable to find it I decide to open the curtains to try and determine the time. With the curtains wide open I stare out to pitch-black nothingness, as if the outside of my window has been painted black. As I begin to panic, I decide to leave my bedroom and check the other windows of the house each with the same result. I try to force the windows open but they won’t budge. The fact that I’m alone also begins to dawn on me and I start calling out for my other family members, but nobody responds. On the wall across the landing I stare into the mirror above the staircase and to my horror I can see cracks slowly forming on the mirror’s surface distorting my reflection. Out of these cracks a thick black liquid begins to seep from the mirror dripping down the wall.

I sprint downstairs to check the bottom floor of the house. Something about the house was distorted I still can’t remember what was different about it but the rooms seemed wider and taller than they should be. I look into the mirror in our living room, which reflects the kitchen and as I look from the cracks emerging to the actual reflection in the mirror I can see a hand resting on the floor of the kitchen with the rest of the body out of sight, behind the door frame.

I’m frozen in shock, not daring to look behind me. The gooey liquid begins to drip from the mirror once more and slowly but surely I pluck up the courage to peer into the kitchen. As I peer round the door I find myself staring into the eyes of my own mother’s body limp and lifeless lying on the floor. I fall to the floor from shock unable to comprehend what I’m witnessing. I then glance up to the sink, which is overflowing with the same pitch black liquid and as it seeps down the cupboard and reaches the floor. It begins to spread until it is touching her body. The last thing I remember is her body jolting back to life and sprinting towards me, screaming in a terrifying demonic fashion.

I awake in a puddle of sweat, heart pounding in my chest and immediately check outside my window. You cannot imagine my relief when I see the streetlight glowing outside… I didn't sleep for a while after that.

A small village in northern Norway.

I was riding a scooter down a road. There was sea on the right of me, and mountains on the left.
I was going to visit a friend who apparently lived at the end of the road there. Which in reality, he does not. Not even close. I remember I was on the phone with him, while driving the scooter, I don't know how, since I was wearing a helmet. When I got there he wasn't there, I can't even remember if there was a house there, the dream sidetracked. I met someone I used to know. My best friend from childhood. We're not that close anymore, in fact, I haven't spoken to him in years. Anyway, we talked for a bit and decided to drive to his grandmother.
As we drive, he in a car, and I on the scooter, we come to a part of the road that had been closed for at least 20 years. I don't know how because I just came from there. The road was blocked by a large concrete block. There was no way around since there this was a road that has woods on every side. I lifted the scooter over the block. Surprisingly this went really well. How he got his car over I do not know, the logic kind of stopped there.
The asphalt in this particular area was really worn. Long thin cracks was everywhere and holes, I could really feel the wear on my arms by holding tight to the handles. The road was also covered with lots of brown leaves and all kinds of debris. Large and small branches and an occasional tree trunk. This road had clearly been closed for some time. But I came that way, but there was no time to think this through right there and there. As we drive for 15 minutes or so, we come to a huge construction site, where they are tearing down a big structure of a building. Which was place where my friends grandmothers barn is.  The building was clearly not completly built, but they had to break it down. As we stood there and watch we became aware of the surroundings. Large landslides had been caused due to the unstable soil. And there is a large river maybe 30 yards from there house. As childern we were not allowed to go swimming in that river due to the rivers bottom, quick clay. Big areas in the village has alot of quick clay in the soil. The people working there prohibited us to drive any further because of the instability in the soil during the demolition. As we waited it was made clear that we couldn't pass for at least two days or so. My friend, whose house was hafe a mile from there got upset and asked if we should just walk there. Through the woods, so noone saw us. I was scared and made it clear to him that this was too dangerous and we could die if we tried. He got every upset and said that he would go alone. And I could just wait there for two days. He started walking. The terrain there was open with few trees. So one could easily spot someone there. A few minutes pass and a girl that looked very similar to the young Stark girl from Game of Thrones, Maisie Williams, but she had longer hair. I knew came and started talking. She asked why there was so much construction and so on. I  told her about the situation and that our friend had left me there. As we stood there and watched him from a distance, suddenly a big crack could be heard. He was on top of a ridge, and the ground around him just started falling apart. He fell a long way down, in a hole that quick clay and  sudden erosion probably caused. And covered tons and tons dirt, debris and quickly clay. Some construction workers had seen him and sounded an alarm.
Allot of commotion stirred, and the leaders there said there was nothing they could do now. It was too dangerous, and more people could die. I remember being scared and mourning at the same time. Few blank minutes pass and then sudden chaos starts erupting. There was an earthquake on the way. Apparently there had been many small quakes that day. I turned to the girl and said that we HAD to leave this place. RIGHT NOW! The season in the the dream quickly changed to winter, as we ran to her home so she could get some warmer clothes. I said to her that we need to run for the mountains, and make our way to safety from there. She was in on the idea, and there wasn't much else we could do. As we came to her house, she ran in and I was right outside. I remember thinking that I should go inside, but as I slided off my one shoe, I noticed that I didn't have any socks on. So I decided to just stay outside. Then her parents noticed me. And they asked what the hell I was doing there, any what I wanted with their daughter. I said nothing, I just stood there in shock. Her mother just shook her head silently giving me a wierd stare. I have no idea why. Then the girl was ready, and we left the house. We could hear and feel the ground shake, but we had to go on. We ran through a forest, before we came to an open area with almost no treet, just small tiny bushes, covered in snow. It was no dark, and the stars on the sky was extreamly clear. The snow on the ground was loose and very cold. Damp was coming out of my breath. Then all of a sudden gargoyles came flying and started attacking us. I now had... magic powers. Yes, magic powers. I could generate balls of ""smoke energy"" with my hands. And I would send then towards the enemy.

At this point, the dream got so wierd that I had to wake myself ut.
But when I woke up, all I could think of was the winter landscape.
It was so detailed and real. And beautiful. For the first time in my life I really really with I could draw, or paint. I had to try.

Fire everywhere. In the sky. On the sides of the single vast road I am walking alone. Each time I glance over to my left or right, I see a house burning or hear a woman shrieking in pain; the fire won't kill her fast enough. I get to a fork in the road and I take it hoping that the fire will go away but it doesn't. I approach a block of houses burning to the ground but no smoke in the sky. The residents of these houses are running past me as fast as they can, collapsing into a pile of ash and a pool of blood. A young child crawls past me crying with a scorched teddy bear, asking me to look after it. I hold the bear and keep walking. I get to a dead end in the road and the last house is my own. But it is not on fire. I open the front door and see the living room of the apartment where I grew up in, but it is completely empty. Empty except for a note on the ground that says ""some men just wanted to watch the world burn, us decent people couldn't take the heat."" After my eyes leave the note to assess my surroundings again, I see my grandmother lying on the ground but she will not wake up. Her body sets aflame starting from her feet and it eventually reaches her head. Once she is fully engulfed, she comes to life and starts shrieking. She runs and jumps out of the kitchen window and then the dream ends.

Anyway, here I am panicking realizing my mother is here. My mother is on a small balcony looking outside. She tells me 'Don't you see how beautiful it is outside?'. 

   My mother died 2 years ago of leukemia. In my dream she was all skinny and frail like the last time I saw her. I woke up and got to the bathroom to drink water and burst into tears.

   Back then my brother was planning his wedding in France and I didn't really want to go because I have a hard time getting along with my brothers and sisters and my father. I am kind of the black sheep of the family, for different reasons. If any of you grew up in a large family (we are 8 brothers and sisters), you can understand that's how it works a lot of times in big families. Long story short, my brother called me all the time to convince me to come anyway. I finally gave in and arranged the trip.

   Last August I was in Paris at my brother's appartment.  My brother's appartment is in Le Marais, a very beautiful and very old 'arrondissement' of Paris. He and his future wife were talking with the DJ about music choice for the wedding. Then it struck me. THIS is the appartment in my dreams. My eyes got all watery. I looked at the balcony.

It started off with me walking down the hallway in the house that I grew up in. It was dark, barely after the sun had gone down and nobody was home. I went into the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror. I remember being incredibly disgusted with myself. I picked up the hair dryer that my sister would use every morning and threw it directly at the mirror. It shattered and slowly fell to the ground. Every piece of glass that surrounded me was a memory repeating itself over and over like an animated gif. They all fell to the ground and turned into a silver liquid. They all pooled up into the center forming an indistinct reflection. I looked into the pool and touched it. As I reached into it, I slipped and fell into the silver and found myself being shot across time and space. 


I arrived in a desert with its only inhabitant being an old man sitting on a porch of a wooden shack. I immediately realized that I was looking at myself in the future. The old man was me. It was then that I was looking at myself as both the old man and my younger self. I realized then that the Older self was disappointed and saddened at the choices that my younger self had made and my younger self was terrified of what he had become. I saw myself through both sets of eyes at the same moment, just staring at each other. 

The ground opened up beneath me and I was pulled back across time again. But as I traveled through the tunnel of time, I was blessed with infinite eyes and was able to observe the human condition as a whole from every perspective.

Everybody thought the world was going to end. It wasn't a religious fervor or anything, more like a universal constant was slowly shifting and all the best minds thought that, once it hit a certain threshold, reality as we know it would it just fizzle out or pull apart. It wasn't just that the world was going to end; any and all existence would be completely wiped out and erased. But there was still a shade of doubt. 

It was an intensely personal dream, and the only characters I remember were me and a close but nameless, and silent, friend. The setting was an open, empty perfectly flat field near a small house with a severe blue sky occupied only by the sun. As the day of reckoning wore on, my stomach slowly started to unknot, and by midday I finally allowed myself to hope that the predictions were wrong, and that we would actually escape erasure.

But soon my friend asked breathlessly, and rhetorically, “Is the the sun is dimming?” and her body sagged in despair as she clutched my sleeve for support. And she was right. As I looked at the sun at its 60 degree angle in the sky, it was slowly darkening and cooling to match the color of the sky. But it wasn't just getting darker. It was also that the entire rest of the world was slowly being permeated by brighter and brighter, painfully white light that also made the sun look dimmer by comparison. As this happened the sound of a terrible, rushing wind got louder and louder. As the sound and light grew in intensity, my only emotion was denial that it could be happening. That everything about anything was slowly dissolving into nothing. I kept fighting it and fighting it despite knowing that it had to be true. As the light became blinding and the wind deafening (like a strong wind blowing into a camera microphone in a home movie) I felt in my gut the loss of every single thing that was quickly fading into nothingness.

-On the first night I woke up within my dream to an intense feeling of fear and being unsafe. The door to my bedroom was open (Which is wierd because I always have it closed and it can't open from wind or whatever else) this one was relatively short and I woke up in real life freaking out and went back to sleep after a time.

- On the second night It went the same, waking up to find my door open, but this time it seemed as if the very air itself was vibrating, the feeling of fear was this time much more intense and I could feel a malevolence in the atmosphere, something was watching me. I woke up completely freaked to find my door was open in real life and i felt like something was present in my doorway, i quickly got up and shut it, didn't get back to sleep that night.

Night three - I wake up to the open door with the same feelings of malevolence, evil, fear, helplessness and a sense of impending danger in the atmosphere but this time I see a Hooded/cloaked figure filling the doorway (We leave a light on in the hallway at night just outside my room) so the light illuminated its shape. I could feel its eyes staring at me, trying to harm me the vibration of the air became really intense and I felt like my chest was being lifted off the bed.

""Very simple Doctor,"" I said, ""you just need to find the right pieces"".

it's pitch black and its cold. i'm in by bed but i somehow end up in a this metallic ball thats is completely pitch black. the walls are cold to the touch and i can hear water dripping. the bed itself is tilted over and i nearly fall to the freezing metallic floor.

i desperately try to find my way out only to place my hand on a bunker-like door. it was tough to turn but once it budged, it opened.

as soon as i pushed the heavy door open, tree branches try to make their way inside the capsule. i break the off and hop out of the ball. i look around and i see myself in the middle of the street wearing nothing but basketball shorts and a tee shirt and wearing socks.

there are overgrown trees and foliage on pretty much everything. light posts, buildings, trashcans, you name it. i stumble around trying to make sense of it all when i notice the ball i was trapped inside was also covered in vines which made me wonder how long i was in there. a thick grey fog covers most of my view and i begin to walk down the street.

no signs of life and i'm confused as all hell. it looked like something out of a silent hill game except completely void of life. i just keep walking and walking and i see all the building have the windows smashed and large chunks are missing from the sides of some buildings. cars are abandoned and most are in bad shape with doors ripped off. i end up just sitting in one of the broken down cars driver seat and notice a small paper calendar sitting in the cupholder. the year was actually 2050. i end up getting really freaked out when i hear this loud hissing sound from a distance. i get up and continue walking then i stop dead in my tracks

sounds a bit like a broken steam pipe. it just gets closer and closer. i freak out and just stand there and i see absolutely nothing. the sound is right in my left ear. nothing is there. i can't move because i'm so damn scared. just hiss after hiss. nothing. absolutely nothing was next to me nor could i see anything. everything was abandoned and the fog was just growing thicker and thicker. i then freak out completely and end up waking up in a sweat and a panic attack, shaking.

I've been browsing Reddit for entertainment and as I was reading some creepy stories in r/creepy (creative, i know), I just realized that I never wrote down the dream that I had about a year ago. Here it is:

I had a dream that I died. I have no idea how it happened but I had been shot and was located in a moving van. I was laying down the back seat, blood was beginning to fill my mouth and I could taste the blood; that metallic, rusty taste of it. With me was my mom (sitting in the passenger seat) and my dad or someone (definitely a male) driving. We were on our way to the hospital and we were  speeding our way over there; every minute (or what seemed like minutes to me anyway) i spent staring at the roof of the van, i could feel myself dying. I've never been in that kind of situation where i black out and lose consciousness but this felt the real deal. I could feel everything becoming darker, the light fading slowly as the my hearing also began to fade. I could hear my mom crying and telling me that everything was going to be okay. I was scared shitless. After all, I didn't want to die and I wasn't fully aware that I was dreaming (or nightmare).



Before i go on, let just give some insight on what I believe dying is like. I would like to believe that there is heaven or some sort of perfect afterlife that we go to after we die. Unfortunately nobody knows for sure what happens. I choose to believe that we are reborn into the life that we live today. That's why we get de ja vu; it's because we are living the moments in our life that we have lived in our past life. In other words, i choose to believe that reincarnation is what follows us after death. Like i said though, nobody can be sure, right?



Back to the dream.



The person driving took a look at me and had this expression of grief on there face and told my mother that there was nothing they could do. I was going to die in that van. 



After some time i just couldn't take it anymore and i let the darkness consume me. This is by far the scariest thing that I had ever experienced in dream. For about 15 seconds i could see, feel, or hear anything. Everything was absolutely dark. I could not move around. It was as if i was suspended in some sort of vacuum in a void that had no escape. Finally, i came to and suddenly everything was filled with a dim light of a fire. I looked around and saw that I was in some sort of hut. The roof was made of straw, the floor was dirt, and there was no visible furniture. Suddenly through the door way of the hut, a woman appeared. She was a dark, indigenous looking woman with black hair and wore what seemed to be a brown, thick (probably wool), dress. I don't remember every detail of this person's face but I knew at once who she was supposed to be: she was my mother. I had no idea who she was but I knew in my gut that she was my mother and that i had been reborn into another life. She then spoke to me in a language that I had never heard of before but as strange and bizarre as it sounds, i understood it. It's weird, i know, but I understood through the indigenous words and expression on her face that she was asking me, ""Are you okay? Did you have a bad dream?"".



At this point I could not take it anymore. I began to cry. I cried and told her that I wanted to go back. I wanted to be back in my own life and in my own time. Slowly, everything began fading and I woke up again in the van where i saw my mom looking at me with tears and we were still driving on the highway. I looked at my wound and saw that it was still bleeding but i no longer felt the darkness around me. I closed my eyes and I woke up.



This is by far the most surreal dream that I have ever had in my life. Makes me appreciate life a lot more and I keep it as a reminder of how precious life is. I spent more time with my family when I can and remind my mother how much i love her.

I've never experienced anything like it. Believe it or not, this was not induced by drugs, alcohol, or sleep aids (which...I suppose are also drugs, I digress), but I believe it was triggered by eating too much sugary crap before bed. My sister made these goddamn delicious macadamia nut brownies...and I had a few before bed to say the least. Bad idea, in hindsight.


At around 4 AM I was have trouble getting to sleep. I tossed, and turned, and I eventually decided it would be best to turn on the TV and just fall asleep from watching it.

 

I started to doze off and enter that stage right before REM sleep where you are still relatively conscious of what's going on around you. I had turned the TV off before this, but I began to hear screaming and yelling inside my head. Then, I was confronted with what could only be the f*cking eye of sauron itself. It looked at me...and I looked at it and tried to open my eyes.

 

The last thing I remember as I had my eyes half open was seeing some sort of evil black sloth thing with glowing yellow and red eyes (like the lights you see on a DVD player or something) hanging in the corner of my room. When I saw this, the cacophony inside my head grew louder until I could finally fully open my eyes.

 

After that, I woke up completely. No sloth...no shitty eye of the dark lord Sauron...so I just turned the TV back on and I didn't get any actual sleep til around 6 AM.

I mostly watch FOX, but I also watch a bit of CNN and this dream happened on CNN.  No particular pundits; just some random, generic, most likely non-existing talking heads, and they had a guest on to discuss the re-election of Hugo Chavez.

So the pundits begin discussing Venezuela, talking about how long Chavez has been in power, how they remain good friends with Cuba and how they're trying to export more to China to ween of dependency on American capital.  They start talking about totalitarian rule in Venezuela and the guest starts to get into some of the good things about Venezuela and they get into a debate over whether the polling was fair, typical TV bullshit.

So anyway, the argument begins heating up a bit, with the CNN people mostly slamming down any praise of Venezuela and showing images of protesters calling for free press.  The guest doesn't question the validity of their complaints, but instead brings up a new subject.

""America does a lot to criticize Venezuela, but do the people realize oil companies are laying claim to limited natural resources they later have to jump through hoops for?  In Venezuela, the oil belongs to the people...""  My heart begins to pound.  Are they really discussing this on American TV?  The newsman looks seriously pissed, and says nothing to rebut his guest's statement.  Instead, he takes out a gun and pops the guy in the head on-air.

This is when I wake up, and I'm still freaking out because the news is on and I'm thinking, ""Did I just see what I think I saw?""  Slowly but certainly, that answer became a no, but the dream led me to look further into the situation in Venezuela and wonder why a private company can lay so much claim to the world's natural resources.  I haven't exactly gone from libertarian to card-carrying socialist, but I'm a little more open to the nationalization of a commodity like oil.

Yeah I know - boring political dream, shit description - but it certainly came as a shock to me.  Off-topic but I've been dreaming a lot lately mostly due to NoFap.

This was some time ago, but the dream was my friend and I were driving out of my apartment complex.  There were what I would call ""hyperdimensional snails"" all around the car.  I call them this because they had a ""color"" that was not like anything I have experienced.  It was like the phasing in and out of various realities. It was much more vivid than most dreams I have and I even wrote my brother about it on chat right after waking up.

So I go about my morning, wake up and head to the dentist office.  In the waiting room, I look at the aquarium and there are a bunch of snails in it with a similar ""color"" (as close as you can get in reality without the impossibility of the dream). No biggie.  It's a dentist. He has an aquarium and of course there will be sea snails.  It's weird, but not impossible in any way.

I decide to grab a bite to eat afterward, head home first, grab my notebook and get an urge to go to this restaurant I hadn't been to in a while.  I drive there, it is closed, but has moved up the street.  I sit there drinking my coffee and writing out the dream.  I draw one of the snails. The waitress asks ""can I top that off for you?"" and I look up.  There is a giant snail tattoo on her arm that looks *exactly* like the ones in my dream and what I was just drawing.  I didn't want to weird her out by showing it to her but I asked her ""I don't want to be rude, but can I ask you something?"" ""Is it about my tattoo?"" me: ""Yes"" her: ""Don't"" and I went back to drinking my coffee, mind spinning.

The dream, as I remember, starts off with this shot and then fly towards the closest tower. The"" camera"" fly's into the tower and down into the lower levels until it reaches the bottom dungeon where I sat shackled to a wall. The camera focuses on me and a faint light source can be seen glowing outside the shot, but slowly approaching me. As the glow draws near, I began to lash out violently towards it until final I break down and start weeping . The camera turns slowly to reveal giant, floating luminescent heart drawing near. Then the dreams ends.

This was a dream that I had years ago back in high school (2006) where my main priorities at the time were trying to get over my social competencies and getting a girl to like me. Obviously, things have changed and these are no longer a problem, but I still remember this being a very cool looking dream.

Anyways, I was a bit confused about how I felt towards the aforementioned girl, but now I'm even **more** confused about how I feel.

OH SHIT MORE CONTEXT: So anyways, the dream progressed like this: Somehow I got into a fling-like relationship with the previously mentioned girl(I'm just going to refer to her as..... Girl X from now on), and there was also a scene I remember from the dream where Girl X and I kept on trying to find places to be alone(Okay, I'm gonna be honest, we were trying to find places to furiously make out(I think this is the part of my dream that may have been affected by my teenage guy hormones)), but we kept on finding other people inside rooms and such we were trying to go to. So the dream progresses somehow beyond that, and then I find myself in Art Class, where I pick up with my teacher telling me to go comfort Girl X or something(somehow my teacher knows about what is happening before I do)( I should mention that this happens in the middle of class)(I should also mention that at the moment, my Art teacher seems to be a very odd person for my mind to choose to just excuse me from class, as I'm getting a C in Art currently, and it seems like she thinks that I'm very irresponsible)(HOWEVER, it should be mentioned that my Art teacher is pretty goddamn cool), so I leave class to go comfort Girl X about whatever(my dream self still doesn't know what the fuck this is all about). So I go find Girl X, and from the dialogue I can tell that the fling has progressed into a full on relationship, and that Girl X didn't want this for some reason. I then comfort her somehow( I think it was by hugging/ holding her in my arms or something?). My dream ends with me taking Girl X to meet my parents. What's strange about this part is that I leave my mother and Girl X to talk by themselves, and I go play pool with my father and talk about something while playing(I think it was something along the lines of the things two friends who are both drinking would talk about, but I""m not sure, as I can't really remember clearly). Dream ends. When I woke up I was very confused for a bit and at least a tiny bit sad.

My mom, aunt, and grandma, along with some random kid on the couch were the only people there. We were talking when all of a sudden I felt kinda wobbly, like my vision was focusing oddly.

I was crying as I asked why would I get cancer, to which he said, ""it just happens like that. I don't know."" And I was crying as the dream ended.

My grandmother, in 2005, supposedly had a stroke, and was soon after diagnosed to cancer. The car is interesting because an Aunt of mine had an olive van, and now she has a mustang. When diagnosed, my grandfather was worried about how to support my grandmother's medical bills, and the entire family was worried in general. The apartment that he described (along with the child) is very similar to my (other) aunt's apartment.

It wasn't until my late teens that I found out I posessed a natural gift, and that others couldn't do this. 

Getting to the point:

I have re-occuring dreams where I will visit the same exact places. I've been visiting these places for years. Even more oddly though are the people I meet. I remember their names, what they feel like. What they smell like. Their temperments. Their annoying actions. How kind they are. I've even grown attatched to them and on rare occasions think about them and or miss them.

I'm not exactly the most social person, and have some social anxiety, but I basically invited a bunch of people to hang out and drink. I have no idea how many people will show up or if they'll get along. Very stressed out. 

I had a dream last night that we were all at a bar, and it went moderately well. People drank and had fun. I didn't seem to drink enough to feel truly comfortable, and was very stressed out, but I was being social. We all decide to head to another bar and enter the parking lot as a big group, talking and laughing. One guy, laughing and joking with the rest of us, says he's sober and is willing to drive people, and wants to make sure my friend and I don't drive so takes our keys from us. Then BAM I realize something's weird with him and he runs ahead to my friend's car, opens her trunk and steals some items. Then he grabs my arm and drags me to some trees on the other end of the parking lot (everyone was too preoccupied with my friend's car to notice). 

Once we reach the trees he rapes me. When he was done, he left and I realize he stole my car. Somehow, I'm not sure how, I'm with him again, in his room, and he rapes me some more.

I get to the wall of dust and I start to think about water. How can I survive without water. I run into a building to try and fill up my water bottle but the water is brown already. At this point I realize I'm stuck. No partner, not able to get in touch with my loved ones, no water, radio silent.

I've learned over the course of about 60+ dreams that it's the result of people attempting to time travel and actually creating a divergent universe that they share. The people/creatures from different universes have formed into different tribes and villages that they inhabit. Some are very friendly and accepting, some are violent and defensive. The laws of physics and nature are a bit off, including things like gravity shifts and alpine mountain peaks at sea level. Also floating islands and huge tidal waves that destroy entire parts of the world. I get the sense that I'm in the future, as I'm familiar with technology that's at least 10+ years from what we have now, namely a tiny device worn around the neck that is used for navigation and identifying things. I have friends in this world, but none of them are from my waking life.

Each time I enter this environment I'm traveling through it on some kind of quest, with a great risk for a great reward. Often in a vehicle, other times on foot. When this dream space started recurring, I would forget about it for weeks at a time. Now there is a point in each waking day that I'm suddenly obsessed with this alternate world and I feel called to sleep so that I can enter it again. This is creating a feedback loop where I'm in this dream space more often and my recall is getting better.

I think it has something to do with a substance in your blood during sleep that makes your physical body unable to move, which also causes sleep paralysis (as your body is sleeping during sleep paralysis, but your mind is awake). This substance also makes you unable to make quick and powerful movements in your dreams.

Well, I looked in the mirror again, and suddenly, a slightly taller duplicate of myself was standing by my shoulder, in the same spot as the other guy. I remember talking to myself, but I have no idea what about. I think I remember punching the duplicate in the face right before waking up.

1363565065.0,11,self.Dreams,1ahrwh,"Last night, I met the love of my life in a dream, then lost her... ",11,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1ahrwh/last_night_i_met_the_love_of_my_life_in_a_dream/,"Last night I had a strange and incredibly profound experience. It was a journey inside my subconscious and it toyed with the very fabric of what I believe is memory or dream. Some of you may choose to believe it is just creative writing, but believe me when I say this happened to me, and it was real in a way I don't think I'll ever forget.

In my dream, though most of it is very foggy now that I’m awake, I remember the entire process of meeting and courting a woman. She was beautiful with blonde hair, breathtaking eyes and a contagious smile and the feeling her face evoked is honestly the only thing that remains etched in my mind. I remember brief moments in time of us together, in the park, with friends, sharing intimate moments, visiting faraway places and countries I’m sure don’t exist. We were so in love and perfectly happy. I remember a feeling of absolute bliss. I’m actually crying as I write this now because the emotions are still there. I had all these memories as clear as if it was a full life actually lived.

Then, inevitably as every dream does, this one had to come to an end. But it was like we both knew it had to be over. We hunched down against a wall, I can’t remember where or why, and I told her I was waking up. She nodded and just held me and I started to cry so hard because I knew I was going to lose her. I held her so tight because I knew these were our last moments. I could feel myself drifting back into this world, and every single memory we had together of the life we lived was being wrenched from my mind into oblivion. It was like I was losing pieces of my soul, and watching my soulmate vanish in front of me piece by piece. I kissed her as long as I could and held her tight. I started screaming in anguish, tears streaming down my face, and feeling a pain as real as if my closest companion was actually dying before my very eyes. My deafening screams settled into quiet whimpers and I awoke alone and covered in sweat. I still felt the pain though. I felt the absence – something missing. 

But here is where it gets truly bizarre. At some point last night, I went back. I’m not sure if I awoke in this world and then went back to sleep. Or if the dream of my lover had been itself, within a dream.  I say this because in the second part I remember (within the dream), I forced myself to lie down and fall asleep. In this dream I had total control of everything that occurred. It was as if somehow, because I was already asleep, the boundaries of reality no longer applied and I could shape the thoughts and images I saw. In this ‘dream within a dream’ I went back to look for her. Because this dream is so many layers deep, I cannot remember the details of it, but I remember the objective clear as day, to make her real again. I remember thinking of exotic places and they appeared. Dreaming of terrible dragons and creatures and they appeared. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t bring her back. I couldn’t create the image of her because I simply could no longer remember what she looked like. I brought countless women to life before my eyes but none of them were her. 

Then, in frustration and deeply depressed, I awoke. I tossed and turned and had several more short dreams after which I cannot remember, but none so profound. 

This morning, I awoke and went about my daily activities. But then somehow, it all came back like a tidal wave washing over me. The sadness, the longing for a person that I couldn’t even recreate in my head. I felt again the pain that had brought me screaming back to the surface sometime in the middle of the night. Here, in front of the bathroom mirror, I cried deeply again. 

So, it’s things like this that make me wonder about my subconscious. Make me think about the strange possibilities. Did my subconscious cross paths with another’s last night and fall wildly in love? Did I experience deep, buried memories of a past life? Did I experience a brief shadow of my life in an alternate universe, on a path not taken, before being pulled back into my own? 

I honestly think I will never know, but this was one of the most bizarre and profound emotional experiences I’ve ever had. Being asleep but fully awake, and being within a dream with the power to shape my own reality. Mind-boggling

I know one thing though. There’s still a tiny part of me that hopes, despite my inherent skepticism, that maybe someday, somewhere, I’ll see her again on the street or in a dream, and even though we have never spoken, both of us will know.

Time passes and me and brother are picked up for a family outing, and it turns out, the person she is seeing is non other than my old man. The situation makes me furious but i try to keep it hidden because my mum seems happy. Then i notice him checking out other women, so i flip and begin to beat the living hell out of him, im not sure, but im pretty sure i killed him. I then run off with my brother and mum and get in the car and drive off with tears down my face. When i woke up i was crying, and ive been angry ever since, pretty much been raging for around 5 hours. Just to confirm, i'm not angry i may have killed him, i am angry i saw him back in my life, i, like the rest of my family, can not stand him",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_124gku,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/124gku/most_terrifying_dream_ive_ever_had/,

I set an alarm for 7:10 AM. Had the alarm go off and couldn’t quite go back to sleep, so I had to go to the restroom. After a well needed break inside of the restroom, I went back into my bed. I did not recollect any dream from the night as of this time.

After closing my eyes, I slowly drifted away into my sleep pattern. Soon enough, I was in REM sleep. From what I can remember, I was sitting down for a college class. The teacher was of Asian descent. The class was full and had 2 rows of 2 chairs per table. I was 3 tables back. The partner I had was a female. Unfortunately, I was not able to find out or ask for her name. The class was at about mid-point when things started to escalate.

As I sat there listening to the mumbles of my teacher, my tablemate began to touch me. Not an accidental touch, but a more sensual feeling of my leg. As I soon realized what was transpiring, I also began to touch her. While she moved her hand up and down my thigh, I slowly but surely moved my hand towards hers. We both met hands around my inner thigh. She then began to gesture her pointer finger around and towards my upper thigh. Things soon began to become heated as I looked at the teacher for reassurance that he was not aware of the situation.

I now noticed that he was unaware of our little gestures, which in turn began a cycle of my tablemate brushing her hand around my Staff. She was very gentle and had a soothing sensation with every slight movement around me. My hand, which still had been around her hand, was helping around the spectacle. Within no time, I had become aroused. The emotional feeling of her playing with me during class was almost unbearable, but I managed to calm myself enough to not get over excited. I had complete control of the situation, and was able to be completely silent as to not cause anyone to notice.

The mood had begun to escalate gradually as I slowly moved my hand towards her legs. With the slightest movements, I had succeeded in my journey to her nether region. With her left hand on my pants and my right hand on hers’, we began to feel each other in ways that were simply incredible. I realized what must be done, as I felt the warmth from her Vagina and a small amount of wetness. I began to massage her slowly with an up and down motion. I still felt the pure joy of her around my penis. As I started to become more rapid in movements, my second alarm had begun to ring.

At the exact moment of the sound I slowly regained my awareness of reality and lost my vision of the dream. It was 9:30 AM now. The day had already begun, but I still was not ready to start mine.  Awoke feeling tired and exhausted, not to mention I had a headache and a minor throat ache. I soon decided to go and take a few migraine pills. After a few minutes, I had come back into my room to try and resume what I had remembered from the dream. I moved around some pillows to aid in better neck support. Then, I closed my eyes.

When the sensation of my dream began to come back, I was in a different room. The room reminds me of the size of a dorm, but it was in fact a classroom of sorts. There were around 5 to 6 people in the room, which were mostly women. We were not sitting but instead standing as we all partook in a session of smoking. The piece, which was a bong, was around 12 inches long and was simplistic. The amount of smoke in the room was unrealistic, but the stench was spot on. It was so potent that soon after we finished, the next class was waiting outside. A woman knocked on the door. I opened it up and this is what she said, “I know what you were doing in here, but it’s time for our class now.” Thankfully, she was kind enough to let us all go on our way. 

At this point, I was finished with classes for the day so I decided to wander around campus. After being outside for a while, I found a set of stairs that led to a dormitory. I entered, and was soon enough in a room with the same woman from my earlier dream. There were a few others in the room, but they weren’t nearly as important to her, so I cannot recollect most of them. Without warning, we began stripping down and started to make out. The room was bright, due to the window being open. The bed that we were on was soft and durable.

After a few moments of making out we were completely naked and above the sheets. With her on my body, she slowly moved into position. I am on my back and she is lying on my stomach, but she moves back a bit. She slowly inserts me in. The feeling was surreal. The warmth from her body was amazing. The movements begin to repeat itself, but become faster. I don’t recall ever having cum, but in what seems like ages, we change positions and start again. After going at it for the second and third time, things begin to clear. Her face is exotic and her nose was small and pointed. With her blond hair and brown eyes, I soon realize that I have seen this face before. Unfortunately, it was just a stranger from my past.

Both of us are of smaller, and skinner body types. I am a bit taller and bigger. I decide to try a sex move that I had recently seen from an app on my Ipod. The move was a variation of a term called bookends. We were still on her bed, but it seemed like we were closer to the edge. I had my legs in a position where I had my knees slightly in front of me and then bent towards me. She on the other hand was facing me, and was doing the same. As she slowly put herself on me, I can feel the sensation of satisfaction and bliss as her warmth begins to start up and down once again. My hands were holding her hips as she held onto my shoulders. We went on for a while like this. Her body looked and felt real. Unfortunately, I had set another alarm for 10:45. As we were going at it, I start to hear the song from my alarm go off once again. As the dream fades, I awake from my slumber feeling refreshed and had no pain at all. I lay there for a bit, and reminisce on one of more exciting dreams, and my first ever dream involving sex.

I was wandering around with a tour group of the world's presidents, prime ministers, and kings, and we were being shown the perfect small-scale city. It was in harmony with the local natural habitat, generated its own power, grew its own food for the inhabitants, had clothing creation and housing construction. Everything was automated, and there was no need for anyone to have money or even understand the concept.

No-one who lived there would go hungry, have to sleep in the rain, or ever have to work for a living. Everyone who lived there could be painters, writers, musicians, photographers, hobbyist engineers, gamers, or anything else they wanted to do just for fun.

It was the perfect city, with the perfect solution to the world's problems of poverty, energy, homelessness, and debt. The seed machinery needed to get the whole rolling anywhere in the world fit in a person's pocket, and would even work on other worlds.

After a small conference amongst themselves the important men of the world turned to the creators of this perfect city and their nominated spokesman said that they would be declining on taking a free copy of the plans for the seed machinery needed to create the city.

He said, and this puzzled me and the creators of the city,

'We don't want to be slaves.'

As I woke up I understood what he meant. Without a representation of wealth, or a legally backed up list of people who owed them money, these powerful men were nobody. They couldn't buy the bigger, better car and say, ""See, I'm better than *you* because I can afford a Bentley."" They couldn't swank around being the most powerful men in the world when no-one owed them anything or needed them to dictate how the economy should go.

They looked at their own imminent obsolescence as world leaders and thought of how they would simply be One Of The People again. They were not overjoyed that no-one in their home countries would be hungry, or thirsty, or cold, or beholden to anyone ever again. They *needed* the hungry, the thirsty, the cold, and the downtrodden to make them feel like their wealth and power was worth anything.

They needed misery in others in order to feel good in themselves.

Both involve a small town with a wooden gazebo in the center and include a parade (for me it appears to be a circus going through town, she described it as a parade).  We both work our way through the parade and town to a shop.  For me sometimes it is a bar and sometimes it is a small market (antiques are included).  For her it is a market or antique shop. We work our way upstairs and then meet the clockmaker who is dressed old school Victorian-ish.  

The feelings involved in  meeting the clockmaker are the same for both of us.  A sense of calm and happiness but anticipation as if he is about to show us something.  For me the wall behind him opens up (I don't see what is on the other side) and then I wake up.

At the end of my dream, after being in many locations and interacting with a wide variety of characters, I end up at a friend's house with another friend of mine. Our hostess is telling us about how we can't smoke inside and how her mom is going crazy trying to quit cigarettes, so my friend whom I'd came with and I go outside to smoke. We look into a window and see that this girl's dad is Robert Deniro, but somehow we know his name to be ""Ron Perlman."" We see stacks of money and armed guards in the room.

My friend and I are suddenly at a bar, presumably in this girl's house, watching something on TV. Pretty quickly a guard comes in with a gun and is looking at people's nametags (which we are suddenly wearing) and when he gets to mine, he holds out a cigarette butt and presses a gun to the back of my head. Essentially telling me that if I throw any butts on the property again, he'll kill me. I'm crying and scared and apologetic and all, so he goes away. Once he's gone I realize no one in the bar will talk to me. Not my friend that I'd come with, none of the several strangers or bartenders, no one. Again, fairly quickly, the same man comes in looking for nametags, finds mine and holds out a cigarette butt. I start crying and pleading, saying that I didn't smoke again after he warned me, that it was someone else's, etc. But I was crying and scared as he held my head down on the bar and loaded/cleaned/prepared his gun. When he finally put the gun the back of my head, I started trying to make peace with dying. Just repeating to myself, ""I'm going to die. That's okay. This was always going to happen. Be at peace."" As I started repeating this mantra I stopped crying and everything faded into white before he had the chance to shoot me.

Everything had a purple hue as the sun went down over the edge. I don't think I ever saw the sun. Just the glow left over. I could barely make out the giant water creature below me's shape. I wasn't sure if it was a shark or a whale. Later I knew it was a whale with its pod.

It starts out with an eagle's view of a huge desert stretching for miles and miles. All I would see was sand and dunes, with a little white spec that had a dark trail. Not sure if the sand turned black or if it was just a sign of it having been moved. 

It zooms in oddly quick to reveal that the white spec is a very young and prominent female who resembled an older, mature me, only a bit more middle-eastern. It all has an Ali Babba ring to it, though I've never been attracted to the middle east as a half Dutch/ half Indonesian Anglophile. She has this mysterious look on her face, as if she knows everything and yet still wonders about daily squabbles. She wears a slimming white dress made of fabric foreign to the location of the dream. After the close up of her face it cuts suddenly to somewhere in an, presumably, Arabic city. I always wondered what business she had in the market place. 

Several short and ugly troll-like men stand behind her, waiting for her to open up the ancient door, very inpatient little fellows. When I got to see the door, it was like I was looking at it from over her shoulder, as if I could tell her what to do. She never listened to me though. The door was large, had a rounded top, wooden and very very old, everything metal was dark and rusty. The thing that left the biggest impression was the lock that hung there, rusty, big, seemed very heavy. It also had a large keyhole but it was, apparently, not pickable.

I woke up thinking of Silent Hill and ghosts, even though virtually none of it actually was related to the plot of the video games or movie. I just remember Silent Hill being mentioned and me getting that vibe about the dream. 

The earlier part of the dream I don’t remember. 

But the earliest part I do remember, I was on a field trip in NYC with a school or something and I bought a $40 chocolate mousse cake even though I clearly said to the lady that I wanted yellow cake with fruit on it but I bought it anyway (who buys a $40 cake they didn't even want?).

After this I was holding a huge house party, at some house I didn’t recognize. I also had superpowers, sometimes. Sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn’t. I also requested silly string be handed out at the party and went around spraying people with it. 

Snoop Dogg was somehow the grim reaper and drove by a few times on a mini-motorbike. I was with Brian from Family Guy (....wtf) and we dove into the bushes whenever Snoop Dogg came by. I found it scary at the time but now it’s just hilarious. 

Later on I was at my own house on the backyard deck, and there was a huge, old, evil-looking two story house built in my backyard. With my mental “dream-will” or whatever, I made the house burn down/explode, in slow motion. Eventually I could see that the house was built over two graves, who I somehow knew who they were and was helping them be at peace. I could see the two ghosts, who were apparently husband and wife, blue-white and ethereal and everything, standing over their graves.

I told someone, I don’t know who exactly, either Brian or my best friend (who magically appeared from nowhere), to fire some strange harpoon looking device at each grave. When this happened, some fucked up demon thing, looking like a cross between the alien dog from the Thing and the Resident Evil dogs, ran up the stairs to try and get us. It was at this point that I started confronting the fact that I was in a dream. 

My best friend was suddenly some demon-hunter vampire-slayer type badass chick, and told me to get inside while one of the dog things tackled her. I couldn’t just watch so I opened the door and it immediately came after me, as if I was it’s main goal. Somehow my friend got inside but we managed to keep the demon dog outside.

The doors on my porch IRL are glass, and so they were glass in the dream. There were suddenly TWO demon-dog things whose faces kept changing to different scary looking things, but I kept taunting and making faces at them anyway, knowing nothing could actually happen to me, even if I perceived pain in the dream. 

By now the things looked even freakier, one actually looked almost normal like a greyhound but with like blood all over it, but the other one’s neck had snaked out to like 4 times the length of it’s body, it’s face became shaped like something between an evil fox and a lion (complete with mane), and it’s eyes were HUGE and oval shaped with blue spirals in them, and they rolled back into its head. Totally looked like something from the Thing now. I surprised myself by sticking my tongue out at it, opening the door and slamming the head of the greyhound-demon thing a few times.

Then something REALLY weird happened. The head of the greyhound one was still stuck in the door. I took my hand, made it into ‘finger-gun’, and ‘pulled the trigger.’

Brains flew out the other side of the thing’s head, and it fell over, dead. 

I aimed my fingers at the scarier looking demon thing… Nothing happened. It didn’t work.

I've never had a ""soundtrack"" to my dream before, that I can recall right now. I heard the music but it wasn't coming from a radio or anything. It just made sense to hear sinister music.

So right after I woke up and took a shower, I worked out this little clip in Ableton Live. I assure you in my dream that it was way scarier. And the main melody instrument....

1324679669.0,12,self.Dreams,nofqf,Almost died in my sleep,15,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/nofqf/almost_died_in_my_sleep/,"This is all a bit hazy (and a bit long, but there's a TL;DR) because I've never experienced anything like what I felt before, and I've never actually tried to write my dreams down because they're very difficult to recall,(I'll be doing so in the future) but this one was unmistakably lifelike, vivid and probably life changing, so here goes. A little background: I just recently moved from California to Baltimore (my home town) and most of the dream takes place in what feels like the time just before I left. Also, I've been experimenting with lucid dreaming for a while, all very positive experiences, but I've never lost control like I did in this dream. I'm not currently on any drugs besides caffeine in moderation, and I have a generally consistent sleep cycle.

Long dream. Many different locations and phases. At some point, I was in my apartment in Los Angeles. It was empty, as if my stuff was packed up for my move back home. My roommate insists that we go out to a party in what felt to me like the well-to-do Orange County suburbs. (This was a pretty regular occurrence in reality, because my roommate is a pick up artist, and for all intents and purposes, a social savant, so I went along with it.)

When we arrive, we go in the house immediately. I got that familiar feeling of being in an unfamiliar place very quickly. (e.g. not knowing where the bathroom is, how to get to where the people I might know were, etc.) but, being that I was in a dream and your ability to rationalize your feelings and make them congruent with your reality is difficult, I wasn't at all perplexed why there were multiple staircases, comfortable furniture in every room, and people filling rooms almost comically as if it were a regular twenty somethings Christmas party in Orange County.

My roommate is chatting someone up immediately in the far end of the room we were in, and an absolutely beautiful brunette walks up to me and says ""Nice shorts."" I look down and I am wearing the red gym shorts that I frequently sleep in. This, for whatever reason, doesn't strike me as odd, and I laugh it off with the girl, telling her ""My roommate didn't give me any time to get ready!"" I finish conversation with her, or maybe she disappeared or I'm not really sure, and I left the house to get pants from my car (because everyone keeps pants in my car.) 

[As an aside, I'm not really pointing out the irrational for the irrational's sake, I'm pointing it out because at no point were these things (though incredibly odd) triggers for lucidity.]

So I get to my car, I open the door and fumble through my backseat and sure enough, balled up, are three pairs of pants. Two of them are black, one of them is light grey. I have a nice black sweater on, so (being fashion conscious, even in my dreams) I opt for the grey ones. I had to do this covertly, as there were people outside, and I don't want to be the guy that changes his pants in the street of a party, (while sober, at least). I open my back door to shield myself from onlookers and I look down and the pants I grabbed are black. In fact, all of them are black. I think to myself: Pants don't just change color, and these were definitely just grey. Further, since when do I keep pants balled up in my car? Even further, I just moved to Baltimore. Why am I in LA right now? *Ohhh, I must be dreaming.*

Easily, anyone who lucid dreams will tell you this is their favorite part. It's like Christmas morning. You wake up (or become aware), and you're excited about the whole new world (materialistic or metaphysical) you're about to discover. I live for it. It makes every lucid dream worth it. 

So, first things first, I get in control of my senses, and then my body. I tell myself, I'm going to take 5 steps forward, and then I do it. I tell myself to make sure I'm in complete control (in my experience, very important) before I start fucking with things I shouldn't. I walk in the house and start exploring. In my dreams, things are always changing without my consent. The scenery, time, people, situations, all can change in a second, and I respect that. However, once my dreams become lucid, most of things (depending on level of lucidity) will remain the same until I either A. stop paying attention or B. want them to.

I find my roommate, but I don't let him know we're dreaming. He's talking to a bunch of people, most of whom I fail to recognize immediately. He's also talking to the brunette that told me about my shorts. She's still a babe, and I want her. I start flirting shamelessly with her and after a barrage of body language and my eradicated fear of rejection (it's a dream.) I take her into the other room and we start making out. It was fantastic and I won't bore you with the details. Afterward, she invites me to her house, and since I don't really want to wake up, and am devoid of other obligation in the dream world, I follow her. 

This is where things start to, covertly, go south. We go outside and my car is gone. Not only that, but it's a completely different setting. Familiar in my memory, but I can't exactly remember where. Maybe the parking lot of a hotel resort of somewhere I vacationed as a kid. Seeing as how this steers far away from the conventions of lucid dreams I normally have, (change of scenery) I probably should have called it quits and woken up right there, but babes, are often a very difficult to resist variable (both in the dream world as well as reality.) I chalked it up to, ""Okay, I just need to pay better attention to what's going on."" and continued. So we walked behind some houses, and she tells me she lives on the next block. I follow blindly, and she is walking just ahead of me. She turns the corner of a fence and three seconds later I turn it too. She's gone. It's pretty dark now and much more vegetated before. Trees with long moss like I remember in South Carolina (Probably where the familiar parking lot comes from.) I didn't think to turn around, and kept going. To the left of me is Orange County suburbs, Christmas lights and palm trees, to the right is the darkest place I've ever seen. I hear my roommate in the woods so I figure maybe he's there with the girl I lost sight of, so I go in. There's a pretty nice pathway set to where I hear the voices, so that eases my fear a bit, and then I find him. 

My field of vision starts to get very constrained, the further I go in, and it's difficult to keep focus or really make anything out, but I see my roommate sitting on a tree stump, smoking a cigarette. I ask him if he's seen the girl and he says he hasn't. Along with my senses diminishing, my ability to control my body has slowly been doing the same, and it's just now becoming noticeable. I start to get scared. This never happens to me in lucid dreams. I think to myself, ""What if this isn't a dream?"" I try to wake up, I feel my real body talking. My real mouth is moving and I'm trying to wake up. I try desperately to lift up my eyelids but I can't. At this point I'm sick to my dreaming stomach. Maybe I *am* awake and lost and dying. I ask my roommate if this is a dream. He looks at me confused. I tell him that I can't control my body, that I'm actually going blind. I scream for help. I scream that I'm dying. I feel my real body sleeping, trying to wake up, I can feel my fingers trying to move, but my dreaming mind is so terrified that I've somehow severed the link between my consciousness and my body that I can't control my real body anymore. I ask him if I'm dying, and he says ""We're all dying."" (My roommate subscribes to determinism philosophically, and he's very objective about stuff like this, so this sounded like something that would come from him in reality, and cemented my theory that I was actually awake and actually going to die.)

I slipped deeper into a state of complete hopelessness until I became content with it. **I feel my real body stop breathing.** I can't express just how surreal this feeling is. I knew that I was asleep in my bed in Baltimore, but I was dying. I thought to myself ""This is what it's like to die in your sleep."" I became thankful that I wasn't going to experience true pain, and that pain I was suffering was being generated by the fear and the loss of control. Once I realized that, death became wonderfully tranquil. I'm not sure if I died in the dream, but I did wake up. I'm not really sure what woke me up, but I'm going to have to do some serious introspection before I attempt to lucid dream again. I'm fairly certain now that it's possible to physically fuck up your nervous system and vital body functions by strictly dreaming, and I can't tell you how absolutely terrifying it is, and wish the experience on not even the bravest of dreamers.

**TL;DR Long realistic dream, became lucid, lost control somewhere along the way, somehow seemingly severed the link between my dreaming mind and sleeping body.**

The roar of the engine gets louder and louder, and the dude isn't sure if he's imagining this or not, so he's freaking out a little. He sinks back into his tattered leather armchair, closes his eyes and suddenly it all goes quiet. Through the window he can't see anything except that the dust has settled, and even with his ear against the thin wall of his shack he can't hear anything from outside, so he steels himself, takes a few deep breaths, and throws the door open to find... nothing. He smiles, turns around, and gets whacked in the back of the head with a blunt object. Cut to black and the opening credits: the film is titled The Prodigal Dude.

 I dreamed me and some other guy who was a friend of mine, were on some kind of tour of strange things in the world. The very last stop of this tour or whatever it was, was this hot tub. People would get inside of this hot tube, and some sort of bath salt looking substance was poured in, the skin of the people in the hot tub would then gradually start to turn blue, and then their appearance would change, and their gender would change opposite to what they are. The men would turn into these beautiful blue women, with very unrealistically perfect bodies. They had large breasts a skinny waste and large hips. The women who would enter the tub, would turn into blue men, except with really small penises, haha this sounds so weird, but it gets stranger. After they would change color and gender, they would automatically be attracted to someone of the opposite gender. The men who changed into women, were now attracted to men, and vice versa. Once they left the tub in their new forms, they would find a partner to have sex with, and once orgasm was reached, they would change back to their normal form, gender and appearance. Me and my friend were asked to get into this tub, and we both refused. After our refusal, some of those who were just in the tub and had been transformed, approached both of us, two naked blue women. They tried to seduce us into sleeping with them and then entering back into the water with them. I absolutely refused, but my friend went through with it.

I was in a bit of a clearing and trying to figure out where I was when I heard a loud, roaring voice scream out ""HEY ROKORIN, HOW'S IT GOING."" To which I responded ""QUITE GOOD, WHY ARE WE YELLING?!"" It was at this moment that I realized two things. I could only speak in a British accent, and I was being yelled at by a t-Rex. So I was a little confused, obviously. But he decided to clear it up with ""BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE JURASSIC PERIOD AND SCREW INSIDE VOICES.""

Science knew there was only one thing to do and called down massive meteors from the sky to wipe out everything.

**Just a little background information before I go on to describe my most recent situation...

I've been in a 3 year relationship with a girl that I truly love. Never met anyone better and she's actually my first girlfriend.
I have developed separate feelings for one or two other girls over the course of our relationship though, but nothing I can't push aside. 

I'm a fairly regular trees user, at least 3-4 times a week recently. 
For some reason on the nights that I haven't smoked anything, I have incredibly vivid dreams and they often tend to develop some sense of lucidity in them, sometimes to the point where I can completely control my actions, but not my initial surroundings and situations.**


Last night I had a dream that I was hanging around with the one of the girls that I used to have some slight feelings for. Nothing was particularly interesting, we were just talking about old times etc. However, I soon realized I was dreaming and started to control the conversation. I decided since this was a dream I would use the opportunity to tell her everything about old feeling I used to have, and she admitted she used to have the same feelings towards me.

We then became romantically involved within the dream, and I was extremely aware that I was going to have to break up with my dream girlfriend or hide it from her to avoid lying (which I hate doing).

Due to the level of lucidity I awoke 3-4 times within the night, but found I could slowly fall back into the dream world.

Before waking for what I knew was going to be last time, we had an extremely emotional goodbye, and I awoke in tears and sweats. I've been rather low ever since, and can't help thinking about the girl during every waking moment.

Does anyone experience similar problems with letting go of alternate versions of reality?

Not since my late teens, early twenties, and I'm 30 now. And wet dreams, well, not since I was 12. Now, like many, when I had lucid dreams when I was young, I would try and turn them into sex dreams. It didn't usually work out so well. Before, if I try to touch them, they'd stop moving. I'd be able to move them and bend them, etc, but it would be like playing with mannequins.

Now, last night, it was weird dream to begin with. It was a fight dream; I was fighting a stream of enemies in an alleyway. It was a corridor of bad guys, I would fight them one after another. I've fought people in dreams before, but not like this. Usually, I beat people really easily in dreams, I'd just find some way to overtake them quickly. These guys I couldn't, I had to keep fighting them. It wasn't that they were dodging or blocking my blows so much as they were withstanding me attacks very well. Eventually I'd get past them.

Now, after a few victories, obviously I know this wasn't real. I'm not really much of a fighter. So I get to a girl, and she wants to fight. I wrestle with her a little bit, and I think.... I'm going to have sex with her. So I start to take her pants off, I reach around and undo the fly on her jeans, and then pull them off from the back.  I do this with relative ease, but she's not like the people in the lucid dreams of my youth, she is struggling a little bit, and she's protesting. However, I'm able to restrain her with unrealistic ease. I am able to put my dick in, and this proceeds. As this is happening, I think... I'm definitely going to put it in her butt. Why not, this is going well, I think. So I take it out, and then in it goes, quite easily. So there's that.

Meanwhile, the dream world still appears to be going on around me. Once I switched holes, I realised I was actually still conscious of the next guy down the alley, and I got very concerned that he was going to come over and start fighting me. He came closer, but he essentially just stands off and watches.

So I continue, not for very long mind you. After a short period, I come... in the dream and in real life. I was slightly alarmed by the sensation, as I'd never experienced it in a dream.

A random person on Steam told me some extremely important boss battle was going down shortly in some MMO I'd never heard of, and that I should help out. This being a dream, I actually signed up. Almost immediately, I found my way to the boss area, where dozens and dozens of people were waiting. They were standing in a giant hall a few yards away from a pair of gates. Not even five minutes passed before the boss walked through them.

The boss turned out to be... that person on Steam who messaged me. A bit taller and bulkier than the average player, with some heavier armor. Nothing too special. Except his attacks were somewhere along [these lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q1XdsrDINE), but in a 3D space. I was fighting from a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, mainly using something like the Quake Live plasma gun, which I can't find a decent clip of. Despite never having played before, I somehow dodged almost all of the boss's attacks AND rarely missed with my own rapidly firing projectiles. All these other people who showed up and presumably had more experience could barely land a hit. Oh yeah, and I appeared to be fighting from the back of an unmoving elephant.

I got the finishing blow with an arrow the one time I used the bow I had. I was thoroughly underwhelmed, but sort of proud. I thought I was a hero, doing most of the work taking out this huge threat that so many people came to take care of. People did seem to be impressed... but they were also angry as hell and had no intention of celebrating.

In this MMO, you could have only one character tied to your account. As part of the plot, a certain percentage of characters were generated with debuffs (cursed) which obviously made things difficult for them. The reward for defeating the boss? Limitless character regeneration, which could remove those debuffs. And there I was, some guy with no debuffs, who hadn't invested any time or interest in the game, cluelessly destroying some lucky player's chance at playing the game without disadvantages.

Well played, boss.

I have not had much sleep the last two nights and this morning I had a few moments of sleep paralysis for the first time. However, the weird part was how my brain reacted.

I heard my alarm going off and became fully awake. I rolled over to climb out of bed and turn my alarm off, or at least I tried to but could not. There was a split second of latency as I realized I could not move and then suddenly I dreamt that I rolled over and climbed out of bed?

Simultaneously, my dream body was conscious and aware that my physical body was still laying in bed. This only lasted a few seconds, but I guess what I am trying to say, is that for a brief moment I was conscious and aware in two places at once. 

Being conscious in two places simultaneously was a very odd feeling and it shocked me awake. There was a moment where I felt my consciousness collapse on itself as I woke up.

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated, I just want the nightmares to stop.",10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1fri71/possibly_nsfw_recurring_rape_theme_in_dreams_any/,"I would like some advice on these violent rape dreams that I (19 F) have been having. I've had quite a few so I'll just explain them all, sorry if this post is lengthy. 

The first rape dream wasn't really me. In the dream I had an identical twin sister. We were eating lunch together, laughing and having fun, when a stranger came up to us and said ""someone is going to rape you and your sister"" (really blunt, right?). All of the sudden I'm locked in a room with no windows. The door is made of steel and locked from the outside. I can hear my sister screaming. I try to get out to save her but there's no way to leave. I'm crying and begging him to stop. Then I wake up.

In the next rape dream I'm at a cafe with some friends. They are telling me to go talk to this guy that had been looking at me for some time. I feel nervous about it, and don't really want to do it, but they convince me. I eventually go up to him and start talking. I still feel uneasy about the situation. After talking to the man for a while, he invites me to his place, I told my friends I didn't think it was a good idea but once again they talk me into it. I go back to his house and he starts to try to get intimate. I say no but he persists. He eventually rapes me. It was very vivid. I remember kicking and screaming. When I woke up I was absolutely terrified, it felt so real.

The third rape dream I had occurred just last night (and finally convinced me to seek advice). I was in some sort of large, stone building, possibly a castle. I was just wandering down the hallways when I decide to open a door. On the other side was one of my old friends, we'll call him Joe. In real life, Joe and I had stopped talking because even though we were both in a relationship with other people, he very obviously liked me. After one incident in which he got very drunk and inappropriately grabbed my ass and tried to kiss me, I decided to end our friendship. Back to the dream world, Joe says hi and tries to talk to me. I tell him I'm not interested in talking to him and he gets mad. He tries to grab me, but I run away. He chases me down the halls and outside to a field. He tackles me and rapes me. Again, it was very vivid and scary.

As long as I can remember I've only had nightmares. They usually come in cycles. I'll have a nightmare almost every night for a week or so, then I won't remember any dreams for months. I'm back on another cycle of nightmares, as I've had 5 in the past 7 days. Usually the nightmares are me observing bad things happening to other people, or of me dying. The rape nightmares are new, and they terrify me more than the other dreams. I should mention that my biggest fear is being raped, so that probably plays a big role in these dreams. I just want some advice on how to make them stop, or how to deal with them. 

Again, sorry for the wall of text. I figured it would be best to tell you about all of the dreams to give you further insight.

I want to get a tattoo that will somehow commemorate my cats, and I'm drawing designs. Suddenly I have three cats, as if there was one between Genie and Stanzi. I just know this isn't right - I only have had two cats. Okay now in my dream I'm back to having two cats.


Then I decide to move to protect my two real cats from another act of violence. My mom helps me set up the new apartment. I tell her about the dead cat, and she laughs and says ""that's funny."" I try to explain to her how its actually very sad.


I'm in my new apartment, and it's the hugest I've ever lived in. My first night there, I wake up to a man in my bed. I know him in my dream but not in waking life. I ask him if its really him, and he's really back. He says yes and we have sex. I can feel his buzzed head and muscles. I never see his face. 


I wake up, and am alone. I look to my right and see the mystery man cuddled up next to my mom. I go outside, and I see a fountain with a bunch of Navy, Army, Marine guys singing songs.

When I entered, I just simply lost all the energy I usually have, and collapsed on the floor of the room I started in.

I wake up, in my room, (Still in a dream) pull the covers off, and see a body that isn't mine, I try to change it back in to a body that I would be pleased with, but instead it turned worse, and became a very cute female body.

I couldn't go out like this or anything, so I did my best to bandage up my chest, corset, cut my hair and put on my uniform. I looked like a very feminine boy, but still a boy at least. I passed the day pretty cleanly, I went to bed, tried to change my body, nothing happened, than another day went by, than weeks, one day, I signed up for skiing club at my school. In order to compete in ski-jumping, I had to live in the dorms at school. I started to live there, until my roommate changed with another dude, a very big dude, and he told me that he liked me. (He thought I was a boy.)

Weeks later, I'm climbing into my bunk, than fall asleep, I wake up (Still dreaming) to him on-top of me, with a hand around half my face, telling me to be quiet, than he says that how I've been so cute, than he says he was going to make me feel good, I was frightened to tears, what if he found out? I agree to consent, and than he starts to pull down my shorts,

I whipped him with my legs, and kicked him off the bed. My leg-strength was immense, I jump down, and tell him not to try that again, than he charges and I kick him in the face, three times. He collapses, and than blood pours, I didn't like blood, so I started to sob and than run out of the dorms, than finally it ended.

Married to my high school sweetheart, but we each attended different schools. I was in color guard (the flag twirling kind, not the ROTC kind) and he played baseball. We currently have one special needs 9 year old and one nuerotypical 18 mo old. We had some fertility problems (related to my diet and general health) when trying for number 2, and want to try for a 3rd after we are better off financially.

Now for the dream. I am pregnant in this dream. We start off in Walmart. I am wearing his yellow shirt from his adult softball league, but no pants. I am carrying sweat pants and a can of dr pepper. We are browsing the camping section, I think, when I put on the pants and drink the can of dr pepper. I am afraid people will think I am stealing so I am looking around for anyone coming at me. My husband buys a drink and we get into an old van (I think it was white) and drive off. 

We are really bored but can't go home (I don't know why), so we start looking for a deserted place to park and have sex. We find what looks like a dead end alley and pull in. Suddenly, the fence at the dead end lifts like a gate and cars start coming in. 

We leave and drive some more, before parking behind a large brick building. There is a ""fire escape"" made of bricks (no metal) that has no door into the building...more like just some random brick stairs on the back of the building. We start to climb them and as we reach the top, we've aged backwards. I am still pregnant, but we are high school age again.
We're just standing around up top, looking around when we hear music. Marching band music. My husband runs down the stairs to investigate. He comes running back to the bottom of the stairs saying that our marching band is going to make us both take our finals, even though we've been excused due to my pregnancy (not sure why he was excused as well). Just then the band rounds the corner and the director demands we take the final. Husband tries to reason with him on my part to no avail. I agree to come down and take the test, and the stairs suddenly get much steeper as I try to go down. The director keeps my husband from coming to assist me. As I am making my way down, a giant ""slender man-ish"" figure appears behind me to ""help."" I am trying to go fast enough that he can't touch me, but slow enough to keep my balance (hard to do when preggo).  A voice says ""You know what you have to do to keep me, to save me."" A few steps later, it says ""Save me! This is in you!""

Suddenly there is a loud sound that startles the figure behind me and he lurches forward. He knocks into me and I begin to fall forward. As I am in mid air, the scene freezes. The voice says ""You knew what you had to do to save me. You knew, but you didn't do it. You've lost me, and this is on you.""

Just a weird dream, or could it have meaning? I though perhaps it's my guilt over not taking better care of myself, thus causing the fertility issues (some miscarriage involved as well, before I knew about the problems), and I have also thought it could have something to do with my marriage. It's been under some stress lately, due to financial issues. Husband has been out of work for almost two years with no luck in sight. My job doesn't even pay our bills. Our situation is a time bomb, which can stress even the best relationships.

Any ideas?

My friend, Tyler, and I were wandering around a huge embassy suites. It was easily 100 stories tall, however everything appeared to be normal. We were walking down the hallway and saw a stairwell door ajar next to the ice machine. So Tyler suggests we check it out. 

All the lights were off in the stairwell except for the red emergency lights. We walk in and the air is hot and damp and there is this constant dripping noise. On the landing to the left, there is an early '00s dell laptop. Tyler, almost mesmerized, walks over and sits down with it. I say ""Dude, this is creepy, just take the laptop and lets go."" He agrees and when he goes to unplug the laptop, there is no outlet. The cable just runs into the wall. Tyler says, ""Hey man, just go ahead. I'll be just a minute."" Then I ask what floor we are on, so that I can go back to our room. He tells me and I head down the stairs.

When I finally reach our floor. I open the door, only to find that the hotel has taken a similarity to the stairwell. All of the walls are a yellowish-green tinge, the carpet has changed from an emerald green to a crimson red and all of the lights are flickering. I make my way down the hallway and look over the edge. Where the lobby used to be, there is just a black abyss.
I make my way down the hallway and hear grunting from an open room. I cautiously peer inside to with a man his leg bent the opposite way. The shower is running at an unbearable volume, almost to the point of static and the man is screaming and grunting and staring me in the eyes. I run down the hall knocking on all the doors to get help, but no one answers. I am now directly across from his room on the opposite side of the hotel and see that his room is empty. No screaming man, no running shower. No nothing. I look over and see the ice machine and enter the stairwell.

I make it up the stairs and back to tyler. A pallid, blue light illuminates his face, eyes glued to the laptop in a glassy stare. ""Tyler"", I say aloud. Again, ""Tyler"". He appears to be back to normal. ""Holy Fuck! I just saw the most fucked up thing downstairs, man."" I explain to tyler what happened and he has this look of familiarity with it. It seems weird to me, so I ask him what he was doing on the laptop while I was dealing with this guy downstairs. He says, ""Uh you know, just some stuff. Nothing important, really."" So I'm like alright man, well lets get back to the room. This place is creepy. He says, ""Nah man, I kind of like it in here, I think i'm gonna stay for a little while."" He goes and sits down with the laptop. I think to myself, ""Whatever, fuck this. Im going back where we came from."" So I walk open the stairwell door and walk out.

To my relief, everything is back to normal. I walk down the hallway and look over the edge to see the lobby downstairs is full of people. The carpet is emerald green again and the wall are back to the egg-shell white. I make my way down a different stairwell to my floor. I make my way to my room and open the door. I am met with a blisteringly-loud metallic grinding noise and a woman screaming with pleasure, impaled through her stomach by the bedpost. I feel ice-cold and turn around to vomit. As i lean over the railing, I see the black abyss. I freak out and look at the carpet, which is now a crimson red and the woman in the room is just staring at me, still impaled, smiling. 

I run back to the stairwell, book it up the stairs, and over to the ice machine. I burst in the stairwell door and yell, ""tyler, dude we gotta leave, now! this place is bad. really really bad."" Tyler has his eyes locked to the screen and is smiling incessantly. He looks up slowly and I know that he knows what I just saw. He says, with a chilling calmness, ""I've been watching things. Things on the internet. Bad things and I like it."" His eyes move back to the laptop and I am terrified. I starting running down the stairs, flight after flight. Every doorway is filled with some horrible, violent scene. I just try not to look as i keep running down the stairs. I eventually reach the bottom and the stairs end with a drop off to a huge pit full of squirming, disfigured bodies. I know that this is the point of no return. There is no getting out of there. I heard slow footsteps behind me, and tyler is walking slowly, as if in a trance. He walks to the final stair and stops. He looks at me, glassy eyed and says, ""I'm finally happy"", and steps off of the ledge.

                                   I am asleep.
It's hot. A dry heat. The high yellow sun beats down on the desert and the distant rocks. I'm in Arizona. Perhaps New Mexico. I'm sitting on a lawn chair, one of those cheaply made animals that are all plastic cords and rusty metals, one of those mysterious pieces of household chattel that no one ever seems to buy, yet always has. There is an old, somewhat forlorn trailer behind me. I can tell that this sagging structure was white at one time, however the yellow sands had tarnished it and formed it into a dirty smile, a smoker's smirk. The door in the middle of the trailer opens and out comes a Man. I am not surprised at this. He is old, impossibly old but moves with the ease of a young man. He peers out at me through bushy dark eyebrows. His face is deeply lined and very kind. His hair, which is held together in the back, is long and fiercely black with streaks of white, obsidian and snow. If His looks did not already give the secret away, his dress and demeanor has. He is Native American. When He is at the bottom of the stairs I stand. He smiles at me and speaks.
""You are ready to learn."" It is a statement.
I am standing close to Him, very close. I can smell Him. He smells strongly of nicotine and more subtly of peppermint and something else, perhaps whiskey.
""I will teach you how to walk behind the world.""
Surprise must have registered on my face because at this moment He laughs. A good, hearty laugh. A laugh that spreads and is immediately and immodestly addictive.
""Let's begin.""
He starts to sing in low warm tones. The tune is ancient and comfortable. The words are guttural and foreign. He walks in a small circle as he sings and lifts his hands up and down three times. Sky, earth, sky, earth, sky, earth. The world trembles and sways and there in front of me is the back of the world as if it had been there all along. Had it? We walk behind the world.
The light is muffled here, it is dark. I can see through to world. It is like looking at a stage behind a heavy drop. It is very still here and cool, my skin prickles a bit. He is next to me. He speaks.
""From here you can go to any time and any place that you wish, for all time is happening at once and all places are no further than your heart is from your head. Do you not know this to be true.""
""I know this to be truth."" I say, speaking for the first time.
Sound is muffled here.
""Once you have made your choice, this will seem like smoke in the wind. I will seem like a dream. Do not fight this. You will learn many lessons on your travels. Once you have learned perfectly the instruction that the particular pin-prick of time that you have chosen has to offer, you will remember. Then you will sing, then you will dance, then you will walk behind the world. Sing.Dance.Walk Behind The World. Have you chosen?""
""Yes."" I reply.
""I will be here waiting for you when you return.""
I walk back into the world.

I'm at an opening to those new spin-off films that has Reddit buzzing for the past couple of days.
Big Wigs are on stage talking it up with a lot of costumed people, dressed as figures from said new Star Wars movies, entertaining the crowd.
It was opening day after all.

So queue this one guy who reminded me of Count Dooku saying something along the lines of 'Oh this is not a mere movie.' He suddenly got fierce. Dooku went and reached for his waist, where he unlatches his lightsaber.

The lightsaber was Spaceballs flexible, but super terrifying. Because it was doing it's thing. Being able to cut shit nearly instantly. So it's more like a rigid-on-command laser whip.

Mother fucking Dooku wraps it around the neck of the guy with the mic on stage. I don't know if the dude was the director/someone important, he was just a figure with a forgettable face. It *burns* his neck and the end of the saber/whip presses itself down vertically along his head. Dooku heat-shears this guyin half down to his chest!

Everyone is freaking out. But it gets worse. And morbidly hilarious.

You know how lightsabers use cool crystals to power themselves? The crystals provide the color characteristics too? Well Dooku wanted to obtain the resources to create another saber. Maybe he had an apprentice to give the crystal to.

Did I mention that in my dream, the crystal is replaced with human penis? That's where that damn MRI gif comes into play. I dream up a cut-a-way, Mortal Combat x-ray style, where Dooku rips out the split in half guy's innards. Namely, his genitals.

That's why his was flexible and shit. Penises are uh, flexible and hard too.

That's all my brain wanted to express to me.

There was some kind of ceremony with a 4 HUGE Samoan dudes in loin cloths, playing these giant drums at each corner of the room. They were impossibly muscular, like he-man on steroids. It was inside this giant wigwam type building. I think I was supposed to be on vacation there. Some tour guide or voice told me the village's power came from this ceremony (probably in a metaphorical sense).

In the corner of the room was another muscular guy but he wasn't Samoan, he was white. He said something like ""everyone has a doppleganger"" and proceeded to hand me the dead/unconscious body of his clone/identical twin. He gets up and tells my group to follow him, we seem to be going on a tour of sorts. A friend helps me carry the body of the dude's clone. 

I see we're now in sort of an upscale home instead of a wigwam. It's a huge building and the weird guy keeps leading us through confusing twists and turns, all while we're shlepping this corpse for some reason. I notice he's walking faster and the geometry of the house is also getting weirder. 

It occurs to me that the man is trying to escape us. I run after him but the twists and turns get really MC Escher-esque and he loses me. I find myself  in a room with two women in formal dresses. The woman in the center of the room is wearing a white abstract rectangular mask and the woman by the wall is wearing a white cat mask. The cat-masked woman pulls out a desert eagle and executes the other one in front of me. Then I woke up.

I was walking through a suburban neighbourhood on a sunny day I didn't recognize the place, but I knew I was going somewhere, just wasn't sure where exactly. Then I turn and walk down a driveway and enter the house.

When I enter the house there are a few people in there, not real but I identify them as friends. I ask on of these friends where two other friends are (again I don't know who those people are in real life) and she says they went out back because they were taking acid. For some reason this made me angry and I was like ""What!? Where's the acid!?"" and she just said ""Over there"" gesturing to a small wooden table against the wall at the back of the room.

On the table there was a wooden bowl, in the bowl there was a large envelope (The kind you might receive paperwork or forms in) that didn't really fit in the bowl. I opened the envelope and inside there was a whole sheet of tabs, with a bunch removed randomly from the corner. I stared at the sheet of tabs for a minute then I put the other corner on the same end of the sheet as the removed corner in my mouth and sucked on the whole thing, I have no idea why.

I felt it begin taking effect right after I put the sheet back and I headed for the back door. I exited to find that the house was actually right on the beach, despite the tightly clustered neighbourhood behind me, the houses on this side of the road were lined all along the beach, but you couldn't tell from the rest of the neighbourhood.

There wasn't much actual beach there, there was about 30ft of sand from the house to the water, and for some reason it was night time now. I walked along the beach to find my afforementioned friends, as things became more intense I noticed there was a very steep drop in the sand almost immediately in the water, then I saw it. It was a small narrow dock that extended from the sand, I had walked right past it and only noticed because I'd turned around to survey the huge drop. And at that dock there was a shark, waiting like a boat. Then I noticed the red eyes and segmented body. It was a fucking robot shark, waiting to be ridden. There was no real effort in communicating actions to it, it knew where I wanted to go and I had complete control.

This was fucking awesome, but I had ridden it out so far into the ocean as I was caught up in the moment and upon noticing other sharks swimming around in the water I began to really regret, that's when I heard thunder rumbling. The water was getting more choppy and I could see lighting in the distance, one hell of a storm was brewing. I wanted to ride all the way back to shore because of all the other sharks, but there was no way I could get back in this storm. I had to fight the other sharks.

So I did, I fought those sharks all night, the robot shark dove in and out of the water, tearing the other sharks to pieces with it's robotic jaws, it was fucking epic. It ended sometime after that, but I don't remember exactly.

Anyway that's what happened, don't care for an interpretation but if you really think it means something feel free to tell me.

I casually walked up the dock and got on the shark, I grabbed the dorsal fin and it immediately began to swim, extremely fast. I was controlling the robot shark with my mind, telepathically I guess, but it was like the shark was an extension of my body, there was ",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_17f2pu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/17f2pu/riding_a_robot_shark_in_the_middle_of_a_storm/,
1358795885.0,8,self.Dreams,17064m,I had the saddest dream I've had in a long time last night.,11,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/17064m/i_had_the_saddest_dream_ive_had_in_a_long_time/,"I'd even go so far as to say saddest ever. Ever since my Mom died last year, I'd been having dreams where I'd see her again and then in the dream realized I was dreaming because she was in it and I ""knew"" she was dead and then I'd wake up. This dream last night was even more heart wrenching than that feeling. (Even though this dream isn't about a lost parent, I wanted to put that in here so you might have some reference on the amount of emotion I felt when I woke up.)

I was walking down this long hallway with several people in it. I think there was a previous part to this dream but that has begun to fade already. Near the end of the hallway was a man in a costume. It sorta looked like a fat suit with a ""head piece"" so he was entirely in the suit. The zipper for it went across the top of the head from left to right. It wasn't as creepy as it sounds. I felt at first drawn to this figure slightly.

As I got closer to the figure it got a bit smaller and when I reached him he was about half sized. Not a dwarf per se, but just a smaller man. He was being held in the arms of another person, being carried like a baby with his legs wrapped around the persons waist and arms around the neck. I reached out and unzipped the suit and it came off of him. He looked like a normal adult person underneath. Once the suit was off my hands were drawn to him. I couldn't stop touching his leg or arm. I felt I had to be close or in contact with this person some how.

I’m not sure why but this started to scare me, so I pulled away. First I put my hands down by my side and slowed down my walking. (The entire time we are all, the two of us, me and the guy carrying the guy, still walking forward.) When I still felt the urge, I put my hands behind my back, but the draw was still there so I slowed down almost to the point of stopping. 

It was at this point tha the man carrying the guy said something like, “No you need to be together.” Or it might have been, “You need to let this happen.” I don’t remember because I was feeling scared and anxious. I had fully stopped moving at this point and was pressed with my back against the wall of the hallway. The man stopped as well and started to come close to me, pressing the smaller man who I was feeling an incredible draw towards against me.

Here’s where it gets a bit difficult to explain. From the moment that a large enough portion of this man’s body began to touch mine, I started to feel different. Picture that you, inside your body was the entire Universe. All the stars and nebula and planets all swirling and moving and living and dying inside you. That is what I felt like. Like I was large and immense and full of well, everything. As the man touched me, I realized in my head that he was the same, another Universe that was coming into contact with mine, with me. However, he was not a different one, but the same one that I was. We were the exact same Universe down to the last molecule. Once this realization passed over me I began to realize that this whole time that I was only a shadow of a Universe. I was there but without Soul. I had the substance of the Worlds in me, but something was missing. 

The draw to this other Person/Universe was so great now that I dare not stop. We began to merge, to join as one. Each of our planets and stars overlapping and fusing with each other. My solid matter with his essence. We became the whole. Like we were half people that didn't realized we were half until we found the half we were missing.

The merging finished with an audible click sound, and at that moment we became one and a new voice emerged in my head. I had the image of an alien like creature speaking, floating in space, so large it took up solar systems. It was kinda shaped like MewTwo (for anyone that knows Pokemon). It announced that it was complete and it was whole and the feeling that washed over me was one of utter amazement and JOY.

Then I heard the man man who was carrying the other man say something like, “It’s too bad the other specimen is flawed. It has some sort of residue.” That is when it all starts to fall apart. I sense the great creature inside me. Not that it IS me, which is what I was feeling just moments before. And it starts to pull away. In my head I start screaming, No! No! Come back! Don’t leave me!, but I am just like a piece of skin, a piece of husk that was attached. I begin to fall away from the creature that used to be me, and it’s going further away. Everything I was is gone, and I am nothing but an empty piece of skin on the ground, screaming and wailing but no one hears me because I am not only all alone, but I have no body or mouth anymore. I am consciousness in a cast off piece of flesh.

I start to tell her in the morning about my dream and she goes white, to which I tell her I'll stop if she is uncomfortable hearing it. It's then she tells me that she had a dream the same night that her sister died and she didn't know why.

In my dream, I realized I could renovate this extra area of my yard and turn it into an outdoor yoga/meditation practice area to hold classes and invite other Buddhists/yogis for meditation and yoga. It would only take some top soil and some sod and a little tlc and this space could be perfection. I had decided that I would begin working on this as soon as I got back home from work.

 Several of us were on a tour of this resort town that was considered to be haunted. A group of 5 or 6 enthusiasts, guided by an elderly woman with long greasy black hair are coursing through this place nervously, while this lady explains that no one has been able to enter any of  the cabins in over 50 years as some type of force was making them impenetrable, and that we were to keep our distance from the buildings. The windows on the homes, although cracked, were unable to be broken, and whenever someone got near one of the houses, you would hear wolves howling from inside.

He threw the keys to the ground and we continued the tour, we came across one old cabin near the beach, and I noticed the address was #4, and as soon as I saw that and pointed it out to the group, out of nowhere this mangy black Sheppard  type dog came running excitedly from to me. I love dogs, so I started to play with him as we walked back to get that key from earlier. He was very friendly, and was acting like he hadn't seen a human in years. We got the key, but as we were approaching the cabin, this dog started becoming agitated, and biting my hand harder and harder. I thought he was just wanting me to keep playing with him, but the closer we got, he was starting to bite me too hard, and I pushed him away. He became very persistent and was jumping around at my feet and biting both of my hands. I walked up the front steps to this cabin, and as I was about to unlock the door, the dog snatched the keys out of my hands and ran to the bottom of the steps, sat down, and stared at me. All of a sudden we could hear what seemed like a hundred wolves howling intensely from inside the cabin. Then out of nowhere, a larger, older version of Anthony Hopkins came from behind the building, and told us that the dogs aggression was a warning sign that we were NOT to enter this place. I acknowledged this, but became annoyed, because I didn't like being told what to do. I kicked a window on the house trying to break it, but I had no strength and I instantly became exhausted and tired, and the group told me to relax, and stop what I was doing. I was seemingly trying to provoke the wolves/spirits inside by making loud noises, but I was unable to do this, as something had stolen all of my energy. Being confused, angry, and frustrated, I started walking away from the group, then when I turned back, Anthony Hopkins had shot the black dog, and killed it. Being an animal lover I ran up to him, and started punching him in the face and screaming at him, but I still had no strength. He calmly told me that he did it because the dog didn't know how to fish, and there was no other source of food for him, so it was best that he be put down. I started crying, and when I woke up, I continued to cry for another few minutes. I got out of bed and as I was telling my roommate what had just happened, I broke down crying again for seemingly no reason at all.

During the 'daytime' in my dream, she was fine, but at 'nighttime' she would try to strangle me and drain the life from me. In the 'morning' she would apologize and I would go take a shower. While doing so, she would turn out the lights and throw things at me, dead things or knives or decaying matter.

It's sort of like I'm dreaming... a feeling. It's impossible to explain a feeling that there is no word for, but to oversimplify it, it's a feeling that is a chemical combination of morbidity with intense fear and sorrow. When I wake up I feel like I am responsible for the death of everyone on the planet on an individual basis.

The first time it happened I was about 10/11 years old and I ran to my mom's room and wouldn't stop crying for a long time and I couldn't explain (still can barely explain) what it was that I had dreamt.

This is achieved through my, sort-of.... ""cutting the planet in half"" in my dream, as in, the planet in my dream is already separated in two and everything's okay but then I come along and I push one of the halves away from the other without actually knowing that I'm doing it. There is a thin line connecting both halves of the planet. But in the middle of pushing one of the planet's halves away, I suddenly realize what I have done and for some reason I feel like I've killed each and every individual in the world (not talking about the detached ""number of people dead"" type of thing but rather as in I am actually responsible for each of those people's unique death) and it all rushes at me at the exact same time.
 
This, combined with the feeling that I'm small and insignificant (like the line connecting the two halves of the planet), is the feeling that this dream evokes in me.  

I am getting more used to it now that I realize it's just a dream and keep telling myself that after I wake up to calm myself... but this feeling... I've never felt anything like it before and I'm wondering if I'm the only person to have ever felt it.

I know this is not making a lot of sense but that's because, as I said, my dream is that of a feeling rather than a specific, established action or object and it's hard to explain a feeling that you've never heard of or imagined before.

i step inside the house and the old grandmother is catatonic once again and the rest of the family is sitting in front of the tv. as if nothing was happening in the back yard. i begin to scream at them,  wondering why nobody came to my rescue while i was tied outside for days on end. the two women merely looked at me and smiled. they act like they didnt even hear me screaming at them. 

i suddenly get a hold on myself and run for the front door, keys in hand- the grandmother never bothered to take them from me. i reach my car, slip inside and turn it on and peel out of the driveway into the neighborhood. i make several turns, knowing the roads well. usually. but somehow, i seemed to keep coming back to the house that i was trying to be far away from. nothing i did and no road i took lead me away from it, i was stuck.

Ok, so in my dream I am present in my official work capacity.  I'm there with my big professional camera equipment ready to work.
I'm in a very clean, white bathroom.


There is a normal looking college-aged girl there who I am supposed to be filming.  As far as I can remember, she doesn't really look like anyone I know.  Also there is an older female doctor, but she stays off camera.  The college aged girl then proceeds to slit her wrists and bleed out.  After about 30 seconds or so, she applies bandages/gauze or whatever to stop the bleeding.  She consults with the doctor for a brief moment and then reopens her wounds and bleeds out some more.  This process repeats a few times, with the girl growing weaker and weaker each time.  Until eventually she ends up bleeding out and dying.  And then the doctor puts her up on the counter and begins dissecting her.  The whole time (before she dies) I'm FREAKING OUT at the girl, asking her things like ""Why are you doing this?!  Are you dying of cancer or something and you want to donate your body?!  This is wrong!""
And she does not answer.
And I'm supposed to be filming this entire sequence of events.

Suddenly someone got the idea that if we all traced our collective paths, we could find their origin, like our creation, big bang, whatever you want to call it. Everyone started bouncing around and spreading the message, and soon a ton of people started turning around and heading back the way they came.

It got to the point that every other light particle was like a force/tide that was pulling me in to the middle. I actually dreaded finding out how light/life started, and I got cold feet. I did as light particles are prone to do, and continued straight in a random direction through space just to get away from it all. I could sense that the others had seen it, but I kept going.

I met some other loner particles that were flying through space, but none of us were truly parallel, and they all eventually faded out of sight. I reached the edge of the universe, and as I was flying through darkness, the only spark of life in a huge void, the only thing I could think was,

""What if I’d gone to the center? What would I have learned? Would it have been too much, fried my brain, made me recombine with the other light particles and start a new big bang?""

I knew the phones wouldn't work but I tried anyways. They didn't work. I had to email him but I had a panic attack that I was going to die in my sleep and no one would ever know why. That's when I woke up. There are so many more details that I cannot include because I just had the dream but still have school tomorrow. But if interest is shown I'll include the whole thing, as much as i can remember. Please, forgive me for grammar and spelling but I am crying right now and I'm afraid I will die in my sleep. Please, please give me advice. I promise to include everything if people do care, just give the dream a chance. Thank you for your time if you are reading this.

",17,7,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/q6t8h/i_dream_a_lot_but_this_was_probably_the_best_most/,"I will preface this by saying that, though I plan to write this as a story, I remember only bits and pieces of this dream, but what I do remember is very distinct and easy to explain. 

I was in Virginia, and I am not from nor have I ever been to Virginia. Though I did not *really* know any of the people that were with me, I did not feel alone. We were in a really rural part of Virginia, and I remember thinking that I would normally feel a bit uncomfortable with myself in an area such as that, but I did not feel that way. Something was very different, and I could not put my finger on it at first, but it was good. 

Everything was different. Everything was brighter. We had stopped somewhere to rest, but it wasn't like a hotel. It wasn't really a house, either. It had a communal feel to it. As if everyone was there, but no one was from there. I felt like we were heading towards something..something big. But I don't know *exactly* what it was, but it was good. 

We had to continue on our journey, but some of them came with us. And then there were mountains and rivers. I got swept away by the current, but it wasn't scary, and I knew I would be ok. There was an older lady there, and we talked. It felt good. 


The dream ended before we got to where we were going, but I don't need to know, because I understand *what* had happened. 

It was as if humanity, people as a whole, had **finally** come to a collective understanding. We had the answers, and there was no longer reason to fear.. or fight. People were *all* good.

It seemed like a normal day in the life dream where I just lived my life as usual, going to class and hanging with friends at their place or at my house, sometimes alone. But this child, a small boy about age 4 or 5 looking who's eyes were huge and orange, with no other facial features that either weren't there in the first place or I cannot remember correctly. Anyway, he followed me around all day, and would say... horrifying things in a sort of demonic voice. The kind you see in one of those Exorcism movies, like several different voices in one embodiment. I remember so many things he said, but a couple examples are:

My girlfriend and I would be walking into my house and see my father, who would nicely greet us and continue his merry way. The kid would scream ""He wants to fuck you he wants to fuck you and your fucking bitch"" ... He loved cursing. If I ignored him he kept screaming, he only stopped when I looked at him.

I would be sitting in my bedroom, (keep in mind I live with a bunch of family) and my cousins room is right next to mine. The kid would start yelling ""Your cousin is doing drugs and having sex right now you should fucking join her you bastard, you know you want to.. imagine how amazing it would be.... imagine... imagine..."" WEIRD shit like that. He would keep saying the ""key"" phrase of his ramblings until I looked at him. 

If I was ever walking with him, he would sort of.. float by my side. Saying random things about people walking by, like ""That guy wants your ass so much, you should let him fuck you bastard, fucker.. ""
""That girl, fucking take her and rape her in the street nothing will happen you fucking MORON... rape... rape.. RAPE... RAPE""

I woke up at about 3 am, turned on the light expecting to see the kid but he wasn't there. Couldn't go back to sleep, freaked my ass out.

My adventure started with me stepping out my front door to be greeted with war. The sun was locked in eclipse, and hardly visible through the smoke billowing up from the city that burned in the distance. Screams filled the air as innocents came under vicious attack from demonic creatures. I was horrified, I didn't know what to do but I knew *something* had to be done.

From here the dream jumped elsewhere to a gruesome scene.The cultists that had ushered in Armageddon ritually sacrificed themselves only to immediately rise again with terrifying power and eyes that burned like the embers of a hungry fire. There was another to be sacrificed; a woman I didn't really recognize, but knew she was a figure of some power and importance. As they flooded her bloody body with magic, a gateway suddenly exploded out of her body with force enough to turn her into nothing more than a red mist. The gate resembled a terrifying, gaping maw. Fangs surrounding the shimmering portal, flaming eyes resting above and accompanied by the sound of a great beast's heavy breathing.

In the time between me walking out of my door and this Hellmouth appearing I had seemingly acquired a small army of resistance fighters and crude weaponry. Shortly after the gate appeared, I signaled an attack and we were locked in a short but intense battle with the few (yet very powerful) cultists. The element of surprise gave us the edge we needed and we overcame them with minimal loss of life. We regrouped and stood before the gate. Every man and woman beside me stood terrified, knowing they faced certain and horrific death, but that through that gate was the only chance we had to save our homes. I was the first to step through.

The other side resembled an enormous cavern that went on forever. The heat was nearly unbearable, and the air was filled with a tortured ambiance. Only one person stood on the other side to greet me. Death, in a [grim-reaper](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s1XXaMaTWq0/Tb_PZhJtCnI/AAAAAAAAAN8/m6aw1p6YFiw/s1600/Grim_Reaper2.jpg) visage. Instinctively I attacked, and he fell apart into a pile of bones. We marched on, our presence seemingly unnoticed. We didn't encounter much for a very long while, until we turned a corner to face a narrow bridge (think the Bridge of Khazad-dum, but only about 15 feet above another floor) with a large creature guarding one end. This thing looked invincible and we knew we had no chance against it. Not having any fucking clue what I was doing or why I did it, I told my men to stay back around the corner. I picked up a large stone and hurled it at the beast and yelled at it, to get all it's attention at me. I then jumped down off the bridge to the floor below and led it away so everyone else could cross.

I eventually shook it off of my tail and circled back around to try and catch up with everyone. I found the bridge again and crossed, and on the other side was greeted with a few very large ""stairs"", roughly 10 feet tall. After struggling to climb up them, fighting off a number of small imp-ish demons that proved little more than a nuisance, I found myself looking down another long bridge, steep walls a few feet on either side, but with bottomless gaps between. Corpses of a number of resistance fighters littered the bridge. I began to make my way across, avoiding the grasping arms reaching out from the walls seeking to pull me over the side and to my death.

As I'm moving across I see Death again, hanging out from a hole in the left wall. He was casting some sort of spell on one of my companions. He drained her soul into a box, and was beginning to seal the still-living body away in a stone coffin. I sprinted to them as fast as I could and, catching Death off-guard again, broke him apart into a pile of bones. As he was slowly reassembling himself I was just barely able to throw off the stone lid, throw the body onto my shoulders, pocket the box, and run away as fast as I could.

On the other side, for some reason or another there were a couple of ""healers"" that I left my comrade and the box with, knowing they would fix things up. I moved on and met the rest of my force standing in front of what appeared to be an huge military facility. There seemed to be humans in lab coats moving around down there! What was going on? We made our way down, encountering zero resistance from the other humans (they ran away, we left them alone), and even stranger still the place seemed almost like a giant *greenhouse*. It was filled with plants. Some strange and alien and horrifying, some absolutely normal.

Making our way through this enormous complex we turned into a series of hallways. As soon as we stepped in we knew something was about to go horribly wrong so we started to run. Surely enough, the door behind us sealed shut and large flesh-eating [BEES FROM HELL](http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/beesp1.gif) poured out of vents above us. I lost a lot of good people to those hell-bees. Devoured down to the bone in seconds. Only a handful of us made it to the end, just barely getting through a closing door before it sealed. Out of probably 100 of us that started, only a dozen or so remained.

This new area we were in was very strange. There were humans walking around, but they seemed absent of anything that made them human. They shuffled about, like lost children. Soulless, expressionless. Scars on their heads hinted at cruel experimentation. Walking through this crowd a little bit I spotted something out of the corner of my eye. A girl, standing in front of a wall of rose bushes. She wasn't especially pretty (being zombie-ish and all), what drew my attention was the way she was *looking* at those roses. Like she was trying to remember something she couldn't understand. In my curiosity I went to take a closer look. There's was still something human in her, and it was sad to see. I took her hand and held it out, pulled a rose from the wall, put it in her hand and closed her fingers around it. She continued to stare at it, never taking her eyes off of it. Still with a sad, lost look on her face like she couldn't remember *why*. From that point on she followed behind my group, like she was waiting to be led somewhere where she might find whatever it is she was looking for. Never taking her eyes off of her rose.

We reached an exit, and set up a basic camp in the caverns. There were dead trees around us and it seemed to get colder so we built a fire and rested. I took first watch, and I pulled out a guitar (I have no idea where I got it) and started to quietly play. After a little while the zombie-girl started to *sing*. Beautifully, mournfully. I'd never heard anything like it. Everyone woke up and just stared at her as she sang. 

The dream ended here, I don't know what happened afterwards or if we ""won"" or all just ended up dying in our sleep. It's a shame, I would've loved to know the end. It's not often that I dream and even less often that I remember even a single detail about that dream. This one really stuck out and has been in my head ever since. I really wanted to write it down before I began to forget it. I also feel like pointing out that I'm an atheist, and I don't believe in an afterlife. However I *love* the imagery associated with it. The whole aspect of good vs. evil, dark vs. light, etc. is very appealing to me.

I am standing in a vast wasteland. Almost desertlike. An empty highway stretches as far as I can see, in front of me. There is an off-ramp to my left, and one on the right. Visible from the highway, on the left side, is a tall cube of earth. It extends from the ground. On top of it is what appears to be a utopia of sorts. I can see rainbows, butterflies, and waterfalls. To the right of the highway is a single roller coaster loop. If I head left, i'm walking. If I head right, i'm driving.

The first couple of times I had the dream, I resisted the urge to visit the paradise on the left. In driving through the roller coaster loop, I realized a piece of the roller coaster track was mssing while coming down and got so terrified, I woke up in a cold sweat. The third time I had the dream,  I headed to ""paradise,"" but at the top were monsters, darkness, dead things and fog. It was like I was lured into a trap. 

Finally, I got brave enough to drive the entire loop, and instead of crashing head-on into the ground, I continued after jumping track. Suddenly, I was in a town that seemed almost post apocalyptic. It was an old town in the sense that the time the dream took place was in the far future. Everything was dusty and dry.

I still dream about this place sometimes, casually chatting with people in the town. I call them ""the other survivors.""

Not sure what this dream means, but it always proves interesting. It plays like an alternate reality. Can this even be analyzed? I've been able to ""decode"" most of my other dreams, but not this one.

Walking down corporate office hallway to bathroom.

Sweating. My torso is a burlap bag full of golfballs and old gravy in a washing machine.

Into the bathroom, only one of the eight stalls is available, the one closest to the door.
Vainly, I glance at the mirrors above the bank of sinks as I walk, noting my fat red face, balding head, wondering where youth and health went. Ridiculous.

Into the stall, close the door, and pants down, just in time. Oh, god...

A few moments later, starting to relax, and I realize I'm naked, my white belly protruding so I can't see in the toilet in front of me. I don't remember taking my suit off. Must have hung it on the door.... is this food poisoning? Where's my shoes?

I'm trying to minimize disgusting bathroom noises but it's just impossible, so I give up. Silence from the other stalls.

Oh god, what did I eat? Three enchiladas from the sidewalk counter at greasy market down the street. Yes, I think this is food poisoning.

Now there's a voice, someone's talking to me, but I feel like I'm underwater, coming up for air, can't tell what he's saying.

Blink.

The door to the stall is gone now. Just gone.

And there's Dave from HR Finance standing there in his brown suit with gold buttons, awkwardly tall, long smug white face, eyes half closed as usual, talking to me...

“Good news buddy!”

He always calls me buddy, he knows my name, I've reminded him at every holiday party for the last ten years, and good christ, he's in HR, we're both on the 3rd floor, we see each other almost every day, and he can't remember my fucking name, again.

“The raise you put in for last quarter? Looks like somebody likes you upstairs, buddy! So you've got something to look forward to if you ever get out of that stall, heh heh. See you later buddy!”

Where's the door to the stall? Where are my clothes?

Blink.

And why does Dave have hooves?

The piped-in office muzak seems insane, jarring, chaotic, the overhead fluorescents seem piercing, brazen, violent.

The toilet is growing, I'm falling in, I'm wet, I'm sick, so sick. I put my hands on the fragile walls of the stall for stabilization and find rough old wood rather than beige Formica.

Blink.

I stand up, I have to take a shower and find my clothes, none of this makes any sense. I'm hallcinating, leaning against the side of the doorless stall, breathing, preparing to walk without collapsing.

The stalls on the opposite side of the bathroom are gone, replaced by bales of hay arranged in low stacks a few feet apart, simulating stalls, maybe.

I stare at the hay.

Blink.

Between the two stacks across from my stall is a man, prone, looking up at me. I was staring right at him and didn't even see his face. He's old, watery-eyed, wearing baggy clothes the color of dirt, homeless maybe, a week's worth of beard, in a daze, or disbelief, or insanity, staring right back at me, passively.

Lights are dimming, the whole floor is hay now, and new sounds; the muzak has faded, giving way to a festive faraway fife, laughing, the clop-clop of hooves on cobblestone.

The smells of bathroom antiseptic and food poisoning giving way to earthy compost, body odor, oiled leather, woodsmoke, manure, beer.

Blink.

It's dim now, an oil lamp near the door to the bathroom providing the only light. But the door is gone, or swung wide open, and I can see it now leads outside into a street at night. There are a few other people lolling about or unconscious in the hay nearby. And a small white goat standing there in the yellow-orange glow of the lamp, idly chewing something.

My suit and shirt and socks and shoes are gone, but I find what seems to be my underwear in the hay at my feet and slip them on. The material is rough, like burlap.

I walk unevenly to the door and breathe in the night air. Feels good. Street is dark and deserted but I can still hear the fife and laughing from somewhere among the old stone buildings.

Someone's approaching, a small boy in dark short pants, gray shirt with a dark vest and cap, and now he's running towards me and saying something.

“Pa, Pa, there you are. Mum's been worried sick!”

He's Irish or Scottish or something, and in the dim lamplight spilling out from the barn, looks scared but also relieved.

“Pa, where's your clothes? Are you all right?”

He keeps talking and now he's taking my hand with both of his and tugging, trying to lead me somewhere.

The first time it happened I was so petrified I honest to god thought I was being possessed by a demon or something insane. And I don't even believe in the supernatural or anything like that.

The scariest one I ever had was a few months ago. I was sleeping, and as always happens, I 'wake up' and I'm lying in my bed in my dark room. I feel like I'm being dragged down into my bed, held into place and I can't move or speak. If I struggle very hard, I can let out faint moans.

Suddenly out of my closet comes a dark woman figure. She walks very awkwardly, with short spasm-like movements. She's coming closer and closer to me and I am TERRIFIED. I am trying so hard to move or scream for help but nothing but the very faint moans.

Finally as she is right about to reach me I jolt up. Now, this is the honest-to-god truth, I never actually open my eyes. I am always looking at my room. I'm convinced when this happens to me my eyes are actually open and I'm seeing things. I freak out. If I try to go back to bed, the dragging down feeling comes back and I'm too afraid to sleep again.

WHAT IS THIS and why does it happen to me every few months? Its always really traumatic, and I can't go back to sleep. The only 'cure' I've found is to put a funny movie on for a little while and fall asleep to that to put me in a better mood.

And, yes, I have definitely noticed that this tends to happen to me when I go to sleep felling stressed out or worried about something or another.

First, I saw the [Wikileaks released video of the helicopter in IRAN shooting down innocent civilians and children with no remorse.](www.collateralmurder.com)

Second, I saw LOTR with my girlfriend last night, the fellowship of the ring.

Third, I saw the David Cronenberg movie ""eXistenZ,"" for the third time. A mountain of mind fuck, if you may.

Now, moving on the dream:

I dreamt this huge house that I've seen in my dreams once or twice before. It has wood finishing and floors, and secret passages everywhere, that have made an appearance in previous dreams as well. These secret passages seemed to appear at the same exact location as I remembered them from the last dream, which was kind of trippy.
The situation was this: I'm trapped inside this house with my parents, and my girlfriend, and there is a massive war going on outside. It is unclear if it's an actual war, or just someone trying to kill us specifically.
I remember looking out of the window, while huge explosions can be heard in the background, and see a huge helicopter. A huge, ridiculously scare f'n helicopter. It's starting to shoot, and it's headed right for the house. My dad pulls me back from the window just in time for the bullets from the chopper to miss me. The helicopter circles around the house and shoots at random windows here and there.

Luckily, there's an anti-air gun right at the front porch. This shoots at the helicopter for a while, and an epic battle ensues, right before a dozen very scary looking fighter planes show up out of nowhere - all targeting the anti air gun. They drop bombs at it (which look just like hand grenades, for some reason,) and we realize we're fucked. We don't wait for the anti-air gun to be destroyed, so we run to the back of the house where my girlfrlend, my mother, and all the children are hiding. We get here to find soldiers (that probably looked like Nazis in my dream,) interrogating them, so we shoot to kill them, (although this part is very blurry and is escaping my memory as I type this.)

After this, I look outside the back door to see if the helicopter is there or not. 
My girlfriend starts crying at this point, so I console her and tell her everything's going to be ok, and also to stop crying. At this point - out of nowhere, this really ugly obese man pushes me and enters the house. He is straight up ugly, and has an ugly round figure. Also, he is huge, and there's no doubt he's here to kill us.

So I run to the kitchen, grab a really huge knife, and run back into the room I just exited to find him sitting on the floor with his back turned to me for some reason. Without wasting any time, I push the knife into his back - and this part felt really real. The knife taking it's time to push inside his body, and the extra force I have to apply. I do this over and over a couple of times, as he starts screaming in agony, and I can see the knife go through his flesh and skin.

He turns around, and he's really pissed off. So I run, and go to the far end of the house again. At this point, I remember all the secret doors and passages, (from my previous dreams,) and start to hide in them to develop a strategy to hunt this monster thing...

This is where the dream ended, and I wake up to a girlfriend whose complaining about pain in her stomach. She's almost in the verge of tears.

I go to open the door where we've docked with the satellite. The door is small, and the space I am in to open the door is claustrophobic. There are lots of hex bolts holding the door in place. However, after I start to unscrew 2 or 3  bolts, my colleagues crowd the area and start sliding the door open.

We all go through the door, and we're in some kind of mine. I notice that the door on this side is a lot larger - the size of a normal door. I quickly realize that we're on Earth, and the miners appear to be mining cocaine. I'm incredibly confused with the whole situation, and mention to my colleagues that we shouldn't be back on earth. They agree but aren't as animated about it as I am.

We progress through the mine, and not long afterwards, we see what appears to be a small track that is just barely underwater. Shortly after that, a small railcar with several people go by on the track. It's a theme park ride! We get out of the mine and realize that we're in MGM Studios in Disney World.

We walk through the park, and park employees approach us several times asking that we come with them. They aren't physically forceful at all, but keep insisting we come with them. We continue to decline, and a police office arrives. He also wants us to go with him, but we realize that the police and the Disney employees aren't working together and want us to go to different places.

Seeing as Disney currently has an active cocaine mine at one of their theme park rides, we don't consider them trustworthy. We go with the cops.

Next thing I know, we're all in a Barnes &amp; Noble and they're examining Wilford Brimley. I get an impressive view of his nostrils. The computer screen is showing some of the veins going through his gums for some reason.

Suddenly, everyone else is nowhere to be found. I walk around through the B&amp;N, and find one of the Disney employees walking around. I ask him what the big deal was with everything, and he tells me it had to do with a crash several years back that involved some scientists. I ask him if the scientists worked for NASA, and the employee said that it might be possible. I then ask him what year it was, and he couldn't give me a straight answer. He thought it might be 2095 or 2059 but he wasn't sure. I walk around and find a newspaper and see that the year is 2033.

It seemed to stretch on forever all around. There are mountains far off in the distance. I can barely hear voices. People talking. But I don't see anyone.

I'm near them now. There are two men sitting by what looks like a campfire, with a large pot held over it by some sticks. Something is boiling inside the pot. Some strange liquid. I can't see what it is. The men had a small dog with them. They were talking, but I couldn't quite understand what they were saying. I catch one thing though, something like ""we have to. It's for Lucy""
Then one of them picks up the dog, and puts it in the boiling pot. You'd think the animal would've yelped in pain, but it didn't even make a sound. A moment later, they pull the dog out. Only, it isn't a dog anymore. It looks like a baby, but with grey, transparent skin. I can see every blue vein running through its body. It looks like it's covered in some thick, clear slime. It's eyes are closed, but they look unusually large, and bulge out.
Suddenly, the infant is floating in the air, just higher than the men's heads. It starts violently convulsing, and all of its flesh begins slowly turning inside out. The skin of its toes peel and curl outward, and then the rest of her does the same until she's turned fully inside out. All of her organs and muscle are on the outside. She doesn't fall apart as I thought she would. The shape of the child still holds, and blood is doing everywhere. I can see her intestines and other organs glistening as the sun's rays hit them. The inverted child suddenly falls to the ground, her skull hitting the ground with a gruesome thud. Her organs making a splat and then squish sound. She's stopped convulsing.

I wanna write it as it's still fresh and I feel it's worth sharing. So here it goes.

I am with some friends for what looks like to be a trip in the Saudi Arabian desert. The first thing I see is a big, wide mountain, almost like a wall. The sun is setting at the exact right angle so that the shadows create a beautiful black/orange pattern on the side of the mountain. We are in some kind of very fancy bus, going somewhere...But I'm too much in awe to really pay attention, so I look at the mountain slowly move as the bus is traveling. The night started to appear from the back of the mountain and had a blue hue. The bus felt futuristic, with small blue lights on the side of the window and on the chaid I was sitting on. I remember taking my actual phone (s3) and trying to take a picture, but as soon I tried, I felt leaving my body very quickly and transport myself high into the air. It was really fast, almost like flying, but it wasn't flying. I felt like I had the power to see something from a great distance, going high and seeing the smallest detail from very far. And so, from this altitude, I looked at the mountain and with the sun shining on the background with the shadows running across what looked like to be a huge canyon. It was behind the mountain, so I couldn't see it from the bus. 

I then transport myself in a different location, not too far I think (maybe the end of the bus trip?), and It's completely dark. It was probably late night, and then , at the horizon, I see the moon, splendid, huge, but quite different. It had huge scars, almost like the shadows I've seen on the mountain. It was still very beautiful to see it rise slowly. It rose until I noticed that it was perfectly aligned behind a tower from a distance. The tower was very tall and for some reason I though it was the Burj Khalifa from Dubai ( I've never been there). The moon rose until it was touching the tip of the tower. It was amazing to look at this small tower, it felt it was like holding the weight of the moon. Soon, as the moon stopped touching and started raising more.

At this moment, I looked somewhere else in the sky. I could literally feel my jaw drop as I saw the billions of stars that collected before my eyes, and as I kept turning my head, I saw this really amazing light blue nebula. I felt like watching a Supernova. IT stood here in the night with all the stars surrounding. I thought that I  was looking at the center of the milky way. As I was looking, I saw someone else looking like me, amazed by the view, and soon enough, I notice that I am on some sort of balcony looking forward to the tower. I then decide to walk to what seems to be a city center while looking at the sky because it was so great. 

Then for some reason, I remembered that I should pay attention to my belongings since there were thieves around here. I don't know why I though that but as I was walking this guy with a black hat and black jacket walks right in front of me. He proceeds to reach his hand in a clever way to my left pocket for where my phone usually is. But I didn't do anything to stop him because I felt that there was something more important on the right that he shouldn't. I don't know what's in my right pocket but I figured that he better take my phone than what's in there. Usually I put my change and my keys in that pocket, still I don't know why I would want to keep that change. Maybe there was something else? At this moment, the time slows down and I feel his hands tickling my left pocket and then... I woke up. I felt great the whole morning and smiled like an idiot to a few people on the street.

Sorry for the wall of text but I tried including as much details as I could because I want to keep this and at the same time share it with you. Hope you enjoyed!

Here's some back story: For a very long time, since i was a small child, I have had this repeating dream. The dream goes like this... I'm in a house that seems familiar to me, in the basement i think, and all of a sudden either the wall opens up or I find a door. Behind this door that wasn't there before I find a house that nobody else know about; a secret house behind the wall. The walls are the purest white, and there's a forest green couch in the middle of the room. On the back wall is an arch doorway that leads into a white hallway but I've never been past this first room.

Now onto the freaky part, where my dream came true...
Tonight I was spending the evening at my fiances grandfathers house and after dinner we were listening to him tell old stories about the house. It came up that I had never seen what was behind this door in his dining room. The thing about this door is that it's the same color as the rest of the wall so it's hard to notice and his family never opens the door. So we go through the door, and what's on the other side? A whole other house that they've never mentioned before. Bonus his grandfathers house is painted white and the front doors and trim are the same exact shade of green as the couch in the room.

We would finally be having more conversations and enjoying each others time, we fought of droid armys together started revolutions, hunted for artifacts but i never once saw her face. And then i got married and she has completely vanished from my dreams.... So idk i find it weird an maybe it was my mind wanting a significant other or something else entirely.

It's sort of at the line between conscious and unconscious state.

They are usually snippits, usually in my own language or other languages I know (maybe they're sometimes in other languages/giberish, tbh I have not really paid much attention to them before). Often they don't make gramatical sense or alternatively I can't make sense of them because I forget what was said almost instantaneosly. More often than not they are commands and are shouted at me. This often has the effect of waking me up.

When I'm more on the side of consciousness, they appear as a thought (like when I read word for word in my mind) except they are much louder.

When I'm more on the side of unconsciousness, they appear as something I hear and usually dreams will follow.

Just want to know if this is common or is it actually unusual?

**Edit 1:** Think what I described is commonly known as [Auditory Hypnagogic Hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia#Sounds)

**EDIT 2:** I paid attention to the voices and had a bit of a wacky experience. It's probably all in my head but I seemed to be able to focus on what the voices were saying and they became more clear. I got really nervous and shaken and it felt like 'they' started becoming aware of me listening into 'their' conversation. Freaky as hell!

On one hand I thought there's nothing that can really happen to me, I was safe. But on the other hand I felt really exposed and vulnurable. I felt like I was dealing with the supernatural and was way in over my head.

Night one: I was flying in an airplane to South Korea, Seoul specifically. The flight was blurry/quick, but I remember being really afraid. When I arrived, I had no idea where to go, so I started calling my friends that live in Korea, but none of them would answer. I missed my flight back home and was stuck there, so I got really drunk off of soju, and woke up feeling irl drunk.

Night two: I was still in Korea, and had woken up in a really run-down motel sort of place. I spent most of my time walking around, confused that barely anyone spoke Korean, and everyone was speaking English.

Night three: I was finally able to find a plane back to the US, but everyone disappeared on the plane, and I was left to fly it. It didn't have any power when I reached home, so I had to land it on a pile of balloons and marshmallows. It worked for some reason. Everyone was speaking Korean here.

Some background info that might help:
I'm a white female in her 20's
I have never been in an airplane, and have never seen one in-person, aside from looking up at the sky.
I speak/read/write in Korean about the amount of an elementary student.
Roughly 90% of my exes are Korean, and one lives in Seoul now. He actually moved back there about 2 weeks ago.

Anyway, any help as to what these mean would be great.

Edit: Update:
Night four: Everything in this dream seemed unrelated. It was a fairly detailed dream where my city had to be evacuated for Chernobyl-like disaster. Perhaps the dreams were just a coincidence.

I feel a little dazed and uneasy; I'd just woken up, and I've never experienced this in my life. I usually have reoccurring dreams and nightmares, but this one was so different. I dreamed of being someone else, and lived through their life. Well, most of it, until I couldn't take it anymore, but you'll see why. I've never had this dream ever. I feel breathless and regret that I woke myself up too early, or too late. I say too late, because I *was* the girl- and inadvertently, felt all of her sadness and regrets of her life. Here is my dream; please tell me what it could mean. 

I was a young girl living in the American suburbs with my family; we had moved to America to live better lives. The summers were blistering and slow. I remember stepping outside of the house and walking along the wide, open street, feeling the heat baking my light cocoa skin and jet-black hair. Our family lived in a small house with little A/C, and often, the cramped, unlit living room with all of its windows open would be our place to laze about. I had perhaps 3 other sisters, but they were indistinguishable. 

Two young American business men would visit our family regularly. I don't remember why, but my father and mother were always delighted to welcome them. Both of them were tall. One was very muscular, as if he worked out (and he seemed to take pride in it); he spoke in a slightly greasy manner, a kind of tone that would allure people. His face was often pink from the blazing sun, and his light hair only made him look more ""American"" than ever. The second man grasped my attention. He was lean and had dark hair and eyes. It was summer, so his skin was lightly tanned. He was more reserved than his friend, and spoke seriously; this is perhaps why I was so eager to know more about him. I was young, perhaps 16, and I admired him.

Few summers went by, and I became very rebellious; my parents were traditional, although they had provided us with an Americanized way of living. I was very independent and spoke my feelings directly, unlike my meek sisters, and to my parents' distaste. They suppressed me. They began to love me less, and I knew my childhood had ended. 

I was 18 in the fall when a woman openly stole my purse in the streets. After a long struggle, I got it back, but she left with my debit card. I was devastated, since many stores did not require PIN numbers. I dashed home, planning to go to the bank as soon as possible, but somehow, the dark haired man who I loved had gotten my card back again. It was incredulous. He was unruffled, he was so reserved, I wanted to thank him but also ask why he could never smile and be happy to see me.

My parents enforced rather harsh punishments, although we were girls. They'd beat us with leather belts and brand us on our shoulders or backs. The two men had not come back in a while, and that depressed me; they were my only sense of escape. My father beat me in particular, since I was more resistant than my sisters. I remember walking into the living room one day, and he was forcing my sister to pierce herself with needles on her shoulder. He saw me, and ordered me to do the same for my behaviour. I think it had something to do with our culture or religion. I obeyed, but after the second needle that had been pushed 1 inch into my skin, I yelled, ""THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT!"" and glared daggers at my father. He quickly made to grab me, but i dashed to the door and unlocked it, running out barefeet. I knew I could not go back. I ran down the street, crying, but the tall blond man caught me. He was probably going to visit our house. He hugged me tightly, and I blabbered in tears of what had happened. He took me to his flat, and we made love. I told myself I loved him for saving me. 

From here, my dream was fastforwarded. I got married to the blond man. I had lived an insignificant life, and I was weary. My face had begun to sag and my hairwas straggled. The blond man had grown a potbelly, and became very lazy. He'd often watch TV with a beer in his hand, while I did the household chores. I realized how indifferent I was, and how sad and tired I'd become. Every day, I'd wait for the dark haired man to pick me up off my feet and save me. It was him who I needed all along. I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited every single day, my face sagged even more, the blond man would drink a few more beers... and that's when I woke up from waiting so damn long. It was such an unfulfilled life. 

I guess this was long and not detailed enough; I couldnt' describe everything but it was just so surreal and devastating to be this woman. Thanks for your time.

My girlfriend and I were at my house. There were loads of people there, and it was really loud and crowded. My girlfriend and I were having a hard time even holding hands or talking to each other amongst all the people, so I grabbed her hand and led her back to my bedroom. I closed the door and she let out a sigh and was like ah finally and we started making out and just hugging and stuff so glad to be away from all the chaos outside. After replenishing ourselves and relaxing for a bit we go back outside.


No one's there. Absolutely, no one. Everyone had disappeared. I didn't think we were in there for much longer than 5-10 minutes. The place was a mess. My girlfriend and I just looked each other, happily, but confused as if... Where did all these people vanish to what happened?

I looked outside. No one. Not everyone could've left this fast. But outside, the world was silent. There were no cars in the streets, there was no one else. The world was empty, completely empty. Everything still worked, electricity, water, internet, it's just there was no one else.

It actually wasn't that scary. My girlfriend was a little scared at first and dared not to leave my side, but we were actually pretty happy together and were just having fun at first. I don't think it really hit us, or I just don't think we let it get the worst of us. We didn't know what had happened, and we couldn't control it, so we just had to live with it I guess. 

We went around just taking random cars, going grocery shopping, driving around town, going back to my house, watching a movie, cuddling... It was kind of peaceful in a way.

And then I woke up. I was kind of sad, because it was so calming. There was no one else in the entire world, we were free to do whatever we wanted to for as long as and whenever we wanted. Although we could've moved to a random castle and lived in the best luxury, we were completely comfortable with how we lived, I don't know why, but there was just nothing compelling us for anymore. Which is weird, because in the real world I'm never one to settle for anything and constantly strive for more, but I guess that's different when everyone else is gone and you have nothing to strive for because you essentially own the world.

I was in a car with my girlfriend (I'm 16, she's 14. She was driving..) and we were going to my house. Outside of my house was a blue snowmobile, and it was snowing very lightly. I told my girlfriend that this was good cause we could play in the snow together, at which point we entered my house. I ran to look through the window at the back of the house to see how the snow was the covering the garden and it was starting to rain and snow, therefore I ran back to the front of the house to tell my girlfriend - at which point it was absolutely pouring down. So we went upstairs, into my bedroom, and my brother was just standing there looking at my girlfriend. My brother is an asshole, and has woken me up with a knife to my neck before. 

So, I then wake up and see my brother standing in the corner of the room looking at me and all the lights are off which is strange cause I sleep with the light on. He starts to take off his shirt while still looking at me, then I wake up again. I turn around to my laptop, which is on my bed, and I unmute my headset in order to talk to my girlfriend (as I fell asleep while talking to her on Skype). It's dark in my room despite the fact that the lights are on, preventing me from opening my eyes so I can only see my keyboard and I am sure my brother is still staring at me. I try to tell my girlfriend about the dream, but I wake up again. I am facing the wall and it is still dark - but I slept with the light on. My brother is still there. I wake up, facing the wall and it is dark again. I unmute my headset and I talk to my girlfriend without turning around because I am sure my brother is looking at me.

     In the beginning of the dream I was in a community that all lived in the same ""house"" which was made of earth built on the side of a mountain. There were around fifty people all living there, not everyone could sleep comfortably inside the house because it was too small, but it was no big deal because everyone shared everything and didn't mind sleeping outside. I had the feeling that it was a LONG time ago like b. C. 

     Everyone was happy and got along and this mountain-house had a big yard with a canal around it. The roof was also a deck and part if it was enclosed like a 2nd story. People didn't cross over the canal in the beginning and everything was fine. 

     Then some people went over (the canal) and came back saying that they found paradise. So I went over to see and the people were ""plugged in"" to plants in an unconscious state and were being used by the ""plants"" like batteries like in the matrix. (The whole dream is really matrixy). I tried to go back and tell the people in our little community not to go, but a lot of them wouldn't listen. Then the plants came after me! Eventually there was a ""white out"" transition (in fact it happened twice in the dream) but up to the white out I was running/jump-flying/fighting with these ""plants"" and I couldn't fly before I started fighting them. *white out*......

Suddey I'm in a different time. In a large city, (something I would imagine New York or Seattile to be like). I'm being escorted by a group of police and I think the ""agent smith"" guy was around at this point. I remembered that while I was in jail (I didn't dream the jail part, just remembered it in the dream) I was communicating via letters with some ambiguous friend outside of jail. I told him to set up bombs around the city to aid with my escape. They were escorting me to court to face trial, I didn't know why, but they had this stack of papers with my accusations on them. 
     So I broke free of the police. The agent smith guy was the only one who could chase me because I was flying. So I would fly over one of the bombs my friend had set up and have the friend detonate it while the agent guy was near it. This happened about 3-4 times. Then the agent caught up with me. We fought for a bit but neither one of us could get the upper hand. Then he stopped attacking me and started just telling me all of my crimes/sins. It started gettin to my head and I was getting confused and dizzy and just not good. He showed me my mother crying because of what I did trying to mess me up worse. Then he decided to attack me again while I was weak. I realized just then that I had to not pay attention to what he had said or I would be destroyed. So I blocked it out; he was already coming at me with his fist cocked back ready to punch but by blocking out his mind game, things began to get clearer and clearer and time was slowing down more and more. By the time he was about to touch me, I realized I could destroy him in any way that I wanted to. Then...*white out*...

Then I was in another time again. The distant future this time. It was a city in a bubble. It reminded me of those things in sim city 3000 where it's a tall structure with a bubble city on top. Everything about the place was designed to keep the people living there under control. People had their own domiciles like a little apartment. The social area looked like a mall with food stands and places to sit and socialize. There was a coffee shop type place with a fake outside view that was nice looking (the real outside was terrible with storms and bad atmosphere). There was a show room type place with music and movies that played and people could watch and it had a balcony. A lot of the place was made of glass so everyone knew they were always being watched but most people didn't care because they had a comfortable life. The colors were soft and a lot of pastels to keep a calm docile atmosphere. Something I noticed was how *clean* everything was. Not a speck of dust or smoke. The *air* was even super clean. I knew they were watching me, but at night I would fly around and try to find a way out. I found a place where I would be able to get out but I didn't go yet because I needed a plan. I had new powers too. When I would see someone I could sort of read them, but if I would shake their hand I could tell almost everything about them. I remember shaking some guy's hand and knowing his religion, and seeing books on his bookshelf in his home. I also figured out how to turn my body invisible and leave my body. So one day I turned my body invisible and left it in some random place like an elevator or on a bench or something random where no one would think to look. So I left it there, invisible, and flew out the tiny air duct I found in the ceiling. I got out but I didn't know what to do so just started moving around energy and clouds for awhile. Eventually agents found my body and confronted me with a giant stack of papers. They told me that because of what I did outside there was a 0.00002 percent chance of the place being destroyed (which I understood to mean it would DEFINITELY be destroyed it would just take a long time). 

     Then they told me that they *could* let me out to fix what I had done. I immediately said ""I'll do it."" then just as fast as I said that they said, ""No, we would rather become depersonalized.""

Had some vague dreams about driving places which aren't worth mentioning. But when I ""woke up"", it was about 4:30 AM. There was a full moon angled perfectly to bathe me in moonlight through the window. My computer that I leave on, which normally has audible fans, is dead silent. I sat up to examine the case, as if looking at it would make it produce noise. But when I did that, the blue LEDs that usually make my case glow bright were significantly dimmer than usual. I also noticed that the power buttons to my monitors, which normally blink to signify that they are idle, were solid colors (which means that they SHOULD be displaying my desktop). I tried moving my mouse, no response from the computer. 

I shrugged it off since I didn't want to lose more sleep by going back on the computer, so I laid back down facing the wall adjacent to my bed, looking at my phone charger plugged into the socket that was charging the phone I was laying next to. What happened next was more than perplexing: I heard a faint whisper. I turned around to face the window where the full moon still was focusing on me, but saw nothing. I stayed in this position for about 30 seconds, examining and analyzing what could be happening...and then I turn back around to the wall. But I don't see the blue wall with the socket that has my charger charging my phone that is laying next to me in my bed. I see a BLACK wall with a dark blood red rusted chain wrapped around my right arm and a demonic voice calling my name. The chain was weak, and I was able to pull it out of the wall with one yank. 

Then I sit up in my bed, and the first thing I notice is that the fans of my computer are making noise again. I see my monitor power buttons blinking, and was able to wake it up by moving the mouse. I look up to the moon which was just focusing its light onto me and see that it has jumped to the next window. I look to my phone charger to find my phone, but it is missing. I look around in my bed for it, but it is not there. *It is sitting on my chair near my computer*.

All of the sudden the Holy Om radiates from inside me, from the center of the chest. The sound is completely internal, serene, and perfect. After embracing the first few initial moments in oneness, I am in shocked in awe and I was free to break away. I went upstairs and the radiant energy stayed with me but the om was silent. I then tried to communicate my experience with my mother who before I say anything says she's felt very unholy - which in real life seems to be quite opposite. Maybe it's a reminder to keep sharing the knowledge, love, and union of the cosmos in hope that they can find the wisdom and oneness for themselves.  I feel blessed to have had this experience. I thank the cosmos. This dream was so surreal, and so - enlightening.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_1b3nic,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1b3nic/the_holy_om/,

I explained to her that before my eye surgery I could have read it, but since I had my vision fixed I couldn't see closer than an inch or two clearly. She smiled and didn't seem concerned.

She took the card back and I sat down, then she came over and curled over me, and we flopped sideways on the padded bench in a cuddle and I commented that now I understood. I felt a deep connection and we nuzzled a few moments before I reminded myself that I was married and needed to stop. Suddenly I am in the bathroom.

I am trying to urinate, and it is coming out as a mist, and to complicate things further, I keep deciding that I am peeing in the wrong spot, and switching to what looks like a better receptacle, and becoming mildly confused that I am having trouble with this. That's when I notice that my penis has begun to pulsate and lengthen, and I think that it must be like that when I come, and no wonder it causes such a strong reaction when I do. At about twice it's normal length, it starts to weave back and forth, and then turns into a snake, that bites me in the shoulder!

I hope it isn't poisonous as I pull it's mouth off of my shoulder. It looks like a rattlesnake, but I don't see fangs and it is easy to pull off, so I suspect I am safe. Besides, it is still attached to me... surely it wouldn't poison itself?

The next thing I know I am in the parking lot, I have the snake gripped by the back of the head and each time I start to let go it tries to bite me again so I tell it that it needs to accept that we are part of the same being and cooperate, I coil it back in my pants, and it goes willingly. I am about to get on my bicycle, when suddenly there are two of me, and I know the other is the snake. I have two bicycles it turns out, so we can leave together but I need to fix something on the bike really quick.

I grab some tools and crouch down beside the bike. I turn to the tool box and then back to the bike and other me has left, and taken both bikes. Leaving me alone in the parking lot.

I woke up with a knife in my hand standing in the office room in my home. I was short of breath and freaked out once i realised what i was doing.

I was at the beach with a couple friends. One swam out but the tide came in quick, making the water at least five times deeper almost instantly. I watched the murky green water pinch into huge waves that showed dark, churning forms within them. The whole scene was frightening and by the time my friend had swam back we decided it was time to leave.

We were riding this bus. I tried to describe to my friend what I had seen in those waves by carving the message gently in a piece of mossy wood. I was trying to be discreet about delivering this message, for whatever reason. Not only was my friend oblivious that there was even a message, I was reprimanded by some tour guide type ""authority"" figure on the bus, because he said transmitting such messages is forbidden.

So I said fine, and gave in. I just decided I'd come right out and tell my friend exactly what I had seen out there on the beach. I tried to explain what I observed, how the water hid strange things that could only be seen when the water pinched up into waves. Suddenly, this fat, overtly ""hill-billy"" type woman at the front of the bus corrected me, telling me that waves didn't work like that.

At this point I saw red. I don't rememeber everything but I went off, lost my cool, and got confrontational. By the time we got to our destination, everyone on the bus was quiet and I saw my ex-girlfriend sitting there next to me with a hurt look in her eyes. She was collateral damage from my anger even though it wasn't even directed at her. Of course! She was there all along, and this was my second, last, and only chance to prove to her that I had become a changed man and yet I failed.

I stood in this line, surrounded by people I didn't like and hardly knew. My head was spinning with the thoughts of my own failure, and how my life has always been just like the events that transpired before this. Being reprimanded for the message I tried to give my friend on the bus reminded me of how relentless authority figures were in correcting me in school. Having some dumb lady at the front of the bus fail to understand my observation and replace it with her own ignorant explanation reminded me of all the times I observed things differently and got in trouble for it, and lastly the punishment that came for losing my temper at the insanity of it all.

It was all here; I could see these patterns as they appeared thoughtout my entire life since childhood, still hanging like a curse over me now. I stood in this line, my body felt heavy under the hopelessness of it all. Everything started spinning. I collapsed against the hard floor that I could barely feel anymore, the taste of blood in my mouth. This was it. What felt like my soul was starting to lift out of my tired, hopeless body. My only regret was that I would die without anyone knowing the horrible things that brought me to this point. Perhaps it was that injustice that jolted my body back to life, clutching on to the world it holds so dear, the same world that hurts me at seemingly every turn.

===

My analysis of this dream is all too clear. Everything that I experienced is basically a summary of tormenting patterns that have appeared in my life since childhood. Maybe there's too much here to go into detail in this single post, no doubt rooted in the physical and psychological abuse I suffered at the hands of my own father. The way I was marked in school by authorities as a so-called behavioral problem child, getting in trouble over the smallest things because that's what they expected from me. The fury that arose over confusion regarding my perceptions and observations. And lastly, the anger that ultimately destroyed some of the most valuable relationships that I ever held.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_15ktdl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/15ktdl/woke_up_this_morning_from_a_challenging_dream/,

I dreamed that I was with a bus tour in a far away country.  We came upon a pyramid which sat in the middle of this beautiful fresh water pool.  The pyramid itself was so detailed.  Grey stones wrapped in moss and vines.  Our group proceeded to enter the pyramid; you had to swim up to it and then climb atop a stone wall and slide down this smooth rock face with a waterfall going over the top of it.  A few of us jumped down the waterfall and proceeded to swim into the pyramid.  The rest stayed behind at the entrance with a group of children.  The group that entered with me began to split off in twos; swimming through different pathways within the pyramid.  Even though I remained on my own pathway I could still somehow see and follow the other groups as well.  I had one person with me a man with a beard.  We swam down this dark corridor in the pyramid when all of a sudden we came to an iron gate with a large stone castle behind it (all of this was still inside the pyramid itself).  The man with the beard informed me that this was the former palace of the tribal king which built this pyramid and that out of respect we should swim by quietly without splashing about.  That's when all hell broke loose.  Two headhunting tribesman appeared out of the shadows, one with a bow and arrow.  He drew his bow and shot the man with the beard in the head.  The arrow had such velocity behind it that it actually took he bearded mans head clean off; leaving a headless corpse thrashing about in the water  next to me.  I immediately went underwater and hid in by this rocky outcropping which had a small air pocket (like a cave)  inside of it to hide from the two head hunters.  Then I saw what was happening to the other members of my group.  One group: a man and a woman, had begun swimming through a narrow corridor in the pyramid with very high walls on either side.  Several headhunters emerged from the very stone walls themselves and began raining down spears upon these two.  The woman was struck several times and killed, the man was able to put up a fight and killed a couple of the tribesman who had jumped down to claim the head of the woman they had just killed.  He was able to kill two of them using their own spears, however the rest overwhelmed him and dragged him off into the dark screaming.  Then I saw what was happening to the group waiting at the entrance of the pyramid with the group of children.  They were all happily playing and splashing about in the water when a group of tribal children snuck up behind them and pushed them one by one into the pyramid.  At this point I returned to my own situation inside the pyramid.  I was being hunted.  My location had changed to a place in the pyramid where it was very wet but no longer had enough water to swim.  I was now entering a great room which was divided by two pools and a large walkway between them.  I was told by a booming voice which I could not locate in the darkness to choose a pool and jump into it.  I guess I chose the right pool because after some length of swimming found myself leaving the pyramid and back outside.  The weather was so warm.  The mood had somehow changed from one of fear to one of overwhelming joy.  I exited the water and found myself next to our tour bus where people were taking pictures with the headhunters and posing as if they were about to be killed by them.  The place had been one elaborately designed tourist trap (like a theme park) and no one in my group had actually died.....Or did they?  Right before I woke up a man in a white suit handed a briefcase to one of the tribal headhunters and said thank you and began speeding off in a convertible laughing.  Seated next to him was one of the girls in our group.   Inside the briefcase was the head of the bearded man who was swimming with me.  I woke up right after this moment.

He was skipping with this weapon that reminds me of that 90s toy Skip-It. Anyway, he got behind me and was holding me compleatly up against him with this blade around my neck. I started to struggle and yell and he told me it wouldn't be so bad if I just relaxed. After a second I gave in and accepted my fate. (To me it was much like a ego-death caused by hallucinogens.) As I took a deep breath and relaxed he started to slit my throat. As he started cutting I had a really intense orgasm that spread from my throat to my body and it lasted from that point until he lowered me to the ground and let go of me.

I guess it's all been too much for me lately. My sister is pregnant and I've been helping her a lot. Now my best friend is going to be father as well. I think my relationship is falling apart.

I've been thinking of changing the course of my life. Travel. Do art some more. I always wanted to become a camera man or cinematographer. I also met this other women and I feel like I could really fall in love.. and since I'm still in a relationship it's caused me to feel so fucked up inside. Just feelings and thoughts I can't put in order.

The dream felt pretty real. Very real. I woke up in the middle of it two times because my heart was racing but fell asleep again. Started out with me having back pains and not being able to carry heavy things. I had this problem growing up but it's been OK for the last 6 years. Then I gained weight and this typical pregnant belly. I went to the doctors and he said I'm pregnant and that it's possible in my condition. No idea how to explain this. I had my belly and I caressed it and was afraid of what the child might be. I was afraid it might be ugly or have complicated syndromes but was too afraid to go to a screening. I then decided to go to my grandfather's house and spend the pregnancy away from everything. Yesterday was exactly one year since he passed away (in real life). I wasn't there when it happened but I felt he is up there in that room, in pain. I tried the to go to him and give him morphine but the whole time people came to the door and kept me busy. They were all talking about how irresponsible I am and how I've had so much potential and just screwed up. They basically started destroying me for every big mistake I've ever made in my life.

**tl:dr semi-cheesy love story**

I (guy) was at a softball game at my roommates university in the city (chicago).  It was a blowout game and the coach of their team was an incredibly loud and angry man. The third base(wo)man was having none of it. She walked off to a near by bridge over the expressway. 

I followed her. Her body language screamed ""I'm going to jump"". I had to stop her. At this point in my dream I actually felt myself take her and keep her from the edge. I felt the hug that my dream-character received. She felt undernourished; she felt in danger. 

I had taken her back to what it seems was her own apartment/dorm. I made food and she was grateful. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so happy to see something I cooked. We proceed to one of those lounge areas where we get a chance to just sit and talk for a while. 

We talk about life for a while and lose track of time. It's storming outside and she suggests I don't try and make it back home. When I agree our eyes meet. Now, I don't know what love is like or any of that, but I feel something run down my spine. It was the most genuine feeling of happiness that me (or my dream-character) could ever experience. 

My dream progressed through dates, family gatherings and generic happy dating stuff. She, as a person is improving from the eating disorder that had plagued her before. All is well.

But of course, what is a good story without a villain? What is a good story without the bad guy?

Her father got wind of her relationship and told the school elites/professors. This was not acceptable in their eyes. This athlete, woman, student, was not to be involved romantically with someone like me. What they had against me I don't know, but that didn't matter. All they wanted was to see me out. 

When we were together thing were changing, her father was doing everything he could to separate us, to keep us apart. I missed the hugs, kisses. I was missing her face, her smile. 

And everything they did was working. 

I found myself more alone. No more wandering the city with my wonderful companion. No more smiles, no more...her. 

It's a few months down the road; I still miss her. It's a new softball season though, why not try and catch a game? I make it to the field and the game is just ending. The coach isn't crazy anymore and the team won the game. And the girl? Well, she looks wonderful. I'm just sitting on the bleachers observing their cheers. Parents, siblings are there congratulating the team on their win.

And then I see something that sinks my soul. There's another guy. And he's with her. I felt my heart drop as I see them hug in the same spot that I first saw her. I couldn't take it; I had to leave. 

But what other place could I go to? There wasn't anywhere else in the world that seemed like it would make me happy again so I went to the only place I could think of...the bridge. 

-----------------------------------------

So that's it. That's my dream. There's a lot more detail that I couldn't really fit into the story, a lot of random scenery type stuff. But I know that if I ever come back to read this story I'll remember it. The dream was vivid and I rarely get dreams like that. Thanks for reading.

Myself and a bunch of people were being ushered through the manor by a bunch of creepy looking French nobles. They were going to kill us, and they were going to kill any men that were against them, so all the men in the group were grabbing at our clothes to disguise themselves as women. Just as the nobles came in to take us away and kill us, I wrapped a bunch of sheets together and pretended to be pregnant.

We were on the imperial side of the revolution, and we were rich and everything. When my children were older, the oldest being like 16-17, and the youngest one being 8-10, I took them forward through time to show them where I grew up. We went shopping in the city and went to a toy store and looked at everything. When we got out, my second-eldest son asked where the eldest one was. His name was Eric, and I began calling for him when my son shushed me, because we weren't supposed to let anyone know we were French. I looked around the corner for him and saw him with a group of other young men, and they were talking about rebellion against the Imperials. I turned around to take my children and run, and as we were running back to the shops, one of the French noblemen caught us and killed my children in front of me with a pike, and then stabbed me through the heart with it.

I had to step over her and many other naked people, to get to the bottom of the ladder, to get to where the private pool area is, from the changing room. It was normal to be naked in the pool area- but she was bitching at me because they were a private members only pool and they had towels so that you wouldn't drip water on other people. So there I am swimming in this private pool, trying to sink to the bottom so I wouldn't hear the shouts from this lady, bitching at me. 

To make up for the apparent indiscretion, I volunteered for a service job - I then remembered it wasn't a members only club per se, but more of a co-op. everyone had to do various jobs to stay a member of this private pool house.

I eventually got out of the pool, and found my girlfriend, standing next to a really tall muscular guy. I wasn't sure who he was, but I punched him immediately. We started to fight, and it was getting serious. There was no one to try to break it up- it became obvious that one of us was going to try to kill the other one. I ran off to both make arrangements for death and to find tools to kill. I went searching the dark rooms of this private clubhouse, to search for scissors (I found two pairs) to stab the guy with.

I then realized it wasn't a co-op, but more of a safe house so that people could avoid going outside. It wasn't safe out there anymore. I remembered that there was no 911 anymore- anyone with any sense was too scared to go outside. I could hear him getting close, chasing behind me. I ran outside, before I could get a chance to make any arrangements for if I were to die that night. I ran off into the silent streets, under wreckage, barbed wire, and over busted fences. I found an old UPS truck to hide in, and tried to come up with a plan. 
 
I figured that if he thought I was one of Them, he wouldn't try to kill me. With that in mind, I stepped out of the UPS truck, and faced him in the distance. I couldn't tell if it was him, or someone else, standing menacingly off in the distance, staring me down from afar. I knew that whoever it was, they couldn't tell who I was just yet, either. I tried to do my best impression of the undead, like the others in the street who were undoubtedly nearby. The dark figure started to come closer- I couldn't tell if he might be one of Them, or he might be Him. But one thing was for certain- I wasn't fooling anybody. 

I knew I was about to murder someone, perhaps someone already dead, and probably die in the conflict.

This is a dream I had. very vivid, very much woke me up an hour before my alarm was set to go off. 

It starts up with this view of a brown haired boy holding a small dog. It was brown and possibly a beagle. It looked drawn, like in Tim Burton style. 

Black, gaping, swirly holes for eyes on an abnormally large head. The boy wore a polo shirt, orange and blue striped. 

They were at a door way of some shop, the outside world vacant of people, yet, bright all the same. 

The boy starts throwing a stick. The dog, moving like something that was poorly animated, wobbled up and caught the ball. 

That went on for some time. Also, some faint music box music was playing in the background.

The music stopped.

The dog had rammed face first into the boys stomach and everything changed into a more anime-like style. The boy, tears in his eyes, watched as the dog pulled out, an intestine in his jaws. The dog pulled back and stared back at the ""camera"", now in a different style. The boy was leaned over and I heard the first speech in the hole dream.

""Oh, come now, that wasn't nice..."" he said to the dog, chuckling and petting the dogs head. 

He watched as the dog chewed on the organ, the boy continued petting him and they both stared at me. Their movement was unnatural, like it was made with puppets, and some person on the other end was moving the dog and the boy's hand. After a moment, the dog twitches and bites the boys hand. 

The boy opens his mouth but the dog decayed, right there. It shriveled, first to a bloody red color, then pink, then brown. The boy dropped him and my view shifts. I am now looking through the dog-corpse's perspective. Although it feels like a mere minute, it seems years have passed. The boy leaves the shop and comes back in, this time as a haggled old man. The man had hyper realistic features, and hobbled his way over. I could almost feel what was about to happen next, I was *willing it*. 

He reached over and grabbed the dog's head, first gently, then started crushing it slowly. I could feel what he felt. I felt the flaky out crust crush and the inner filling spill out. Nice and gooey, it was black and red. ""Oh, you're decayed like my dog. My dog decayed like you. Crusted, cooked, baked..."" his voice was the stereotypical old-man voice. It was croaky, yet I could sense the malice inside. 

""My dog died a long time ago, but you're a good dog."" 

He pulled his hand away, it was dripping from the slushy inside. He glared, eyes beaming with hate and mouth twisted in retort. 

*""You're a good dog,""*


So what does this mean? Is it some inner issues? Please help...

Anyhow it all started in my living room. There were two teams in the room, Team Obama, and Team Romeny(or however you spell his name). Basically we were going to have a debate you could tell Romeny's team was full of pricks, because they dress all rich and ****. Anyhow I was on team obama and there was this one other girl on my team.

The name of the game was to give Obama a good speech and holy **** this girl was first. All i could remember was seeing her stutter and sipping on her damn orange juice. Looking out into the Romeny squad they didn't seem to impressed. So I started uttering words and she would repeat them. I wish I remember what I said though, would of made a grand speech. Anyhow eventually she stops repeating my words and just sits there blank. I was raging at this point because the Romeny goon squad was starting to laugh. All I was thinking was, ""Who the **** let her on my team?"". 

At that point I felt we humiliated Obama, but then this kunt goes around and spill her ****ing orange juice on Obama's favorite jacket. My jimmies were pretty rustled at that point. Then Obama just wiped off and still kept his cool. Man whatta cool cat he is. 

Then I just woke up struggling to remember what epic masterpiece my brain had conjured up. Then I went on the news and Romeny was on there. Soon everything just came back to me. Will tell my mommy to vote for Obama again after this one.

When it's time to wake up, that's when surges of dreams rush my brain. It's kind of frustrating because I like dreaming, but can't because I'm suppose to get up soon. These types of dreams happen almost instantly. I can just close my eyes and be dreaming. I believe they're hypnagogic  dreams

When I'm trying to wake up, or half-asleep from being really tired, it's like I'm just in a daze and can't seem to pull myself out of it unless something happens like the phone ringing. 

I just pass in and out of consciousness, and go from having my eyes open to nearly instant dreams, maybe just one dream, then my eyes open again and I feel tired, don't feel like getting up at all, then suddenly a few more dreams, then I may wake up, and it's back into dreams again. It would eventually end, but not usually before I'd be horribly late for something, so I have to force myself to get up somehow. 

since I'm semi-conscious, I can hear music or whatever's going on and I'll often hear it or have my dreams influenced by it. 

Almost every one of the string of dreams are short and random, nonsensical, or just weird. Some of them can be slightly longer and somewhat coherent, but not often. 

I'm only saved by the fact that I usually stay in the semi-conscious state and thus have chances between the dreams to snap out of it while my eyes are open. And no, the eyes being open isn't part of  a dream, I'm actually awake at those times, just in a bit of a sleepy daze. I do occasionally slip into the sleep state though, and before I know it an hour or more has passed. If that doesn't happen, then I could have 4 dreams and be like FUCK I'M LATE and realize only 15 minutes passed, I'm still safe.

**edit:**  

The strange part is that I've read that dreams don't really start until at least an hour or so into sleep, yet I'm definitely having them in less than a minute. I even had one strange night where I was a little over-tired from lack of sleep, so I forced myself to stay awak to re-align my sleep schedule, and I decided I'd go to bed at around 11:00PM, not too early, not too late. I specifically didn't want to sleep too early, like at 9:00PM because I knew I'd likely wake up at 1:00AM wide awake. So I went to bed at around 11:30PM 'cause I couldn't really keep myself up any more. I was also sore and felt like I had a cold coming on. Falling asleep was almost instant, I was just so tired I closed my eyes and put my heavy head down.

I then had a wonderful sleep complete with some long and almost entirely coherent dream that I don't remember anymore, but when I woke up, it felt like it was around 5:00AM, that I had a wonderful full night's sleep and to top it off, I was no longer sore, just refreshed and wide awake!  

I thought to myself ""I guess I'll get ready for work, what time is it, anyway?"". I check the clock and see 12:45AM. I was speechless. That's a lie. I actually said WTF. I proceeded to stay awake until it really *was* 5:00AM, then It hit me. I was dead tired, and only slept for an hour after that, then I had to work, putting me back at square one.

1340826339.0,9,self.Dreams,vp965,[Dreams Library] How to remember your dreams.,14,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/vp965/dreams_library_how_to_remember_your_dreams/,"This is an excerpt from my book ""Dreams 1-2-3: Remember, Interpret and Live Your Dreams."" The entire chapter is available for free in the book sample linked to on the right sidebar of this page under ""Links about Dreams."" (You might also look at this [r/dreams post about remembering dreams.](http://redd.it/vk3cg). There are some good resources in the comments section.)

Suggestions for dream recall:

1. Use a dream journal and keep it by your bedside or wherever you sleep. I use the same notebooks for making lists and taking notes, but when I first started to journal my dreams I used dedicated journals. Precious moments can be lost when looking for something to write with or scribble on after remembering a dream. Your dreaming mind knows that the paper and pen are nearby and ready, and it will take the opportunity to dream about something important to write down. Maybe not the first or second night, but the dreams will come. As I’ve learned through trial and error, the unconscious, dreaming mind is an eager partner in my dream endeavors, but I have to be willing and able to give my dreams the attention required. If I’m too busy in my waking life, my dreams backlog the material until I’m ready.

2. Tell yourself before sleep that you want to remember your dreams. Really tell yourself. Say it like you mean it. If you’re a spiritual person, say it like a prayer. If you remember any dreams from the last time you slept, review them or browse through your dream journal. It’s possible to pick up where you left of with a dream even weeks or months later, so by reviewing your dreams you cue your mind. It’s also possible to recall an entire dream after remembering only a snippet, if you keep your mind clear when first waking. Implant the suggestion that you not only want to remember yourdreams but will.

3. Make time to write down your dreams. When I’m in a busy environment I retreat to the bathroom first thing in the morning. However, my partner enjoys discussing dreams, so she gives me time (and vice-versa) to start of the day with dream work. I don’t have to hide somewhere to journal, but you might. You can be “selfish” about giving yourself these moments to start the day right, because there is nothing at all selfish about eforts to live your dreams. The more you practice the better you’ll become at remembering. Use a voice recorder if pen and paper aren’t handy. The act of writing with pen and paper is a physical cue that can stimulate dream recall by “getting in the flow,” but do whatever is best for you. Recall was difficult and tenuous for me at first — the dream memories vanished if not written down immediately — but with practice I could wait long enough to start up my computer (back in the days when computer booted up in minutes, not seconds).

4. Return to, or stay in, the same physical position as when you wake up. This physical cue helps to jog dream memories and aid recall.

5. Write your dreams in the present tense. Instead of “I drove to the store and bought a pizza,” or “I am driving to the store to buy a pizza,” you write, “I drive to the store and buy a pizza.” Present tense is a mental cue, a mind hack. I learned it while writing Dreams 1-2-3, and found it helps to think of a dream as an active memory, a present situation described in the present tense, making it feel more immediate.

6. Meditate. A clear mind, calmly aware of itself and its surroundings, is the best helper for remembering dreams. Meditation is any activity that holds your attention in a relaxed way, so a peaceful walk counts. I find that the concentration required to practice Pilates is meditative. Meditation is a very broad term, and people get hung upon “doing it right” rather than just doing whatever feels right.

7. Be patient. The memories are never lost, just stored in the subconscious mind. There might be good reasons why your conscious mind blocks out some dream memories — they’re too difficult to accept! Groundwork might have to be laid before the messages can be received. It’s fine to be a turtle instead of a hare when it comes to dream work.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,1340826775.0,,,True,t3_vp965,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/vp965/dreams_library_how_to_remember_your_dreams/,

What's the most physically impossible thing that has happened in your dreams?,10,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/upjnc/i_used_to_have_a_recurring_dream_that_had_dream/,"When I was younger I used to have a recurring dream that was very unique and happened exactly the same way every time. The strange part of this dream is that it is difficult to explain because I simply lack the words to describe it. I wonder if I was dreaming primarily in my language dominant hemisphere without much crossover...? Or maybe my brain just was imagining something physically impossible such as a strange number of dimensions.

The inexplicable part is that time, distance, and directions other than up or down had no meaning, yet in the dream I had to play a game that was based on moving quickly to somewhere far away and back again along the same path before something crossed the path and took my spot. - Like I said... Doesn't even make sense.

Years later I still remember this dream fairly clearly. I dabble in lucid dreaming, and if I have been laying still in silence for a while, nearly in sleep paralysis, sometimes I'll have waves of deja vu where it feels like I'm almost going to slip into this old recurring dream. I haven't actually had the dream for years and years though.

I'll try to explain the dream to humor you. It sounds like something a schizophrenic would say...

I'll start with the setting, which was the same every time.

It started with a sense of unease and urgency. I knew that Something Bad would happen if I was unsuccessful. I did not have a body. I floated in space. There were never any dream characters, just a great many discrete 'consciousnesses'. Colors were matte and greyish and the landscape was flat and featureless. At this point I would realize that it is a game of sorts and I must begin it. These incorporeal beings started out seeming malevolent, but as the dream progressed I would realize that they are capricious yet competitive and I would start to have fun playing the game.

What the objective of this game was is difficult to describe... Something to do with moving very far in no time at all. The closest analogy I can think of is that I started at the beginning of a tunnel similar to a highway tunnel through a mountain. There are many highway tunnels in all directions all on top of each other. The objective was to go so fast down the tunnel that it takes no time at all and end up back at the starting point. Somehow this involved going in a loop without being anywhere along the loop. And there was always the danger that something else would do it faster than me and take my spot. - Like I said before... Makes no physical sense.

Anyways... Anyone else have something that pushed physical impossibility so far that it is nearly indescribable?

As an extra, I'll tell my favorite dream story. I was in a generic hide from the bad guy dream. I was not lucid. There were bad guys searching for me in a large warehouse complex. I was sneaking around with a group of people all trying to get away and for some reason I took a banana out of my pocket and cut a slice of it off occasionally. Somehow I knew that each banana slice represented 5 minutes. When I reached the end of the banana I woke up without trying to. I looked over at my alarm and realized that it was set to go off in less than 5 min. I think that my 'banana clock' was my brain trying to guess when the alarm would go off and being surprisingly accurate about it.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_upjnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/upjnc/i_used_to_have_a_recurring_dream_that_had_dream/,

So maybe someone here can give me some help? I'll try to describe to the best of my ability.

It starts out with myself at the age of 8 or so, it is at some earlier time in history, possibly early 20th century (based on the clothing in the dream), Also in a possible different country. My family is in a panic, and even with me being young as I was in the dream, I still somehow knew something was going on. They told me to hide in a hidden closet space with my sister and to stay quiet. I hear people barging in the door, shouting and screaming indecipherable words, I'm covering my sister's ears and after five or so minutes, the noise stops. I leave the hidden area, telling my sister to stay put, my family is nowhere to be seen, I crawl my way over to my neighbor's apartment area, and try talking to them as to what exactly is going on, they don't really tell me anything except to stay quiet and hidden with them, as they are hiding behind a couch, there is another group of people who come through the apartment complex, wearing uniforms I can see their black boots, and military-like uniforms. They are speaking a foreign language that I cannot understand, going through the other neighbors' places. I never got to see the exact military people's faces, just basically from the neck down... I remember after they cleared the place my neighbors explained that there was an invasion on our people, me going back to my own apartment area to retrieve my sister. We just cried, not making sense of what was happening. And then I woke up.

It really bothers me to this day and now I've finally found a place to talk about it. I'm on a cell phone so some words may be wrong. Sorry if it's a bit long but i would really like to get some feedback. I am 13 if it makes a difference to the sense of the dream.

So the basic structure of the dream goes like this. I start off by waking up in my bed. Everything is the same. I do this repeatedly and the whole time i believe that it is real life. If it makes any difference, every few times i awoke i would be signifigantly more tired than other times. One time waking up, i get out my phone and browse the internet, but everything just keeps loading forever, this signals a dream state, i did not have my phone and i usually get good reception. I keep reawaking about 7 times total. One time when i wake up, i wake up in a straw bed in a small hut. It feels natural because it is a dream. I go outside and cross the street. The area kind of has long streets and two story buildings. The buildings are like warehouses except with windows and no gaps between buildings. The hut is next to the sidewalk in a fenced area. It is a sunny day. After crossing the street i find my mother drying clothes on a clothesline. She seems very rushed and kind of ignores my presence. She responds when i speak and answers my questions, but does not look at me directly. She tells me that we have to get ready for some kind of festival. It is now that i notice bright flags and banners above the streets and on buildings. She quickly walks inside a slightly bigger hut with no windows but with invisible lighting. There is a table with clothes in the middle of the room. I go to the other side and start to wonder about her strange behaviour. I finaly get a look at her face and notice that her eyes are a bit more droopy than the real her. I now realise that i'm in a lucid dream. I wonder if i should experiment with things or see what happens if i ask ""mom"" about the dream. I remember noting that there could be many risks in signaling that it's a dream. I decide to as anyways. I say to her ""mom, i need to ask you a question."" I ask many times. She keeps avoiding the question many times by talking about how we must get ready for the festival. Finally she stops and says ""what do you want, just say it so i can work."" She looks at me straight in the eye with her droopy eyes and worried look. I then say,""is this... a dream. Are we in a dream right now? Are you my mother or is my mother sound asleep in her bed?"" 

This part is crucial and sort of strange but every bit is true.

She then disappears. Everything turns red and everything just feels generally evil. The best word i would use to describe it is demonic. I then say to myself,""i better try to leave before something bad happens."" Then, recognizing my powers, (i kid you not) i summon a lightning sword for defense in case anything bad comes through the small doorway of the hut. I leave the dream and wake up in real life. I noticed before that in the dream, when i had to get up from my straw bed, my knee did not make a cracking noise like it usually does. I got out of bed and tried making the noise to be sure that it was real life. It was. I was too scared of the demonic scene to go back to sleep. 

I would really like to talk about this dream with someone else. I have decided that if i get another lucid dream, i will see what staying for the demonic scene to continue does to me. I would prefer not to have to do this, but i would even more prefer to know. If anyone else has had this experience, talking about it would be much apreciated. 

Does anyone know what the purpose of the festival might have been? 
Where was everybody else?
Why did everything become demonic?
What made me choose a lightning sword as my weapon?

Any answers or feedback would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

As a kid, around the age of 5-7(putting this around the year of 1994-1996), I would sometimes go to my parents room to sleep. My mom kept a pallet out on her side of the bed for my sister or I in these cases. Several of these times I would wake up in the middle of the night, and look at the door leading to the hall.( I always felt like I was awake so that's why this may not be considered a dream, sorry if this doesn't go here.) These times that I would wake up, there would be a half man, half wolf silhouette standing in the door frame. I was never afraid of this silhouette, I just knew he was there and knew for the fact that he was half wolf. At this time, I had no idea what a werewolf was. The first werewolf show I ever saw was ""Big Wolf on Campus"" a few weeks later so I don't believe I manifested this silhouette from any pop culture reference.

Let's jump forward 14-16 years and I'm sitting at a table with my sister, mom, and soon to be wife. We get on the subject of dreams, and I disclose that I use to see something standing in the door frame. Before I could describe more, my sister butted in and asked if it was wolvish. Obviously after saying yes, she opened up and saw a wolf man watch over her too. My mom then said that when she was real little that this silhouette also stood in her door frame.

So, I grew intrigued and tried googling but found nothing. That was several months, if not a year or two, ago. My friend mentioned the dreams subreddit so I thought I'd share here and see if anyone has an inkling idea.

That many people dreaming the same thing can be creating it in the world.  There's a quote from Jung that I am paraphrasing, that if you don't pay attention to your dreams then you will meet them in the street as your fate.

So apocalypse, utter destruction, then salvation only for the good, or for everyone.  As in Revelations in the Bible.  As the cycle of creation and destruction (Kali) in Hindu stories.  We are in the Kali age (yuga.) The Mayan prediction of the end of the world in 2012.  And the Zombie apocalypse, darkest of all, nobody wins.

1.  The apocalypse as described in the Bible is literally true.  Watch out for Horsemen.

2.  There always has been a fear of the destruction of the world.  Most recently the Kohoutec Comet and then Y2K.  I was there.  Nothing happened.

3.  The apocalypse as described in the Bible is symbolic, like a dream would be.

Symbolic of what, and why now?

A new understanding of God and the spiritual is taking place in the Western world.  

The last time this happened was the birth of Christianity, which took centuries to form into an established church.  It was a shakeup of everyone's world view. And the old world view fought back!

And as the new is emerging, people will experience the changing/destruction of the old ideas with imagery like in the Bomb, apocalypse, Earth climate destruction, and of course, the zombies.  (They did rise from their graves, but were destruction, not salvation.)

The more we pay attention to these images and what they carry, the less likely these events will have to play out in the world.

No conclusion.  Just throwing out some thoughts.

So, here's a few dream recall tips I hope others find helpful:

1) Awake slowly... being jolted out of dream state by an alarm clock isn't conducive to helping conscious awareness get in contact with remaining tendrils of waning dream state.  So, if you can, awake naturally, and slowly... don't even open your eyes or move your body... just lay there for a few minutes... try to recall any tiny bit of the dreamscape, feelings, images, etc... once you get a handhold in the dreamscape, you can wiggle your way in deeper, and deeper into fuller recall.

2) Journal your dreams... even if you only remember a bit... it's a good practice.

3) Always record your dreams in first person present tense as much as possible... So, not ""I saw a bridge and went over it"", but ""I see a bridge.  I am going over the bridge.""... this does a trick on your mind and actually puts your conscious perspective back into experiencing the dreamscape, and can help provide a cascade of dreamscape detail recall.  Also the first person present tense perspective is more conducive to extracting valuable interpretation.

4) Have fun with it... sometimes you'll get it, sometimes it'll just slip away.

5) Practice... as with all things will improve.

They've always been very vivid, I suppose it doesn't help that I have a photographic memory. They are extremely graphic (I still remember a scene in one I had when I was about 8 of a naked blonde woman I've never seen before being torn up in a shower) and as I get older a little more realistic, which to me makes them more frightening. 

My main concern is that, since around the age of 10 or 11, I've been dreaming of my dad trying to kill me, or do other things to me that a father should not do to his daughter. I do have serious daddy issues, and many real life memories. I just want them to stay out of my dreams. In dreams, anything can happen, right? 

I should probably mention somewhere around here that my father killed himself about a year and a half ago. In real life. Since then, he still enters my dreams with the same motive; for the first while, as himself, but now more often than not, he comes in the form of someone else. Like he's possessing them. And when he is possessing them, I sometimes see him in the background, looking all zoned out like an empty shell of a person. It's really creepy.

Anyway, I'm 20 years old now, and over the many years that these dreams have consistently been going on, my father gets closer and closer to murdering me. Last year, I dreamed that he had my sister and I in his car and was driving us out in the bush to kill us, and I had to watch my sister die before I woke up. 

Now for the past 2 weeks, I've been having more abstract dreams, but a short while before the dream is over, my party (usually family members, once my father was there himself) and I start planning a road trip, and as the nights go on we get closer and closer to getting out there to our destination. It's always someplace wild looking, like a little cottage by the water or an open field full of free looking people. 

4 nights ago, while I was on a path in my dream connecting one of these little settlement to the next, a man scary as fuck who I knew was supposed to be my father started running after me and my legs turned to jell-o (you know what I mean) and I tried to scream but nothing came out of me. He jumped on me and I tried to kick and was still screaming. I felt something sharp and then slowly started to hear my scream get louder until I woke up, still screaming and crying. My boyfriend was there and said I'd been screaming for at least 45 seconds before I actually woke up and he didn't know what to do. Since then, my dreams have been leading up to the same point, but luckily there's always something that happens in the real world to wake me up (the cat jumps on the bed, my boyfriend accidentally sets the alarm too early..) and then I just stay up. So now I've just been staying up late and waking up early to keep myself from having to experience it all over again.Last night cut it really close, where my father possessed my mom and she had a rope out and was ready to jump at me. 

If anyone knows about anything that could help me with this, I'd really appreciate it. I hope no one else has to experience the fear I go through every night. 

Is there some sort of drug I could take, even? Obviously, I've seen a therapist before but I liked to keep the wishy washy-ness out of out meetings. I'd mention it sometimes, but she really wasn't into it. I guess they effect me so much because of my photographic memory. Everything seems so real and important when I wake up.

I've got daddy issues and since I was a kid have been dreaming that my dad is chasing me, tries to kill/fuck with my body. He gets closer every time. A few nights ago, he succeeded and now I've been staying  up late and waking up early to avoid it, but he's still getting closer.

It was up to that time the most intense dream I'd had. 

My religious upbringing was neutral with a hint of Catholic horror lurking at the edges. My grandmother was *very* religious, very Catholic, and my mom was the rebellious daughter: she hadn't been to church in decades but still had that fear in her heart. I went to Sunday school as a kid, I knew my basics but we didn't practice.

I dreamt that I was playing in my yard when God spoke to me from above. I couldn't see him and had no impression of anyone being physically there, which seemed very natural at the time.

He told me that I could do anything I wanted to, that I would have the power to do whatever I liked including fly and make things appear with my mind. I had a blast with this. 

During this scene everything was very bright and warm. At some point I came up with the idea to summon a cloud of bees to attack people who had hurt me. Only those people, no others; the people who hurt other people.

(The bees reappeared in dreams later in life as swollen, prehistoric wasps sleeping in massive hives.)

As soon as the bees went out and started to hurt them, the skies went dark and God's presence reappeared. I was instantly chastened but the voice said in a very deep tone that because of what I had done, all the powers he had given would be stripped from me and I would be left alone and out of his presence. I was stricken by this, and the dream ended with me kneeling alone by myself in the dark cold, feeling utterly bereft and hollow, down where the family dog ordinarily did her business. I was utterly abandoned. 

I don't know how young I was, but I felt slightly differently about God from that day forward.

I was in a white room. There were pipes and some wiring evident in the room, but otherwise it was a nondescript enclosure. Suddenly, a door opened slightly. I opened it and saw that it opened to space (I didn't feel any kind of decompression or other physical effects you'd expect from such a scenario). I did the only logical thing and jumped out.

The door closed behind me and suddenly I was enveloped in darkness. There were arbitrary pinpoints of light, which I recognized as celestial objects. In the darkness, I thought that I was still, but I realized (similarly to Einstein's elevator) that I was ""falling"" at a constant velocity. Every now and then I would ""pass by"" a star or a galaxy; I was cognizant of the fact that they were dangerous, but I didn't feel afraid because I knew that the odds of me actually coming into contact with these bodies were astronomically small. I ""fell"" through several galaxies, and passed by stars.

Eventually I ""sensed"" an invisible presence looming. I put my hands out in front of me and, lo and behold, I stopped. I felt around and I realized that I was in a corner. Yes, in space. I had reached a literal corner of the universe. I sat in the corner for a little bit, and then I kicked off and began returning. 

The return trip seemed to go by faster; my velocity seemed to be of greater magnitude. Eventually, I reached the door that I had originally come from. It was slightly open; I pushed it open further, and climbed up. As I went through the portal, I woke up.

I'm not quite sure what to make of this, but as a scientifically-minded individual, I'm quite intrigued by the implications.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_lfg5t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/lfg5t/falling_through_space/,

We were kind of just hanging out in the living room and talking when there was a loud noise and we ran down the hall in to my parent's bedroom and then the bathroom.

There's a standing shower stall in that bathroom and I had my daughter get in and closed the door. I had the bathroom door closed and locked, but whoever was in the house sent small little green fly looking machines to go under the door. I was squishing them all.

Then he tried to ram the door open and I kept my feet against the door to keep it shut while he rammed it. My daughter stayed pretty calm throughout all of this, actually. 

He shouted at some point ""Why don't you just give up?!"" to which I replied ""I'm protecting my daughter! Why are you doing this?!""

He explained he's from an alien race and that no one has hunted humans before because we're so far away from the rest of civilization. I thought to myself how I'd like to ask him where others exist, and what he could tell me about the universe, but instead he's trying to kill me so we couldn't really have that conversation.

Finally, he stopped banging on the door and I thought he gave up. Then there's another noise, and I look out the window to see this cube-shaped ship that looks like earth (only cube instead of sphere) and it cuts through our atmosphere like it's a sheet, and the air starts flowing out in to space.

I turned to my daughter and told her ""Ok. It's time to wake up now."" she says ""Ok."" and then I woke myself up.

I was in a large all you can eat restaurant called ""Most of Us Are Pork"" named aptly because it was full of characters dressed in pig costumes running around the restaurant playing with the kids that were playing in the large tubes of the indoor play area or loitering around the arcade machines.

It was a large buffet with all kinds of food and people were shoving food in their mouths like they hadn't eaten in ages. Everyone was obese and if they weren't obese I could see them slowly growing larger and larger and ballooning as the costumed characters ran back and forth to the buffet for them to get them more food. Most of the people sitting at the tables eating had snub upturned noses and snorted a bit while they shoved food into their mouths.

A family of four was sitting in one of the booths and the father and mother were shoving food into the mouths of their toddlers strapped tightly into ""child seats"" at the table.

In the corner sat a bunch of characters that I hadn't noticed before, a chicken, a cow and a pig. The pig was shoving fists of bacon into his mouth, the cow was shoving hamburger after hamburger into his mouth and the chicken was devouring chicken wings. I first noticed the pig who was sighing and sobbing and when I walked up to the table, I noticed that all of them were crying so hard that the food on the table was soaked with their tears.

I followed costumed characters leading a family towards the back of the restaurant. The family walked seemingly dutifully and purposefully behind the characters down a narrow hallway to the back. I followed invisible as they entered a dark room where there was a chair used to perform executions. There was no light in the room except a spotlight on the chair from above. The father sat in the chair first and was grinning from ear to ear as they strapped him in.

The pig threw a large switch on the wall and there was a flash of light in the room like lightning. On the back wall behind the man was a cross-stitch pattern with a smiling pig that said ""You are what you eat."" and when I looked back to the chair they were unstrapping a large squealing pig from the chair where the man used to be.

I’m not talking about hypnogogia and being paralyzed, but a period where you’re still dreaming while awake and aware of it. I guess hallucinations would be more akin to what I’m trying to describe.

I had one this morning around 4am. I was dreaming and then “woke up” to find my friend lying on the bed next to me. I then proceeded to have a conversation with her about my dream. 

All of a sudden a vampire midget appeared and began climbing up the bed. I was going to yell to her to look out for the vampire midget, but I paused for a second because I was wondering if it might be more politically correct to say dwarf instead. Anyways, I swung at the vampire and hit my nightstand, at which moment the vampire and my friend disappeared.

It wasn’t like I was jolted awake or anything when my hand hit my nightstand. I saw it connect and I had an unbroken stream of consciousness from when I swung to when my fist connected with the nightstand.

I then laid there on my bed for a while, aware of the absurdity of vampire midgets, aware that I was hallucinating, yet still terrified of the possibility that the little bastard might come back.

I remembered the IAMA thread about the woman who was a paranoid schizophrenic and the goat hallucinations saying that it was a very bad idea to interact with the hallucinations. “Shit!” I thought, “I just interacted with the vampire midget! Now it will get worse!” At the same time I was arguing with my dreaming self that I was awake, that vampire midgets weren’t real, that I was in my own apartment and needed to man up. I thought for a moment if Zoloft might cause hallucinations, since I took 100mg of that before bed, but I’ve never had problems in the past.

I’ve had these periods every once in a blue moon. They’re always different, but the one thing that remains constant is half of me still dreaming while the other half of my consciously and rationally tries to convince my dreaming half that it is, in fact, dreaming.

I never have this issue when I’m awake. I never hallucinate when I’m fully awake. I don’t hear voices in my head. I have no mental health issues aside from some depression. No history of mental illness in the family.

Am I alone in this?

Movie theaters. It's always movie theaters.


If these were entirely recurring dreams, I wouldn't have a problem. I probably could have figured out what they meant a long time ago. But 'being inside of a movie theater' is the only common theme keeping these dreams similar. 


Sometimes the lights are on, and I'm just talking with people in the theater. Sometimes the lights are all off, and a movie is playing. Sometimes the movie is based on a real movie, sometimes it's completely made up. On other occasions, I'm being chased/hiding in the theater, sometimes I'm beating someone up. I've been happy, sad, scared, excited, thrilled, and every other possible emotion you can imagine. Sometimes I'm sitting with friends, sometimes I'm alone or among strangers. A few times I can remember, the screen was replaced with a stage, although everything else remained the same.


So it comes down to the theater itself. I have tried and failed to discover what the theater represents to me, (and it's not even the same theater every time!) but I can't figure it out for the life of me. It's not exactly like these dreams are bad, but the unrealized symbolism of it just nags me relentlessly, and I'm thinking about it often.


TL:DR I have constant dreams about movie theaters, although the situation in the theater is different every time. Has anyone had an experience similar to this? What could it represent?

This morning I woke up crying after a weird dream.
I'm a male of 25 years old and normally barely cry.
I wouldn't say I'm the happiest person at times, but I make do with what I got. (accepting live for what it is).

I can't remember everything, but the last part is very clear. I was swimming with an old female friend, whom I had a crush on in my teens, but that's all over now. We still talk once in a few months, but just as friends. The friend in question also has anorexia and a lot of problems with her parents(drunks). 

So we were swimming randomly until we came to a slide thingy which was very dangerous. It could go very wrong and she could drown. But only one person at a time could enter and nobody could see what was happening. For some reason I was scared it could go wrong, but thought ""she was ready"", I don't know why. Her self-esteem was up the roof as well, which made me happy.

So I was waiting for her return, hoping everything went alright. 
Luckily she made it, but had lost her memory of everything, her name, me, all the problems. At first I thought this was a bad thing for her, because she made such good progress with her self-esteem(doing the dangerous slide thingy on her own). But then I noticed she was doing even better then normal, she didn't know anything anymore of her problems and was just really happy with no bad thoughts what so ever.

Then I really felt sad because I couldn't feel that way. Woke up, tears.
(Anyway I think that was the reason why I felt sad)

It was all really random and weird, like a big roller coaster. Especially because it's such a random person in my dream and the events were really strange. And when you're reading this, it doesn't even sound like anything to cry for, but the emotions were quiet heavy.

Does anybody experienced such things as well, or have any explanation? 

Pardon my grammar, my English isn't the greatest.

It was dark in the building itself, and outside the windows was nighttime. 

We were scrounging around looking for any sort of light be it flashlights, candles, lanterns etc. Extremely loud and building shaking thunder was sporadic. But every time it stopped, a loud metal clank would occur on the roof of the building. Everyone kept saying they were these alien capsules from space. However this one lone guy who had no family or friends with him was trying to explain to me that this was Gods answer to this virus that was spreading. After 5 or 6 clanks on the roof, a friend of mine and myself went to go see what was up there. As we approached the rooftop access door, it opened for us and two people stood on the rooftop. They were clones of myself and my friend Jay. Scared the hell out of me. They sounded as scared as we did and begged to be let in. We did under the condition they would remain seated in these two specific seats. 

After asking them a hundreds of questions each, we learned they had no recollection of capsules, any sort of journey ... They were scared to see us and see themselves on the other side of the door. They knew of the virus but didn't know what it did (neither did we really). They had no families or friends that we had. My clone did not recognize my sister Kristen who was with me. 

The rooftop door opened again and a clone for each person came down the stairs. With everyone in a panic, we did not realize everyone, including our clones were all mixed up. From across the room I see my sister and her clone walking off (didn't know who was who). A knife was taken and my sister was stabbed, by herself. I ran over to do something, but I didn't know what. It was my sister. Clone or not, I had no clue, but I couldn't retaliate. I just stood there in shock. 

I immediately turned around and saw my clone just standing there. Looking at my dead sister and it seemed like I was about to start crying. I grabbed the knife and slit my clones throat. I couldn't stand that fact that they showed emotion to someone who they said they didn't know. He said he didn't recognize my sister, he didn't know her. But when emotion had been shown on his face, I felt betrayed and lied to. 

One by one, each one of the pairs had died. Through all the chaos, no one was upset. We didn't know if the person now left, was the real person, or the clone. 

..... This scenario ended I guess ......

I then remember laying in this bed, in the same building we were in, and knowing I was dying. I was the same age, wearing the same clothes. But I was not right. Everyone around me was telling me it was ok. I would be healthy again. I asked to be alone because I didn't know who was who. I knew my time was coming and I just wanted to be alone.

I died... I don't know what happened to my soul. The only thing that was made apparent to me was that I made the wrong decision. That millions all over the world made the wrong choice. The clones were sent to replace us. We were all infected with some virus. The clones were exact clones and wouldn't remember our past until the original was dead.

(She also has sleep paralysis, but these are real dream states not s.p.)

I've never met anyone else who dreams like me. I don't necessarily have reoccurring dreams, but I have reoccurring places that I visit in my dreams. In fact my dreams are kind of like a continuing story and in my dreams I will remember past dreams as if they are memories. I notice when things have been altered or changed and if I don't like it I have had things change back the next time I visit that place in a dream. I have dreamed about these same places since I was a child and I can navigate through them even when I am awake. Sometimes it will take me a moment to realize I am remembering a dream and not a real memory. I love the places in my dreams, I have houses, neighborhoods, schools, theme-parks, playgrounds, cities, etc... When I was little I used to have this nightmare about this one creepy old house that I had to crawl through small spaces to find my way out away from the evil old man who kidnapped children and locked them in his house; this house is in the woods at the top of a huge hill and I know the way there, but as I got older I remembered to not go near the house. The house is still there in my dreams, but I know to stay away. I also have a city, one of many cities, where Bozo's fun house is and I once dreamed that Bozo's place closed down and I was so disappointed, that the next time I visited that city in my dreams, Bozo's place had reopened and I was glad that it was back. My places are very complex and very vivid. My favorite dreams always take place in one of my familiar places. I even have a swamp, a forest, back roads, malls and so much more. I have a Disney World, a Sea World, more than one swimming pool, the coolest roller coaster ever and amazing neighborhoods with the most incredible homes.

Does anyone else have dreams like this? I have never met anyone who has a whole dream world where they visit the same places over and over. I really do love my dreams. I do have to be careful though, because my dreams are very real, I have learned to not watch horror movies, because the things I see in real life definitely find there way into my dreams.

Ive been doing nothing with my life besides sitting in front of a computer screen, wasting away. Everything seems to be going downhill lately. I got kicked out of school and I cant find a job. I tried volunteering at loaves and fishes to help keep myself busy but I find that im not even useful there. I dont have any friends anymore. I dont know why but I just stopped talking to everybody I know. I cant sleep very much. I feel lucky if I could even sleep a couple of hours during the night and on the rare occasion that I can get a full eight hours of sleep Its done throughout the day and I wake up at 1:00 AM feeling as though Ive wasted my day even though I know it would have been spent doing nothing. What upsets me the most though is that the only place im happy is in my dreams. Im only happy when im around a girl I see in my dreams.

We were forced to kill each other to survive, kind of like battle royal or the hunger games. But me and her just hid on a cliff and talked and laughed. We eventually escaped the area where we were being forced to fight. Thats the last I remember of that dream. Almost every time I would go to sleep I would see her. And we would do the same things. Just talk kind of like new couples do in movies. Just cute banter and getting to know each other, making jokes, but nothing even sexual.  We would always be around some type of violent environment like fights or wars or harsh arguments. Sometimes I would be a across the room from her and I would look at her, she would catch me staring and I would look away embarrassed and she gave a cute little laugh. I would never touch her, or hug her, or kiss her like I wanted to. We would just talk. Somehow that was enough though. And I felt really good in my dreams. When I would wake up and realize she wasn't real I would feel sad like a loved one had just died. It would take a few minutes for me to internally debate with myself that she's just not real and that Ive never met this woman in my life. Anyway, I saw her in my dreams for a few months and then last night happened. I dreamt that Me and  about fifty other people along with the girl were in some kind of war zone. We were in some sort of a small town and we were trapped  in an old church trying to fight back against an enemy that I didnt know and couldnt see. But me and her just ignored the violence and sat in the back of church just talking and laughing like we usually did. Eventually after what felt like a few hours of this I came to realize that the people I was in the church with were losing the battle and I began to see almost all of them dying. Eventually all of them but the girl and one other were gone, with the enemy about to break into the church and kill us too. So I told the girl we have to run. But she wouldnt respond to me. She just looked paralyzed. Frozen in time. I told her that we would be killed if we didnt leave the church and try and make a run for it. But she didnt respond to me. She just stared blankly. The one other person grabbed me and pulled me away from her and we began to run out of the church. Somehow, even though I felt like I needed to stay with the girl no  matter what and that she needed me right now I still ran away. Me and the guy ran and ran for hours till we were far away from that church. In my dream I started sobbing because I knew the enemy that had killed everyone else in the church had killed the girl too and that I did nothing to stop it. Then I woke up.

In the last few weeks, I've been changing my eating habits in order to be more healthy and fit.  This has been a huge challenge for me because I love desserts and deep fat fried food and constantly have cravings for sugar and sodium-filled foods.  Anyway, I've been having these dreams lately where I get to indulge on all the things I've been eliminating from my diet.

Last night in particular, I was surrounded by food for miles.  Just millions of clean, white plates topped with chocolate cakes, ice cream, french fries, fried chicken, the list goes on and on.  I was pigging out on all this food and felt so happy and satisfied.  While eating, I thought to myself, ""This isn't healthy, I need to stop."" But then somehow my brain recognized it was a dream and let me keep indulging, kind of like a lucid dream.  

Waking up, I was a little confused and thought I had actually binged on the food then realized, again, that it was a dream.  I felt great! Another interesting thing about these dreams is that they're in third person; I can see myself eating.  Maybe it's because I see myself as a different person now.

After I was unfrozen, I went and found my car and drove to declare my love for my first serious girlfriend.

I'm unsure why I dreamt about her. We dated at least five years ago and seen each other maybe twice since we broke up.

She had gotten married, so when I found her she was really dumbfounded since she thought I was dead. I tried to kiss her and got shot down. She told me that I had been immature when we first dated and that she could never trust me. Dejected, I left. 

So I went home to see my parents, who, somehow in the year I had been frozen, had two children who were now 8 and 9 and were both named after my sister. 

I walked inside and hugged it out with my dad who was excited his only son hadn't died. Then the rest of the dream, my family came by and everyone was saying hi to me and talking about how excited they were that I wasn't dead. The whole thing felt amazing. Almost like I got to see how much love I have in my life.

It seems like an incredibly vain dream (everyone is excited to see me/showing me love that I'm not dead) to have. However, this has been the most memorable/life-like dream I've had in a while. When I woke up, I felt really guilty that my current girlfriend wasn't in the dream since she's a major part of my life, but still felt very loved despite being rejected by my first long term girlfriend.

Anyways the dream goes like this; Im chillin on my block, when all of a sudden, me and 2 friends I am with, who happen to be Krillin and Vegta, yes from DBZ, realize that my wife (im not acutally married, nor have a GF) who is not chichi is going into labour. they quickly shoot off into the sky (flying). I attempt to follow suit but, cannot. Almost like my batteries died, but I could not follow them into the sky, and after a few more tries I give up. I begin wandering around the block in wondering, between certain houses and then stumble upon an old friend who I have not seen in months. He brings me inside one of the houses, and I being expelling a disgusting amount of phlegm into the sink of a bathroom. At this point other friends of mine (actual friends from RL) are surrounding me and inspecting the phlegm. the sink is literally full of it at this point. Someone takes a lighter to the sink and instantly the stuff catches fire, I'm sitting in the tub thinking, what the fuck is happening to me, while the friend with the lighter looks at me, disappointingly.

I sort of fade out of REM sleep at this point, but do not actually wake up, 45mins may have gone by (I was having terrible sleep all night, constantly tossing and turning). So I was aware when I was coming to. Deep sleep beings again, and I dream-awake in a video game world, I knew this immediately for whatever reason and just begin mucking about what I know is a car park. By mucking about I was literally just revving around on a dirtbike, kinda like the Sanchez from gta. Anyways I time a certain jump right in front of a moving car, just for kicks, I hear the driver say HOLY SHIT as I fly by on the dirtbike. I come to a safe landing and feel pretty bad ass, when all of a sudden a  strange dog creature comes running out of the darkness, which later turned out to be a small wooded area on the far end of the car park. I get off the bike and begin running away, the dog-creature thing catches up so I push it away, it whimpers back to the forest. People have noticed me now and are gathering around me, I look at faces and realize i know almost everyone there. Friends family, co-workers etc, people from my day to day. The creature whimpers back towards us and I begin to notice it has many thorns and twigs stuck in its skin,  which is surprisingly human. I being to tend to it and take out as many twigs as I can. the dog-creatures likes this and feels comfortable, as do I. I give it a hug and (here is the weird part) give it a nice firm pat on the ass, as to say (good on ya). All of a sudden I'm being pushed away from the dog by the crowd that had gathered, and they are telling me its going to be fine, and that they will take care of it. I catch the glimpse of someone I used to date, and dare say loved, who mouths the words, its not okay! at this point i get a bit nervous, but then the dream fades out as the creature is blocked out of sight by the moving crowd. 

I looked up symbols for phlegm and nothing, symbols for not being able to fly and could not find anything. and this creature I could not find anything, but I'm sure is my subconscious, primitive side...

everything went fuzzy again and i was standing there in a grey place and i was with my Papa who passed away a few years ago and he took me hand and we went for a walk through the front door of my grandparents old house. there was a big flash and i was at my funeral, standing there at the back of the funeral home while all my friends and family were there.

It started off something like I was in a subway platform that had tons off about 6 foot high doors that were closed with the platform was long and turned corners. There was at least 30 of these doors on each of the side. Everything was fine. I'm not sure what the point of me being there was, but people were just going about their day. All of a sudden these doors started popping open one by one with huge thuds and people started rushing to close them. After about 10 seconds I joined in closing the doors, but they all started flying open again. What came out of them were all sorts of these creatures ranging from huge to as small as a cat. They all had the same color scheme of black, white, and gray. They would exhale this gray dust into people's face and when they breathed it in they would change to the same color scheme as the monsters and gain the powers the monsters have (exhaling this gray dust, being able to move fast, climb, jump etc...). I go trapped by one fairly quickly for some reason, and when he exhaled the gas on me, I began to fight the affects it was trying to do. Now when these creatures exhaled the gas it would change the colors of everything it hit...so it seemed like the goal of these monsters were to come into this world and essentially make everything its own (trees, grass, buildings, cars, water etc...). So back to me fighting the gas. I fought it and I turned into the dark colored scheme, but did not have the urge to try and exhale my gas on anyone or anything. Seeing this as a free cars sorta, I ran away outside of the ""station"". The outside was made to look my campus at university. Its a school of about 80,000 students so its a huge campus with tons of tall buildings. I used my powers to get to the top of a building and lay on my stomach and peer over the edge (maybe a 13 story building). As I sat and watched police and swat like men began showing up in huge amounts of numbers, while normal people began running from the station while the creatures continued to chase people. At this point the dark color scheme began to just engulf everything and the cops were obviously losing. I left the building and blended in with the creatures. I began exploring the area and began seeing very odd things. Kinda like the dimension began to change. There were objects and machines that are not real in this lifetime, but could be made with the machinery we have. Best example I can think of is one of those flying hot air balloon gunner robots from the newest bioshock game. Just found out they are called mosquitoes. PIC---&gt;(http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Mosquito?file=BioShockInfinite2.jpg) There were other types of machines, and different small animals that were being consumed by the gas. Then all of a sudden I changed to extremely bright and vibrant colors and anything I touched would turn extremely bright like red orange yellow. As I turned into these colors the creatures started noticing so I ran. This is the part of the dream that became really intense. I still had the ability to climb fast and whatever, but it was 1 vs thousands. It was in a third person view at this point in the dream. I just began running and anytime anything got close to me I touched it and it changed color, but it was immediately consumed by the creatures (when I say consumed I mean instantly turned to the dark color scheme because so many were exhaling the gas on them). I finally broke away and got into a pond and went underwater. I must have been able to hold my breath real long because when I surfaced everything was the dark color scheme. The sky, the ground, the WORLD. But I was still vibrant. I saw a group of small flying creatures just hovering about 300 yards away. They didn't see me. I told myself I need to get these on ""my team"" It was me versus the world right now. I thought there was no way I will be able to change everything, but I need to try. I dove back under the water and swam underneath them and popped up just flailing my arms to try and touch them all. There was a struggle,  but I was able to get them all. So it was me and a small team of about 8 what seemed like oversized wasps. We began roaming as I was trying to touch everything to change it to my colors. We would occasionally run into small packs of was seemed like patrols, but with every group we defeated we grew in numbers so it became easier. I have not seen any people at this point, all just creatures and trees plants etc… So its me and now this small army of creatures. We make our way back to the larger density of buildings on the campus. (I wish there was some bad ass music plaything in the background at this point) We roll in and there is a group of creatures about as large as mine out front with a bunch of cars and machines which too are able to fight. Now shit hits the fan we go in and I start losing tons of my army and I make my way behind everyone and start changing the machines like the cars and flying machines. With the help of the machines were able to win that battle. Then I proceed to go inside the first building and only me. I come across one guard and made eye contact.  Before he can do anything I dive at him and turn him into one of my own. Now people I change into have the ability to change other people. So now me and my newest best friend continue throughout hallways adding people to my army. 
Unfortunately at this point I really can’t recall what happens next, but I eventually win and I change everything  into “me” Like I said it was the best dream I ever had. It was like a movie that I was the star of, but I could have died. Hahah. Thanks for reading!
TL;DR I go on a spree to change everything back to normal.

Roughly 2 months ago I dropped shrooms, not for the first time, but I ended up having a really bad trip and thinking that I was in a coma, and that this reality wasn't real. Found out later that I had a panic attack and thought that my heart had stopped. 

Since then, I've experienced extremely horrifying and recurring panic attacks and feelings of going crazy - so I've completely stopped my drug use, which for the most part was habitual marijuana and cigarette smoking, but occasionally included other stuff (nothing too intense). I'm learning how to cope with my panic attacks and they're becoming less frequent, which is good - I no longer worry that I'm about to die when faced with anxiety.

Fifteen minutes ago, I woke up from a dream in which I was in a house with my current roommates, who I love dearly, but the house felt unfamiliar. I think I was in my room, but something was off about it. I was playing guitar, and the closest one of my roommates who knows me very well was outside the room, and asked me if I was going to play my piano. Confused, I told him I didn't play piano, thinking it was strange of him to ask because he knows this. I look over at the other side of the room, and I see a mirror.

Suddenly, I realize that although I'm playing guitar, my reflection is not - it is holding up a ""peace"" sign with its right hand, at which point I realize that it is not me, but someone who looks exactly like me. I don't know if it wanted to harm me, but more wanted to let me know that what I was experiencing wasn't real. While this is happening, I hear a painful screeching like a buzz saw cutting through my head, and I wake up hyperventilating and extremely frightened. What is going on? It really felt like my head was being split in half as soon as I saw the reflection's hand - I don't want to go crazy. Do I need psychological help?

I was at a wild west saloon type of bar, talking to the barkeep. In an RPG-like sort of way, he told me about a bounty on a guy called Judas. He was known to operate with the local criminal gangs as an informal leader of sorts. I asked about the bounty.

At this moment, an old crone surrounded by flames appears from behind the bar, and shouts very aggressively at me that ""Judas can't be defeated without special preparations! No man can catch him with his *bare hands*!"" I'm hit by the flames and lose a little bit of HP. Her forcefulness does a disservice to her credibility, and I continue on my hunt for Judas.

Picture a log cabin in a sparsely populated desert. It's built like a block house, with the top floor hanging over the front door, making a sort of shaded porch. Near the door, and the obligatory rocking chair, there are a couple of urban hoodlums physically arguing about something. I knew this was the right place.

As I approached unnoticed, Dave Chappelle comes out of the house. He has a trollface-like expression as he tells the two to ""calm down, motherfuckers!"" with his body angled away from us. I follow his front arm down his body... to see that he is openly masturbating as he says this. His eyes meet mine and I'm discovered!

**""You can't transmute me! I'm Judas, motherfucker!""** he shouts, in-character, as he runs into the house. I chase him, unbuttoning my pants and beginning to masturbate just like him. Clearly, my transmutation power works by imitation.

I chase him into the bathroom, where he turns to face me. I've got him cornered, but the look on his face isn't one of defeat. **""Ha-ha!""** and he disappears. I run to search the house, knowing he's in there.

What follows is a Scooby-Doo-like sequence of finding him and losing him again, all the while we've both got our pants unbuttoned and mysteriously held up at the belt, and continually masturbating. In the end, he has the last laugh:

**""How do you like that, bitch?! Nobody can transmute Judas! Ahahahaha!""**

I left home and arrived at my first layover destination which was familiar, but unknown.  

After a short stop, I hopped back on the plane and drifted off to sleep. When I awoke, it was a little strange, but fun exploring the new concourse. Something seemed out of place, outside of it being new to me...everyone seemed...different.  Everyone was more friendly.  I actually felt a higher level of tolerance from others in my dream, it was really comforting!

I asked an airline employee behind the desk where I was, and she replied ""France!"". Interestingly looking back to my dream I actually noticed a flag for Germany when she said this, but I registered it as France while experiencing it. 

Immediately I panicked.  No passport. Work in 48 hours. No one knew where I was.

It was a strange panic, one where I knew the consequences, but simultaneously brimming with euphoria. 

After a bit of reacting to the news, the lady offered some help.  We strolled around and talked a bit about myself, herself and her job last the airport, and France.

Finally she introduced me to a gentleman who asked for my credit cars and was delighted to tell me he found a plane trip immediately back home for 500 dollars.  I was a little disappointed because I wasn't expecting to spend this, but I didn't feel regret having accidentally flown to France.

Coincidentally my dream never touched on the passport issue again and I just left.  Not sure how I made it there or back, but its a dream haha.  I felt happy leaving but yearned to go back.  The lady who assisted me was very beautiful too, and even now I am trying to remember how she looked.  This unknown women made quite the impression.

But that's it.  If you like reading dreams hoped you like it!  It was one of my favorite recent dreams.

This also made me remember two previous dreams from a few months/years ago. 

    So my most recent dream is as follows:
I'm at home in my lounge and the tv is on the news channel, there is a story rolling about mass tornado's tearing it up all over the world. This gets followed by me taking my lunch break at work and heading towards the supermarket to pick up some food, on my way i look out and can see all the other countries, from my home island (Guernsey), being obliterated by these tornado's.

I think nothing of it and continue on to purchase my food. Now, it's on the way back that it all goes down and i see a car a few hundred meters away from mine get picked up by the wind and tossed into the horizon. I then start feeling my car being pulled backwards up into the air, i'm clinging on the the inside door handle with my other arm over the side of the car (for some reason the car has no roof).

This is when the real WTF moment comes in, the whole scene kinda pans out and i'm stood in my kitchen making a cup of coffee (which i dont drink) whilst watching the contents of the cup. The cup is playing like a tv the scene i was just in, but it's an advert for the coffee.
And that was the end of that Dream.

The other Dreams that i had second hand memories of after i woke up entailed

* a zombie apocalypse in which i made my way to a friends house where he had built an island in his garden with a moat around it.

* The world was coming to an end by the means of mass tsunami's that would engulf everything, i survived it by retreating on the same friends as in the dream above's boat.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,1362844920.0,,,True,t3_19z2no,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/19z2no/i_think_my_dream_got_a_little_out_of_hand_last/,

I have never experienced a dream like this before. I've had the regular nightmare where I'm being chased and even some weird ones where maybe there's a giant scary face looking at me, but nothing like this.

The dream started out like I was at a banquet. It was a very large room with a lot of people sitting around eating dinner. Then, out of nowhere people started shooting themselves one-by-one in the chest, stomach, head, everything. I can usually stand more than the next person when it comes to gore, but this physically hurt to watch. Not only were the people killing themselves one-by-one, but they were all people I knew.

So I was walking down the road with some friends, three of them actually. One of the women was how I imagine Nynaeve. We came upon this small red fortress and one of the women said ""someone is keeping the Aes Sedai captive."" 


We go in and are greeted by about 50 Aes Sedai held in a room by a man and a woman. The woman's face was always in shadow but her hair was black. Her friend looked like how I imagined Artur Hawkwing. It was obvious the man was in charge.


I came to the conclusion that I have to kill the woman first then the man. I go to what looked like my real life bedroom. I go to my closet and take my  two ka-bar knives.


I go back to that big room and stab at the woman. I miss and she pulls a knife on me. I disarm her Assassin's Creed style. I then stab her with all three knives. She screams and I slowly take the knives out and very slowly stab her again. For some reason I take some sadistic pleasure out of stabbing her. There's no blood.

First, I was in the driveway of my parents house and noticed that the clouds were very low, near the ground, and were floating towards me. As they moved closer, they engulfed the entire street and driveway and began to float over my feet. The clouds rose to around my waist and were very fluffy and I just began to run around and play in them as if they were waves in the ocean. Very cool but such an odd dream!

Then, I was walking through an outdoor market towards a hotel that I was staying at. As I got inside, I realized things weren't normal. There were blood streaks in the hallways and when I got to my room, it was filled with people who were being held hostage there. I backed out of the room and looked down the hallway and saw two dead bodies being dragged away. Back in the room, I soon came to understand that one of the men was planning on killing everyone in the room. For some reason, I wasn't too scared about any of this. I kind of accepted that we were all going to die. No one really tried to escape, either.

The killer was a overweight kid, maybe in his early 20's. I went up and asked him why he wants to kill human beings, hoping to change his mind. However, he just reported 'My mind is made up' and pushed me away. He handed me and the friend I was with bottles of poison and told us that that was how we would die. Each other person would be killed in different ways.

This is when it got really weird - I remember thinking 'If I die in this dream, will I die in real life?'. I remember being aware of the fact that i was lying in my bed, in my bedroom. It was as if I was half asleep, half awake.

Anyway, I have no idea why none of us fought this, but we all stood in a line and he began to kill us. I drank my poison, glad that it was the least painful of the deaths. I suddenly felt very light and floaty, and realized that myself along with all the other victims were floating around together inside a grocery store. It was supposedly the afterlife.

I was lying in bed in contemplation as I usually do , I had closed my eyes maybe 2 minutes at this point. For some reason the topic of the meaning of life came to mind. Now while thinking about this I came to the conclusion that the meaning was happiness and sharing happiness, now this is where things turn weird.

As soon as this theory came to mind I felt calm and all my thoughts cleared. A voice came over me deep and resonating telling me I had uncovered the meaning of life and that I could be at peace now. At this point I instantly feel sweat all over and i'm terrorfield because it doesnt feel like im asleep. I felt like I could of opened my eyes but was just too scared of what i might of seen. 

After the voice said this to me there was like 10 seconds of it chanting ""I love you"" then i heard a large rumble like how i would imagine an earth quake followed by a very bright light that would get even brighter to the point of a brightness i have never seen before. This was acompanied by a rushing sensation and eventually I could see myself rushing through the sky and it was the strangest sensation. Not like any flying dreams I have ever had.

Eventually I opened my eyes and got a grip of myself. I was physically dripping with sweat ( I rarely sweat , even from exercise ) And I used to have nightmares often and never sweated as a result. Second to this my heartrate was also like 120bpm and i was gasping for breath.

I know this was ""just a dream"" but it felt so strange, maybe because it felt real, keyword here FELT. I've never been religious and im atheist so i dont know why i would dream something like this and why it was so terrifying.

(NSFW)",8,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/12yssp/had_an_extremely_outofcharacter_sexual_dream_can/,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this.  Dunno where else to post.


Basically, I don't have dreams (or at least ones I can remember) often.  Even rarer are ones which are explicitly sexual.  I'm 21 and I can count them on one hand.  And well, last night I had a realllly explicit, vivid sexual dream.  It wasn't a wet dream (never had one) and when I woke up I wasn't even terribly aroused. 


Simply put, I was ""me"" having sex with an extremely dominant middle-aged woman.  Lots of sex.  And she was REALLY into it (and as I mentioned, the dominant role in the whole thing.)  Not quite BDSM levels but she was definitely the controller.  There were also a bunch of other female friends from my life/past around just sort of watching/going about their business, and preventing family members from interrupting.  I was completely unembarrassed and played the role of the submissive guy, willing to appease her utterly.  I remember like, double checking with the girls around to make sure I was doing an ok job.  The sex was also somewhat exploratory in nature.  I don't remember her face, but I feel like I've seen her/known her, from considerably far back in my past.  I remember she had red hair and was wearing a sweater most of the time.  I didn't have an orgasm in this dream, I should add, although I remember asking if I could and coming close.  We were ""interrupted"" by a family member coming upstairs before we finished, the other girls blocked the door and said we would be right down so the family member was none the wiser.  Shortly after that I woke up.


So here's why I'm sort of WTFing about this:  I am gay.  In fact, I am now coming to terms with the fact that I am more than likely transgender.  I've never had sex with a woman, and haven't dated one since freshman year in highschool, although I have with guys.  Left with just my imagination (no porn) it's basically impossible for me to masturbate/climax while imagining sex with a girl.  So this dream has me really scratching my head.  I've had two other dreams that were sexually explicit yet unarousing involving women in my life, but nothing like this.  Thoughts?

So as I'm walking down this alleyway, there's a garbage dumpster about 50 feet ahead of me with some rocks laying around it. By this point, I'm speeding up to try to grab a rock to use in self defense because I notice that the person behind me is getting closer and closer. I'm about 10 feet away where my view of myself changes and I see myself from above. I see the man put a gun to the back of my head and pull the trigger. My body drops to the ground, he checks my pockets. He pocket checks my body and finds my phone and my wallet. After that, he drops my body in the dumpster and runs away. I see all this from an ariel view about 20 feet off the ground.

I've been doing just fine dealing and coping with everything. Work has been excellent, life has been excellent, took out a few different girls. 

I blocked my ex on all social media so I really have not had any contact with her. 

As far as the dreams go. It all started on Monday of this week. 
Dream #1: I was at the bar having a drink, by myself. Just hanging out. My phone starts to ring, its my ex. I ignore. Thinking why should I even answer this. Dream slides into I guess you could call it the next scene if it were a movie. It's the morning, I'm getting dressed for work, I turn on the news. My ex was found dead. She committed suicide. (I wake up in tears.)

Dream #2 (Tuesday night):
It's my ex's funeral. And I'm sitting there bawling my eyes out. Walk up to her family and start telling them how sorry I am. And that they will all be okay. Hugging her brothers and sisters and mother. I step into the bathroom and look in the mirror and I tell myself its all my fault. I woke up in tears.

Dream #3 (Wednesday night):
I'm driving in a car, smoking a cigarette. And I get a call from my ex's friend. Her friend is drunk and telling me I need to save my ex. My ex is on drugs and is talking about doing more so she can od. So I turn around and start driving towards where their location which is an hour from where I am. I woke up.

Dream#4 (Thursday last night)
My and my ex are in my car. Just driving. And she is my ex even in the dream. We are driving and an argument comes up about how she would be fine if I would have taken her back. And now I'm a piece of shit, Ect. She grabs the wheel of the car and we go off road. We hit a tree. I wake up. (It's about 3am in real time. I go back to sleep.) I was ejected from the car. I stand up look around, I'm in a field. I find my car, and my ex is sitting in the car. Blood from her head not breathing. I wake up.

I'd like to add, these dreams have all been extremely vivid. First time in about a month that I've remember a dream. Also the first time in about a month that I've begun to think about my ex. I haven't had contact with her, her friends, I did run into her brother at the bar last weekend and we had a good time. Did not talk about his sister (my ex) at all.

It feels like a divine connection, a true love. Feels like we have each others trust and standing side-by-side can go through anything together. 

In earlier dreams I wasn't sure if he felt the same for me, and if it is ok to feel that way about a relative, but over the dreams we have connected more. One of the first dreams I had about him, was that his mother noticed our attraction to each other and didn't approve.

*About real-life cousin:* 
My cousin is the same age as me. I haven't spoken to him in years (not even online), saw him at a wedding 2 years ago, we didn't talk. We used to play together a lot when we were kids. I kinda miss him.

*About real life romantic relationship:* 
I have had a boyfriend for 3 years. We have some issues (but we were having issues long time before the dreams came). I probably miss the excitement of a new relationship.

I don't really want those dreams to end, they are so so beautiful! Has anyone had romantic dreams about their relatives? What do you think those dreams were trying to tell you?

*Dreammoods.com explanation*: To see your relatives in your dream signify family issues and feelings. Relatives are symbolic of some aspect of your own self. / To dream of romance suggests that you need to be more affectionate in your waking life. Perhaps you are longing for more romance in your personal relationship.

I also read [this topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/vdgb1/dream_library_you_meet_the_love_of_your_life_or_a/) but I still wonder, why my relative? It could have been any guy, or just a guy with blurry outlines.

The prison was designed more like a ghetto--the living accommodations packed closely together,rickety iron-barred stairs, the walls were bleeding with decay(mold, or some other black stain). 
I climbed up the rickety stairs, someone nearby shut a creaking door near me and there were faint voices of arguments. I sit on the topmost step beside a tall,thin guy with shoulder length black hair and a pale complexion. He acknowledges that I'm next to him with a sullen glance and fatigue from sadness is evident beneath his faded blue eyes. 
Then the dream switches to a series of intermittent memories of returning the same cell together, always in silence and always with a sense of heavy guilt and hopelessness. 
Switch back to the dream present, and I suddenly understand that within the prison this man has become my life lover. Yet,it's one of th saddest loves I have ever felt. Joy is absent, and instead we were bound to each other by shame for our contemptuous deeds, guilt, and a total unwillingness on both parts to defend one another..for we both understood how little our worth was for being in prison in the first place.

Quick edit to also mention that my room mate heard me laughing really hard in my sleep the other night, like I had heard the funniest joke I've ever heard before. I have never been told I sleep talk or sleep laugh or anything so I definitely think it is the medication.

A little context: I slept at my family's house, the one I grew up in. I slept in my childhood room and then woke up today in my room I lived in before I moved out. I must have sleepwalked. Anyway...

So the dream was that she and I were going through a huge pile of baby parts. She was kind of bloody (I watched some Walking Dead earlier, so maybe that was it??)

At one point I picked up a baby arm to the shoulder. Maybe they were like
... doll parts.

So I pick up this translucent arm  - it was like the size of a banana I guess. It was sort of see through and clear. It was slightly luminescent with a whitish glow.

I kept trying to put the little baby hand on my finger to like get it to grip my finger..You know how babies grab your finger with their whole hand? Like that.

But it wouldn't move. It was just like a doll.

So I held it in my palms which turned neon blue, and I began crying. My tears fell onto it.

For no reason, it started to move and my hands. As I watched, it extended itself and reached its little baby hand and grabbed my finger. 

Over and over. I felt it. I felt the pressure and the warmth. It was very vivid.

It was a baby arm in my hands and its little fingers wrapped around my index finger and I felt it. Then I woke up in my other room, where I sleepwalked to.

I have no idea what it means but it was creepy, and there were like a million little arms and legs and baby parts everywhere. I tried looking these things up, but I would love some insight.

So I go to the house and my friends parter is there, I am meeting him for the first time, but he is going out with my CRAZY ex. It's whatever, my friend shows me the setup tells me what I'll be doing, then has to leave to get something.

Then my long time bud comes up to me and hes like ""so uh .. hey what you gonna do today"" I respond ""I dono, I was going to do that review but I don't know about it anymore"" he then goes, ""well what do you want to do?"" I say ""We could go to the beach, I could surf..."" I think he probably doesn't want to just go to the beach to watch me surf so I then go ""yea you probably don't want to do that, you want to go rock climb?"" my buddy then is like ""yea sure we can do that, I've been smashing v15's at the gym lately"" as he walks down the stairs.

A few years ago, I was living with a person I will call Garrett. We were really good friends and at some point I felt like I was in love with him but in a very different way. I never wanted to date him, but I felt an overwhelming love for him. I had two separate dreams of me hugging and I think even kissing him and just feeling an overwhelming sense of ""cosmic"" love.

It was about a family living out in the mountains who discovered this glowing blue substance in the water behind their house that they called ""LARK"" or ""LARC"" that was basically the essence of love's purest form - that if you drank it would give you the same feeling I felt in my previous dream. 

Last week I had a dream about a person that I had a very brief but meaningful romantic encounter with about 4 years ago, who I have thought about on and off. I dreamt I was riding in a car on his lap, kissing his neck and apologizing for the mistake I made of not staying with him at the time.

I’m a young writer and I have an idea for a story that revolves around the phenomena of dreaming. Now, I know that I want my plot to revolve around a character who is a “special dreamer,” one who can change waking reality with his or her dreams. I’m at the point where I just want to learn more about how people dream, and what they experience during their dreams. I know the Reddit community is vast, intelligent and wise. I want to research and learn more about people’s dreams. I have a few questions for you dreamers. 

1.	Explain your dream world. What does it feel like to dream? Is it always the same, or does your dream world shape shift?  Are you always the same character? Explain your personal experiences with the dream world.

2.	Do you think there is an interaction between the dream world and waking life? If the dream world could have any influence or power over the waking world, what would it be?

3.	Have you ever had a profound dreaming experience? Please explain it to me: how did you feel, how did your dream(s) affect your waking life?

4.	What do you believe is the purpose of dreams? Mysticism aside, why do we dream? What impact has dreaming had on your life?

For legal purposes, I want to let you know that I may incorporate your ideas/stories into my writing. If you choose to reply to this thread, you are knowingly and willingly giving me the right to use your experiences and/or ideas in my writing. If you reply to this thread, and I somehow become well-known for this novel,  you are forfeiting the right to sue me for ANYTHING. If these circumstances are unfavorable to you, then please don’t post a reply. It is not my intention to steal anyone’s ideas, or capitalize off of other people's ideas; I am here for research and curiosity. I am looking for inspiration. Dreams are so intangible and inspiring, perhaps you can help shine light on a facet of the mystery?

I want to thank you all for sharing your experiences with me and helping me understand the dreaming world more in depth. I know that there are more to dreams than I can ever comprehend. I’m excited to hear what you have to say.

Have a great day/night and sweet dreams.

to me last night.. most spiritually healing dream 
I've ever had.",13,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/xiuxp/i_believe_my_recently_deceased_exboyfriend_came/,"We dated for exactly a year and it was an intense relationship from the beginning. I broke up with him at the end of April and he committed suicide by police on July 3rd. We hadn't seen in each other in a solid 2 months, but were very mean over texting and the phone all the way through May. June was our first month of really not talking, and I blocked his number from contacting me. He was facing 25 to life for cocaine charges and the day of his court date (July 3rd) he decided to commit suicide.

That being said, I have been very upset at the fact he died while we were so angry at each other, all the things I said and a million other details I won't go into.

Last night while going to bed, I was talking to him. I asked for a sign that he had crossed over and that did he know that I truly did love and care for him even though we were on horrible terms, etc. I didn't expect to have such a great dream.

The last time I physically saw him, he took me to a Houston Rocket's game and we both bought shirts. He bought a jersey and bought me a shirt. In my dream he showed up wearing that same jersey at my house that I currently live in (he didn't know where that was when he passed) and wanted to hang out. I couldn't believe he knew where I lived and asked him why he was showing up, etc. He just said he missed me and wanted to hang out, that he had court the next week. So we did, and we cuddled on the couch and had a great conversation. It wasn't fatalistic conversation about his future. He simply wanted to visit and was very affectionate. Jesus had a very hard time opening up, so his actions seemed to be coming from a higher vibration if that makes sense.

I felt like I was awake through the whole dream and I woke up energized like crazy. It was powerful, I was so happy and I cried at the same time. I feel that because he specifically mentioned it was a week before his court date (death date) he was giving me the visit, conversation and closure that I needed. It was as if he told me not to worry and he did love me and he knows that I loved him and that he is okay. I feel like there was so much more said, but not directly. Like we were communicating through the atmosphere of the dream and not semantically. Just on a soular level.

They terrify me.,9,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/wr3ps/ive_had_the_same_type_of_dreams_throughout_my/,"So, my entire life, I’ve had dreams that really scare me. They happen every once in  a while, and I’ve had them for as long as I can remember. They aren’t anything like normal dreams. All of them take place where I’m sleeping, never in some sort of made up world, like usual. All of them have a constant, very loud noise throughout the entire dream. And in all of them, I can’t move, or say anything. I can only see. They never last long. I’m not sure how long they actually are, but they feel like they last only seconds. I wake up from all of them out of breath and gasping for air, as if I had been holding it in the entire time. And in all of them, I feel as if something evil is watching me. As if something has been trying to kill me with its invisible arms my entire life, but never has been able to.

The most recent one happened just last night. I was lying in my bed, trying to fall asleep. I started to drift off, then I was asleep. I knew it because it felt different than when I was awake. I don’t know why, but I looked at the clock. 4:13. I hadn’t noticed at the time, but that was strange to read while dreaming. Clocks always say gibberish in dreams, but never an actual time. Then, I started to hear a loud noise, and I could feel my body being constricted, as if a snake had wrapped itself around me and squeezed very tight. Then, I could feel my throat closing. It felt like someone was strangling me. My body was being squeezed tighter and tighter. I started to squirm and struggle, but with no prevail. I tried to scream, but I couldn’t get any words past my closed throat. It all felt so real. I could feel a presence above me, staring down at me, laughing at my struggle, my incompetence to its power. My mind was exploding in thoughts of horror that this might be reality, that I was actually going to be strangled to death by a ghost. Then, finally everything came rushing back to me, I opened my eyes and sat up in bed, gasping for air. My heart was pounding. I looked around, seeing nothing unusual, just my room in the dark. I looked at the clock. 4:18. Just 5 minutes later than when I checked it in my dream. That was the scariest part. The fact that I knew what time it was in my sleep. That’s what made me question if the dream was real or not. I was terrified. It took me a while to get back to sleep, I was afraid I might have another dream like it. Afraid maybe next time it won’t be a dream.

My entire life, I’ve dreaded these dreams. These are the worst nightmares to me. For as long as I remember, I’ve been tormented by these horrors, praying and begging to no one that I will never have to witness such awful things again in my life. Someone please tell me I’m not the only one.

I want to know who these people are. Are they alive? What happens to them when you wake up?
It's disconcerting to think that they cease to exist when you awake. They had a life of their own. It's almost like it's not fair.

The other question is how does our brain do this? How is our brain able to create so many different ""complete"" minds and keep track of them all as they were individuals? ",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_wizw3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/wizw3/the_people_in_dreams_who_are_they/,

TEETH

Dreams about teeth are common and tend to have one of four meanings:

1. You need to see a dentist. The first meaning to consider is the literal one. If you dream of your teeth decaying or an infection in your mouth, get checked out.

2. Teeth ground down often indicate internalized stress or anxiety, expressed in the phrase ""ground down."" Modern life can be loaded with stress, and dreams illustrate the detrimental effects by showing teeth ground down or grinding together. Grinding teeth during sleep is also a stress reaction.

3. Teeth are related to social perception -- there's no quicker way to judge someone's social position than by the condition of their teeth. Missing teeth -- especially front teeth -- are associated with rednecks and po' folk, and can symbolize the phrase ""loss of face.""

4. Because teeth are in the mouth and words come from the mouth, dreams about teeth can be related to what you say. Teeth falling out during conversation can indicate dishonesty. Teeth getting knocked out by force can symbolize hard words, verbal battles. The phrase ""loose in the tooth"" used to be a common way of describing exaggeration, reckless speech or lying, and loose teeth can symbolize this idea.

As with all dream symbols, relate the possible meanings back to your life -- especially to the day before the dream. Other clues within a dream will flesh out the meaning. For example, you dream of getting punched in the mouth and losing a tooth. The first question to ask is have you been figuratively punched in the mouth by a comment or situation? Or did your reputation or social status take a hit?

Do you dream about teeth? Please share your stories in the comments.

I was at the field of my old elementary school, and there was a baseball game going on. I was standing off to the side and noticed that I, for some reason was holding a crossbow. I noticed that my ex girlfriend, whom I harbor no resentment towards, was crouching behind a chain link fence near the classroom buildings. She was watching the baseball game. I noticed that her current boyfriend was playing in the game, so I realized that she must be watching him play. I pointed the crossbow at her nonchalantly and shot. no reaction. I shot again. no reaction. I stood up and walked over to talk to her. She didn't acknowledge the crossbow I was holding at all, or the fact that I had shot at her. there didn't appear to be any damage to her either. I can't remember the exact conversation we had in the dream, but she ended up showing me some photos, saying that ""someone sent these to my boyfriend yesterday, but he doesn't know who."" The pictures were what really made this dream so anxiety inducing. Both were of her, my ex-girlfriend. The first one was a closeup of her head, bloodied and resting on pavement with her brains splattered behind her. there was a huge hole in her forehead. The second was of her naked, tied upside down to a tree by her legs and with the same injuries to her head. This one appeared to have been taken later because her body was kind of purple and bloated. There were a bunch of biker-looking dudes standing around the tree with their arms crossed, looking kind of like it was the picture of a successful hunt. I left her crouching behind the fence and went back to the spot i was sitting in at the beginning of the dream. This time, it seemed like something was making me shoot. My hands lifted on their own, point the crossbow at her and shot, landing a bolt right into her forehead. She slumped over this time, and I could see the blood and brain matter from where I was standing. Her boyfriend started running over to her body from the baseball field. I did the same, but the dream just cut off halfway there.

Sometimes I even had to vandalize things to fix lines, depending on where they were left- not ""fixing"" the lines with an ice skater was a bigger crime than the vandalization required to do so.

Help?,8,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/pmafd/i_think_my_dreams_try_to_force_me_to_stay_asleep/,"By the time I reached adolescence, I started having dreams that confused the hell out of me. The first I remember:

* I was in a summer class, in the middle-back row, and I dozed off. I felt like I was still in class, but that my eyes were closed. I kept trying to open my eyes and every time I did, everything was blurry. Finally, I managed to open my eyes, and I awoke from my dream with my eyes closed. Then I really opened my eyes and paid attention in class again.

This sort of thing has continued to happen to me. I used to sleep with a beeping alarm clock. Then all my dreams incorporated the beeping. So I switched to a radio. Then all my dreams incorporated the music. The only thing that worked was putting the radio dial between two stations so that I had static and 2 types of music. That worked for a while. Then I started turning off the radio in my sleep and not knowing it. So I moved it across the room. Then I started having new dreams:

* I would wake up, walk over to where my alarm was on my dresser, and start getting dressed. I would go to the kitchen and the sound would fade and start packing my bag to leave for work. At some point, I would wake up from the dream thinking that I was pretty much ahead of schedule since I was already dressed and packed. And then I'd realize I was in bed in my PJs and the alarm is blaring and has been for over 30 minutes!

I would have dreams where someone is talking to me and talking to me, and the dialog is sensical and engaging, and at some point, the context of the words changes to allow the words of whomever is trying to wake up to enter my consciousness. An example would be that I was speaking to someone in a dream about saving an aboriginal tribe and how important it was and they went on a long diatribe and I interjected at some point. Their response was ""Oh yeah? Well, you know what? You know what? It's time to get up!"" Time to get up! I was being woken up by someone who was saying ""It's time to get up""

The weirdest one in recent memory was when I fell asleep on a hammock, on my back, with my arms folded behind my head. I decided it was time to get up, so I sat straight up. Then my eyes closed involuntarily and I was lying on the hammock in the same position. So I tried again, same result, sat upright, fell back asleep, woke up in the same position. Did this one more time and decided I needed a new plan. So I started to slowly sit up and grab onto the hammock to pull myself up and hold on. 3 times during that process my eyes closed involuntarily, but when I re-awoke (in the dream still) I was holding on to the hammock ropes so I wasn't on my back. I finally sit all the way up, and that's when I actually wake up... in the hammock, on my back, with my arms folded under my head. I swing my legs over the hammock and get up.

There's so many more though. I've dreamt 3 nested dreams in. I've dreamt seemingly entire days of regular life. I've dreamt making decisions and sharing them with others and believing I actually did that for days until it comes up in conversation and it never really happened. I've been in class and watched the room vibrate as though I was in REM while still semi-conscious. I've had brake lights fly at me only for me to kick the chair in front me trying to push on my brake pedal. I respond to questions once I pass out. I have a twitch that signals when I'm about to go under, and while my SO says I do it every single time, I've only caught myself doing it maybe 3 times.

Fortunately, in real life I know a lot of people who go to this school, so in the dream I asked one of these people (we'll call her Annie) if she could drive me there, and she said that yes she could but first she had to make a stop in town and take care of something.

It turns out that the ""something"" she had to take care of was a *robbery*, because she came sprinting back to the car (a Jeep Grand Cherokee) a few minutes later with an assault rifle in one hand and one of those cartoony bags of cash with a big dollar sign on the front; after diving into the car, she drove off.

Fast forward to a little while later, and Annie tells me that she knows a shortcut that can get us to the university more quickly. She then drives straight down into a huge ravine made out of perfectly square blocks a la Minecraft (there were a lot of flat surfaces for driving, fortunately, and later on in the dream I figured that it must have been mined out a bit by other people driving to school).

At some point we pass some sort of security checkpoint (within the ravine) without stopping, and from then on we're tailed by this bizarre, border-control-esque organization.

We had stolen a wooden box full of cocaine from a rival mob, one of which was danny devito for some weirdass reason. they were chasing us and shooting at us. we ran into an abandoned railway tunnel and it was mega dark, we ran all the way to the end of it where there was an old abandoned train. anyways the mob caught up with us and I remember saying something like ""WE CAN SHARE THE DRUGS!!"" and then opening the box and grabbing a handful of coke and shoving my face into it, it was so vivid I felt the stuff go up my nose all tingly. then I proceeded to go around the mob and my monster-husband sharing the coke. then we all took our clothes off and partied until the dawn! it ended with the mob making best friends with me and my weirdass husband and then I shagged the shit out of him ontop of the train.



woke up because my housemate came into the house, I got up and told him all about it. we are both baffled. also I probably should mention I have tried coke twice in my life, and both times I don't think I took enough as I didn't feel anything. thought I should mention it as it came up in the dream and I was very suprised that it did! just wondered if any of you guys are dream interpreters and would fancy unravelling this dream ball of wool? haha.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_mvdjn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/mvdjn/fantastic_dream/,

Evidently, she owned a pet sitting service, and we were her assistants.

Well, that day she showed us the new animals she was sitting for: a gorilla, 30ft python, black panther, 2 chimps, a wolf, a smaller african cat, and a jack russel.  As training for these animals, she supervised us as we took each (except the python) out of their giant outside cages to exercise and socialize them.  I was a nervous wreck, but held my own.  I only really panicked when I realized the way the panther was looking at me was the way a hunter looks at its prey.  And it got exceedingly rough with me and the other 2 people had to help get him away.

Deb (my old manager), went into the house with us and explained our simple duties of watching the animals over night while she went home.

Next scene: Me and SeaQuest-kid wake up and look outside the top story window.  Instead of the predators being in those cages, they each had ungulates in them! (ie cows, deer, horses, etc).  WE FREAKED.  The predators were loose!

Next scene: This is the part where things get exceptionally out of whack.  The gorilla, panther, python, wolf, and chimps were reaking havock on the city.  Evidently they were intelligent enough to be sneaky and make plans, but they were also vicious and strong enough to kill everyone they saw.  Me and SeaQuest-kid held hands as we ran through the city, trying to avoid the Beasts, the panicking people, and the gangs of thugs who found this to be the perfect time for thievery.

Next scene: We are in a school.  This school has been in many of my past dreams, only this time it was filled with people.  People who are running to every and all exits- we avoided it because the reason we went into the school is because we got chased in there by the beasts.  Kids were huddled in the dark hallways like a tornado drill was happening.  We knew that our only chance was to get as high as possible, so we raced up the stairs in the chaos, with the sounds of people screaming behind us.  We finally get as high as we can, which turns out to be a boys bathroom.  Bunches of people are hiding in there.  So SeaQuest-kid and I lock the door, which is almost immediately followed by the door being pounded on by the beasts.  I ask the hiders if there are any windows.  You know those tiny windows that are in some bathrooms, way high up?  Yeah, they had those.  So I finaggle the window and get it open where, miraculously, there is a fenced in ledge, and on the other side are roofs similar to steps, so we had the perfect get away!  I squeeze my way out the window and just as I am preparing to help the others, I feel a gun pointing into my back.  I turn, and it's one of those evil gangs.  He tells me to empty all my pockets and take my coat off.  I do, and panic!  Because inside my coat is my ex's dachshund, evidently I was trying to save him from the Beasts?

Next Scene: SeaQuest-kid and I are walking through the everglades., which we knew was a bad idea, but it was our only choice.  Thankfully we get lucky enough to find more survivors!  I'm guessing this part of the dream is taking place later, when the Beasts have destroyed our way of life.  The guy we come across is the guy from Jaws (who was also on SeaQuest)... he's not very thrilled to see us, but he lets us come in to his home anyways.  I meet a woman, and it turns out, they are wildlife specialists, and they have taken it upon themselves to track the beasts!  Me and SeaQuest-kid reluctantly admit that we know the animals really well, and we would like to help.

Next Scene: We are on a LARGE everglades-boat thingy (I cant remember what they're called) with a ton of people, and we are in search of the Python.  Come across a diver's flipper, so we stick large nets down so we can see if anything else is down there.  The nets come up with a skeleton.  According to my dream, this meant that the python was there.  Just as the people in my dream came to that conclusion, the boat started rocking, people started screaming...

I was in a cafe with Anderson Cooper. I was his assistant, but we were having an affair. We were being very flirty and kissy, when we noticed we were being observed. Somehow, our observers got hold of our cellphones (mine was an iPhone, AC's was an HTC or Galaxy - weirdly specific detail), and were going to use the evidence of our affair, which was stored on our phones, to blackmail us. We used AC's government contacts to torture the blackmailers. There were three of them, and we tortured them by dunking them into a huge vat of ice water. This wasn't working, so I devised a plan to torture them further, by poking a stick down their throats to make them throw up. 

The dream segues into me (AC makes no further appearances) taking a second job at a bar. I am completely useless at my job, until my employers realise I have an amazing singing voice, and I am rehired as the musical talent. The dream fades out with me singing ""Respect"" on stage in the bar. 

I had re-watched The Blues Brothers just hours earlier, so some of the ""inspiration"" is obvious. But Anderson Cooper? I'm only barely aware of him, I've never even heard him speak.

It was a chilli autumn afternoon and the sky was slightly overcast. I separated from the protest and took a turn down a small city street and into somebody's home. I soon found out this was home to Noam Chomsky. He told me things about the protest (I can't remember what exactly he said, but it was in the manor which he usually speaks; highly sophisticated and intellectually, and he explains to me that he agrees with the protesters). We walked around his home while talking about politics. It was a modest home, nothing special about it. While speaking to me about politics, Noam led me to an elevator (still in his home). The elevator was rather sub-par. Perhaps it was undone/unfinished or really old. Either way, it was made of wood and I hardly trusted getting into it, but Noam insisted.

Once inside, I glanced at the elevator panel and to my amazement I saw that there were over 500 floors (going down). Noam took me down into the 40th floor first and showed me something amazing. I can't exactly remember what it was, but I know it was something profound. It was as if I realized some great truth. It may have been a room with many lights of assorted colours, but I'm not sure. He continued to take me to different floors with different rooms and show me amazing things, until at one point he needed to do something and asked me to wait. In defiance of his request, I ran to the elevator and hit button 31 on the elevator panel, and suddenly felt immense G-forces pushing on my stomach as the elevator shot down into lower levels (sort of what you feel as you descend on a roller coaster). Once the elevator reached its destination, the doors opened, and I hesitantly stuck my head out.

 As I looked around, I noticed that this room's walls were lined with shower tiles. I turned my head to the left and noticed a giant, hairy and morbidly obese man in a bath, having a shower head spray water all over him. He was bigger than any man I'd ever seen before. I couldn't see his head (it wasn't in my field of vision since a wall had been covering his head/neck), but I generally felt that he was hostile and had he seen me, he'd probably kill me or torture me (strange how you can perceive such a wide array of feelings in dreams). 

I quickly hit button 500 on the elevator panel and could feel the elevator suddenly shooting straight down. The elevator accelerated at such an intense speed that I found myself struggling not to faint, but to no avail. I awoke with Noam and my mother kneeling above me. Noam asked if I was alright and explained that I had fainted. I felt ashamed (at disobeying his orders).

1317699688.0,7,self.Dreams,l04yr,Three days passed and this dream still disturbs me,8,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/l04yr/three_days_passed_and_this_dream_still_disturbs_me/,"Vivid dreams are my constant bedfellows. 

Having one is no surprise. Not having one is an unusual night. More often, these dreams are fairly fantastic, giving me ideas and thoughts on stories or plots or series or the like. 

Sometimes the dreams are less fantastic and forgettable.

Once in a blue moon, they leave a lasting impression that I carry for the rest of my waking life.

Rarely, they burn themselves into my subconscious retinas and refuse to shake off for days on end, leaving me with a disturbed countenance and disconcerted vibe. 

The latter just so happened Saturday night, October 1st. 

The dream setting took place in my bedroom, though it was altered a bit. The opposite walls to my bed were extended out a fair bit and a cubby in the wall, complete with a futon-couch, was where my clothes dresser resides now. On the cubby walls were papers of schedules, dry erase boards, posters- it was obviously my work area. The other wall lined by my book cases, connected perpendicular to this wall with the door into my room, was also extended. The ceiling was altered the most, having been lifted by at least half a story. 

For some reason known only to my dream-self, repair work had to be done in the wall lined by book cases. A large rectangular hole was cut, revealing the innards between the walls; wires, beams, nails, chalk notations left from construction, and ultimately the backside of the adjacent wall could be seen. Large and rectangular, it was too high above the floor for me to reach up into.

A few “days” passed in this dream with no happenings.

One “day”, a friend visited me in my room. As I spoke to this blurred-faced acquaintance, who sat silent on the futon-couch, leaning over to write on one of my schedule papers posted on the wall facing the hole. I recall nothing of what I gabbed about, sans that it was mundane. 

“Hold on a second. I want you to come here and look at this,” my friend finally responded, motioning to the paper he/she had just been defacing with a pencil.

I move from my bed to take a gander.

On the paper, my friend had doodled a crudely drawn image of a figure, a human. It looked akin to a child’s drawing, but something was terribly off. 

It was a moment in which you look at an image, though seemingly fine at first, and know instantly that something is primevally very wrong. It looked void of eyes, with a half grin that only those with demonic intent could give.

“Now,” this anonymous friend entity continued, softer as if to comfort me in light of his/her next statement, “Look up, slightly to your right, into the hole…”

I did so, as slowly as he/she spoke softly, moving my gaze to peer up into the far corner of the large rectangular hole.

The figure was looking back at me. 

It’s very existence looked smeared. The longer I looked at it, the more it seemed to ethereally distort my perception of it, nearly to the point of no longer being able to make it out. The pose was neither hunched nor standing straight. In the darkness of the hole, not even the entirely of the body could be seen. 

But it’s face. 

It’s face was strikingly easy to perceive. No eyes. Demonic half-grin. 

And the worst part about it-

No. I stared for a moment, trying my darndest to allow my skeptical analysis determine why this figure couldn’t possibly exist. 

“That’s just an illusion of the wires and chalk mess left on the walls. It just looks weird it all in the darkness of the hole,” I reassured my friend, but moreso myself.

And that was that. 

“Days” went by in this dream. I recall disturbing feelings wash over my more frequently as time continued forward. The ‘figure’ was still there, unmoving, always gazing eyeless and half-grinning.

Time leapt within this subconscious state, until I found myself with my back against my door, on the floor, in my room which was now only lit by the pale dying light of twilight. From this position, I could not see the hole as it was up above me to my immediate left. In front of me standing in the middle of my floor was my dog, looking distressed. He was barking indefatigably at the hole. This lasted for a few moments. I only sat and watched, silently, awash with stress and concern. I recall feeling as if I had just been forced to the ground moments prior, leaning back on my elbows for support.

It was then, for the first time, I heard something that made my heart stop.

I heard movement in the hole.

Immediately, my dog reacted, curling the stub of his tail under and leaping to me for security- and the exit just behind me.

Instantly, I lunged to my feet. A blur, and both myself and my dog were completely outside of the house. I dashed to what I believe to be my mother, who stood outside with her car. 

“We have to go. Now,” I gasped out, “I—“

My cell phone blarred and I awoke with a sweat. Without hesitation or logic, my eyes darted to the representative area in my room where the hole had been, deep in my subconscious. Nothing, of course. I sighed and felt it was best to wake if it meant not reliving that dream.

Normally when I am thrust violently from a dream, I forget most of it. Unfortunately for me, I still can not forget the image of that thing that continues to burn in my mind’s eye. The black voids where eyes should be. The smeared existence. The disturbingly inhumanly stiff yet unperceivable position. The demonic half-grinning expression always peering, never moving. 

The distorted face.

Some seriously weird sci-fi going on in my dreams.",10,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ksm7c/jellyfish_just_woke_up_from_this_one_and_it/,"I'll try to make this as coherent as possible, as it is my first time posting here and I wrote it down frantically upon waking. But I wanted to share, so here goes:

-----

Earth seems to have been invaded overnight by huge air-dwelling jellyfish-like creatures, ranging from 20 ft to 100 ft in height. They float above the ground and are slow-moving, but their long tendrils deliver potentially life-threatening electrical(?) shocks. The jellyfish themselves seem to latch onto human psyche and emotion, producing strange visions and hallucinations, and being stung perpetuates these visions. The jellyfish also seem to mimic human mannerisms after a while, such as basic tendril motions (waving, clapping, etc), and also mimic human speech patterns, which sound like random, hollow jibberish. (Mockingly? I don't know.)

VISIONS:
I look down at my hands, fingers and palms are comprised of jellyfish strands, floaty... electrical charge at my fingertips. They feel powerful, alien.
I look up, and I see my daughter(?), half her head is blown away. She is floating as if underwater, beckoning to me. It's like the jellyfish are trying to tell me who killed her.
The walls around me are made of tiny, multicoloured particles that smash and deform when I run my jellyfish hands through them. It's like seeing the matrix.
Extremely intricate and extensive 'tower-like' 'illustrations'... constantly moving, comprised of faces/characters intertwined with maddening detail. Strange abrasive music accompanies them, sounds a bit like un-tuned techno-pop, with sour notes and intrusive sounds thrown in. I find these images thrust before me, and I am forced to examine them.

Apparently there are now enough of these jellyfish inhabiting Earth to cause panic among the populace. People are in a state of riot and mass disorder, chaos. JF are everywhere, in the towns, the countryside... people who have been stung show massive red marks on their skin, wandering about in an unseeing haze while the jellyfish sting them to death and laugh about it. I get the distinct impression that the jellyfish find us 'cute'.

I get my car out of storage and set out to find my daughter, if she's still alive.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,True,,,True,t3_ksm7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ksm7c/jellyfish_just_woke_up_from_this_one_and_it/,

I was somehow at my friend's college and my coworkers were there at a party. My family had driven me there. I was in a common area of the dorm, and suddenly the party noises died off, and it was completely silent. There was a small room off of the wall I was facing. Once inside the room, I saw a closed door on the wall opposite me, and facing the left corner, one of those old school baby buggies with the large wheels. I walked around to look inside the carriage, and my brother was in there. There were flecks of gold light inside of the awning, and he was bathed in a gold glow. The second I laid eyes on him, I fell to my knees and in an awestruck almost-whisper, said, ""It's Gabriel! It's Gabriel!"" My six month old brother put his finger to his lips and said ""Shhhhhhhh! Don't go behind the door. Something bad is behind that door.""

The following night, I dreamed I was in the minivan with my family returning from the previous night's trip. I was in the back and turned to the carseat. Feeling foolish, I whispered, ""Gabriel?"" and once again my brother responded with a slow ""Shhhhhh!""
End of dream.

Here's the thing: I had no idea who Gabriel was when I had that dream. I thought it was a name from the bible but was uncertain. I have never been religious, I did not have a TV in my room that would have planted that dream in my head. After reading a bit about the subject, I thought one story about Gabriel was interesting. It is said that before a child is born, he whispers everything the child needs to know about life in its ear, and then puts a finger to the child's lips in a shushing gesture, and that's where we get the clefts above our lips.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_konk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/konk1/a_dream_thats_haunted_me_for_years_interpretation/,

In the first one, I was myself (a 17yo girl) who had heard reports about a giant meteor headed towards earth. I bought a cheap car and packed up my stuff, planning to run away with my boyfriend (who doesn't exist in real life). I saw some kids who didn't like me messing with the hood and I didn't know what was going to happen so i just hid behind a corner. The car exploded, and I cried in terror, knowing that without it, it was impossible to find safety.  
  
Then the second arc was kind of stupid. If anyone here watches Breaking Bad, I was the protagonist, Walter White. I had managed to get my family to a forest glade where for some reason I thought we'd be safe. There, I saw some idiot teenagers in a burning car, but they didn't seem to notice it was on fire. I ran over and opened the door, screaming for them to get out. The looked at me, confused, and I reached over the driver and set the car to drive and pushed down on the gas. I let the car go right into this little pond, and the teenagers all got out and ran away. As the car sank, I told my family I was going to go find some food. Then the perspective changed and, through the eyes of Skylar, I saw Walter White suddenly die.  
  
In the third arc I was a young man, trying to espace the incoming meteor. I wasn't looking at the sky, but I could feel its shadow on me as I ran towards the ocean. The air was hot and I could see trees burning up around me. I dove into the water and swam towards this small but very close island. I was helped onto it by this woman (I think she might have been a goddess of some sort, or had magical qualities) who was my old enemy/lover (again, this person doesn't exist in real life). She had a vulture on her shoulder that she didn't want to die. We sat and talked for a few minutes, when I suddenly felt this wave of dread and somehow I knew the only way we'd be safe during impact was to be underwater. She was convinced that being underwater would kill her and she said she'd stay on the island with her vulture. So I left her there and dove in, and just started swimming in a random direction. A few seconds later I heard her dive in behind me.  
  
Then I woke up (in the dream). I was on the island again, the air was normal and it seemed early. The woman was asleep next to me. I got up and looked in the water and saw pieces of the vulture she failed to save.

So a little bit of context first:

A few weeks ago I discovered this girl's webcomic through a facebook friend. Her comics were good and funny, and she drew herself in an fancy style.
I kind of idealize her without knowing who she was.

So fast forward 2 weeks and while taking a nap at a different city from where I live, I dream the following:

I'm in the middle of a beach leaned on a bench which is stuck in the sand. I'm surrounded by people I can't figure out, but suddenly a blonde gorgeous girl appears and starts chatting with me,  she tells me she's the creator of the webcomic and we end up making out because yes.

I wake up afterwards and think to myself: **Did** **I** **just** **kissed** **a** **girl** **that** **exists** **but** **I** **don’t** **even** **know** **who** **she** **is?** **Wat?**

So I go on with my life and fast forward to 4:00 am on that same night. 
I was at a coastal city at the time, so I ended at this great club which has this huge terrace which goes right out to the beach. While having a smoke, leaning with a friend on the bench of this terrace, a blonde gorgeous girl suddenly appears and leans by my friend. He starts chatting with her when she suddenly presents herself to me, while chatting she tells us that she has this webcomic that we should see… 

**The** **webcomic** **I** **had** **learned** **about** **2** **weeks** **earlier.**

I just didn’t know what to say, and while trying to process what just had happened a friend of her comes by and asks her to go to the bathroom together. That was the last time I saw her.

Ok, I know I didn’t end up making out with her but … **WTF?!**

Ahead the upper deck portion of the bridge collapsed.  As we were trying to stop I watched other cars fall into the collapsed portion of the bridge.

That morning I then saw on the news the California Loma Prieta earthquake, and footage of the San Francisco Bay Bridge collapse.  

I recall having a really weird feeling about the fact that I had just dreamt what I was seeing.  I'm unsure if I recalled the dream as I was watching or prior, but it was a very vivid and memorable experience.

I lived in NJ at the time, and had never been to CA.  The quake took place at 8:04 EST on a Tuesday, which would have been a school night for me.  I lived with my divorced mother and I most likely went to bed around 9pm.  It's unlikely that we were watching the world series game or any related news footage.  

I won't rule out that my mother may have been watching the news after I went to bed, feeding me some subconscious audio.

What I do recall is that my dream was nearly identical to the video that was later released of the woman who died driving off the upper deck.  I don't know when that footage was released, but I would assume it was on the 18th, and part of the broadcast I saw.

Reality checks are one of the best ways to become lucid. I've been doing them about four times per day when my phone tells me to.

It's been a few weeks of trying to make this a habit, but I don't think a reality check hs popped up in a dream yet.

What if we set a distinct sound to play at various times every day, which would alert us to do a reality check. We would then have the sound play a few times during the night, which should trigger the reality check habit more efficiently than just hoping our dream selves decide to do it on their own. The sound should probably be gentle enough to not wake us, but loud enough to hear in our dream world. 

I mean, we can sometimes hear ""real"" people or alarm clocks in our dreams, so why not use this to our advantage?

I had a pretty normal dream for most of the night last night, strong but fairly uninteresting, until this one, very vivid sequence. It came totally out of the blue: I don't watch cartoons, I'm a thirty-year-old woman and don't have much exposure to trippy shit like this. Very out of the blue.

I was a very poor, elderly Japanese peasant man. I had a large three-wheeled bicycle with me, and it was my job to repair a broken satellite dish out in a field some ways from an abandoned rural  road. After climbing laboriously off my bike and making my way to the dish, I found that there was a very steep gorge next to it, a crack in the earth, and took care not to fall into it or get too close.

I couldn’t repair the dish: no matter how I tried, it seemed only to fall apart every time I touched it, and I was making a total botch of it. Finally I had the idea that I had to get the broken dish into the basket on the back of my bicycle, and get it hidden somewhere: I saw that there was a car coming very far off on the road, so I hurriedly stuffed the pieces of the satellite dish into the basket, climbed on (with a lot of difficulty) and set off up the road.

Quite suddenly, I coasted along the road and into a very large building, which seemed to be an institutionalized poor-house of some kind. There were a lot of poor people in rags shuffling about, and I noticed a very old pile of shoes in one corner: one set of shoes, a rotten pink silk pair that looked like something from a museum, had the number 1548 embroidered on them: I took that as the date that the shoes had been made. Another pair nearby were covered in a green slime, and I thought I saw part of a human foot somehow still attached to them.

And then, all at once, everything fell apart. Great rays of light suddenly broke through the skylights of the building: literally broke through, because the masonry and glass started raining harmlessly down all over everyone, the ceiling broke up and gave way: beyond the ceiling I could see a gigantic figure of an Egyptian god soaring up into the sky, rising up right near the building, at least 200 feet tall. He wore a giant, elaborate suit of armor that seemed to be made of stone, and had a head like a dog, snub-nosed, with glowing featureless yellow eyes. As it rose up, I could see a plate in its gauntlet open up, and it tapped on a set of keys there: thumping house music filled the air everywhere, and there was a general gathering ambiance of celebration and destruction of a pernicious system. The institutional building crumbled: there was a man (he looked like Obama) standing high up on the shoulder of the god, and he was shouting ‘Everything looks good, let’s do this and see how that plays’. House music everywhere, like a club or a rave.

I saw the broken satellite dish start to crumble and break in the light, and could hear the dullish voices of managers over the building’s PA saying ‘Uhhhh....it’s breaking up the road....it’s breaking the building...’ in a tone that seemed to indicate recording of criminal acts. Right around this point I woke up.

He couldn't and started blurring and going crazy like one of those shimmering dudes in Jacobs Ladder.

now I didn't really notice or care that the meds I was taking for my sinuses have DXM in them...dex is great for tripping balls (which I was not) but it also can intensify dreams, making them extremely vivid,  easily influenced, and for me it always increased the likelihood of a lucid dream. I must note that in last nights case I used as directed with the exception of 1 beer, so it's odd that I would be affected like this but I guess it doesn't take much
 
so about the dream         anyways so I want to say that in the dream I was much younger, but that's not as relevant as the location. I was in our old house, where I spent most of my earlier years, before dad died.
 
I came across something that was out of place and I immediately knew I was dreaming, I knew that I could not be in that house, and I began to explore, a great sense of dread weighing me down as I continued on.    It quickly became obvious that I was also in another time, and when I came across my mother I knew that I was or should be a boy of about 5.   At this time It became difficult to stay in the dream, but I had to know
 
 
 ""mommy what year is it?""at this point I am aware that I am waking, my mind is screaming to the living world to go fuck itself, I have to know, I have to see this through  ""it's 1990, joey""at this moment I have burst into tears, both inside and outside of the dream, but i still manage to ask one more question before I permanently snap back to the waking world

The group seems dynamic and interesting, and I feel a little out of my league.  We all head down into the sewers, and i'm a little surprised to note that we're actually slogging through the filth; though somehow I know the human waste has been filtered out at this point, so it's just table scraps, etc.    
   Now I'm driving to a weekend seminar; I sit down and we're engaged in some sort of demonstration. Everybody gets up for a break and mingles, and I play with what I thought was a timpani mallet or something; after I put it down and move somewhere else the owner of the object becomes upset to see it's been moved, as it was actually a highly explosive device - I decide to feign ignorance as nobody saw me playing with it.    
  As the seminar progresses, more and more highly influential people show up.  Bill Clinton's sitting behind me, a world-renowned author is somewhere else; I realize this is a meeting of really powerful people, and I feel even more out of place.  However, I note that they all are making me feel completely at ease, that their power comes from being able to relate, and I start to get a little bit of a social buzz.    
   It starts to rain, so we all have to carry the chairs and tables to our next gathering area.  As we're jostling about I'm still quietly reveling in the atmosphere of geniality, and even consider talking to Obama about my past as a radical activist and how I'm starting to appreciate that we're all human and there needs to be more understanding, not more infighting, but kind of thought better of it.    
  Now the day's about wrapped up; I'm a little worried about what i'm going to wear the next day, because I didn't pack a change of clothes, and I've slogged through the sewers in this getup, and everybody else probably has wardrobes full of thousand-dollar suits that they'll be able to choose from.  We all begin to congregate outside; one of the women of the group giddily runs up to another woman, plants a quick peck on her cheek, and trots off like a schoolgirl with a crush.

Apocalypse imminent.,7,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1f3lg9/new_found_love_bloodcolored_sky_voices_in_my_head/,"About an hour ago, I awoke from a dream so intense that it left me covered head to toe in freezing cold sweat. Upon awakening, I threw up three times and have felt completely broken since. This is the dream as best as I can remember it. 

I was in Wilmington, North Carolina visiting family. It was about 5am dreamtime and I had decided to take a walk along the beach. Looking up, the sky was a few shades closer to red than normal. As I gazed into the atmosphere, someone placed their hand on my shoulder and spoke softly ""Beautiful, isn't it? It has been getting redder every morning for the last week."" I turned around and standing behind me was the girl I am beginning to fall in love with in real life. For story purposes, we'll call her Madeline... except in the dream, it felt like I was meeting her again for the first time. 

A brief period passed where I'm not sure exactly what happened, but we ended up in a mansion in Myrtle Beach, SC, about 60 miles away. It turns out, Madeline's mother was running for mayor of the city. Anyway, after a night of strolling along the beach front, it was like falling in love with the same person all over again. I can still see a high-definition picture of what her face looked like when we stopped and started holding each other on the beach. The next morning, the sky was now a blood-orange color and I could see the look on Madeline's face turn to pure worry. She said ""we're not safe here,"" and took me into the cellar of her house with a trap door underneath that lead to a panic room. ""She can't hear us here,"" Madeline whimpered. I was then described exactly what was happening. Earth really was created by a single being, but when people started becoming more technologically and intellectually advanced, it made the primitive creator angry that we were creating our own virtual worlds instead of living in hers... so she turned evil and started planning a way to end her creation. Sadness gripped both of us as we held each other tight for what seemed like an hour. As we made our way back upstairs, the television was blaring alarms with a banner reading ""Warning: High-dose radiation is coming from the sky, stay inside and go underground if possible."" Instead of going back to the cellar, we went into a sort of bunker behind the house where we waited in horror with nothing but a radio with poor transmission due to the radiation. At the top of the bunker was a 5-foot diameter pane of triple-layer bulletproof glass used for looking outside. The sky had turned the color of human blood, and the air had become electrified with lightning striking all over the place. 

All of a sudden, I heard this screeching voice clawing at my ears and filling every pore of my body. ""Your time has come, you'll die like the rest. Your love means nothing."" It was simple, but haunting. I was the only one who heard it, and I just fell down in disbelief as tears flowed down my face. Then, the pane of glass was ripped off of the bunker. What seemed like 200 degree air poured into the room. Frantic, I grabbed onto madeline's hand as tightly as possible, and we were going to try and make it to the secret cellar from earlier. The house was crumbling, and the earth was violently shaking. We knew we were dead, but we wanted to spend as long as possible together. I looked up in the sky, and I could see what looked like a giant orb pressing down toward the earth's surface. Another planet was getting to slam into us at full speed. 

We ran inside the house, when suddenly I felt a tug on my hand as if Madeline had stopped running. When I looked back, the chandelier had fallen and completely impaled her. Her eyes were wide open with shock, and she started convulsing rapidly with blood pouring out of her mouth. I just fell onto my knees and started crying harder than I knew was possible. Crying hard enough that blood started seeping from my skin. She was still momentarily conscious, and I scrambled back onto my feet whispering ""I love you so much"" into her ears. Her hand slowly trembled up to my face and I gripped it tightly. She tried to make a sound, but blood just started spurting out even more. Knowing she only had moments left, and I only had minutes left at best, I bent over and kissed her lips one last time. Her eyes faded backwards, and her muscles went limp. Emotionally torn to shreds, I went back outside and shouted at the sky with unintelligible fury. I was not even making sense, nor were words coming out of my mouth. It was just a bloodcurdling scream that had no other purpose than to show that the last moments of my life, and humanity's existence, was filled with death. A huge fissure opened in the ground, and I fell straight in, free-falling for what seemed like a full minute before landing in molten lava.

I want some help here.,9,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1e6gyd/i_just_had_a_terrible_nightmare_i_want_some_help/,"It started out pretty normally.  I don't remember too much of it.  My boyfriend's aunt and uncle sent us both to summer camp at our college so we'd have some more time together this summer.  (There is no summer camp here.)  Real world me and boyfriend met in college, so we spend most of our time together, but we live about 6 hours apart in the summertime, so that made sense to me.

It dream-segued into me sitting in a lecture hall for Genetics.  Real world me had taken Genetics before, and although I passed it, I didn't do too well in it.  Dream world me knew this and thought it strange I was in there, but went along with it anyway.  I didn't have a notebook or any paper, so I pulled some out from the elementary school style desk and found some of my notes from when I had last taken it in there.  I flipped them over to the normally blank side, as I usually take notes on one side of the paper, and someone else had scribbled on that side.  The prof started talking about what we needed to do to pass the class and started getting really creepy around me:  hands on my shoulders, whispering in my ear, and even licking my face.  Dream me made a note to press sexual harassment charges.  By the time he had stopped molesting me and I had found some paper, class was over.  I went outside to my little Vespa-like scooter (which I don't have) and took off back towards the dorm on a road that runs parallel to campus.

Now here's the worst part.  I was riding my little scooter down the road to get back to our dorm.  I rounded the corner into campus and saw firetrucks, police cars, and ambulances sitting around everywhere.  Not a few of them, but so many of them that I couldn't wedge my scooter in.  I skittered to a stop and jumped off my scooter.

I walked up to a police woman, and there was already a bad feeling in my gut.  Although dream me was just in an introductory lecture, dream me knew it was finals week and my boyfriend had been under a lot of stress.  I swallowed hard and asked her,

DM:  ""What happened?""

PW:  ""Two young men were hanging out of their windows at [our dorm name] Hall like they knew they could fly.  They leaned back and, well, magic isn't real, so they fell four stories onto concrete.""

Two young men.  One of them can't be...

DM:  ""Do you know the names of either of them?""

PW:  ""One is unidentified, the other is something like [butchered version of boyfriend's last name].""

DM:  ""You mean [BF's last name]?"" *(DM's losing composure)*

PW:  ""That's definitely it.  Do you know him?""

DM:  *(DM's started crying hysterically by this time)* ""We've been dating for nearly a year and a half.""

PW:  ""His parents weren't answering the phone.  You're going to have some tough decisions to make.""

As we were walking to the ambulances, something finally woke me up from this terrible dream.  Disturbingly, I was morbidly curious as to how bad of a condition he was in even when I woke up, and for some reason wanted to return to that horrible dream.

Luckily real world boyfriend is perfectly fine and cozy and safe in his childhood home, just as I am.  It still shook me up a lot because it was so realistic and a totally valid concern during finals week.  There aren't fears of infidelity going on if you were trying to understand the second guy.

We've had quite a debate about this subject here at /r/dreams. As expected, opinions vary greatly. I assert that dreams actually help create the future at a quantum level before it becomes reality, but can't offer proof because the research just hasn't been done. However, bring up this subject and you will get many folks who chime in with their own stories of dreams predicting the future.

The article linked to above covers some of the research into the topic (it's a long article so scroll down about halfway to get right to that part) and studies that have been done. It concludes by surmising that people are easily misled into believing what they want to believe, but leaves open the possibility that more is at work than just stupid human tricks. If so, there is an avenue for scientific exploration that is wide open and potentially life-changing. If dreams can truly see into the future and help create it, it means they are the greatest tool we know of for personal development.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_1e5a9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1e5a9h/can_dreams_predict_the_future_this_article_gives/,

Me, James Franco and Elijah Wood were at the EA Christmas Party, where Toa (gorgeous Tongan lesbian friend) was once again my awesome date, and James Franco's double buddy dates was JC, a good friend, and Jody (another good friend, all three were high and wouldn't leave the nacho table) and Elijah Wood's date were two girls: my sister Nola and my buddy Ruth (they both were trynna compete to see who was the best dressed, throughout the dream, their outfits changed constantly as they were both outclassing each other at every other appearance). JC and Jody both were awesome comedy reliefs and James Franco kept saying ""DUDE YOU GUYS SHOULD BE IN A BUDDY MOVIE"" to where the both of you looked at each other and went ""...... NAaaaaaah"". The EA Christmas Party theme was held at Disneyland this year, and everyone happened to be inside the castle (I've never been to Disneyland, so my head just assumed that the inside looked like the inside of a huge, wood paneled mansion with staircases and libraries everywhere) when all of Los Angeles began to get upset that they weren't invited and began a revolt against the castle. Trebuchets, catapults and giant slingshots made by that Swedish guy from the Youtube based Slingshot Channel was there hurling arrows, firebombs and Molotov Cocktails. We were inside wondering what to do, when Toa, the genius that she was, realized that I was currently asleep and that we were all trapped in my dream, and suggested that we do an Inception in my head to implant the thought that I had to wake up before we die. So, we had to get to the end of the mansion where the Sleep Machine Pump and chairs was located.

However, we first had to get past a GIGANTICALLY TALL and IMPECCABLY DRESSED MADS MIKKELSEN, who was armed with a spoon and a fork, Filipino Style, ready to eat whoever came across his path! We had to stick to the shadows as Mads Mikkelsen seemed to be blinded by the glare of the spotlights that suddenly appeared and pierced through the windows randomly. We managed to get split up somehow and I lost track of Toa and the rest of the group decided to take the stairs and try to get there that way. As I crept the way through the bottom floor of the castle, GIANT MADS MIKKELSEN LOOMED BEHIND ME and crouch-ran after me throughout the lower portions of the castle. I was just one step ahead of him when I managed to time a spotlight flash right into Giant Mads Mikkelsen's eyes: I slid underneath the light stream right when Giant Mads Mikkelsen took a stab at me with his fork shouting ""BALIKBAYAAAAAN!!!"" in that typical deep, evil giant voice all evil giant peoples have.

I sprinted upstairs where I found James Franco and Elijah Wood inside a giant library room where they and the rest of the group were crawling above holding onto the library shelves attempting to make it to the Inception Room except for Toa, she was nowhere to be found, and they wanted to avoid the lasers darting back and forth on the ground. Me, being the big bumbling fat oaf that I was, was all, ""HEY GUYS WAIT FOR ME"" and went running directly into the laser fencing. Everyone was like ""OOOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOoooooooo"" when the huge steel security door opened up and IT WAS GIANT MADS MIKKELSEN!!! Everyone started screaming their heads off, but JC pointed and went ""LOOK!!"" and who was riding Giant Mads Mikkelsen's neck but none other than a leather vested, cowboy hat wearing, rope wrangling, @$$-less chaps wearing with magical sparkling neon green and gold zebra striped denim jeans wearing TOA shouting ""YEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAWWWW!! LET'S GET HIM GIRLS!"" and out came the Amazing Lesbolognian Ninja Force lead by Coco (Toa's ex-girlfriend but they're still friends), Ellen Degeneres, New York's Mayor Bloomberg dressed in drag, and Spider-man swinging under Giant Mads Mikkelsen's crotch right into a giant jacket pocket where he found Meg Ryan and rescued her.

We crowded into the Inception room, sat down and I woke up in a darkened room lit only by dim security lights above, and I had my dream helpers Travis (a younger hipster friend of mine) and Andrew (his lumberjack hipster half-brother) trying to help me break into my dream vault. Andrew kept insisting that I eat a burrito before I enter the combination to my dream vault, but Travis was all ""Dude that'll never work. Let's just go and eat this taco"" and you held up a vanilla flavored Choco Taco. I was confused as to who to help when I accidentally set off an alarm and we were all of a sudden surrounded by the combined forces of The West High School Football Team from Salt Lake City, Utah, and the San Mateo high School Football Team. Travis looked to Andrew and said ""SEE I TOLD YOU!! Tacos can save lives, Andrew! What do burritos do but bring pain and suffering?"" But, then Andrew looked and smiled and said ""Oh yeah?"" and he bit into the burrito, swallowed, and snapped his fingers, and the coach of the combined football team arrived and who was it but none other than MEGAN FOX. And she walked up to Travis and burped into his face and then walked up to Andrew and kissed him. when they separated, Andrew was like ""your kiss... it tastes like... it tastes like Victory.""

She then looked to the combined Football team and said ""Scram, boys"" and the entire team left to go run wind sprints.

In my dream, I'd never seen him). I was window shopping. I stopped into a little family owned store and started looking around, while the man went to the other side of the store and looked too. We bought multiple items, and the total came out to $115 and some odd change. When the lady scanned my card, she took all the money out of my account and handed me a huge wad of $20s and $5s. Then I woke up to my mom's ringtone on my phone.

My mom called me at about 9am yesterday morning(April 4, 2013) and asked if I had spent $110 at a gas station, and $15 at Family Dollar(downtown McKinney) about 20 minutes away from my house(Frisco). Chase had alerted us about potential fraudulent charges made on my card. She told me to basically tear apart the house looking for it(Which, obviously, I didn't find). When I checked my work pants, I pulled out 2 $20s, a $5, and 5 $1s.

Now I know the money came from the tips I made the night before, but the fact that I was in the same city spending almost the same amount in my dream as a strange man was in reality kind of sent me for a trip...",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_1bqq5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1bqq5e/connections/,

I usually don't post much but I recently had what I believe to be the most important dream of my life. Which is strange for me because I rarely put any faith in such things. And to be honest, not much happened in the dream. I was living somewhere in the midwest on a farm of some sort with an elderly couple. The old white Woman loved to cook and was your stereotypical southern granny. Her husband was an old black fellow who loved to sing the blues. Another southern stereotype? Anyway we had only one neighbor and it was an Asian family. The daughter, who was absolutely gorgeous, was very nice. For some reason there were folks there whom I seemed to know and who I apparently cared about. An argument broke out between the neighbor and some of my guests, and what happened next was what I think was so important. I yelled at the top of my lungs for them to stop fighting and it was so full of passion and anger that I surprised myself. I was full of confidence I have never experienced before in real life. I had a real understanding of what happiness truly meant and how it really felt. I explained to my guests what happiness was and why it was so pointless to argue over nothing. I went to my neighbor's daughter and put my arm around her comfortably. I woke up after that not knowing I was asleep or where I was or why I was so frightened. Then I realized that I was scared because I am always scared of everything and my dream-self wasn't scared of anything. So my question is: is that the person I want to be? How do I get there? Where is the lovely house in the country? I know none of you have the answers but ya.

And I asked my self if one of them is the one,  then took some NyQuil and passed out. 
My dream starts at my work, I leaning up against a counter with my backpack on the right of me and my skis on the left. I'm falling asleep, I feel so drowsy and tired then the room changes , it turns into a apartment with smoke everywhere. I know somebody's been smoking weed. I hear a TV in the back ground and start walking towards it . There is three men sitting on the couch but I only recognize one. (Sean) I look around the in panic and and then feel relived when I see my bag and skis . Then Sean looks at me and tells me to come snuggle with him. So I sit behind him on the couch but I don't wrap my arms around him. I fold them on his back. 
Now here is a part I thought was VERY strange. 
They had crayons on the floor and I was using my shoe to break them, and the three Guys would eat them like they were some kind of a drug.  After they eat them all I lay my head on Sean's back and start to feel drowsy and tired again but it's so intense this time. I push him away and yell stop rocking you body back and fourth it's making me so tired!! He laughed at me then Change his position on the couch and pulled my head into his chest and started rocking again( this is where i felt love) Then I wake up and everything is changed I'm in a bedroom . I was at a sleep over and this little girl comes in trips over my skis. She yells at me and then Puts on a movie. I don't watch the movie because I remember that I was with Sean an I want to go back to him so I start packing my green pillow into bag. And I change my socks To a pink and green pair, I grab my skis and bag and run out the door  on the other side is then. Sean and the other guys. There all sitting around a table. The room is empty except for the table and the walls are painted a light yellow I drop my bag and set my skis down and walk over to Sean he stand up and hugs me we sit down I he passes a blunt to me and right before I take a hit i am back at work felling drowsy tired again I snap out of it and check my phone. It's 4:10 and that means work is almost over and I've slept the whole time I've been at work and didn't get anything done. So I start running to all the classrooms to grab the trash cans (I'm a sweeper ant a elementary school) as I'm running out of the class rooms I wake up.

Some details in your dream may not seem like they relate to anything in your life but if you try hard enough you can make the connection. Now don't get me wrong there will be some minute details that appear in your dreams that really have no meaning what so ever, just your minds way of dumping the trash (if you find meaning in it use it if not just let it go). Like seeing a Starbucks cup that reminds you of a friend who likes Starbucks coffee, has no real meaning but could creep into your dream.  Something could stem from a photo/billboard you seen while walking home from a friend’s house, maybe a car ad, travel ad or just a model wearing new jeans. It may have unconsciously triggered a thought that just happened to make it into your dream. Even these unconscious thoughts have a meaning in your dream state like I said it’s your minds way of clearing the clutter. Now recurring dreams most likely have deeper meanings. These are the ones that can be difficult to decipher and my take some time. I feel that these can be triggered from something as simple as a passing thought sometime during the day or a conversation you had during the day that, by not the actual topic of conversation but the wandering of the mind during a conversation puts you (your mind) into a different place, all the while still carrying on the conversation. Your mind can pick this out during the dream, the conversation has nothing to do with the dream but where your mind wandered makes its way back home, into your dream. When trying to decipher a dream leave no stone unturned. Even the smallest thing could have a much larger emotion / thought that you didn’t even realize at the time. I am not trying to discredit anyone that claims they can interpret your dreams for you but I just don’t see how they can do this without knowing your entire life and everything that has ever happened  to you.  There can be things that have happened to you that you don’t remember but they find their way into your dreams. Maybe I am just rambling but I have figured out almost every dream I have ever had without the help of some wonder guru.

I must have been asleep not more than 25min when in my dream I was walking, yabbering away about pointless nonsense to what I can only describe as the ""presence"" of a good energy, it did not have a physical form that I could see but was there none the less. I am walking down a street at night and then something dark is lurking in the shadows on the other side of the street and it is growing. Whatever this thing was it was fucking evil and I'm getting chills up and down my spine typing this now. The good force in my dream at this point became (and I only saw a glimpse as I looked back) a white figure of light and told my to shut up and that it was not safe, to move faster. The dark energy was getting closer and fast and then my white figure put the palm of it's hand right between my shoulder blades and began pushing me, hard, not shoving but a continual force. I was terrified at this point and it felt like if this thing caught us I would be dead- or worse. I was being pushed faster and within seconds was lifted of my feet flying about 50cm off the ground with everything becoming a blur around me. This was a chase and it felt so so close but at that point I was hurled into consciousness. Here's the really strange thing, that hand was still pushing right between my shoulder blade to the point I felt like I was leaving my bed for a good 20seconds or more, the dark being whatever it was moved closer to the walls and away from me but I could still feel it's presence. I WAS awake, not halfway between sleep and awake but full awake eyes wide open. This has never happened to me before, I have had sleep paralysis a few times in my life but nothing like this. This was intense. Any help with an interpretation would be appreciated as this is a really crucial point in my life. I am beginning to for the first time fend off 15 years of depression and recently returned from a burning man style festival which has had a huge impact on me if that is of any use. As we say in New Zealand... Chur

There, I was laying in my bed bowsing the internet as I usually do, getting ready for sleep. It was so real.

I dream first that I am a prostitute- or, I label myself a prostitute in-dream. But I am in nicer hotels, I am not in dire need of money or anything, and I enjoy the sex. It's almost a pleasant job for me. The men are relatively attractive to me, but they do not use a condom, to my distress, and I do not say anything. I do not recall being handed money after sex, and I don't know why that is- I just seemed quick to say to myself, ""I am a prostitute"".

In my next dream, as I said before, I have no recollection that I 'sold' my body before. But I know I'm pregnant. (IRL, I'm single and in my early 20's. In my situation, pregnancy would be, well, earth-shattering). As my first dream took place in bedrooms, this one takes place in the sun, outdoors, and I very much revel in carrying a baby (though it is not established who got me pregnant).

I can't describe the feeling I woke up with. I suppose I had a pang of sadness, that the joy was only in my dream, and short-lived.

Neither one of us was proportionally upset, so we just wandered off in separate directions to think about what to do next.

After that I went back out and found (now ex-)fiance, and told him about it, and THEN had a good dream-cry.

I am a twenty or so year old male who recently got into a non-booty call relationship. 

I decided that I didn't want to do the booty call thing anymore. I ended up not being able to climax because there wasn't much if any emotional connection.

So I go after the first girl who I have genuinely liked in a long time. . (side note: we met because one of her friends and I were F-buddies. She knows and we talked about it. We are a really close group. Her friend said just be sure to not hurt her. I scoffed and said no way in hell will I).

We started going out a few weeks before Christmas and had a phenomenal New Years. She is a virgin and is still uncomfortable with doing anything physical to my lower regions but is ok with everything on her end. 

In most every one of the plentiful dreams, she either catches me cheating before it happens or after. And each time she cries as expected. 



I am confused as to what my mind is trying to tell me. The dreams have been going on for a little over a week and show up in the smallest of naps. And I am certain I am sexually frustrated.

1357812956.0,7,self.Dreams,16b3df,Common Dream Symbols &amp; what they might mean.,8,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16b3df/common_dream_symbols_what_they_might_mean/,"**Edit: RadOwl Expanded on this list &amp; [his comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16b3df/common_dream_symbols_what_they_might_mean/c7uq9zj) is well worth reading.**

This is just as much a question as it is an answer.  I could very well be wrong or not entirely right about some of these, so feel free to correct what I've said, modify it, or post your take on it &amp; feel free to add to the list.  I'm here to learn &amp; to summarise some of what I've researched so far.  These are just some of the most common dream symbols &amp; what they are commonly believed to represent:

* **A house or building**: represents your body (or perhaps someone else's body if you see another house from the outside with someone else on the inside?  The eyes are the windows?  Things happening inside the house relate to things happening in your head?).
* Your **home**:  is usually an indication that the dream is mildly to significantly important.  A dream about the first house you can remember living in is much more important &amp; worthy of contemplation/translation than a dream about your current home.
* Cars, buses, boats, airplanes, &amp; other **forms of transportation**: Refer to the passage of time.
* **Bodies of water**: indicate emotions (e.g. calm, turbulent).  (But suppose you're on a boat going down a rapidly moving river?  Is this describing emotions AND the passage of time?)  I suspect that music in dreams might also represent moods/emotions, but I haven't yet read anything to back this up.
* **Teeth**:  represent how you appear to others.  Dreams about teeth cracking, crumbling, &amp;/or falling out are generally interpreted as losing face in front of others or other people seeing your flaws.
* **Bleeding**:  I've read that losing blood relates to losing money &amp; how badly you're bleeding indicates how much money. (e.g. In one very strange dream I had, I was with a friend when I fell &amp; injured my hand. The wound looked serious but there was surprisingly little blood.  This friend used to always try to get me to pay for the alcohol, food, or whatever when we hung out &amp; I knew she was using me a little, but only because I was the only one responsible enough to keep a job &amp; have money back then)  I wouldn't mind a second opinion on this definition of blood from someone else familiar with dream symbols.
* **Re-occurring dreams**: relate to something you've been dealing with and continue to deal with as long as you keep having these dreams (I'm not good at swimming at all &amp; in dreams, bodies of water - even swimming pools - would often be teeming with fish that looked as menacing as sharks &amp; deep sea creatures.  I eventually faced my fear of water, quite literally ""took the plunge"", &amp; haven't seen the vicious fishes in many years)

I hope some of you found this useful &amp; I look forward to your input.

-----------------------------------------------------------
For those interested in reading more &amp; who aren't familiar with these, I will throw in a list of **Carl Gustav Jung's ""Archetypes""**.  These dreams are important &amp; should be given special attention.
-----------------------------------------------------------

To further help you in uncovering the meaning of your dreams, Jung noted certain dream symbols 
that possess the same universal meaning for all men and women. He terms this phenomenon the 
""collective unconscious"". While dreams are personal, your personal experiences often touch on 
universal themes and symbols. These symbols are believed to occur in every culture throughout  
history. Jung identifies seven such symbols in what is referred to as the major archetypal 
characters:

1. **The Persona** is the image you present to the world in your waking life. It is your public mask. 
In the dream world, the persona is represented by the Self.  The Self may or may not resemble you 
physically or may or may not behave as your would. For example, the persona can appear as a 
scarecrow or a beggar in your dream. However, you still know that this ""person"" in your dream is 
you.

2. **The Shadow** is the rejected and repressed aspects of yourself. It is the part of yourself that 
you do not want the world to see because it is ugly or unappealing. It symbolizes weakness, fear, 
or anger. In dreams, this figure is represented by a stalker, murderer, a bully, or pursuer. It 
can be a frightening figure or even a close friend or relative.  Their appearance often makes you 
angry or leaves you scared. They force you to confront things that you don't want to see or hear. 
You must learn to accept the shadow aspect of yourself for its messages are often for your own 
good, even though it may not be immediately apparent.

3. **The Anima / Animus** is the female and male aspects of yourself. Everyone possess both feminine 
and masculine qualities. In dreams, the anima appears as a highly feminized figure, while the animus 
appears as a hyper masculine form. Or you may dream that you are dressed in women's clothing, if you 
are male or that you grow a beard, if you are female. These dream imageries appear depending on how 
well you are able to integrate the feminine and masculine qualities within yourself. They serve as a 
reminder that you must learn to acknowledge or express your masculine (be more assertive) or feminine 
side (be more emotional). 

4. **The Divine Child** is your true self in its purest form. It not only symbolizes your innocence, 
your sense of vulnerability, and your helplessness, but it represents your aspirations and full 
potential. You are open to all possibilities. In the dreamscape, this figure is represented by a 
baby or young child.  

5. **The Wise Old Man /Woman** is the helper in your dreams. Represented by a teacher, father, doctor, 
priest or some other unknown authority figure, they serve to offer guidance and words of wisdom. 
They appear in your dream to steer and guide you into the right direction.

6. **The Great Mother** is the nurturer. The Great Mother appears in your dreams as your own mother, 
grandmother, or other nurturing figure. She provides you with positive reassurance. Negatively, 
they may be depicted as a witch or old bag lady in which case they can be associated with seduction, 
dominance and death. This juxtaposition is rooted in the belief by some experts that the real mother 
who is the giver of life is also at the same time jealous of our growth away from her. 

7. **The Trickster**, as the name implies, plays jokes to keep you from taking yourself too seriously. 
The trickster may appear in your dream when you have overreach or misjudge a situation. Or he could 
find himself in your dream when you are uncertain about a decision or about where you want to go in 
life.  The trickster often makes you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, sometimes mocking you or 
exposing  you to your vulnerabilities. He may take on subtle forms, sometimes even changing its shape.  

Archetypal dreams, also refer to as ""mythic dreams"", ""great dreams"" or ""grand dreams"", usually occur at 
significant times or transitional periods in your life. They often leave you with a sense of awe or that 
you have learned something important about yourself. Such dreams have a cosmic quality or an element of 
impossibility if occurred in reality. They are often extremely vivid and stay in your mind long after 
you had the dream. ",,False,,t5_2qmbx,1357863134.0,,,True,t3_16b3df,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/16b3df/common_dream_symbols_what_they_might_mean/,

I was snooping in the middle drawer, and for some reason I decided to skim my hands through the upper part of the drawer. Upon placing my hand, I felt the wood move slightly upwards. I did it again, but this time applied more force, and much to my surprise a thin layer of wooden board smoothly went down. The table had around four to five inches of distance between the table top and the drawer, so it makes sense there was space for secret compartments. 

I inserted my hands on the secret compartment and probed around gently. I felt a metal box. I removed it carefully and placed it on the floor, in front of me, where I sat. There was a hole for a lock, but there was no lock. I opened it as if it was Pandora's box. Inside there was numerous pieces of golden jewellery such as necklace, a watch, earrings, rings with huge diamonds and a note with beautiful handwriting that I couldn't quite read instantly, it was all curly and inclined to the right.

There were two dreams overlaid. The first one, I was auditioning for a musical, and was up against some pros. I mean, these people were formidable in their vocal performance and they knew the show backwards and forwards, but I still felt I had a shot. 

While this was going on, I also had a dystopian dream. I dreamed that I was part of an underground band of people (similar to the people in The Walking Dead in their temperaments) and the only people I remember recognizing were my actual father and a two-year old girl I know from work (I work at a childcare center). 

Anyway, the dystopian setting took place in the future, where human evolution had progressed to genetic manipulation. We were trapped underground in an abandoned government facility, and were on the run. We were part of a movement that did not agree with genetic manipulation, or the way in which the government had used the technology. In the dream, at this point, I don't know any of this. All I know is that me and my people are stuck in a deep, dank, dark place where we can't get out. We got separated for what felt like years, and when we finally reunited, the other part of my group had been outside, and managed to come back for us. 

We broke out of the facility and were on the run in the countryside. We used abandoned houses and broken down cars for shelter. We got to the top of a hill and I remember looking down at a city below. It looked gorgeous. Completely pristine and unadulterated. That's when I discovered the nature of the genetic manipulations done by the government. I saw people diving off of buildings into pools, and being completely unharmed. They flew through the air at high speeds- they'd basically become superheros. The manipulations had taken the form of physical entertainment, and anyone who wasn't considered ""gifted"" didn't matter. They didn't use this chance to better humanity at all. They weren't pushing their species further with high intellectual pursuits, there were no humanitarian efforts to bring everyone forward with them, it was just...games. Just physical feats of amazing scale, however it didn't mean anything.

They were saying they bought the bike already from some guy at a park but it was my moms. It had been in the yard. So I start questioning and trying to get them to back out of my yard and garage and I jumped in the truck and locked everything and took the keys out, dragged the asshole in it out with me and slammed his face on the car because he was trying to bite me and he hit me in the chest.

This leads to a mad me of course, it turns out my nephew(3) is at this house. So I go inside and ask if my dad can come out and help me chase them off and I put my nephew in the house because he was playing in the yard. When my dad came out some of the idiots got scared and walked further down the road but one guy pulled out a gun and started shooting at me and the door of the house. Then I heard crying I never ever want to hear. My nephew had been shot. (I cry just thinking about this, makes me so mad.)

Inside my poor baby nephew is hurt but luckily it just grazed him. He's still in pain though. My dad starts cleaning him up and calling 911. But I lose control of my anger even in my dream and I have a blackout moment like I do sometimes when I get that pissed. Except this time when I blacked out everything was slow and grey but I could still tell what my body was doing. I grabbed the closest sharp thing which was a big, long, heavy, sharp pair of dress makers scissors and headed out side. They had all come back and were still out in my yard celebrating being degenerate youth. (insert yolos here) I ran up and pounced on the mother f**ker with the gun. And I stabbed him right in the neck and did my best to behead him. The gurgles he made mixed with the screaming of the hood girls made a sickening soundtrack to my revenge.

After he fell I caught one that hadn't had a chance to run away and I tore off part of his face with my hands and threw it into the car of his friends just before they drove off down the street.

In short, I happened to be in a strange wingsuit of sort. It felt like I was laying back (because I was in reality) and grasping the 4 corners of like... a sheet while it was behind my back, catching the wind.

It was super windy; I was immediately caught by the wind and sent sailing across the mountains and skies, over oceans and lakes. Forests and hills; And for some reason, Jake the Dog from adventure time was with me. Oh, and I remember that while I'm flying over all of this I had a very clear thought of ""Damn I wish I could record this..."" and thought for a split-second of a GoPro camera. Ha, if only I could...

I'm soaring and sailing; We come over a huge mountain peak and let out a resounding ""Uh oh"" as we realize it suddenly goes down much more steeply; A literal mountain with mounds below, kind of like [moguls](http://lh6.ggpht.com/this.ian/R78DTS0pAzI/AAAAAAAAAc4/yLPoVPs1NQM/IMG_1109_thumb%5B1%5D) but very large ones, to the degree that as I was terrified at first of coming down I realized that when I slid down the side of one of them the wind immediately thrust me right back up over the ridge of one of these huge moguls and into the air.

So here it is, me and Jake the dog, sailing by means of holding onto a large glorified sheet and riding intense wind over miles and miles of differing landscapes.

A few instances. 

* I immediately woke up but it was semi, sort of like aware of your surroundings and consciousness but still in the dream state. I thought the entire room was a stage, where the walls would fall down a la Truman Show style... thus I threw my pillow at the nearest dresser. My GF the next morning was confused on why a pillow was on the top of the dresser.

* I suddenly woke up, in the same manner of semi consciousness. Screamed at my GF, acknowledging her that the mattress is upside down! She was utterly bemused... asked me what I was talking about... I became more agitated, and told her that the mattress is upside down and should not be this way.. then proceeded to go back to sleep.

Why I was there or why I decided to enter I do not know.  Upon walking into the main room, a man in a skull mask charged at me, threw me to the ground and tied me up.  The next thing I know, I’m in a darkly lit room sitting on a chair before a table illuminated by a single weak light bulb.  On the table is a deck of cards and since I’m no longer tied up, I take the deck and begin reading through the cards.  Each card is blank on one side and on the other side says the name of a body part such as eye, hand, or leg.  A select few of the cards say “nothing.”  The masked figure who tied me up enters the room and sits at the table across from me.  In an deep voice he says “Alright, we’re going to play a little game.  Draw a card.”  I draw the first card from the top of the deck which says “hand.”  The masked figure then walks over to a nearby table and picks up a massive blood-stained chainsaw which he revs and starts up.  Once the chainsaw is roaring he slowly approaches me, I turn and run in the opposite direction when he shouts, “THE DOORS ARE BOOBYTRAPPED.  IF YOU TRY TO ESCAPE, YOU WILL DIE.”  With a sense of helplessness I sink to the ground.  The figure stands over me and says quietly “give me your hand.”  Knowing what was going to happen next I hold out my left hand (my non-dominant hand) as he lowers the chainsaw.  I watch in horror as the chainsaw comes in contact with my wrist and blood begins to spatter everywhere.  I begin screaming in pain as the moving blade slices off my hand.  Blood is now gushing out of the stump on the end of my arm.  I’m in shock as I scream and writhe on the ground in pain.  The next thing I know I pass out cold.


When I wake up the man is gone and the bleeding has stopped.  I know I need to escape and see a partly opened window on one side of the room.  I run over to the window still trying to comprehend the fact that I am missing my left hand.  I manage to open the window and slide my body out.  I get outside and in pouring rain I frantically search for a way out.  I notice a small fence in front of me and run over to it and desprately try to climb over with only one hand.  I somehow manage to get to the other side and once over, I run up to the nearest house I see.  I bang on the door but no one answers.  “HELP,” I scream.  “I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME.”   After receiving no answer I try the knob and mange to get in.  The first room of the house is a living room area with couches and a fireplace.  I sink down to the ground panting.  But just as I begin to relax, I see the front door get bashed in.  It's the dark masked figure with a chainsaw who enters the house and sees me cowering on the ground.  He cackles, turns at me, and shouts “DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD ESCAPE?”  He fires up the chainsaw again and begins to approach me.  “NO,” I scream.  “NO THIS CAN’T BE, THIS CAN’T BE.”  I close my eyes and wake up.


This was one of those dreams that was so vivid that upon waking up, I had to check multiple times to make sure I still had the use of my left hand.  I really have no idea what to make of this.  I’m on winter break and have been incredibly relaxed over the past few days.  On top of that I haven’t seen any horror movies or anything in ages because I’m not really in to them.

So this may be described as an out of body experience. 


Once I got out, I looked at a nearby mirror in the room I was in and I could barely see myself, it was a very cloudy image.


I decided to have a go at flying around, so I floated up through the ceiling and the house. I am high up in the sky flying around, looking around in amazement when somehow I run into this girl. 


I can't describe my feelings when I saw her, it felt as if she and I had been best friends and lovers for many many lifetimes. I had completely forgotten about her until I saw her face, then it all came back to me.


It felt so good to see her again. This feeling is probably the best feeling I remember ever having in my whole life.


We then fly together into outer space and start doing this stuff, it is hard to explain, but it was like we were dancing or playing. At one time, we spun around each other so fast we turned into colored light energy, and I remember myself turning into the brightest orange I have ever seen. It was pure ecstasy.

My mom, my stepdad and I were at a republican rally of sorts on a ranch (shocking I know) but the ranch was also a high school.

We look over and there a giant bull riding event going on and the bulls start breaking loose from the pin. Theres shockingly little panic and everyone starts trying to wrangle up the bulls. One comes charging towards but for some reason it was a mini bull like the size of a kitten with full silzed horns. Super weird, but anyway, I just grab the horn and pick the little guy up and walk him over to the barn. The guy inside the barn is like the head rancher and is [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/iehWy.jpg) from joe dirt, but he spoke normally. He thanks me and asks if I wouldnt mind helping out. I agree and he tells me first we need to crack the bulls knuckle. Which in my dream means pushing down on the hoof until it separates like theres a hinge in the back. Once it separates he pulls out a boner grinder (something my dream brain made up) and stars to grind down the mini bulls knuckle and as hes doing this his [assisstant/star bull rider/most popular kid in school](http://i.imgur.com/zPMMj.jpg) we'll call him jason since he didnt have a name in the dream, comes in and is helping out a bit but also complaining about some girl problem hes having.

At this point the rancher hands me a ball of wax and tells me to chew it if i wanna be able to play for another 5 years (???) so I do and he then turns to jason and starts telling him the story of how he and his wife met. This is meant to give jason some insight on his current girl problem (what ever it was I don't know) and this story goes on for a long time. I dont remember the details but I know I was chewing that weird wax ball for a long time. Towards the end of his story I can tell jason is itching to leave and I wanted out of there too so I asked where the bathroom was. Turned out to be very close so I head in to take a piss but can still hear them talking quite easily. Jason is still trying to go out the door when the rancher starts telling the story of how he met his first wife, when jason interrupts his and says, ""We've all heard your story about being a gladiator in a past life!"" then storms out, I hear the door slam and wake up.

Straight blew my mind when I woke up. Im still kinda like what the hell.... I had to tell someone body so thanks r/dreams. Questions/comments welcome.

I am super excited, despite this situation not making any sense. The only major suspicion is that my ex bf wouldn't be this attracted to me. We just broke up.

I just stared at the wolf, tuning everything out. And then I started day dreaming in this dream!

I'm in the world of Tron, wearing Tron stuff and a bowstaff with tasers at both ends. I am ambushed by wolves and I fight all of them off. Suddenly I get derezzed and return to my college dream

I am back at college when the bell rings and I head to class. Crowded classroom. I sit in back and fall asleep. Then I wake up back home with my ex bf.

I just hold him in my arms. Enjoying the moment. And then I hear Star Wars sounds coming from outside and I wake up for real.

But I dream about work every so often. 

Last night, I dreamed that I was teaching in a weird Library-esque place that had computers but there weren't enough computers for all the students (tech issues at school are a HUGE problem). 

Anyways, someone comes screaming out of the bathroom that a child is stuck in the toilet. 

I go in and look and in the toilet there is a child, whose head is the only thing I can see. Obviously, I can't flush. I try to grab the child's head but that makes things worse. He is a black child who's head is really reddish in color (I work in the inner city.) but as I try the child's head becomes more infantile (as in decreasing in age). 

I couldn't save him. 

I woke up. 

I can't get the image out of my head of him stuck in the toilet with only his head showing. 

Now my colleague and I thought through this and said there's a few possible things: my career is in the toilet? my school is in the toilet? my life is in the toilet? I can't save the world? I'm flushing my career away? Oh, and it may be a birthing image??? rather than a flushing image. It WAS like a reverse birth.

There’s plenty of interpretations and documented accounts of people being near a tree, climbing a tree, in a forest, and/or even being trapped inside a tree, but, my dream is quite different, as I believe I am the tree itself.

I want to make it clear that I am 100% drug free, never done drugs and never will. I also have no psychological issues. I am very much sane.

I have had this dream since I was about 3-4 years old. Only a child, I can only recall the bristling sound of the leaves being ruffled by the wind, and for the most part, was mostly in darkness.

As I grew older, the dream became more vivid and more detailed. The dreams have become very lucid, and it’s been very difficult for me to discern what was real and what was but a figment of my own imagination and/or recall of fabricated memories.

The dream unfolds like so:

A brief moment of darkness, in which, I turn my attention and gaze above me, and there I see the deep black night sky painted with shooting stars, a full moon, and a splat of gray clouds here and there. All is calm – there is no breeze and not the slightest sound made. I am no longer human, and I am completely immobilized. I sit, gazing, and long and behold, a thunderous roar wipes the black sky clear, and now, it is day, with the radiant sun illuminating the sky blue, and blotches of fluffy clouds scattered about. I continue to gaze, and soon, day becomes night, and night becomes day, each transition met with a thunderous crash – but there I sit, in complete stillness. 

Watching day and night pass perpetually gets boring, so I turn my attention to that which lies below me. At first, I see shadows of various shapes, sizes, and intensity. It is difficult to discern what each of these shadows resolve to, and with the flipping of day and night escalating with each cycle passed, everything becomes almost stop motion to me, and so, I focus hard on resolving each shadow. Some I quickly identify as family and friends; adults, teens, children; some I have never seen before; some acquaintances, co-workers; animals and flowers/shrubbery of all varieties; even insects, some known, some, probably make belief… They are wandering about below me, they climb and poke me, and kick me, and hug me, but I don’t feel a thing because I think the thick layer of bark around me prevents me from feeling… But I see them. They laugh, they cry, they share smiles and exchange frowns, going about, doing their own thing.

Anyway, things begin to wash out, I hear the thunder turn into a storm, and the flickering of day and night becomes so rapid that I can’t keep up with the visuals. I turn my attention to myself, but I cannot see myself. I could feel the leaves and branches as my arms, and the deep roots as my legs. I cannot move. An avalanche of snow or wave of water wipes everything below me, and next thing you know, I am clinging to my dear life, I do not budge. The tidal force barely moves me, if at all. The shadows, people, animals, vegetation drown in the white noise, and as everything disappears, the thunder blanks out, and all I hear is a low humming thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. It is my heart beating at a steady pace… I feel something reach out to me, but I cannot see it, I can’t feel it by touch, but I know it’s there…

I wake up, dazed and numb. I feel old just like I always have been.

I get this dream roughly a handful of times a year, for the past 26 or so years (I am now 30). I started documenting my dream, and updating it since I was 17. They seem to occur more frequently during the cold winter months. I just had this dream last night – again, so I thought this time perhaps I should share it with the Reddit community to see what your thoughts are and if there are some deeper/hidden meaning behind all of this.

Thank you for listening.

**TLDR: I have dreamt of being a tree since I was 3 years old. As I grew older, it’s become much more vivid and detailed, but I am having trouble deciphering the meaning behind this dream.**

So basically I'm in an undefined infinite space. I don't feel any sensation or hear any sound or see any light. I do, however, see an object in front of me. Usually it's a shape like a pyramid or cube; sometimes more complex.

The shape becomes visually larger to the point that I can no longer see it's edges and still continues to grow infinitely large, I can also feel it's presence, such a massive object I don't even think I exist anymore.

At the exact same time this object is rapidly shrinking into a never ending nothingness, becoming infinitely small. I feel so huge by comparison that the infinite space we occupy begins to seem almost too small.

That's it. Just back and forth at the exact same time, small and large, infinite in it's mass and lack thereof.

I can only just make out shapes of things in the room.  We're sitting in a couple arm chairs, conversing with one another.  I notice there is something VERY large leaning up against one of the walls.  Upon inspection it appears to be a thick slab of metal about the width of the room, and almost to the ceiling.  Strange.  I pay it no mind.

As my wife and I talk, I notice out of the corner of my eye that the slab is starting, ever so slowly, to lean away from the wall.  *This thing is going to crush us if we don't get out*

I panic.  I run up to the slab and put all of my weight and strength into it, trying to keep it against the wall.  It's no use.  It's too heavy, I can't stop it, only delay it's impending fall.  I scream to my wife to turn on the light so we can find a way out.  She's freaking out, she can't find it.  She fumbles around the room trying to find the light.

I keep screaming.

My eyes are closed tight as every muscle in my body strains against this immovable object.  I'm almost numb.

*Click*

She found it!  Still straining, I open my eyes to see what this thing is that is about to crush us.  It's our bedroom wall.  Bewildered, I relax my muscles slightly and look down.  I'm standing on our bed.  My wife is at the light switch looking frightened.  I peel myself from the wall that I was so sure was about to kill us.  I let myself drop onto the bed, shaking.


[As it turns out, I really was screaming to my wife to turn on the light.  She had no idea why I was so afraid, thankfully she knew I talked in my sleep, and played along and turned the light on.  The instant the light was turned on on I came out of my dream state, but the transition was seamless.  For the first few seconds I still thought we were in mortal peril, and my arms were pressed so hard into the wall I really did kind of peel my arms off the wall.

All I can recall is myself and some friends that I know I had not yet met, along with this girl that I had also never met. I just recall an unexplainable feeling of love toward her. As well as spending an abundant and close amount of time with her.  (I never did catch her name) Also you know how You usually experience things in your dream that couldn't happen in reality? Well with her we did just the opposite. We talked, we sat around, we genuinely enjoyed each others company. I found it oddly fantastic. (Made me the happiest I had been in a while) 
Usually  I would just blow it off as an odd dream, but it's what happened after I had spent my time with this woman that affected me so. In my dream I remember ending back up in my home at night. 

I was just standing in the middle of the hallway that leads to my bedroom door. Except my door was blocked off by a wall of miscellaneous items for some odd reason. I shrugged it off and simply drudged over it and into my bedroom. It is here I remember standing in the threshold of my room with the television on to my left and my bed in front of me. But there was someone in my bed. (I assumed it was my girlfriend at the time) but they where completely covered, so I gently woke with a nudge or two, who I thought was my girlfriend, as to ask what she was doing here. As I tried to wake this person my dream suddenly and without warning came to an abrupt end and I woke up dazed and confused in my bed. 

It was later in the evening after trying to recollect my dream, that I came to the unsettling conclusion that I had indeed been watching myself sleep in my own bed, so the person I was trying to wake up was me. 

Now whenever I think about that dream all I do is wonder how much of the dream in its entirety could have actually been legit. I mean, could I have met up with some chick that I know deep down that I love, and could even actually meet in the future? Or is my subconscious mind just a little overly active? I dunno.

Hi, I just made a dream alarm clock for iphones/ipods - called Dream State. It's basically a standard alarm clock, but when it wakes you up in the morning, and you turn it off, it starts recording audio. So, you can then start describing your dream before you forget it.

I made it for a friend of mine who is doing a dream related PhD, and has trouble a)writing things down fast enough when he wakes up, and b) getting his dictaphone working with his fumbling fingers.

So yeah, it's only version 1, so a little rough around the edges, and I have a few more bits of functionality to add (like maybe a video recording option? I dunno...), and am happy to take any other suggestions on board.

I believe that what we call consciousness, or even intuition, speak to a much deeper interconnection we experience with each other and subsequently with the universe than we have the means to formally acknowledge. So I believe dreams can hold amazing significance, and take on much deeper meaning within our waking lives. We often dismiss the importance of dreams since it's ""all in our heads"", but at the same time there is no such thing as an objective reality, everything is ""in our heads"". 

Anyway, one of such strange occurrences I've experienced was learning a word, completely foreign to my vocabulary, in a dream. This has actually occurred twice. Both times, in the dream, not knowing the word, I was confused as to what ""the speaker"" meant in what they said. And both times I didn't understand the message until AFTER I awoke, and AFTER I looked up the meaning of the word. And surprisingly enough, in both cases the words made complete sense within the context. 

Another such eery occurrence, didn't actually take on meaning until many months later, after forgetting I ever had the dream. If it weren't for the fact that I wrote it down immediately I would've never remembered. I fell in love with a girl in a dream. It was one of those instances where you regret waking up after experiencing just pure unadulterated joy. This is what I wrote when I woke up:

&gt;She's beautiful, isn't she? Her gentle gaze caresses the deepest crevices  of my soul with undaunted warmth and infinite pleasure. Her silk touch melts across my skin, then dissipates as beads of water on lush blades of grass. The labial sound of love nuzzles at my ear. I am as much hers as she is mine. Our love, obscured by blinding light. And then I awaken, stuck in a familiar existence. Undisturbed, desolate, alone.

Well, fast forward two months after I had that dream. Lo and behold, I fell in love with someone. And if I've learned anything from falling in love, it's that there's no such thing as coincidences. Coincidence is just a word we use for fate without purpose. There are no ""accidents"" in our lives. I find it amazing that within my previous, cynical, selfish, mindset, without even understanding the first thing about the real meaning of the word ""love"", a word we so flippantly use to the point that it's almost become empty, a dream revealed to me it's true meaning, in all it's depth, complexity, and overabundant beauty. Once I finally met ""that girl"", I was  immediately in love, without fully understanding why. Before I knew anything about her background, beliefs, interests, or any of the components that make her who she is, I just knew I was in love with her. It felt as if I'd always been in love with her, I simply had yet to discover it. Now I'm fully convinced she was the girl in that dream. Personally, there's so much beauty, and truth, and boundless complexity, within phenomena we don't even have the capacity to fully understand. How can we be so arrogant as to believe we are all there is. Well that's my two cents.

1345640838.0,5,self.Dreams,ymvy0,Dreaming of the apocalypse,7,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ymvy0/dreaming_of_the_apocalypse/,"Setting: A large town, about the size and scope of San Francisco.  Most of the town is made up of apartments, homes, and various shops, but there was one extremely large building.  It was shaped almost like a pyramid, all glass and stone, and it was easily 20 stories high.  The pyramid overlooked the entire area, situated right in the midline of the town, but set as far back as possible.  The entire town was encircled by a steep mountain range, with the sole entrance on one end, and the massive pyramid at the other.  It was set some time in the future, perhaps 50 years or so.  There were some types of flying machines, hologram style cellphones, and futuristic architecture.

Problem:  For some reason, our town was forcibly quarantined.  Not by the government though, since they were scrambling to break the quarantine and try to free us, but a massive force field was blocking the only entrance in and out of the valley, and also blocking access from above.  I was trapped with many others in the massive pyramid, which was even further quarantined, with each huge room within locked down as well, in an effort to make travel impossible.  We didn't know why there was a quarantine, nor who initiated it.

Being the future, there was a specific type of robot in the town.  It looked a little like the squids from the matrix, but more like it was designed for a happy japanese cartoon.  It had a cleaner, shinier appearance, an elongated head (about 3/4 the length of the average human body), a pleasant ""face"", and a dozen thick, 7 foot long tentacles.  They were created as helpful workers, and were situated all throughout the city.  However, someone had created a small armada of the same type of creature, except they were designed solely to kill, and had hidden them throughout the city.  They weren't active yet, but I recently discovered a countdown that would activate them upon completion.

The only modes of travel possible throughout the pyramid was a series of ductworks, used mostly by me, and Portal style portals used by these streetrat style kids (dressed in a grungier, steampunk version style of Oliver Twist).  The kids were a sort of gang similar to the little rascals.  They would point the portal gun (looked like a laser pointer) at a nearby wall, and it would open a portal to a random location within the pyramid.  They were traveling as they pleased, scavenging and having fun, not knowing the world was going to end.  At one point their portal opened to a secret series of ductwork, and you could see one of the evil squid robots waiting in stasis at the end.

As I tried to get the kids to give me the portal machine so I could travel to the main chamber room and shut down the countdown, the evil squid activated early and rushed the portal, attacking as it went through.  A random portal opened up behind me as the kid was knocked down, and I jumped through, unsure of where I would end up.  I ended up in a sort of viewing room of the pyramid, which overlooked the entire city as the sunset.  I wasn't the only one in the room though, as there were 5 or 6 other people around me.  I could see on a nearby clock that we had less than 5 minutes til the countdown completed, so I drafted an email and sent it to the outside world, hoping my family would see it.  It was going to serve as a last will and testament.

I then turned my attention to the people in the room, who were all sitting in line starting at the mountain range and the town entrance through the large viewing windows, waiting for the end of the world.  I remember thinking ""We all have to die in some way.  This is my way.  I accept it, and it's beautiful.""  I hugged a few of the people there, and even kissed one of the girls just to have one last kiss, then we sat down and watched the sky turn orange and smokey.  I could see a hazy smoke rising from the town, and I'm not sure now if the countdown had finished and all that smoke was destruction from the hundreds of squid robots.  Suddenly a large burst of smoke started creeping along the town from the far end, and it approached the pyramid, looking like a dust storm.  As it rushed the pyramid, I remember hearing a large rumbling sound, like the world was falling apart.

Suddenly the smoke cleared, and I could see blue sky behind it, and the town below was perfectly fine.  I remember looking at everyone and we all started talking.  None of us knew if we were safe and everything was okay, or if we just suddenly died and appeared in heaven.

So if I screwed something up; please let me know.

I dreamed that I was at a slumber party with a bunch of girls. *I* didn't know any of them but my dream self did. We were all happily talking and laughing and I never heard any actual words during the conversation but I knew we were talking. Suddenly one of the girls gets up to walk out of the room and pecks me on the lips just before leaving. I'm left in this room with girls and I'm absolutely stunned. She comes back in and I say ""Gee I know I'm gay and all but it's not like I have it for every girl I see haha."" (that sounds quite mean written down; I may have said something different it didn't seem so mean before) we all laugh about it but the girl who kissed me looks hurt.

Later on all of the girls are out of the room and I'm by myself when the girl who kissed me walks in. She looks really sad and says something along the lines of ""Logcabinsyrup, do you feel anything for me?"" and I cannot definitely remember if I said yes or no. I think I politely said no, but I knew that it was a lie. 

The dream seems to skip forward awhile and the last I remember is the girl and me cuddling on the bed of the room the slumber party was being held in. I'm not even sure that was part of the dream or if I'm making it up. I was woken up by a relative and the dream left me feeling so sad. This sounds so odd to me but it feels like a part of me was lost, like I really lost someone close to me. I don't even recall anyone in the dream being lost or dying or leaving so I really don't know why I feel this way. I've felt it all day; the feeling just won't leave me alone.

So /r/dreams got anything to add?

EDIT:

Not sure if this is really important but I guess I should add that I cannot recall having a dream that felt this real.

She was taking her clothes off as I was talking to her which was amazing, and I complimented her. As she heard the compliment she smiled real big and tried to kiss me. I don't let anyone kiss me in my dreams except my girlfriend so I stepped back and just let her hug me. But then the situation changed. She(the friend) went into my living room and was waiting i suppose. I slowly watched from outside my house as my girlfriend led a LOT of girls I've known from school and through friends including her best friend into my house. So after they all go inside I follow suit and enter the door. 

This is awesome.

ALL the girls are naked. Feeling eachother, looking at eachother, laughing and having fun. And they all look at me and keep the moment going!

* My Dad and I went to a sushi restaurant, but I had ordered a bowl of cold water with rice, ""seafood paste"" that I had to stir in myself, and one octopus tentacle.  
  
* Then we went to an ice cream shop; I tried a sample of blue ice cream and then was persuaded to try their ""new flavour"" which was really blue jell-o they were trying to scoop and put on cones as if it were ice cream. It was not pleasant.  
  
* Later I was in a park that looked like a sunken amphitheatre and was surrounded by clothing stores and a library inside a building that looked a lot like [The Rainier Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainier_Tower) and hung over the park.  
  
* Inside the library was also shaped like a sunken amphitheatre (this library reoccurs in my dreams a lot).  
  
* Later still, my boyfriend wanted to take me free running/parkuoring, which neither of us do in waking life. We parkuored into a neighborhood with lots of brick duplexes, then we parkuored right into someone's house through the window! There was a family inside that didn't notice us the whole time we were in there, and they had a flat screen tv in their garage. The house was exactly the same on the inside as my Grandparents' house.  
  
And, as I said before, my underwear were next to my face when I woke up. I'm assuming I took them off in the night and placed them next to (or on??) my face, though there was nothing in my dream that would have prompted me to do so.

",8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/xnmmb/i_look_down_and_am_flabbergasted_to_find_that_my/,"The dream is set in a semi-post-apocalyptic world.  The area I am in is a city, or at the very least a collection of institutional buildings – a very large complex of sorts. Much of the area is underground, and has the feeling that many areas have been repurposed (i.e., an underground mall has become a large mess hall/hospital area).  Many of the buildings show sign of destruction: blown out windows, crumbled walls, dangling electrical wires- some have even sunk into the ground completely.  I feel that I am part of some group, whether it is a group of peers, a group of coworkers, or both, I cannot say.  I do not recognize anyone, and there are many varieties of race and class.  

Access to food, water, medical care, medical supplies, clean clothes and showers are limited.  There are no cell phones or wall phones, and there is little- to no- electricity or running water.  Helicopters fly overhead. People move in groups – never alone – and people are constantly shifting from one area of the complex to another in a hurried fashion.  People traveling alone are shot on sight. There are children, but my child is in another area of the complex with some of my family, an area that is heavily guarded and has food and water.  I want desperately to get to him, but I do not know where the he is. I know that I am held in high regard by the group, and I feel a large sense of responsibility to save my group and all of the other groups.  I know that I will be able to lead us to safety, and I know that I will find my son.

Most people in my group and other groups are complaining about the situation, but not providing solutions.  I tune them out and listen to the murmurs coming from the leaders of other groups.  I gather that there is a large convoy coming with food and water.  There seems to be talk of possible evacuation.   I know in my heart that wherever the convoy is, my son is sure to be there as well, but people have been known to provide purposely misleading information so that they can corner you and kill you for whatever supplies you may have.   I listen carefully to discern the truth between the lies and deception.  Portions of groups begin to leave the area, headed in different directions.  I try to view the movements as a whole and figure out where the majority of the more trustworthy people are moving.  I notice my group has started to panic and fight with each other.  I motion to those I trust to follow me and we slip away from them and start to walk briskly in the direction I think the convoy must be.

It is dusk.  The air is full of hazy smoke and irregular lighting from battery-powered industrial lighting, like those you might see at a remote work site.  Ahead of me there are two rows of tall buildings and in the middle, to the left of me is an elevated roadway that is littered with the remnants of crumbled buildings and burnt-out cars. There are throngs of people moving along this roadway and between the buildings ahead.  The people from my group that I have brought with me are 30 to 40 paces ahead of me.  In my periphery to the right there is a dark-skinned woman walking at the same speed as me. We begin to pick up our pace as we realize we’ve fallen behind the wave of people moving in the same direction we are. 

With our next step we find no ground below us.  I can see for just a split-second that we are falling on to what appears to be the roof of a building, even though the buildings surrounding us are at least 30 to 40 stories high.  I land with a thud onto my stomach, but I feel almost nothing.  I look to the girl to my right, and she’s landed on her feet, and is about 5 feet higher than where I have fallen.  She is panicking, shouting for help, as we’re now stranded on this bizarre island created by a building that has sunk almost all the way into the ground.  I can feel the cold metal of an air conditioning unit under my body.  I shout to the woman to remain calm and try to come towards me so we can get off this building.  The elevated road is 20 to 30 feet above us to the left, connected to the ‘island’ we are on by a small bridge of twisted rebar and concrete tangled in the roots of a large oak tree.  A woman with long brown hair notices us and runs over.  I ask her to please help the woman to the right, as I can get up just fine. THe dark-skinned woman keeps shouting, yelling my name in a shrill, panicked manner, and more people start running towards us to help.  As they lift me, I am overwhelmed with immeasurable pain. I scream and black out, my last memory being the dark skinned woman stroking my face gently and assuring me that we will find my son and everything will be okay.

When I come to, I’m being shuffled through a very large hall full of industrial-style school cafeteria chairs, the type with steel legs and melamine seat and back.  There are so many chairs and tables in this cavernous room that you can barely move between them.  When we enter, the room is nearly empty; by the time I’m settled into the chair, there are more people than I have ever seen in my life.  There is a constant din of chatter and moans filling my ears.  I feel no pain, and I am irritated that I am made to sit still when all I want to do is lead my people to the convoy so I can save them and find my son.  A doctor sits in front of me and regards me with a dis-compassionate and grim expression.  He has on a dirty lab coat, old, blood-stained surgical gloves, and a grimy surgical mask pushed below his mouth.  Several young men, dressed the same as the doctor, begin to surround me.  The doctor is speaking to me and I am arguing with him, insisting that I have sustained no injuries and that I need to lead my group to safety, that I need to find my son.  One of the the young men lifts my legs onto a chair across from me, and I am startled to find that while I can see him moving my legs, I cannot feel it.  There are now 10 of these medical-type young men surrounding me and the doctor.  It seems the attention of the entire space is upon me.  Two of the men – medical students, the doctor says- reach for my right thigh.  I look down and am flabbergasted to find that my leg has been severed nearly completely from the top of the crux where my thigh meets my hip to the bottom of my buttocks.  I can see the bone, the muscles, the blood vessels.  I am not bleeding, and I feel nothing.  I am furious to have sustained such an injury, and I don’t understand why I’ve been put in a sitting position with such a serious injury.

The doctor begins to give the medical students instructions to prepare me for surgery. Their filthy gloved hands move towards me, snaking into my pants and my underwear to remove them.  They are touching my wound, and one hand is cupping my vagina.  I become enraged that I am being touched with dirty gloves with such a serious injury.  I shout at the doctor that his assistants haven’t even washed their hands, and that I want them to wear clean gloves and I want him, the doctor, to do the surgery, not the medical assistants.  He regards me sternly, and then assuages my concerns by admonishing his assistants and sends them to wash their hands and find clean gloves.  I tell him I will take care of removing my clothing myself, and that my privates don’t need to be touched in that manner. I undress from the waist down, and in doing so my leg keeps separating from my body, hinged by the only piece of flesh still connecting it to my buttocks.  The inside of my leg is so vivid I admire it’s lovely, albeit gruesome beauty.

Ever since I can remember, the majority of my dreams at night take place in the same spaces. As of right now, there are two ""cities"" or ""worlds"" that I go to at night. There used to be more, but I've stopped going to certain places. I travel around them, going about every day duties, though most times with a dream-like twist (mostly involving hiding from someone/something, or running away). I've even gone to school there. I have literally grown up with these places; one store I used to go to a lot changed the decor as I got older, the miniature toys in the front counter changed, and the place got a bit dustier. About a year and a half ago, I stopped going there. I'm not sure why. 

When I was very young, about 5 or 6 years old, most of these places were going through a war, or a holocaust, or something else terrible. I've survived everything from being hunted by anything from men with guns or having missles shot at me, to a demon stalking me outside a movie theater. Yet somehow, I keep going back. They've calmed down in the last few years. No wars, just the after effects of wars, and everyone in the cities have gotten back to normal. The racial makeup of the places has changed since then, too.

Another thing I should mention is the mall. One of the cities has a mall that I'm pretty sure is a layout of my own mind. I only go there every once in a while, and I start either outside the back entrance or on the main level. I then travel through the mall, stopping into various stores and perusing their wares. The people who work there know me, but they are sort of like shells of people. They only serve to help me through the mall. They help me shop, but I never buy anything. They give me directions to where I should go next. I always avoid the lower levels; they are always dark, and the few times I ventured down there, it was terrifying. The stores are open there, but dark. There are things hiding down there. 

I am thinking about trying to lucid dream to study my surroundings more, but I'm afraid doing that will ruin everything. I don't want to control the dreams, I just want to be more aware of where exactly they are. I love the place I've gone to most lately. I didn't so much in the years before this, but lately, it's been my home away from home. I find myself wanting to stay there after waking up, and maybe if I learn to lucid dream, I can stay there longer.

Here are our stories.,10,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/vmj93/i_have_shared_multiple_dreams_with_the_same/,"*Quick note. I put this post up on /r/LucidDreaming and it did well, however, it was removed as it wasn't about Lucid Dreaming and more of an anecdote. Many people suggested I throw it up here, so that's what I'm doing*

I've shared multiple dreams with someone very close to me. We even passed information to each other THROUGH a dream. It sounds impossible but it happened. Here goes:

Ever since I've known this person, we've always clicked. From the day we met at high school fourteen or fifteen years ago, to this very day. We were best friends and even dated a time or two but we were never intimate. We never shared a bed and the only time we slept next to each other was during a 6 hour bus-ride to Pittsburgh. Regardless of whether we were ""just friends"" or ""more than friends"", we have always been connected. We just know what the other felt, what they were thinking, etc. [This also made any fight we had all the more painful, since we could see the others secrets' and supposedly hidden insecurities.]

The first shared dream came in my junior year of high school (her senior year). Prom was approaching and we were going together, so one night, we both dreamed that my best (male) friend interrupted us slow-dancing and said how she was HIS girl and we then fought over her. It was especially weird since my friend never had feelings for her (they hardly even talked) but I guess the concept of ""what is the most awkward thing that could happen to us"" weighed heavily on our minds.

After our first year of college (I graduated early) she had to move to Florida (we were in Virginia at the time). We weren't dating then, but she was dating someone else and I had feelings for her but wasn't brave enough to speak my mind. So, being young, stupid and jealous the entire time, we had a huge fight before she left and we didn't speak for six or seven years.

Here is where the story gets interesting, in 2009, while returning from lunch, I just got this feeling that we needed to patch things up. I doubted we would ever be friends, yet alone best friends but for the sake of being a mature adult (something that is still quite difficult to master), I figured that we should bury the hatchet and turns out that we soon picked up to being as close as we had been back when we were friends and could literally read each others minds.

Within a week of talking again, we shared a dream. We were back in the house where I grew up, on the old couch I had, watching our favorite TV show, Rurouni Kenshin [yeah, we were anime nerds], and we were even watching the same episode. We laid on the couch with myself on the inside, her on the outside. After the episode, we went to the porch to talk to each other about how happy that ""we"" were back.

Back in reality, when we told the other the dream, we both flipped out. This is because she was married and I was the forever-alone bachelor. While we didn't feel anything for each other, it was still a very scary downright creepy concept given the situation.

However, being the ever-so curious people we were as well as our ever-growing curiosity of our 'connection', we wanted to take it one step further. We wanted to see if we could talk to the other while IN the dream. If anything, that would confirm any doubts we would ever have about the connection. To do this, we would have to think of a phrase...any phrase...as long as the other wouldn't know what it was, or even GUESS what it was. It could be a random string of words, letters or numbers, a phrase from a movie the other never saw (but wouldn't be well-known), etc.

It did not happen immediately but I had a dream where she told me what the phrase was (a song lyric from a band I never listened to and I never listened to anything except ESPN radio at the time) and several days later she had a dream where I texted her my phrase, which was nothing but a string of random words.

While it wasn't within the same dream, or even the same week, we were able to do it. Although, given our situations, we have not really tested those waters and we have just conceded that connection certainly exists, we just aren't aware of its origin or purpose (unless it's just that we exist as best friends). We just sit back and joke how [Ka is a wheel and all things serve the beam.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_%28series%29)

There are more stories/examples of this connection, many ""little things that add up"" but as they aren't dream related, I won't bore you but I do hope you guys enjoyed it.

*I would like to add to that while I do believe what happened, I am not trying to convince anyone of this, nor am I submitting this as ""proof"" as astral-projection or psychics existing. At this stage, it's just an anecdote that I thought people would enjoy. Our lives and situations are a bit too stressful right now to consistently try something like this but if the day ever comes where we are comfortable with attempting this again, we will certainly make another post.

For starters, I'm deathly afraid of the concept of ghosts/possession/the paranormal. I was one of the people that almost needed therapy after seeing Paranormal Activity (I used to be a horror movie fanatic, but that movie messed me up entirely [I know it's fake, but it made me realise how scared I really am of that concept]). 

So, the dream: I got a new job in the mall, along with a bunch of other kids my age. I worked in a café/merch place and I was one of the people that would display the merch and make it nice and sell it. Everything was fine, and I was getting along with everyone. Then, my boss says she has an orientation video for us to watch. It was called, ""Take"". So, she puts it in, the lights go out, and it's a fucked up video spliced with images of gutted people, and animals possessing each other, seizing (in the style of an exorcism), and committing suicide, filmed in the style of Paranormal Activity. The filming style was identical to that of a scene in the movie where a character is tripping on something, and you're seeing things from their point of view.

My dream self tried to look away, but I could see the video, even with my hands over my eyes. Then, I look around the room that I'm sitting in, and everyone has killed each other. 

I woke up about 5 minutes ago, scared to shit. I'm afraid of my own dog at the moment, as she jumped up on my bed promptly after my dream ended, and I screamed. I don't know what caused me to have that dream, but it's 7am, and I'm shaking. I haven't had a nightmare like that since I saw Paranormal Activity.

1340266126.0,7,self.Dreams,vdgb1,[Dream Library] You meet the love of your life or a romantic partner in a dream. What does it mean?,10,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/vdgb1/dream_library_you_meet_the_love_of_your_life_or_a/,"One of the more common topics for dreams discussed at /r/dreams is meeting someone you fall in love with instantly. You know right away that something is special about the person. There's chemistry, attraction, affection, passion. And the reason why you're so attracted is the person is an opposite sex version of yourself, basically.

Beneath your personality is a sub-personality of the opposite sex. Dr. Carl Jung called it anima in men, animus in women. It's everything associated with the opposite sex that is unconscious in yourself, below the surface of your awareness.

Anima in men teaches them to be sensitive and nurturing. She inspires and is a powerful source of creativity. But if the relationship is contentious, she'll be a nagging, judgmental presence who makes men moody.

Animus in women teaches them to be independent and strong. He helps her work out her values and stick to her guns. But when the relationship is out of whack she'll be sarcastic and bitter.

It's a simplified example -- the relationship with this part of your psyche can be just as deep and challenging as waking life relationships. The ultimate goal of the relationship is union between the conscious and unconscious sides of the mind. Some call it the ""marriage of the soul."" The process starts after the shadow side of the psyche has been tamed, so the deep work doesn't usually occur until later in life. However, anima or animus often first appear during early adolescence, and can be central figures in thousands of dreams over the course of a lifetime.

Here's a great [discussion about anima](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/os99p/another_dream_about_a_girl_not_the_first_and/).

But I did find a really [fascinating post from a female learning about her sexuality.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/jbhpr/the_bears_they_can_smell_it/) The dream is epic, and the comments are engaging and insightful.

They tell me how they have been trying to sneak into this farm. get attacked by a yeti thing, i kill the yeti with a sniper rifle i somehow obtained between meeting the kids and that point of the memory, apparently these yeti things are mutants. learn that there has been a nuclear holocaust from the kids.  

go to the farm the kids referred to, the own is a man and woman, they take us in, there are many children from 4 to 16, including the mans son.   TV is playing, everything seems normal and happy there is news broadcasting, i am relieved, i go to the bathroom, the house has running water and food, I exit the bathroom.   
 
 
I speak with the woman, and ask her about the news, she informs me that the TV repeats every 3 days, there are no updates on the still functional internet there.   
 
 
I tend the field with the children and here things like ""the Russians had found their red god"" on the repeating news channels and what not, the man of the house takes me his son and another young girl 16 or 17 into the city.   has to be the future the cars have 1 front wheel and 2 back wheels and some sort of     square device underneath the center of the car to do balancing or maybe it picks up bacteria for gas, I’m not sure. 
 

gang of 3 bikers closes us in, man does evasive maneuvering but it doesn't do anything, than this probe flying in the sky starts launching lights at people and it sucks them up, the people in the car yelled ""(*@#$&amp;%^ probes are sending people do the moon station"" I don’t know what that means.   We drove around a bunch of other cars that were getting sucked up, and flew off the exit. into a part of the city close to the store we were going to.
 
 
there were a lot of weird things like an ectoplasm person blob just crawling along the floor and a lot of punk looking people, we went to the store, it was a small convenience store no larger than a kitchen that made use of the front entrance and had the checkout desk next to the front entrance. we walked inside and everyone grabbed things, there were coolers with drinks and stuff on all sides, the store clerk asked if i would grab him some beer that i cant remember but it exists today.   there was a small stand in the center that had cheezits and other assorted snacks, and the cooler on the pavement had fresh looking sandwiches in them. I asked the clerk as the man who i started growing close to was paying for everything if they were able to do things like get the cheezit factory back up and running.   he told me he had it up and running and something was difficult, or maybe it was difficult to find i don’t remember.
 
 
After that the man and i started growing close and fond of each other.  I learned that everyone in Russia hated the Americans and i hate to keep my identity a secret.  
 
 
the man and his wife learned that his wife's mother had died in the holocaust, she was upset, he asked me to leave him be with her and go tend to the field with the children, i did ask he asked. Then later i talked to the man and he affirmed that he knew i was an American but it did not matter to him, I felt very loved.
 
 
there is a gap, next a giant dragon creature appeared and attacked the kids, i shot it and followed it, aiming to kill it.   it was not large maybe 4 feet tall, and i chased it down a hill where it suddenly grew large, up to 20 feet tall.   I had to dodge some of its attacks and climb up on it and bash it in the face with the butt of my gun, it shrunk again and i shot it in the head.
 
 
The man came down the hill on a horse to see if i was alright than all of the sudden all these pelican/banshee looking things (halo/sc2 respectively) swooped in, like police cars and what not, the man was about 20 feet away from me. he put his hands up and they started yelling at him and held a gun on him, than one of the men shot him in the throat. The man fell to his knees and yelled at me with the last of his air ""Take my gun! Run!""
 
 
I think the kid who shot him made a mistake, they could have easily killed me when i ran over and grabbed the revolver he had and ran. There is another gap, I was at the farm again, telling his wife that he had died.   She was very upset and told me the man had thought of me as a soon, and had always known i was an American and did not say anything because i reminded him of himself. the mans son was upset, but he stood up to take over the farm and lead everything.
 
 
another gap, i found myself driving in the city and entered a new part where i had to give my papers for registration and got a section card after that was all completed essentially at a toll both on the road. I went to the closest store and looked through the goods in the store, it was much larger and had many more people. Someone was commenting on how it was going to be another year before politics sorted everything out and got the country up and running again, and at that moment I felt a sudden pang and missing for the man and wondered about my family in America which was most certainly dead in all probability.

They were all standing around talking and I noticed the bully has writing on his forehead but I couldn’t tell what it said. All of a sudden one of the other guys pulls a .44 and shot the bully in the face killing him instantly and the writing on his forehead changed to ""Don’t Blink""",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_r0phu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/r0phu/dont_blink/,

Really vivid and intense dreams. And I remember things that happened in the last one. 

This month was really weird because each time I woke up and fell back asleep, the dream would pick up where it left off.

Basically it starts out that I miss the initial OMG ZOMBIES RUN and I've made my grandmother's house a safe haven. I start out with 2 older black women, one who treats me like a grand daughter and the other who treats me like shit. People keep coming to the door and I decide who gets lets in. I let my friend Josh in, an old class mate in, a few co workers in and some weird old white guy who claims to know how to defeat them. I wake up.

After falling asleep, most of the people I let in are in the kitchen. We need to throw the trash out but I don't want anyone to go outside. I say we throw it out the windows.  Instead a few co workers open the back door and start calmly putting bags into the cans. I'm flipping out. I run to all the doors and check the locks. The old lady that treats me like shit has unlocked them all. When I lock all the doors I go back to the kitchen and find that my co workers not only got rid of all the trash, they found fresh green onions and noodles (What?). I shut the back door and lock it and I see a big caravan of ""circus freaks"" (for some reason I call them this, but they're mostly just goth kids). They notice my house and oddly enough, my old produce manager, dressed as Superman, comes up and asks to talk. There's way too many of them to fit in my house so I ask if they have my dad. (My dad is in the kitchen...?) Manager says no. I ask if they have my boyfriend. He begins to turn away and I tell him to wait. I get my shoes and tell everyone to be safe, lock the doors. I wake up just as I approach my dad for a dramatic good-bye.

I fall back asleep and it's way into the future. I'm in a different house and the only other resident is a fat black lady I call Mama (which is weird because only my dad is black). She has really nice jewellery. Apparently the Zombie Apocalypse is almost over because I'm not so worried anymore. Three goth girls come up to our door and demand to use our bathroom. Mama says no and they get into a fight. Then I heard two loud thumps (turns out my brother was waking up) and I tell Mama in a serious voice that we have to go. She drops her necklaces and I pick a couple up. We run out the door and I see a zombie at the corner of my eye. We split up while looking for my car. I weave through yards and come back towards our house. I finally find my car (once a Ford Focus, now an old RX 7?) I open the car door and finally wake up.

I'm getting drunk. They have this GIANT theater in their house, and the whole thing feels as if its inside a tree. That is a weird description but that's my best description. They have fucking kittens all over their house too. They kept  attaching themselves to my legs and I ended up walking around covered in them. I had to piss really badly so I went to the bathroom. It was so tiny, had a window though. Probably about 2ft by 2ft. Maybe a little bigger. Dont ask me how everything fit in there because it did in my brain lol.  I had a bag of clothes because I was still in my work uniform. I wanted to change after peeing but I took off my shirt and hit the soap dispenser by accident and soap just pours all over my chest. There's knocking at the door and stuff. So I get cleaned up somewhat. I leave. I'm drunk and everyone is fighting at the party, I dont get along with anyone. Some people show up blasting  some good music (none of this lil wayne crap) and I'm pumped. For some reason though- I leave right after they arrive.

I head to my school (college) for something, like to clean off the soap or something. I'm walking to my room (it feels like some futuristic version of my school though, with parking garages and stuff.)... (dunno how that makes it futuristic though)......

There's sirens and I see cops freaking out. They run past me yelling into their talkies ""The person with... the bag is across campus. Move move!"" So I'm just like wtf and keep walking towards my building.  I stop and talk to someone from class about nothing much.  Suddenly I hear gunshits and its a machine gun or something. I hear someone yelling ""they're in the tank! they're in the tank!"" I turn to run but look back and there's what looks like a highly armored Jeep with something like a .50 Cal on top. Its sweeping bullets back and forth as it drives down the road. I cant make it to my class in time so I lay flat on the ground praying the gun is aimed higher up. The bullets shatter through the 2nd floor dorm buildings and I'm in a panic but relief at being alive still.  I get up when they pass and start running towards my building again, hoping to make it. 



The armored Jeep comes down the road again in front of my building. Sweeping fire as before. I lay on the ground but they must have spotted me before and they aim low. I feel about 8 bullets hit me. My friend I talked to briefly before comes running yelling and crying. In my dream the bullets didn't hurt only the first 2. In my head I decided I was paralyzed once one hit my spine. I thought of what I would say to the friend as my last words. Thought of if I should tell them all the stuff I had thought about them but never said. I had blood pouring out of my mouth, I could taste it. The ground grew very warm from my blood as well..Decided just to die. 



The feeling of the bullets was so strange. I always feel stuff in dreams - things feel so real. It was as if I was made of putty and someone was just nailing bullets into me.

Since I don't like dogs, I engaged in a fistfight with the dog (well, the dog wasn't using his fists, of course), and during that fight (I beat him up pretty bad!) I woke up. 

Fast forward some time, I have a dream where I'm all alone on a beautiful mountain. It's my birthday in the dream, so I start singing the happy birthday song (no idea why I would do that, I hate that song).

So of course that singing causes a mountain lion to appear, and although I do like mountain lions, I had to fight it since it attacked me. And since it was I mountain lion, I had a hard time defeating it, and it fatally wounded me which caused me to wake up. 

So yesterday, I dreamt of an animal attack again, but this time it was a grizzly bear. Ran straight at me, and I prepared to defend myself, but I woke up before it hit me. 

Although my dreams are pretty weird in general, this case seems off since it's a recurring theme in multiple dreams, which never happened before. Also, the animals get stronger every time one appears, and I wonder what will be next? 

A friend suggested it might be a velociraptor, and now I'm not sure if I should be scared or looking forward to it since velociraptors are both deadly and freaking awesome.

Anyway, any suggestions what my subconsciousness might be telling me?

I woke up on a pirate ship. There were two pirates there who seemed as surprised to see me as I was to see them. I couldn't remember who I was, or anything prior to waking up. I told the pirates that, and they were suspicious of me but gave me a new identity and I became one of them.  
We landed on an island to trade (I think) and all were stopped by the police and asked for identification. They provided it, I told the cop that I'd left my identification on the boat, but I told him my new name, and that it was a new identity because I didn't know who I was. He said the name sounded made up. I told him it was made up - we didn't know who I was so a new name was made up for me. He laughed and left us alone.  

We continued to walk along the beach, and I suddenly felt deja vu. I stopped the pirates and told them that ""I'd seen this film before"", and we needed to leave the town because we were going to be set up. They asked what happened in the film, I said we were found guilty but escaped. They said if we were found guilty we'd be killed, so it must be bullshit. Just then, three boats on the horizon were on fire, and we all realised we had been setup.  

Rather than go through town and get caught (the action I remembered from the last time I ""saw this film""), we went the other way to escape. Our boat was gone, so we ran up a hill to a canal. (The hill was a hill from outside the house I grew up in, but there's no canal at the top, just a road). At the top of the hill was a canal boat. The other pirates told me it was too slow, but I said we had no choice, so we commandeered it.  

At this point, the dream split into two endings (as I find dreams often do). Firstly, we were all caught and hanged. Someone had replaced the hanging rope with something elastic so it only appeared that we were dead, then we cut loose, jumped into the sea, and swam to our escape.  

Then suddenly it was back to the other ending where we weren't caught, and were on the canal boat. We took it out to sea (don't ask me how), and used it to climb aboard a better boat which we used to escape. We then took the people we'd stolen the boat off (I'm not sure which boat). They were old people, 2 or 3 (I'm not sure), one was a man. We threw them out to sea, and left them in freezing cold water with sharks circling them. We told them they'd be dead in ten minutes, but don't worry because the other boats (our pursuers) were less than 5 minutes behind us and would rescue them. That's where the dream ended.

We were both into it, and both of us were very good. Just like that. After that, another time gap. Persumably well after GIRL and I finish making out, FRIEND1, FRIEND2, FRIEND2's SISTER, FRIEND3 and I are playing some game that was a top-down view. My vision is only of my character in third-person from a top-down perspective. We're getting swarmed and my character (at this point our characters and us are synonymous) starts dragon shouting. Me and one of the FRIENDs breaks off and dragon shouts away from the group, eventually getting us deserted. The group calls for our aid and we dragon shout back. That's where the dream ends. What does reddit think?

Been a lurker for awhile, but this strange dream-induced occurrence from a few nights ago had me laughing so hard, so I figured I would share. 

I don't remember much about the dream other than seeing some source code (I'm a computer programmer in real life) and a friend randomly telling me something.

The part from the dream that sticks out the most though, was there was an eye that was floating around the room. For whatever reason, the existence of this eye was pissing me off. Not just a normal annoyance, I mean hardcore rage pissing me off. 

Something caused me to wake up, and as I was coming to, I saw a small splotch of white. Thinking it was that eye from my dream, I yelled ""FUCK YOU!""  SUPER loud. 

Right after this, it was in my head that someone had asked me what I was swearing about, and my response to that was ""That damn floating eye!"" 

When I got to the point where I was fully awake, I couldn't stop laughing thinking about what someone's confused reaction would have been had I told them I was yelling about ""That damn floating eye."" and the fact that I woke up and screamed ""FUCK YOU."" 

It got to the point where I was laughing so hard, I had to get up and surf the net for a bit to calm down.

I wake up around 8:00 at night, go to work, read and post on reddit all night long, maybe watch a few vids, go home, sleep during the day, wash rinse repeat.  So this was a dream I had this afternoon while sleeping.

It all opened up with me being aware of past history that had not yet actually happened.  So a fleshed out world in a way.  I was being held prisoner at my workplace in a car of some sort, or rather, just released from being a prisoner.  American society had collapsed.  There was no traffic on the road in front of the call center.  Some sort of disaster had happened.  I'm not sure what, but there had been a lot of people who died in the previous years.  Maybe a plague or a small meteor strike, something just enough to disrupt everything.  I was sitting outside with some friends in the driveway by the road in folding chairs, and it was a relatively warm spring day.  It was a bit hazy from dust in the air, so the air had a bit of an orange tint.

We were all sitting around talking about stuff and things.  The conversation turned to a wistful sort of remembrance of humanity as it used to be.  I looked up at the sky and I could see the moon, and it looked like a map of the world.  We started talking about human migrations, where we had come from, how we got here.  There was a sort of ""haha, guess that shit's all over now"" feel to it.  I could see the human migration paths looking up at the moon.  I remember pointing to the moon and saying, ""There's one place we won't be migrating to any time soon.""

Then I became aware of some more prisoners that had just gotten released from inside the building.  Captain Picard was there.  Just there, nothing really significant, he and a few people were off in a conference room somewhere.  Then it was back to us outside.  Once again shooting the shit, talking about computer models that we used to sell, known issues, that sort of thing.  ""Hey, remember that optiplex with the graphics issues from nVidia.""  ""Yeah, I did so many reinstalls trying to figure that issue out, replaced cards, and the whole thing was a driver issue.""  I then noticed a friend walking up the street, and I became him.

Now, Dell is near an airport, and the road outside dips down and tunnels under one of the runways, and there's a limestone cliff of sorts that gets created on either side of the road as it dips.  As I walked up the road as my friend, I saw my brother (in real life, I have no siblings, but he does).  We were walking past Dell, and he point to the cliff side and said, ""That's where I had to bury mom, in that ditch there.""  He pointed to a picture of her imbedded in the cliff side, and said that there was a wifi hotspot there with a message broadcasting her information, and that we should tidy it up.  I said no, leave her, one day archaeologists will find the site and take care of things (in real life, I used to be an archaeologist).  We continued to walk along, and we stopped by my old workplace.  Management had declared they were opening the site back up again.  To celebrate the return of limited electricity and water the were serving sheetcake and lemonade in the cafeteria.  We stopped by after walking by display cases filled with Occupy memorabilia, and the whole thing was lamer than it usually was.  Watered down lemonade, really bad vanilla cake, usual sort of bad food fare that they serve to show you how much they really care.  We laughed, said screw that, and headed out of there.  

Sometime during all of that it ceased being me being my friend and his brother and became me and him.  We ended up grabbing knapsacks and headed out towards town in search of supplies.  We cut through a neighborhood that had started to become heavily overgrown due to neglect.  We talked about old days, and I mentioned how I used to go everywhere with my book bag.  During my old university days I'd cart groceries home from the store on my back.  (In real life there's a grocery store nearby and I'll still do this, just walk to it, get what I need and come home with food and supplies on my back.)  We finally made it to downtown where we stopped by some small shop.  They had a little of everything for sale, but pretty much had been picked over.  There was one shelf with some bottles of alcohol on it.  I immediately grabbed the last bottle of whiskey, but before I could get a top shelf bottle of rum, somebody else grabbed it.  We rummaged through some clothing and other junk.  Electricity was working here, as were debit cards.  We paid, and I remember saying ""The banks can have whatever money is left in my account.  They won, they got it all, and now it's worthless.""  I felt ok about it, because we were still surviving.  We started to go towards the farmers market to pickup some produce and meat.  At that time my wife came into the room and woke me up, and everything ended.

Normally I don't have such vivid or intense dreams.  It may happen once or twice a year, if that.  There's some pretty obvious stuff there, getting released from the prisons of corporations and cars and modern life.  The fluidity of becoming my friend while still me and then fully me again was a bit weird.  And I enjoyed the idea of the banks winning a very hollow victory.  They got all of nothing, and society crept along.

I steal a cup of 7up (as I used to do) but I was the only one in the cafeteria, which made me feel even worse about stealing it for some reason.  

It was time for class, so I went outside and saw that the academic building was at the bottom of the steepest hill I've ever seen.  All of a sudden I'm sitting in class watching the end of a movie.  Everyone files out and I get walk a few steps before realizing that I left my jacket in the classroom.

I go back into the classroom to find it dark, the screen is flickering even though there is no movie playing.  After finding the spot where I was sitting, I kneel down and feel something tear near my crotch.  My jacket is nowhere to be found so I leave.

In my dorm room (which looks like a soviet bloc style apartment complex--see Modern Warfare 1), I end up taking of my pants to find that the head of my penis has caved in--like it was made of porceline and a piece of it broke off.  Naturally, I decide to go to health services immediately.

I never make it to health services.  Next thing I know, I'm standing on a ridge in the country (Hudson Valley style) next to a road that winds down a steep hill.  It's raining and a car whizzes pass me.  Somehow I feel sure that I know the driver.  All of a sudden, my perspective shifts so that my POV was as if I were perched on the hood of the car (like a steadicam shot).  

I stay with the car as it rushes down the hill.  When it gets to the bottom I wake up and immediately check my penis.  I've never felt so relieved.

I dont really dream at night, or if i do i dont remember much of it. anyway, lately i started this healthy eating phase of my life and instead of soda and water i started drinking coco-nut water. Naturally I tried all the brands that were available around my house and at first i tried Vita, Zico and Naked brands (they were ok, but didnt like the taste that much so didnt drink much of it.)
then i tried Amy&amp;Brian and C2O. They were so delicious that i was in love, specially with C2O. My fridge was filled up with C2O and i was drinking about 2 18oz cans a day one usually before i go to bed. (cotton mouth hehehe). Suddenly i noticed i was dreaming like crazy! so vivid, so long and intertwined i was astonished.
so, i stopped drinking for 2 days (ran out) and my dreams went away and it was back to normal. Started drinking C2O again and BAM!!!! Dream city!
i told my cousin this and he said ""dude.. i never dream, ever! very rare) and i thought to myself ""perfect candidate"" i told him about the theory and he was game to test it out. had him drink half a can with me at my house and told him to DOWN one more can (1.5 all together) before you go to sleep!
next day i get a text: ""crazy dreams son! no idea wtf, but it was weird""
so now im here. Asking fellow redditors to try it and see if there is any validity to my findings.

We're greeted by a woman who works at the resort. She guides us to the resort, which is a rather long hike away. During the walk, I can't contain my elation at the natural beauty of this place. There's strange, beautiful birdsong everywhere we go. I see turtles whose shells are so brightly coloured they look like they're encrusted with jewels. I gasp when we walk past a toad the size of a cocker spaniel.

I tell our guide that I've never been to anywhere tropical, which is why I'm gawking at every vine and bug and tree. She empathises, and tells me she used to be a teacher, but decided to move to the resort permanently and work as a bartender.

When we get to the resort, we're offered a variety of sustainable tropical desserts. I order a flan smothered in all kinds of berries that I've never seen before in my life. I'm so, so, happy. This is the vacation I've dreamed of since I was a little kid.

We were a village, or an outpost or something, on the edge of a vast plain, nearly featureless.  As a test or a challenge, we (a friend or classmate, maybe, and I) went into the elf hill under the plain.  It wasn't what we expected.  Picture an enormous stone basin filled with oddities-- strangely regular outcrops, plants, birds, bugs, and *people*, some of whom were more as creatures.  Some would have killed us, but when we were caught, instead we were marked, or adopted.  ""One little kiss, and now you're a brownie.""  To them, it was a game, but we couldn't leave.

I wandered, lost around the maze, until my adopter? captor? pulled me deeper into the hill.  I was shown things I hadn't seen walking by myself.  There was an amphitheater where they played a game that was like baseball, except the bases moved and floated, and it wasn't anything like baseball.

Later, I found myself near the place where I had entered the hill.  There, I saw another person from above ground, someone I had known before.  Again, I tried to run and hide, but he caught me, and took me from the earth, brought me back outside.  It was different.

The first thing I saw were my former peers, in uniform practicing weapons.  The weapons were strange to me, like leaf blowers that could force a man to his knees or send him flying back.  ""And they say these are for defense!""  The man who caught me, who knew me, took me to a building I did not know.  It was like an office built all of concrete and rebar and wire.  There, another man (who might have been my teacher, or leader, or whatever) asked me questions about the hill.  I could not answer them.  Instead, I offered him information about one of the hill-folk who was known to me.

When I was let go, I was free to roam the camp.  This time, it was more like a tent city away from the plain, with a barracks and administrative buildings nearer it.  Another friend whom I had known took me deep into the heart of the tents and shacks, and we sat with those who had been elders when I left, but were now left to sit, huddled in the cold and the dark, like memories.  These things were all strange to me, the children, the ancients, the twisting, winding paths between the tents.  My companion asked me questions, but I was numb, and could no more answer those than the previous.

After a time, they took me to the edge of town, out of pity I think.  They took me to see the plain.  A pair of foxes played upon it, and I ran for the hill beneath it.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_lm562,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/lm562/i_was_the_changeling/,
1319088919.0,8,self.Dreams,liexk,The eye lamp,8,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/liexk/the_eye_lamp/,"I used to have dreams that would consist of a series of smaller dreams.  I'd start in one place, perhaps with a few people I knew, and I'd be going through whatever crazy or mundane scenario my brain cooked up.  People would drop in and out as the dream progressed, locations would shift without warning, and occasionally the overarching goal of the dream situation would vanish entirely and be replaced by something else.  I was used to this; it was generally relaxing and entertaining, though a bit odd.  

One night, when I was about 6 years old, I was dreaming that I was at my church's youth program, hanging out in the room that my mom taught in, and admiring an elaborate water-powered setup sitting on the floor.  This thing was about the size of a desk top, and it was composed of all sorts of wheels and streams and rods that kept the flow moving constantly.  I was always fascinated by Rube Goldberg machines, and I stood there in the dream, gazing at the device.  

Slowly, the clamor of the kids and leaders faded around me, and the bright room turned to cool darkness.  I could still hear the trickle of the water, but now the image before me was a ghost of the water device, oddly displayed as a reflection on a car window.  Something clicked in my mind, that this wasn't right and there should be no car window in front of me.  I broke my focus on the device and looked around, the water sound ceasing entirely.  

I was standing between two cars, alone, in a dark parking lot.  It was night, and there was little moonlight.  The lot was full of cars but there was not a living soul in sight.  

Since I was used to seeing dreams shift before my eyes, I immediately rationalized the change in setting.  Perhaps I'd gone out to the car early, and my mom and brother would catch up momentarily.  Turning around, I saw that I was indeed standing next to my family's black '97 Taurus, so I figured everything was fine.  Satisfied with the circumstances, I looked around again.  

Off in the distance, far beyond the limited sight range in the darkness, there was a small pinpoint of light.  Curious, I stared at it.  It did not move like car headlights or a flashlight; it remained in place.  As I watched, it began to grow brighter.  I was a bit surprised by this, but I didn't see any reason to fear.  At least not yet.  But as the strange light grew in intensity, it began to take shape.  It was an oblong shape, with points at each side and a dark spot in the center.  It looked exactly like a single human eye, unblinking as it glowed at me.  My vision grew sharper as I forced myself to ""zoom in"" on the eye.  What I saw sent my heart into my throat.  

The eye light was mounted on a post.  Sitting below the post, hand on the brightness knob, was a man in a chair.  His eyes looked like the lamp - hard, unfriendly eyes.  He was looking directly at me; there was no doubt.  And somehow I knew he meant me harm.  Without breaking eye contact or even flinching, the creepy lounger spun the knob back, and the eye lamp turned off.  

If I had known the phrase, I'd have said ""Oh shit"".  I looked around frantically for the direction that would take me to whatever building was next to the lot - the place my family must have been.  But all four sides of the lot were bordered only by pitch black.  I was truly alone in the middle of nowhere.  With rising fear, I looked back toward where I'd seen the eye lamp.  

There was no more lamp.  There was only a shadowy figure, head hunched down, rushing across the lot toward me.  

Now I was in full panic.  Knowing that there was nowhere to run, and the dream was working against me, I yanked open the back door of the Taurus and dove inside, slamming the door behind me.  Another glance out the windshield showed that the shadowy runner had traversed the entire lot in seconds and was hustling towards the driver's door.  In fear-paralyzed slow motion, I shot a hand toward the power lock switch, and in the same instant the runner's hand flew at the outside door handle.  Time slowed to a crawl as my brain screamed at my arm to move faster.  Judging the distances and speeds of both our hands, I knew he'd get there first.  And in a flash of practicality, I decided I wasn't going to stick around and find out what the shadow of the eye wanted with me.  

I blinked, vigorously and repeatedly.  The dream world shattered in a roar, and I awoke in my dark bedroom, wide-eyed, blinking furiously.

Here's the (slightly edited for clarity) text of my post:

This sounds really crazy so I made a throwaway to avoid my RL redditor friends. I don't care if you don't believe me, but here are the facts: For years, I'd go through periods where when I was trying to fall asleep I'd see a bunch of faces when I closed my eyes. They were all angry faces, very angry and menacing. They'd come towards me then kind of fade off to the sides, two rows, one on each side. Sometimes it was just angry eyes. Human, animal, cartoon - all very angry. It took a long time to realize that when I saw these faces, it meant I was about to dream about a place I actually really liked. The place only existed in my dreams but it was like an alternate universe for me. I had memories of that place like anyone does about their childhood, but it didn't exist. It was more than just a recurring dream. Those dreams were always very lucid.

I don't want to expand on the dream place because I'm trying to get back there again and I don't want to ruin my chances. I told a few people once about this place, specific things I remembered. Then a few nights later the angry faces were back and I was all excited about ""going"" to my favorite place again. When I got there, various people who lived there, people I ""knew"" and liked, suddenly had angry faces - like the ones that usually come before I ""go"" to this place. They shot me. Three times. In three different rooms. Twice I woke up after getting shot. I didn't wake up in real life, but the me in my dream woke up. I thought, ""Wow, I'm glad I made it through that,"" looked over, saw another old ""friend"" with a now-angry face, and get shot again. I didn't wake up the third time.

This ""shooting"" happened about 7-8 years ago. I've really missed the place. I keep trying to force myself to remember the angry faces, thinking if I can fall asleep visualizing them they might show up. No such luck, but about two years ago I was dreaming I was in some kind of street market, either an old-timey one or one located in a country that wasn't at all modern. A woman was leaning over a well in the middle of the town square, she was wearing a large-brimmed, purple hat. She looked right at me. Angry face, like the old days. I was both freaked out and kind of relieved. Like somehow I wasn't forgotten by that place and those people I used to ""visit."" I know this makes me sound nuts, but my first thought was ""they're finally coming to let me back in.""

That was two years ago. I now work in a hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. I see a lot of people on the street. I sold my car last winter and take public transportation, so I see more people now than I used to when I'd just drive by in my car. I'm in crowds fairly often. And six months ago, I saw that woman. I wasn't dreaming. I checked. (Lucid dreamers know what I mean when I say ""I checked."") That woman from the well was there, and she had her angry face on. In the last six months or so, I've seen 10-12 more people who were glaring at me, the way those faces used to. Then the people disappear in the crowd when I try to follow them. I'm kind of scared but I'm also kind of thrilled. I know I sound crazy, but these people might be following me around in real life now. I still can't get back to that place I used to go to, though.

There was a lab assistant to my right and my brain was in some undefined container in front of me. I open it up and my brain doesn't look like a brain at all. It sort of looked like a small fisher price toy made of colorful rubbery pieces (purple, blue, green, and pink parts). It was shaped like an elongated oval, and small enough to fit in my hand. 

I read the assignment on a piece of paper with indistinct instructions, and I immediately started taking apart my own ""brain"". I took it apart with the same curiosity and gusto as a child would have disassembling a radio to see how it worked inside--except my brain had much fewer parts to it. During the process of taking it apart, my head started to feel more and more strange.

After my brain was fully disassembled, I realized that this was bad because I would die without a working brain, and my head was feeling really weird. So I panicked and started putting it back together as quickly as I could. I tell my lab assistant that if I pass out, to get a doctor immediately.

I put it all back together and close the ""container"", but I still have this pressure in my head and a feeling that something was off with the brain inside my head. I freak out and look for a doctor. I find a nurse instead and she begins to tell me about the research and experiments  done on human brains until I wake up with my head in an awkward position and a stiff neck. About 5 seconds later I noticed that I wasn't really breathing until I consciously inhaled and exhaled (sleep apnea?).

It was all bizarre, and I just wanted to get it off my chest. I can see how it's connected to me in real life though because I tend to meticulously examine why I am the way I am (I repeat large mistakes, and I am something of a deadbeat).",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_l20f2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/l20f2/taking_apart_my_own_brain/,

It usually begins with a surprise that she is actually into me as much as I'm into her, which then begins a whirlwind romance that I can't believe is happening, there is some intense sex, some very close intimacy just talking about everything and anything, true happiness.

I was at a library down in my hometown near New Orleans. I walked in and seen a cute girl inside working. She made me want to work there. She asked if I knew anything about working in a library and I told her, ""No, but I'm really helpful."" So when I had to show her how helpful I was; I helped some kid go through his money and help arrange it. The first thing that made ne start thinking odd about the dream is when I saw an 11$ dollar bill. Weird, I thought. Then I had gotten colored notes w/numbers on them from reading some books. I found out that I got to redeem them for a prize. I decided to get a big ball with twizzlers in it.

I somewhat dozed off and the next thing I know I'm in a 4-person motorcycle to Washington. No clue why, but when I got back I saw myself painting a WarnerBros. picture behind the counter. Everything looked great except somehow the WB looked blurred (the frame was perfectly visible and so was the background. It was just the WB that was blurry.) I started walking back to the main office of the library and while doing so, I seen a huge hole in the wall. I noticed that 2 of my friends were in there peeking out. I turned into the office to ask the girl if I needed a library card and she replied, ""You worked here for 1year and you still don't have one?"" I told her that I would just say I must've left it at home if asked for it. 

We got to the front desk and she was obviously pissed at me for something, but didn't tell me why. She then gave me a card and then just vanished into thin air. I step back and see her all the way down the hall staring at the hole in the wall w/her arms spread wide. She then turned around and looked at me. Poof! She was gone. Then all of a sudden I hear her start to whisper in my ear, ""I will kill everyone!"" And thus I wake up. Weird, eh?

Anyone think they may be able to help?,8,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/jutel/ive_been_having_some_selfcannibalistic_dreams_and/,"Recently I have been having cannibalistic themed dreams. They are really messing with me and I was wondering if any of you might help me feel a little more at ease with an interpretation or advise in general.

The first one I had didn't last very long, but it consisted of cutting off my own hand and eating it raw. After a few bites I started feel a dull pain in the removed hand as my teeth were sinking in. After feeling the pain I continued to try and eat it, but could feel my gag reflexes kicking and I couldn't get down another bite. I remember feel both disappointed that I couldn't finish, but ashamed of myself for doing it. I also want to say that either someone else in my dream was doing the same thing to their hand, or possible sharing mine. 


The second one I had, the dream ""started"" with me in my kitchen (although layed out a little differently). I was talking to myself with a sense of urgency. I went over to the stove and inside was a human. I couldn't make out any identifying features, but it was a adult male. 

After checking to see if it was done (I guess) I shoved the body back in and allowed it to cook for a few more minutes. I repeated the process a couple of times. Finally I felt it was done and pulled the body out. I don't remember putting any of him in my mouth, but I do remember the taste. At that point I noticed his stomach had bloated and then burst, spraying what looked like some kind of stew or pot roast all of the kitchen floor. I remember feeling very disappointed that my cooking didn't turn out like I wanted.

I decided I had to get rid of the body (I knew what I was doing was very wrong) but I didn't know how. So I went and grabbed a large blanket (one from my childhood IIRC) and wrapped the body in it. Next thing I knew I had the body wrapped in the blanket outside and walking towards a somewhat secluded area of my property, but on the way the body had reduced to a sludge. 

I decided to fling the ""goo"" across my yard, but the head rolled out of the blanket onto the ground. Now that I am writing this down, I am realizing that the heads features where similar to my own, but I don't remember thinking that in the dream, but only until now as I write this. 

I said to myself, ""Now all I need to do is get rid of the head"". So I picked up the chard, slightly sticky and matted head and looked at it for a moment. Then I woke up with a very uneasy feeling.

These dreams didn't start until recently. Some major changes in my life has been getting off of drugs (synthetic and real marijuana; I was a very heavy user), and dealing with a lot of stuff with my parents (I am married and do not live at home). In that respect I have trying to keep my emotionally abusive father as happy as possible (which pretty much consists not visiting when he is around) so my mother who had a stroke earlier this year doesn't have to deal with his mood swings. My wife and have also been having some financial issues and things falling apart in general (the AC in the car and house both went out and I've only been worked enough to pull in a measly 375 every two weeks but hopefully that will get better).


The last thing I need is to not be able to sleep at night for the fear of dreaming about eating myself. I'm scarred, confused, and just want to be able to have a good nights rest. Any advice would mean the world to me.

Oh, and in case you where wondering, it tasted like sweet vomit.

normally i don't mind these dreams...sometimes they're annoying because if something cool happens in the dream, like if i find some money in my pocket, i go to check the pocket in the morning and there's no money.

but yesterday, in the middle of the dream, i had one of the worst dream experiences i have ever had. it may be the worst.

it started with me and my most recent ex-girlfriend. i'll admit, i haven't fully moved on from her yet, because i'm sure that this is part of why i had the dream. it was just us. now, we broke up because we were really only just friends and she didn't seem like she wanted to be in a relationship. we never had sex. but the sexual tension in this dream was almost palpable. 

as you can imagine, a dream involving an ex in any situation is usually not too fun. but my most recent ex, in a tense situation is even worse.

i can't remember exact dialogue, but as i remember, she was asking me if i wanted to have sex. it was extremely forward, but in hindsight she gave me the feeling that she was doing this to make me happy. almost like i was psychologically forcing her. 

this is what has been eating at my mind all day. after i told her i did, (i don't actually remember saying anything at all in the dream, so i guess i just assumed i told her i did) i went in to kiss her. every time she would turn away and refuse to kiss me, and just offer up her body to me. she wouldn't look at me in the eyes. i stared her down until she looked at me directly, and when our eyes met she started to cry. it was more real than i can describe. almost more real than any single moment i had with her when we were together.

but then she delivered what was like a punch in my gut. as she cried, she said, ""i only ever wanted to get to know you better. i only wanted to become better friends."" i felt horrible. i still feel horrible. i feel like i used her, but like i said, none of this ever happened. how do i overcome these subconscious problems so i can dream awesome dreams again???",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_j1tjb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/j1tjb/very_real_dream_worse_than_a_nightmare_help_me/,

I live in a studio apartment. It started with me getting out of bed in the middle of the night and stumbling my way to the bathroom. It's a very common thing I do but I knew something felt wrong this time. My air conditioner was blowing warm air as I passed and my lights wouldn't turn on. I'm dreaming. I notice that my front door is open. It now leads to the hallway of my elementary school. The door has also changed it's appearance to match the school doors I knew as a child. A new door has appeared near my front door and connects to another classroom. A small boy, maybe 11 years old, dark skin, sits in the middle of the room on the floor coloring. The door is locked.  ""Don't be locked"" I say out loud. The door opens. I enter the room. I wake up.

Now the previous night I was in my old church wondering around. I discover a staircase that I'd never noticed before. I suspect it leads to the steeple but instead leads to the back side of a dumb waiter connected to an upstairs apartment. I look into the room past the lift cables. I hear something behind me. Tucked into a small space on the opposite side of the lift are 4 children sleeping in ragged blankets. A small portion of stain glass window blocks most of the light. The silhouette of a girl sits up as much as the ceiling allows. She's looking at me. I can't make out any details of her face. I wake up.

I'm curious as to why I felt worried for the kids in each situation and also the fact that both of these locations were places that I haven't been to in 15+ years.

Had this dream:
I was protecting a tiny little girl from the evil forces of the world, consisting of the evil members of Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings and real life celebrity bad guys like Saddam Hussain.
The whole city was being ripped apart by evil tornados, so I heroically rode a motorbike super fast through the destruction until I could reach the tallest building in the city (obviously the safest place.) I'd lost the bad guys by this point and went to the tip top room to camp out with my killing knife.
After mercilessly dealing with a spy or two the bad guys all caught up with us, and after a jerry springer style ""Why we need to kill the little girl"" debate fronted by a four armed guy in a Death Star bad guy black hat and a ""Who's the better rock climber?"" contest, I had to fight them to the deaths. I won. 
Then for some reason I transformed into Gwen Stefani and kicked a bad spy midget off a three story ledge, only to later realise that the midget I killed was the good twin brother of the original bad one. 
Everyone was appalled that I'd killed the good dwarf and I woke up feeling ashamed at my Dwarfist faux par.

It's the third dream I've had about death, and all of them have been MUCH!!! too realistic for me.

Most of the dream was fairly ordinary. At the very end of it, I was standing in a close little room with another woman - she was a successful businesswoman of some kind, and we were in a building that she owned, getting ready for some kind of event. 

The room we were in had a lot of old-timey folding screens, the kind that people used to get dressed behind around the turn of the century. All of them were made of polished wood: some of them had colored glass in them, or painted panels with designs and scenes. We were surrounded by these screens, and the woman was talking to me about her plans: suddenly a gunshot rang out somewhere behind me, and in a panic both of us fled.

We ran through the screens, into a familiar wooden room with a menorah-like structure against one wall surmounted by an oil lamp and what looked like pews against another wall. In retrospect it looked a little like a funeral parlor, without a coffin or dais. We fled through that room - she was totally panicked and knocking things over as we ran - and into another as the gunshot rang out again behind us. 

A voice, my voice I guess, had begun narrating what was going on as we ran into the next room, which had more pews with some boards or something leaned against them. The voice was sobbing in fear, emoting my terror in the put-on way of a kindergarten teacher narrating a protagonist in a book for her class: 'Find an opening, find an opening, hide, hide...'

The next room had cabinets in it, and the woman pulled a cabinet open. Inside were two pistols, lying abandoned on the floor of the cabinet: I knew they were both empty, that they were the leavings of whoever was shooting at us. We ducked into the cabinet, and there was nowhere else to go.

I was sure we had escaped, and then suddenly I was shot in the head. I never felt a thing: I saw myself pitch forward in the cabinet, and then there was only blackness, shot through with brilliant lightning-bolts of yellow. I was still narrating my own death: ""Recoil....recoil....recoil,"" I droned, ""for a million, billion years."" 

I woke up with a start.

It's a place I frequently visit on holiday so it's fairly easy to recognize.  

So we're sat down by the waters edge, enjoying the sunset and a couple of joints and bongs etc. I'm an Ent in reality so it's quite a natural experience, everything genuinely feels like I'm high. At this point I realise ""Fuck, I'm smoking it up with James Fucking Franco, I must be dreaming... oh shit, I am dreaming!"" 

I've had a couple of lucid dreams before, nothing to the extent of being able to fly though, unfortunately. For some reason as well, I can only control my own actions. The situations/locations and people around me all do whatever they please, but I don't mind to be honest. I like going with the flow. 

Anyway, after this realisation James turns to me and just blows this huge smoke cloud right into my face and starts wetting himself with laughter. I'm still feeling high within the dream as well so I also start to laugh. All of a sudden we realise there's someone else laughing along with us, and lo and behold... Audrey Hepburn in her prime is sat between us, cross legged, bong on her lap and a huge bag of weed in her hand. She puts them in a bag, still laughing, then stands up and takes both of our hands and leads us to group of people she ""wants us to meet"". (I swear to God, when she took hold of my hand I could feel her beauty, something I've only ever experienced in my current relationship, which is a little rocky at the moment, perhaps suggesting this is my representation of my girlfriend in my dream?)

I can't remember any of the of people apart from a little girl who followed me and James away from the group after a very short amount of time conversing with the strangers. For some reason, we both then know that she's Madeleine McCann. 

Next thing I know, Madeleine has pulled me to the floor by my hand. I look up to see James is lying on the floor in a pool of blood. For some reason I feel a real connection with him, and it fucking scares me to death to think how much it hurt when I saw him like that. I rushed over and knelt at the side of him, the blood soaking into my clothes. I could feel the sticky warmth of it, clinging to me and almost burning my flesh. He looked at me and smiled, and simply said goodbye as a trickle of blood fell from the corner of his mouth before huge, furiously violent bubbles started to pour out. 

Audrey Hepburn then grabs my hand again, and this connection jolts me back to life. I realise I've got to get Madeleine safe again, and we just start to run. I've no idea why, we just ran for what felt like an eternity. While we ran we talked and talked and talked non-stop until we reached a pier. At the end of the pier was a long bench, with somebody leaning back, legs out-stretched and head back on the end of it. I slowly walked over and sat down right next to them. It's James Franco again, and he's ok. He looks at me and smiles again, that same scarily peaceful and beautiful smile he gave me before he died. I notice over his shoulder that Madeleine is running towards what I assume are her parents. 

Out of nowhere though, James whips out this handgun from his pocket and whirls around and just starts firing back towards where I left Audrey standing. I duck and turn around to see her being dragged away slowly by a group of men, another group in front of them is firing at us with guns. James pulls some strange Clint Eastwood style tricks with his gun and takes out those fuckers, but Audrey is still being dragged away. I run towards her with James and we manage to miraculously fight them off and drag Audrey away from them. I hug her, but seconds after embracing I see one of the men pull a piece from his side. He aims straight towards Audrey, and time just slowed down. I could literally see the bullet dancing through the air, but Franco is moving normal speed. He calmly walks directly into the path of the bullet, turning to me before the impact and smiles that same smile again, and whispers goodbye again. He then turns back to face the bullet, shoots the fucker who shot at him and time speeds up again. The impact sends her staggering backwards towards the railing of the pier.

I quickly let go of Audrey and run towards him, just as he falls over the edge of the pier. As his body slowly spirals towards the water, I see him smiling at me still. He's still alive. I just know he is for some reason. I scramble onto the railing, ready to jump in and save him, only to see Audrey being dragged off again. I'm out-numbered and there's nothing I can do other than tell her I'll find her. She simply looks at me with the most gut-wrenching expression imaginable, so much so that just thinking about it upon waking made me feel sick. She holds out her hand towards me just as I turn and plummet towards the water. Throughout the fall all I can see is the events being replayed over and over again, until the impact of the water seemingly woke me up. 

I've spent the last day feeling like absolute shit because of this dream, I just needed to get it out. 

TL:DR; Me, James Franco and Audrey Hepburn found Madeleine McCann. James Franco dies, comes back to life and sacrifices himself to save Audrey Hepburn from a gunshot. She gets kidnapped anyway, and James Franco falls into the sea, leaving me to dive in and save him while Audrey gets taken away.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_homn5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/homn5/james_franco_audrey_hepburn_and_madeleine_mccann/,

They look just like humans but think very far advanced. They were making copies of people. I tried to stop by running them down with a car. I tried to get the copies to escape. They wouldn't. The aliens threatened to kill me so I run. I shoot the alien that is tasked with making sure I leave. I shoot him in the face and he laughs it off and continues to threaten me with death.
I get to this house that's premiering the new ""Alien Design"" TV show. They've made a huge event out of it. Its the season premier. I look at the TV and there are all the copies. I run up to the TV wildly, attacking it with my shoe. Hitting the screen. The owners of the house are in shock. They do nothing. The TV characters start talking to me. They stroke my hair, calming me.  They tell me to think, as I am the key to this copy thing. Why did the aliens just run me off and didn't kill me? And it dawns on me. If I die the copies die. So one of the TV copies tells me to go upstairs and use a razor blade. I head up to the roof and look around. Then I dangle myself upside-down off the edge. There are Chinese lanterns decorating the courtyard. At this point my consciousness in the dream flees my body. Everything is black. There is no direction except forward. I hear a splat behind me. I jerk awake. It's 5:45am.

What if our dreams are just our conscious touch another dimension, albeit briefly. Sometimes I am myself in dreams, other times I'm someone else. I can either be in the person or in the 'camera' position, watching the dream happen. I always have thoughts that I recognize as my own. My dreams are always in color and very detailed.

I started out at my current place, but there were arcade machines everywhere, and a bunch of little kids. me and some other people (not sure who) decided to each choose a kid and have them compete with each other on these games. At first the kids didn't care, but then they started getting really malicious and attacking each other. Then they started attacking me so I ran away.

Apparently by this time I was in LA, so I was wandering around in LA trying to figure out where I was. Some guy tried to get me to go to a party with him and Christina Ricci was there. I said no and he got all pissed. Then it was dark and I was really freaked out. Samuel L Jackson rode up on a motorcycle and I asked him if I was in a dangerous part of town. He started laughing and then pulled me up onto his motorcycle. He was about to drop me off somewhere safe when the guy from earlier tried to attack us. We kicked the shit out of him but then he pulled out a gun.

Next thing I know, Samuel L Jackson is gone and I'm with the guy from earlier, but he's totally cool now and we're hanging out. I'm hanging out with his friends and they are all trying to hook up with Christina Ricci. The friends start slowly disappearing into Christina Ricci's apartment, never to be seen again. I go outside and look up to her window (she lived in a tall building) and see her sitting on the window sill smoking a cigarette, then another Christina Ricci appears and they sit together. then a christina ricci appears next to me and starts talking to me. I see one of the guys I was hanging out with go into the building, and then a few minutes later, blood squirts all over the Christina Riccis in the window. 

So I go inside Christina Ricci's place, and there are like a dozen christina riccis in there, and some of them look like weird mutants. Then I look to the right, and there is a super mutant Christina Ricci on the bed. She barely has a head. She's wearing a tore up, stained nightgown, and pretty much has her vagina in the air. Except, it's not really a vagina more than the fucking scariest toothed monsterbeast I've ever seen. They're sacrificing the guys I made friends with to this mutant form of Christina Ricci with a voracious toothed vageen.

I run over to the tree and I start pulling the wood that is attached to the tree, helping the choppers. One chopper leaves and I'm standing there at the front of the house, looking out at the street.

I was an old pirate captain, hook hand and all, but I had somehow left Neverland and fallen into the real world, and though the time period into which I had come was in the golden age of piracy, I had had immense trouble coping. I had begun to wonder whether my memories of Neverland and my endless fights with Peter Pan were mere delusion, when one day Tinker Bell showed up in the weird junk shop where I lived. 

She was not a more traditional iteration of Tinker Bell; she was fucking evil, or at least terribly amoral, and took a great deal of pleasure in tormenting me in terribly creepy ways. She could change size and shape at will, and whispered terrible secrets to me at night, haunted my steps by day, and generally acted like a fucking possessed little girl because she thought it was funny. But all the same, I couldn't get rid of her, because even though she was driving me insane, her presence proved that I was who I thought I was. I hated her immensely, but I needed her around. 

She tortured me to the point where I eventually snapped, and in a frenzy tried to rape and/or strangle her, in a desperate attempt to rid myself of her evil influence. She laughed at me the whole time, and her demon-voiced laughter made my head spin...

...and then I, the old pirate, came to in an opium den. I looked down at the ruin of my body, emaciated, sickly, craving for the evil smoke that was slowly killing me, and realized that the whole thing--the evil fairy haunting me, the trying times I'd had, and even my life in Neverland--had been an opium dream.

The first drew out a cap gun and it fired real bullets, and the second fired a real gun with fake bullets. Those silly trolls.

Twice I laid down in the snow, at night, next to a strange beacon that flashed. After a minute or so, people appeared out of some dropship (couldn't see shit, captain, I don't know how big it was) and collected some data on a short clipboard like I was doing a survey. They said thank you and each time I just walked away like nothing happened. 

I kept smashing a small piece of ice with my hands and doing tactical rolls everywhere, since I was virtually free of pain this time. I think I did a tactical roll into a surface so hard I might have exploded if it were real. Being free of pain could have meant I would have set myself on fire but thankfully I wasn't really caring about that.

 The house. I don't know who's house it was, but it was definitely not recognizable. There were anywhere from 10 to 15 people in it during the dream, doing their own things unless they were outside.
 Maybe 40 years old in build, which isn't bad considering it's 2011, and had decent furniture inside but it was also kinda pale with no plants whatsoever.  Some kid brother of the family was playing a PC near the door to the basement, he never even looked at me or said a word. Two people were watching TV downstairs and looked bored as hell.

Lots of this took place at night in the house. It was a large house, not in the way you'd think. It looked like it was small but when you'd turn a corner, there'd be two doors and a staircase or something, and going down those stairs revealed a basement slightly larger than the last basement you visited.  That night time was interesting because I was more concerned with exploring it than abusing it.

I forced daytime to come after night got boring, simply by closing my eyes for 8 seconds and bringing images into my head of sunny skies. Then I opened my eyes, and I was in that same hallway but it was bright and I could see the sunlit snow outside. I was on this quest to find more girls wearing coats and scarves inside my head, but really I just knew I wanted to have a kiss.

Near the end, the pizza happened. I went outside into the main lobby where the office people were working, and down the hallway heard someone knock. They said ""get the dogs"" and I was like NOPE I knew the dogs would obey my swag, so I waltzed right up and opened the door. A guy that looked like Chef Ainsley was there with two boxes of delicious pizza, and I gave him my trademark grin and he knew he wasn't getting money but life was good.  The dogs didn't bark or anything because I was totally giving off an aura of command. 

Went and ate that pizza so good next to a fireplace.  I don't recall sharing, oddly the dogs disappeared after I went down the hallway so I was pretty much alone at this point.

Back to night time in that house. 
Several times I felt myself approaching reality , so I backed off. You know, stuff like uhh, being next to the fireplace and crossing my eyes - the flame disappeared, and I close my eyes and wish it were - then the flames are back.  Not too long after this I closed my eyes again, and when I opened them, I was laying in my bed staring at the dim light of a venetian-blind window. It was over, and I feel fine. 


The soundtrack to this dream was Álfheimr. Estimated time, based on the songs I heard through my earbuds, was between 30 and 40 minutes.  I have , for the first time, achieved FULL lucidity - able to control every aspect of my dream for as long as I wanted. I am lucky, because this is usually something I would have to work for with many times of practice and training the mind to recall details as well as make them. 

Now, I'm gonna go play Minecraft.

In my dream I was I was in Canada. I was at my mother's house, and she came calling to me that one of my students was missing. There were a bunch of Chinese women outside my house; one of them emerged as the girl's mother. The girl in question is not necessarily a ""favourite"" or my best student, she's just one of them. Six years old. The girl's mother kept on telling me things that the girl had told me I taught her. Things I actually have mentioned in class. She seemed to be telling me this to make it seem like the girl really liked me and that was why she had come to me to help find the girl.

I went to a school. Not the school I teach at or any real school; some school in Canada. I see a man who I seemed to know was the ""janitor,"" those he wasn't dressed as one. He was a larged man and wore mostly black, and he seemed to wear a number of layers. After finding him suspicious he eventually pulls a gun on me. There are a number of video-game-like scenes of chase and evasion and I somehow run up to him and get the gun from him. I end up shooting him repeatedly.

After this, I run into someone I presume to be the principal. He has taken offense to my killing his janitor. He is devious-looking bald man, and I end up killing him too. I don't end up finding the girl in the dream, but I know killing these two people has solved the kidnapping.

There is a scene back at my mother's house, the girl's mother is very pleased. The girl is there, but she is not six years old, she is taller than me; I'm 6'1"" so she was probably about 6'7""... abnormally tall for a Chinese girl. I am very happy to see that she is safe. I start crying in the dream, but it seems to be because she has grown up so fast...

I think this is the second time I've ever had a dream where I end up taking a gun from someone shooting at me by running up to him and wrestling it out of is hands, then shooting him. I think this idea might be the result of being terrible at Counterstrike and always getting knifed while I'm shooting at someone. I've almost seen it work before. This is, however and to my knowledge, the only time I can ever remember being heroic in a dream.

One night, my friend came to my door and claimed that he was the only one who was thinking straight of all of us. He announced that he was attacking my home. I began to run around the house, screaming for help and to prepare a defense from his minions, but nobody was there, and the house was dark. 

I remember thinking to myself, ""am I crazy? Is anyone even with me?"" (It was pretty scary, actually). Right when I thought that, I fell down the stairs. When I hit the ground, the house lit up and all of the old characters were back (INCEPTION?) and we actually began piling up dead characters' bodies to block the entrances to the house. 

Then my alarm went off.

Pardon the wall of text, but trust me this will be a good read if you like reading dreams!

**Dream 1.** *I came to in my dream inside of some sort of big house with a friend, for some reason all of our relatives were also in this house with us, but all sleeping, and in separate rooms. The house in the dream had this eerie feeling about it, so me and my friend got in a vehicle and left to go ""to my house.""
We arrived at my house (and this was an EXACT representation of the house I lived in at the time, it was SPOT on, it's rare for dreams to be this accurate) and we walked into my room and sat down on my bed (this was the bed I was sleeping in in real life at the time). We looked at eachother, thinking ""well, now what?"" and right after we said that, all the lights in my house turned off, and the small TV in my room turned on to white noise, I looked at the TV, and looked back at my friend, which was no longer there with me. I instantly got scared shitless in my dream, I was whispering ""Oh fuck, oh fuck"" to myself as I got up off of my bed and started toward my doorway. Upon entering my doorway, I was petrified, my brothers room was directly across the hallway from mine, and there was a tall black figure in the doorway staring at me. I then woke up still saying ""Oh fuck, oh fuck"" like I was in my dream. I did not fall back asleep*

**Dream 2.** *I came to in my dream underwater staring at a pool light. I quickly realized I couldn't breathe underwater and went to the surface. Once I was above water, I realized that I was in a small pool in the middle of a pitch black forest. The mood instantly went from neutral to grim. I got out of the pool, and looked around, and realized that I saw black figures surrounding me deep in the woods. I freaked out, I tried running as fast as I could, but I couldn't go anywhere, and the more I tried the closer the shadows got to me. I was so terrified in my dream that I was crying out my brothers name in my dream in hopes of him hearing me in real life and waking me up (we shared rooms together) and I started hearing my name called from a distance, and it got louder and louder, until I woke up to my brother calling my name from across the room. It had worked, my pleas for help in my dream got my brothers attention across the room and he woke me up right as the shadow figures were almost right in front of me.*

Writing those two dreams out got me somewhat teary eyed and gave me the chills.

2. I'm in this dark school building and this vampire person has people lined up to kill but all I can think is how my panties are going to fall to the floor at any moment.

Because you should play Yume Nikki.,7,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1k38vn/have_you_not_played_yume_nikki_because_you_should/,"[Yume Nikki](http://yumenikki.wikia.com/wiki/Yume_Nikki) is a freeware indie game that consists of exploring a shut-in young girl's lucid dreamscape -- from concrete locations like forests and sewers to more abstract areas like the eyeballs-and-hands world. Scattered throughout the game are effect items that let Madotsuki move faster, kill the often grotesque DC's (they come back, don't worry) or just wear things on her head. There is no explicit story behind the game, but finding every single effect will open up an ending cutscene.

Apart from its brilliance in its own right, Yume Nikki (Dream Diary) can be a useful tool for dreamers. Run through a few worlds before going to bed to help seed your own dreams (nighttime sessions are always the best). Practice your world-building ability by recreating one of Madotsuki's worlds. And if the game itself interests you, see if you can ~~read the entire wiki~~ find every world, character, and effect on your own!

Yume Nikki comes pre-packaged and pre-English-translated. However, its dozens of fangames and imitators do not. Here are some of the most popular fangames, each starring a different girl and a different dream world:

* [**LcdDem**](http://lcddem.wikia.com/wiki/LCDDEM_Wiki) does without most of the disturbing imagery Yume Nikki loves, and features more realistic and more calm locations like flower fields and the ocean floor. Probably better for actual lucid dreaming utility than YN once you've played both.
* [Yume 2kki](http://yume2kki.wikia.com/wiki/Yume_2kki_Wiki) is considered the unofficial sequel to YN. It's *huge* in comparison, and still unfinished, which justifies the lack of an English version.
* [.flow](http://dotflow.wikidot.com/) isn't the best tool for dreaming on account of it beng creepy as all fuck.

Within minutes officers stormed in and took me. I found an opening on the top of the closet or room in which I was hidden in while the police came in the house.

1375860508.0,8,self.Dreams,1jvc7y,My recent horrifying nightmare,8,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1jvc7y/my_recent_horrifying_nightmare/,"I've been haunted by nightmares since as long as i can remember. They come and go and differ in intensity; sometimes they haunt me during my awake hours, sometimes they don't bother me.
But tonight i had a really horrifying nightmare which i just can't let go and it also brings back memories from my previous nightmares. English is not my mother tongue so excuse any grammar mistakes. I only remember sequences of it.

I think it started with me living in a sewer. I was hiding from something, or i was being held hostage by someone/something. I had a feeling as if i've been there for a long time and struggled with whatever was keeping me there. I opened a door and i saw written in blood ""Die, pig girl"". I supposed that referred to me. I closes the door quickly and opened it again. (My stomach is turning and i have goosbumps all over as i'm writing this). When i opened it, i saw a man(?) with a mask made of human skin and flesh- similar to Bloody Face in American Horror Story: Asylum. It gets kind of blurry from here but i think he tried to slash my face or something.
In the next sequence i am in some sort of underground or perhaps under a dirty stone bridge. I have a narrator with me. I see midget soldiers being force-fed water. The narrator explains to me that they're short because of their malnutrition- water was all they were allowed to consume during their service. It was a really horrifying sight, in black and white like an old movie. They were really sick and i felt ill. 
In the next sequence i am above ground, shopping for some organic food in a local store. When i stepped out of the store i found myself just above the sewer where i spent many months. The lid seemed to be jammed shut and i started panicking. I walked over the lid a couple of times as to see what i would feel. The lid was in fact not jammed shut, and so it opened. In my hand i suddenly had a sledge with spikes on one side which was flat. It was one of the instruments that my tormentor had used on me. I held the sledge down the well to se if i would hit someone or something. I did. I jammed it through the tormentors brain and i fell down with him. I think he was dead, but i wasn't sure.
I was in the sewers again. This time there were two little boys down there as well, i think they were brothers. The older one was sadistic to the younger one and he asked if he could demonstrate how the sledge is supposed to be used. I froze.
He rolled a thin mattress around his younger brother and started beating him with the sledge making the mattress all bloody. The younger brother seemed to be in pain but didn't express any feelings of such. It was as if he also enjoyed it somehow. He crawled out of the mattress and sought shelter behind me but i didn't dare touch him, i didn't want him near me. The older brother took out a thicker mattress and went on with the procedure until the younger brother was almost still.

The next sequence was above ground. It was a sunny day and i ha brought a book with me to read outside. Again i found myself just above the sewer where i had been witnessing and experiencing this. (My throat is thick as i write this). I started panicking again and it was the most intense anxiety i've ever felt. I wondered if i would ever be able to live a normal life after this experience. How does one manage these kind of atrocities? I stood on the lid of the well and felt as if the ""Bloody Face""-tormentor was still alive down there just waiting for the lid to fall of and for me to fall down again. Die, Pig Girl. 

I woke up at 6 am frozen in my bed, closing my eyes and trying to work through this. I've had horrifying dreams before which hadn't bothered me at all but i just can't let this one go. The feelings were so intense and i still feel really sick about it. I've contacted my psychiatrist during his summer leave a couple of times due to other recent nightmares where i have some sort of REM-paralysis. 
I just want to know what it is i can't let go of, and why. It's really bothering me. 
Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I hear the child point to one, (I can't explain it better than that.

I went back upstairs to tell the others and we discussed a plan of attack. Unfortunately, I went into a seizure and then woke up.

Part Two - Several weeks later, I dreamed the continuation of the dream. I was in a large warehouse where I was resisting the Nazis with the aid of about a hundred preteen boys and their leader.

Unfortunately their shots missed and they were all crushed and killed by the steamroller except for the leader who managed to throw the perfect shot at the end and hit the steamroller's front wheel in its weak spot.

Now it's been two days that I got those weird dreams becoming nightmares. 

The first dream was fine at the beginning, and it was pretty realistic. I pretty much kissed a girl that I liked. And I guess I still have feelings for her in a way ? Anyway, you remember the movie where the hero was god and could move the moon for his girlfriend ? Bruce something... Don't remember. So after kissing her, black out. I was in space, and ffs that was realistic too. Until I fucking push Jupiter near Earth. So I was in my house after a little blackout, and the TV was on. What it was ? News, with reporters, who were reporting on ice. There were two people with a mic, a man and a woman. The woman had lost an eye and the man had do face. At this point I woke up *in my dream* and understand it's not reality. And when they point out fucking Jupiter, [it's so big, it's realistic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Yi58jtNdY). So it crashed, white vision, explosion sound and people shouting at me ""Take your medicine"" ""He should take it"". I don't take medicine (mayby one pill against my allergies). In my ""dreaming mind"" I was thinking ""Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up now, WAKE UP"". And when I opened my eyes I saw my legs (since I was on the floor with my hands on my head), and my blue jean ? And I again I was thinking ""Wake up now"" and I woke up. For some reason I was feeling good in my bed. It was 10 AM, I normally wake up two hours later. I mean, it's vacation time.

The second dream was weird all along. I had a coat with a handgun in it, and someone I know invited me to go with him in a weird playground. Don't remember exactly. Anyway the plot of this dream was : find the coat and the handgun in it. Boring, it was like 4 hours long. But later I killed some dude with my hands. It wasn't supposed to kill him. I remember I was in a car and I woke up after that. Didn't see I was in a dream.

Wednesday July 24, 2013


It started out as one of those recurring dreams (I think), where I was in a game that I used to watch Bogdan play. NVM. We were traveling on some train with the Vachtchenko family right beside lakeshore. We saw a few geese and ducks and they were swimming through the actual grass that was there because of how much the water had risen. I pretended it was obvious and that I already knew about that. When we arrived at the house or something, we decided to go to the movies with Olessia. We went back on the same train in the other direction. We saw the geese and ducks swimming through the grass again. I decided to get an aerial view and fly over as a bird, so I transformed. I flew over a bit and the train stopped to wait for me kinda. I saw that my dad was standing on the water making a fire that was also somehow standing on the water. Liza was walking around nearby. Suddenly, I looked at the train and saw that one of the Chinese people on the train (that I’d seen before and thought was suspicious) was choking her with a string! I told my dad “Dad, quick! She fell into the fire!” – He’s like “Where? Where?” He looked around assuming I was talking about my little sister Liza who was just walking around it. I start sprinting towards the train and he somehow understands that he means that someone’s choking Olessia. We stopped and apologized to each other for being confusing and for not understanding one another. I started running again, as I picked up a 8 inch by 3 inch drawn and colored picture of a sword. I turned into a bird and flew straight onto the train, by which time everything was back to normal.

We soon appeared at the movie theatre. We started watching Harry Potter 1, but I noticed something I hadn’t noticed before – there was this huge introduction where everyone was walking around and the camera was flying around showing us everything. Harry Potter was doing some kind of interpretive play with chains and black feathers, lowering himself to the ground as we passed by. Everyone clapped for him. We flew around to an area where dementors were, on some shady street just flying around with a bunch of human maids. Continuing on, I saw stairs leading down to god knows what – stairs like in that Battlefield 3 map. The one with the underground train tracks. Where you have to go from this park-style area through the subway area then back up to a mall and to like 5 6-story high apartment buildings. Behind them are the stairs – the ones I was talking about.

Suddenly, I was a 10 year old boy that had nothing to do with Harry Potter. My family and I were walking through a museum of weird shit. There was an area where you could kiss &lt;something’d&gt; birds on the mouth. People would like make out with them and weird shit. I remember seeing that at least five times before throughout my life. Olessia told me that she’d done that before but she accidently broke off the neck (haha). Hold up – rewind a bit. When we entered the museum, my maid told me that I need to invite someone to dinner. I said “Like... off the streets?” My dad pitched in and said “yep.” I walked around looking for a cute girl to invite (since I knew I was only 10 and awesome looking). I kept getting confused though – I would walk past 10 year olds way shorter than me, and 13 year olds the same size as me – yet I was only 10. I couldn’t decide if I wanted someone older or shorter. I decided to go back for one of the pretty 13 year old girls I saw, which is when we walked past the bird kissing area, etc.

I was in a house now. Chinamen were trying to kill us, we knew that – so we were hiding in this house. No, wait – I’d just arrived at this house; I didn’t hear anything, all of the lights were off, and a mix of my dad and Olessia were lying in the middle of the kitchen floor. I couldn’t tell who it is so naturally I said “What’s up?” They said “Hold on! Quiet down! People have *cough cough* broken in! Chinamen!” “Oh no”, I said! He/she started blabbering about how I should get random shit while I was stuffing my belt with kitchen knives. They said something and I didn’t hear it exactly – I said “There’s a what, where?” They said “There’s some tools that may help you under the washing machine” – I said “Oh, I remember that dad used to have a gun here before. Did you know that guns are illegal in Canada?” “Oh, really? Haha that’s cool.” (Guess he/she was partially my 11 year old oblivious sister now.)

I looked under the washing machine and found a large firecracker – it was only about 3x the size of the few I saw a bit before. I decided not to take any of them because they’re so loud that they’ll call everyone to the house. Instead, I took a few flash bombs that burned super bright for about 10 seconds. They were shaped like a pack of 24-hour Listerine strips, with a very short pointed fuse coming out of the top. I thought I heard something, so I looked around, quietly creeping. Nobody was on the main floor. I suddenly realized that there was music playing upstairs – like really loud music. I decided to wait for them to come down one by one. Lemme explain quickly – the stairs are right in the middle of the main entrance room. (I came through the side door when I came in.) If you go right, it’s the living room. Continue straight in a circle around the actual stairs and you’ll be in the bar. Continue to the other two or three rooms in the circle around the stairs and idk what’s there. Anyways, I went around it clockwise and when I came back to the bar, I thought I heard something behind me. I continued and turned right at the living room as soon as I entered, hiding behind the wall. “Fuck, really?” I heard some guy say. For some reason they weren’t turning on any of the lights. The Chinaman comes and squints, trying to look into the dark living room. I quickly get up to stab him, but oops! I’m too close! The knife is too long, and I end up stabbing him not perfectly straight into the heart, but at some weird angle. I basically do a few short 3-inch stabs into his leg and into his chest, none of them straight. As I’m finally about to stab him in the heart, he crumples to the floor, defeated. “They some weird damn physics”, I thought to myself.

I continued doing that for a while as many people came down all over the place usually one at a time. Finally, it was the last two (or so I thought). I was hiding in the corner of the living room right where the two couch ends met. It was very hard to see in the darkness. I noticed someone creeping up on the left and for some reason decided not to attack. I ran to the right where the main entrance area was, and right before entering it, I hid right up against the wall. (Living room’s left, entrance room’s right.) I tried to light a Listerine thing but my lighter wasn’t lighting, as it often doesn’t in real life. Suddenly, it worked – I lit it and threw the Listerine pack into the middle of the room. It started flashing violently and those two idiots just stared straight at it. I’m pretty sure they were drunk. I went up and stabbed the one on the left, right in the doorway of the living room / entrance room. I then went up to the kitchen one, but the light went out a bit early. He was super drunk and held out his weird German gun (like the one on the Imgur front page yesterday). He shot at me just as I jumped on the couch, and missed. Guess he didn’t see me. I burst through the door and went right for him, stabbing him in the stomach.

I heard something – I didn’t know what. I suddenly remembered my friend Bogdan playing this game, and in the game flashlights started pointing at the windows. I looked through and surely enough, flashlights. I hid beside a couch that was in the kitchen (idk why) and lied down. They started coming in through the front so I knew what I had to do – I ran. Suddenly the person lying on the floor in pain was actually my Russian comrade. He was bald and broad-shouldered. He jumped out the window and I ran out the door that was right beside the window. We sprinted towards the woods. Suddenly there were two redneck Chinamen (don’t even ask). One was holding a machete and the other was holding a can of long-shot hairspray and a lighter. The lighter one went after my friend and the machete one went after me. Right as the machete one was almost at me, they switched focuses and the machete guy turned around, leaving his back exposed. I just slashed it once and a deep gash was on his neck, but he didn’t even notice. Suddenly the fire guy started spraying me with fire. I kept running, trying to turn around and attack when I could. Suddenly, I was too close! I couldn’t evade him! He sprayed me with fire, leading to me rolling on the ground, seeing my Russian comrade stab that guy and lift me up by my hand. Suddenly he despawned and I was left, just a 10 year old with fireworks in his pockets. (Guess fire makes you younger?) My teacher came up and asked what I was doing (I knew she was my teacher but I’d never seen her before in real life). I said “nooothing”. She started coming up to me when I fumbled in my pockets and a thick purple sock fell out. “See, a sock!” “Hrmm”, she said. I stuffed the sock back into my pocket and we started to part ways. Suddenly my maid showed up with some weird family, and we headed off to the part where I needed to invite some stranger to dine with us.

Right after I got up I hopped on an IRC channel I frequent and shared it with some friends, so I'll keep it in that format I think.

(If anyone has issue with that just let me know and I'll fix it and also fix my terrible lack of capitalization) 

----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;Leah&gt; i know i don't curse that much but i have to say. last night/this morning I think i had one of the most fucked up dreams i've ever had 

&lt;K[A]&gt; Oh?

&lt;t[L]&gt; Sounds fun

&lt;S[w]&gt; What was the dream about?

&lt;Leah&gt; I was with my sister and mom, and another friend (which, who he was would take longer to explain than the rest of the dream, so i'll just sum up that it was someone I liked) were in a car going somewhere 

&lt;Leah&gt; we got in a minor traffic accident and were close to a hospital so they made us go there, even though my friend and i were very adamant that we hadn't been hurt 

&lt;Leah&gt; somehow at this place, someone was infected with some sort of hemorrhagic fever, the kind that basically makes your blood no longer want to be in your body (like ebola) 

&lt;Leah&gt; it turned out it was my cousin Dusty, who had gotten back from some overseas trip. he had it, and then my mom and sister got it, and a few others. 

&lt;Leah&gt; i basically watched them die from outside of the quarantine, and then my friend started to take me home. i keep kind of a log of dreams with extreme emotion, and i think this one counts as the most i've ever felt sadness and loss. my friend started to take me out of there, kind of sheilding me with his jacket as we left (we got tested to make sure we didn't have the disease so we didn't go around spreading it), hiding me from all the cameras of the newspeople outside the hospital.

&lt;S[w]&gt; Damn

&lt;Leah&gt; and then! this whole time during parts of the dream, I would be pacing down the halls thinking 'there's no way this is real, this has to be a dream' 

&lt;Leah&gt; but then it turned more dream like and a little more surreal i guess

&lt;t[L]&gt; Hm, that is pretty vivid

&lt;Leah&gt; turns out my friend hosted some sort of 'fact or fiction' show with the lead singer of the band Falling in Reverse and Dave Grohl, so we met up with them.   

&lt;Ts&gt; bleh, rr is a douche though

&lt;Leah&gt; we were going to go to my friend's house, and and kind of just decompress for a bit when suddenly we weren't going to his house, we were going to something to do with minecraft. (stupid game) it was like a minecraft built cathedral, with everything being built in blocks. there was some sort of puzzle and someone ahead of us solved it and we followed them 

&lt;Leah&gt; it turned out to be a release party for something to do with a sequel to Amnesia

&lt;Leah&gt; and everyone started turning in to zombies except for the party host and me and i was freaking out, like i had already lost my family, now my friends were zombies and then I was gonna DIE 

&lt;Leah&gt; but it turned out to be some reveal of a new monster thing, and everyone turned back to normal  

&lt;Leah&gt; so I found my friend and was basically clinging to him sobbing when I woke up   

&lt;Leah&gt; and that was the dream I had.

&lt;Leah&gt; it's just crazy that you can practically have another life in dreams and it's not real :c 

&lt;Leah&gt; and the reason i say that is because now i miss the friend that helped me u.u 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here is where I've experienced things I never had in a dream, and I'll explain a bit more about my friend.

I've had dreams where I experience anger, happiness, sadness, death, fear. But this is the first dream where I've felt such a real sense of loss and sadness, and it's still affecting me. I know I can call my mother or my sister and talk to them now and that they're still alive, but I *saw them die*. I was right there... When the doctors announced that everyone that contracted the disease had died, I collapsed on the floor and tried to deny it. I've never felt something like that before, ever. Including outside of a dream.

And then this friend... this is when it gets stupid. Somehow he was a friend I had a crush on in high school. We never talked too much but he was in a few classes with me and I was friends with his girlfriend at the time so I knew a moderate amount about him. Somehow he was there, but grown up, and we were just trying to hang out and get to know each other again. The fact that he helped me through this was something I would never forget, real or not. And now I miss him more than I've missed someone in a while. Not the friend I knew in school, but the one that comforted and protected me. 

Has anyone else ever had such strong feelings in a dream? Or missed the people they met in them? I just have a feeling it's going to stay with me for a while and knowing I'm not alone in those feelings would make me feel a lot better.

Drilling or something. When all of a sudden, something goes horribly wrong and there's a massive explosion. I'm not tied down, so the explosion sends me hurtling through space (my biggest fear). Death is inevitable. I'm going to die in a few hours. I'm watching planets fly by me.

I decide to say my final prayer. I'm asking for forgiveness for my sins, I'm asking for forgiveness from my family for being so careless, everything. Everything I can pray for, I do pray for. Until finally, I come up against a planet. This is it. My final seconds. Everything moves into slow motion. I remember feeling my head hit the rock. My skull compressed and cracked. I felt every second of pain, and boy was it intense. I'm still asking to be taken to eternal paradise when everything goes white. All I see is light. And a hand grabs me around the ankle and pulls. Hard.

I wake up in my bed. Back in the good ol' trailer court. Thank god. But everything's different... Everything's more vivid. More sharp. Better. And I think, *this is heaven*. My senses were heightened, including my vision which had become almost 360 degrees around. I stood up, feeling every crease in the hardwood flooring between my toes. I walk slowly to the front door and open it. 

It's perfect. The wood on the deck is perfectly level and evenly spaced. Every nail shined unbelievably bright. The grass was phenomenal to look at. Every blade stood straight up into the air, with a perfect point at the tip. The gravel on the driveway was straight. I'm not exaggerating. The pebbles were in an impeccable grid formation. Even my beater of a car looked somehow phenomenal.

This might be a long text.
It started with a very fragmented segment where i died, I believe it was something that fell on me. Then it skipped the me watching my friends greiving over me on a farm, it was awful cause i could feel their pain and my own, i really thought i was dead and that this was reality. I wandered of, crying and desoriented and wound up in a shabby diner.
I sat down in a chair and watched the people there. Then a beutiful young woman who might have been an old lover sat down next to me. She was crying,drinking coffe and eating pie. I started crying cause i missed her so much and i laid my hand on hers. She could see me again. We looked at eachother the had a final goodbye kiss. Then it skips back to the farm where my friends stood in a row talking about me. Another dead person stood next to me. It was another friend of mine. We realized that death was just another level of existence. I felt alot better now and we managed to show ourselves wo our mourning friends. They where shocked beyond belief so we proceeded to explain that death is not the end. Its just another level of existence were you are free to do whatever you want. Anything was possible. Then me and my spirit friend are walking down a dirt road past an old gate. We looked back at our living friends and waved. Then it ended.

I live in southern North Carolina and for the last month it has done nothing but rain. Right before I was trying to sleep and it was raining kinda hard but nothing to be worried about.

As I'm falling asleep I hear what seems to be an emergency air horn that comes from Firefighter stations. Now usually this horn is to signal extreme weather (tornadoes, floods, hurricanes). Now, my brain decided not to put air horn and weather together but instead the air horn meant some kind of attack. I didn't really pay it any attention other than making the connection that the air horn represented something out of my control.

Now I've fallen asleep at this point and I'm dreaming about standing in my yard. Nothing wrong with dreaming about standing in the yard, right? As I'm standing there I hear the air horn once and instantly look up to the cloudless blue sky to see a plane flying by. As soon as I see the plane, I instantly make the connection that it's not friendly. I see what looks like a bomb fall from the plane and without hesitation I realize what it is and start running with one thing on my mind (am I far enough away to escape the blast radius?). I try to run behind my house for some kind of protection and before I can make it I see a flash from behind me. As I'm running my hand comes up to eye level and my skin and muscle are ripped from the bone and I'm watching my hand fall off by the wrist in slow motion. Simultaneously I start to fall face first but before I hit the ground, darkness envelopes my senses and everything goes pitch black. In the few seconds it took for things to go dark I literally lose my mind and I panic, scream and cry inside my mind. This gut wrenching feeling, sinking feeling is all happening at once and I can't do anything but one last thought crosses my mind. I scream at the top of my lungs and as hard as I can to myself to **WAKE. THE. FUCK. UP!!!** 

I instantly wake up in a panic scared out of my mind with the worst feeling I've ever had in my stomach.

I don't really believe dreams have deeper meanings beyond our comprehension (telling the future, possessed by spirits), but I do think they have relevance to our mental/emotional states. I'ma tell you the one that I just woke up from.

So first of all, I slept until 12 which is really odd for me. I usually get six-seven hours of sleep and feel great. Last night I got ten, and when that happens my final dreams are much more interesting and much harder to wake up from.

The Dream:
      So, I was on the Internet researching about this mystery at the college where my mother works. Apparently there was some boy who went missing from the library never to be seen again. My research took me to a chatroom where I found a friend of mine had ended up as well. We chatted for a little bit until someone messaged us in the chatroom, saying he knew how the kid disappeared all those years ago. He said he could show us if we met him at the library that instant. We told him the library was about to close, but he said meet him there anyway.
      We go there, to the library, and I learn that people are allowed to spend the night if we pre-register. The guy pre-registered my friend and also pre-registered myself under a pseudonym because I didn't attend the university. We meet him on the landing of the large stairwell, all of us wearing hoodies and hats and sunglasses in order to conceal our identity. There are plenty of other people in the library who are about to spend the night, for in my dream it's finals week.
      The guy looks like he's Romanian, and he pulls out from his bag a couple of candles and a huge book. He tells us to light the candles and wait. We do. Then, out in the distance this large black fog starts to appear. The guy starts reading from the book aannndddd-

I wake up.

This was one of those dreams that I tried to go back to sleep to finish, but waking up seemed to have been the completion of the dream. The friend of mine in the dream wasn't a real-life friend, just a dream- convenient made-up person. The guy with the book looked like someone I've dreamt of before, if only as a background filler person. So I'm wondering what it means...

But its currently 12:30 London time and I've just managed to wake myself up before I fall too deeply into the nightmare. So my sister( Who is 3 years older than me) and I have experienced sleep paralysis since we were very young, maybe 7 and10 years old. It would usually happen around 2 - 3 times a week. Its gotten to the point that when it happens now I just tell myself to relax and fall back asleep. Lately though I have been having a re-occuring nightmare. It starts off as me dreaming that I'm dreaming. Then I wake up ( and think I'm actually awake) I then attempt to get ready for work as I normally would but its almost as if I'm very drunk. Falling, Tripping its almost as if I'm moving through tar. I then wake up ( in real life) but I can't move or speak. I have to wait til I fall asleep and then wake up again in the morning. I told my sister about this and she freaked out. As she had been having the EXACT dream. And anytime I have It. She will have it within 24 hours. Last monday the last time I saw on the clock was 12:00 I then must have fallen asleep. I dreamed the usual nightmare apart from this time I was speaking to someone and explaining what I was seeing. Then a scary/evil face jumped up and I bolted up in my bed. I was still sleepy so laid back down but as I was falling asleep again I could feel my body going numb and myself getting weak almost as if someone was holding me down.  I was having to time my breathing and figure out when whatever it was felt weak and then I'd use all my strength and make a sudden body movement to shock myself back awake. All this happened within 45 mins because my 12:45 I was sitting up scared to death in my bed. Eventually I was too scared to sleep and watched youtube videos until five am. At around 6 I turned my phone on and received a bunch of pings ( I have a blackberry :(  I know) from my sister telling me to wake up. I called her and she had woken up in the night feeling that I was having the nightmare. I was pretty freaked out. I went to work and around 7 pm my siter calls me to tell me she had a bad migraine ( we both suffer from them, like BAD) and went to have a nap and then the nightmare happened to her. I tried to ignore it and slept fine since until just now. About 30 min ago I fell asleep and felt my body getting weak I was fully concious and could actually hear myself snoring lol. I then heard a freaky whispering in my head and forced my self to wake up. Thought for a second and realised "" Hey! There must be a subreddit for dreams"" so here I am. I know it sounds Crazy, but its true. I would appreciate if someone could give me even an idea of what is going on. Thanks.    Also sorry for any bad grammar or spelling.

There are three tiers of people.  The doctors, the some other ofvalue and there regular people.  
The doctors are supposed to help the people, the doctors are all girls.  It’s 2025 or something. 
The doctors are somehow hiding the entrance to the other areas so the kids don’t know they exist. 
The nicer the area, the better sleeping arrangements. The people in the bad area sleep on the ground and such.  
There are robots and people that are running the place but mainly robots I think.  Every so often the robots at random murder a bunch of the people in the lowest tier.  
If someone from a lower tier goes to a higher tier the robot sometimes comes to kill them but it doesn’t always work.
The robots have some sort of goal, probably protectionary, but it doesn’t always work.  
I think maybe the doctors are allowed to select like a few people each to bring into the room. 
Apparently they often bully for sexual favours or in return.  The doctors are pretty happy but the rest are pretty miserable.   
The main guy is supposed to be in the second area but somehow is convinced by one of the doctors to come to the main safest area.  None of the doctors seem very frightened.   Before a robot attack, the people from the main area (kids?) beg the main character to let them in but he is urged not to by the doctors.  The kids apparently did not realize that there was a safer room.  Many kids are killed by robots.  
Everyone has some sort of telecenetic powers but its very minimal.  Powers are boosted by blue gum or blue toothpaste that everyone loves but supply is running low.  
Somehow I know this doesn’t make sense, but if you eat a whole gigantic tube of it, from top to bottom, you like pretty much become the chosen one and gets great powers.  If someone else does the same thing I think than they become the one.  
Main characters powers is to like be able to give an instruction what to do (obviously stolen from bioshock.) 
The main character in a confused dream state isn’t sure if he’s suppose to be in tier 1 or tier 2, but is living in tier 1.   While no one else is there, one of the girls confides in him that she’s not actually supposed to be in tier 1 but actually tier 2/3.  This time the robots hear it and come and kill her. 
Main character realizes enough Is enough and eats the whole thing of blue power gel.  I don’t know why he didn’t do this before, but for some reason he didn’t. 
Now the robots are getting pissed and start coming in but the main character tells the one robot to kill the other and he does.  More and more like advanced robots (think transformer type robots) are coming in and main character takes control of more and more and gets like an army of robots and is telling all the robots to kill each other.  Now for some reason it's  like a party and everyone is excited about possibly getting out.   Main character for some reason is now trying to transfer his powers to someone else but there is not enough blue gel.  For whatever reason his powers are starting to wane.  When he goes back into the main room everyone, robots and people are gone.  He puts on his hood and walks through a few rooms, acting casual and no one really notices him.  He walks out onto the street and sees an LA that looks to be in rough shape. 
He (of course) sees someone he knows.  “Is this one of those distopian apolypses where all the building are burning?”  
“The buildings are burning but I wouldn’t worry too much about it.”  
Looking to the LA sky line, some buildings are broken leaning on each other, some are onfire and some is ok.  Things seem bad but people are still kinda leading normal dangerous lives.  
“I have to get to Toronto” says the main character.”  “That’s where we’re going” says the others and he goes with them.

(Possibly NSFW),8,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1gmj99/can_someone_please_interpret_my_16_year_old/,"So let's start off by saying I'm 16. I've never had a girlfriend, not much physical contact with girls, but I'm pretty okay with that.

So it started off with this weird dream I had while I was having a sleep over with my friend.

DREAM NUMBER 1

The dream started off with me basically in The Dark Knight. The joker was there and they were discussing some mob stuff.

It then somehow transitions to me being at this one camp I've been to before... but the entire place has a big rollercoaster type thing surrounding it.

Basically, the joker built the rollercoaster for some stupid reason and was controlling it. I saved the day.

Then, after I did that, there was this ""Olympic Event."" (They called it that but it was just a bunch of people from my school doing challenges)

At this event, there was a bunch of weird challenges. One was where a bunch of kids would stand in a crowd, and somebody would throw a tire at them. Whoever in the crowd flinches is out.

Elijah wood was one of the tire throwers, and he felt really bad so he dug a tunnel underground and rolled it down there so nobody would lose.

One of the times that the tire was thrown this girl that I know got hit.

Before I go on, I should describe her. I don't really have a big crush on her or anything. I used to HATE her, but then we started to get along and be humorous together. She's one of the only girls I'm not awkward around... but I've never had any sexual feelings towards her.

Anyways... she got hit with a tire, and as soon as she got hit, she got really mad, went up to me and lifted up her dress, showing me her vagina. I thought it was really fucking weird and I didn't know why. Then she just walked away.

After the event I went into my cabin and she was the only one there. She lifted up her dress again, smiled, and then jumped out the window.
I'm pretty sure something like this happened a few more times, but I don't remember.

I've had other dreams about specific people, and the dreams made no sense, too.

DREAM NUMBER 2

One involved Chloe Grace Moretz (who is my celebrity crush.) and starting in the dream I already knew her.

 She texted me inviting me to a restaurant, and she was there with her brothers and some stars of her newest movie. (which doesn't actually exist.)

She was acting really shy and sad. For some reason I decided to leave.

After I went back home I couldn't stop thinking about her, so I texted her. She said she wanted me to pick her up.

I did and I just immediately knew that I needed to take her to this Teen's Oscars sort of thing.

When we were driving there, I passed through this weird part of town. It was dark and there were tubes everywhere that were lit up. It sort of reminded me of futurama mixed with bioshock.

When I was in that part of town, I passed a building.

I said ""Is that where the oscars are? Are they today?""

""Yeah.""

""Why aren't you there?""

""Because I'm not 18.""

After she said this she started crying. I didn't know what to do so I kept driving.

So we arrived at the teen awards place and it looked like a big warehouse.

We go inside and it looks like a nightclub, but with bouncy castle type floors. We hang out there for a while and then she just keeps crying. I ask her why and she won't look/talk to me.

I take her home or something.

I woke up covered in sweat after that dream and couldn't stop thinking about her.

So... um. What the fuck is going on with me? Why am I having such weird dreams? And such specific ones, too?

My dreams used to be about being in the woods and being attacked by a bear or stealing a car and crashing it, but this?

Also, just so you know, I've posted this on /r/thisdreamihad but didn't get much help. So if you've seen this before, I just want you to know that I didn't steal it. That was me.

He is encouraging me to solve the problem and helping when he can. We work back and forth getting closer and closer to a solution to the ""problem"" we are writing. But his responses get further apart but our excitement is building. Finally I have the solution.. I get so excited and I write it out with exclamation points... 78!!! But he doesn't seem to get it. I write it out 2-3 more times and tap on the mirror. Then I realize hes written something but I can't understand it. So I back away a bit and realize hes been furiously scribbling a large picture of a rather horrific female face. Two words appear on the mirror... ""She's Coming!"" and I get this sense of urgency. The other side of the mirror starts to flicker and a banging starts up and I can just feel his need for me to get out of the room before she shows up.

1370009356.0,5,self.Dreams,1fek6l,"Lois Griffin shoving food into her vagina, hallucinations, and dismemberment.",7,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1fek6l/lois_griffin_shoving_food_into_her_vagina/,"I had a series of incredibly vivid dreams last night. The most interesting involving members of the Griffin family from the tv show Family Guy. There were other vivid dreams that took place before this, but they were less interesting, so I am starting with what I remember from this particular series of events.  
.....Suddenly I am spectating an extremely disturbing episode of the adult cartoon Family Guy. Lois Griffin, fully nude, begins frantically digging through a closet in the kitchen and proceeding to shove various food products inside of her vagina. Meanwhile, Stewie is sitting in his highchair behind her witnessing these events. As she is shoving more and more food into herself, her stomach begins to bulge like a pregnant woman. She then reaches into the pantry closet and pulls out an entire cooked turkey dinner. However, she struggles to fit such a large item into her vagina. At this moment Stewie says something along the lines of, ""Mommy I don't think your groin has a credit card slot.""  
.....At this part the scene begins to lose some of it's coherency, but I will describe it as best I can. Peter discovers Lois and questions her actions. The scene is now shown from Peter's point of view. Lois slowly turns around revealing her eyes are extremely dilated and a manic grin on her face. Peter carefully consoles her and persuades her to lay down in bed because she is ill. Now the scene is back in third-person. The scene shows Lois lying in bed with Peter standing next to her. He is trying to make her better by giving her something to drink. After she takes a drink she starts to hallucinate. The scene is still from a third person viewpoint, but I am witnessing Lois' version of reality. Peter's body disappears leaving only his arms floating in mid-air. The background of the scene is warping and distortion into ripples and waves while Peter's body changes colorfully back and forth between various geometric shapes. Lois becomes agitated and it appears her conditions is worsening.  
.....The scene is now first-person from Peter's point of view, no longer distorted. ""Honey I think you've had enough. I'm going to throw your drink out. I think it has gone bad."" There is a green soda can with strange markings sitting on the table beside the bed. Peter picks it up and slowly begins to walk out of the room and down the hall. Lois doesn't like this. Suddenly Lois appears out of bed, but she is no longer herself. Standing menacingly in front of Peter is a very tall, alien-like figure with dark beady, insect-like eyes. Her stomach is no longer bulging and she has a shiny multi-colored body. Peter begins to walk faster and faster, now running down the stairs while carrying the strange soda can. As he bolts out the door some of the soda spills into the air, some of it landing on Peter. (Internal Monologue/ Breaking the fourth wall) ""Oh crap, the soda spilled on me! I can feel myself changing...Just kidding. Nothing is going to happen. Wouldn't that be funny though?""  
.....Peter is now outside behind his home. The scene is still shown through Peter's eyes. Lois appears outside a few yards away from Peter, but she is no longer in alien form. Lois' condition has rapidly deteriorated, her appearance best resembles a cross between an extremely anorexic person and a homeless leper. Her face no longer resembles that of a woman, but rather a dead person. Her eyes are black holes in her face and her clothes are tattered and ripped. At this point Lois says something threatening to Peter in a deep manly voice. As Peter is standing there Lois suddenly rips her arm from her body and throws it at Peter, but he deflects her attack by defending himself with a trashcan lid. Somehow Lois then manages to hurl her other arm at Peter which he also dodges. Lois is now standing there with no arms, blood dripping from her sides where he arms were previously. Despite this disadvantage she is able to detach her penis and throw it at Peter. Lois, now coming to terms with her bodily condition, yells at Peter, ""WHY AM I STILL ALIVE!?"" Suddenly she charges towards Peter. Instinctively he grabs her/him by the neck and twists until her/his head comes off in his hands. The head is now skinless and resembles a decomposed skull. Peter runs over to the side of his home where he places the skull onto a compartment on the back of Stewie's tricycle. Stewie seems to know what to do and launches the skull into the sky.....As this happens the scene shows a view of the sky, which is also now a Capri-Sun commercial. This is where the dream begins to fade...various cartoon faces are swirling around in the sky doing random things. And for some reason it comes across as being a commercial targeting black people. At this point I wake up.

I posted a while back on the matter. Just to start things off with some info, I do keep a dream journal and have a dream about 1/3 nights give or take. In the last month close to 90% have become relevant in real life after having dreamed about certain events. I live in Oklahoma city, and my last dream was the night of may 18th. The subject was about Oklahoma getting devastated by a massive tornado, multiple casualties, and some vivid details. The two days following, everything was to the t, and even a very vivid image of me walking through the devastation left in the wake of a monster storm, standing near a destroyed building, at sunset turning around because someone called my name. That is a word for word quote from my dream journal on the morning of the 19th. About 30 hours before it hsppened. Just had my first dream since that one. Similar setting only its middle of the day and the building I live in. I'm completely unharmed in the dream, but others that I have never met who's faces I can see in vivid detail are. I can see it all in vivid detail and its eerily similar to my last dream. As soon as I awoke just a few moments ago I wrote it down and checked the weather, which I haven't done since last week. The reports show projected torndaic activity for this week. Any thoughts, ideas, interpretation welcome! Cause I'm nervous now.

Additionally, I'd like to add that all my dreams for as long as I can remember are always realistic in nature. By that I mean nothing ridiculous happens, I.e. flying, breaking the laws of gravity or physics, etc... My dreams are like memories that haven't happened yet. sometimes details like people or places are erroneous, but almost never words spoken by someone or actions that happen in my  dreams, so if you try to tell me its my subconscious telling me I have ""too much on my plate"", well revise your theory. I've accepted that I seem to predict future events in my life, just seeing what you guys thought about the my most recent dream.

I don't buy into that stuff, just thought it was a fun one to share. And before anyone asks, no, I didn't watch Wrong Turn recently : P

I was making a drive from my house in the northwestern corner or NC down to the flatlands to visit a friend. My car broke down in the middle of nowhere so I took to walking. I came across a small cabin a little ways off the trail and knocked on the door. A grizzled old man answered. As I explained my situation he threw me to the ground pinned me while another man bound my hands and feet. I blacked out.

When I came to I was tied to a post on the back porch of the cabin. Facing me were three men. They were discussing what they should do with me. Behind them in the yard was what looked like the edge of a cliff. I could hear the sound of falling water. Hanging around the roof of the porch were various farming tools, plows, saws, a hatchet, etc. 

One man went inside the cabin and I began speaking to the other two. They didn't speak very good english and had heavy appalachian dialects. I convinced them that I wasn't going to run and they untied me. As soon as the ropes were off I made my move. I hit the closest man with an upper cut to the chin, cracking it and causing him to hit the ground, motionless. Then I proceeded to brawl with the other, larger man. We exchanged several blows before I was able to get underneath him and take his legs out from under him, flipping him backwards over the railing of the porch. He landed head first on a rock and went unconscious. 

About that time I could hear the third man running through the cabin. I grabbed a hammer and a meat cleaver that were hanging near me. I hid by the door frame and as soon as the man stepped through I hit him with the hammer, but he grabbed it in mid swing. I let go and took off, leaping down the porch stairs and into the yard. He threw the hammer at me, striking me in the back. I turned and threw the cleaver at him, hitting him clean in the face. It stuck, killing him. 

By then they first man I hit had awakened and was chasing after me. I did the only thing I could do, I ran for the cliff edge not knowing what fate awaited me at the bottom. I took a mighty leap and fell about 50' into a plunge pool below a huge waterfall. The man did not follow. I grabbed a piece of wood and floated down river to safety.

Normally, I would have gotten up,  gotten ready for work, and spent the next hour or so carousing reddit.  Waking up before my alarm sounds is not an uncommon occurrence for me, and I normally take advantage of the unexpected free time.  


This morning felt different, however.  I don't know if I was tireder than on a usual morning, or if there was some other cause, but I simply rolled over and closed my eyes once again.  I had some trouble falling back asleep, and my brain started doing its best to convince me to get up.


As time passed, I began estimating the amount of time I had before my alarm would inevitably do its duty.  When I came to the conclusion that it would probably sound in 30 minutes, I decided to get up.  I went into the bathroom, took care of some mild but urgent business, and walked into my computer room to look at the weather forecast for the day.  


The door creaked a little as I opened it.  My heart shocked my system when I abruptly noticed a previously absent bed in the room on which lay my sleeping brother.  My computer and desk were gone, my bookshelves were gone, and my TV stand was gone.  In its place were the exact items my brother had in his bedroom two years ago when he had lived in that apartment with me.  Realizing that my brother was no longer my roommate, nor was anyone at all, in fact, I immediately knew that I was dreaming. This realization annoyed me.  I didn't like that I had been so tricked by my own mind. 


I concentrated on waking up.  


With success, I opened my eyes for the third time that morning.  Reassured, but still mildly shaken from such a vivid, unforeseen encounter with the past, I swung my legs over the side of my bed and sat on the edge.


""Headooe..."" said a *cutesy*, familiar voice over my shoulder.  It was my girlfriend's way of saying ""hello"" to me, and she often did it in the morning.


""Hey,"" I replied, unexpectedly feeling a wave of uncertainty and unease flood my consciousness.  When I realized what was amiss, I felt myself become physically astonished.  What really stuck out to me was how happy she was, and then how that happiness turned to an uneasy confusion, and then to a downright fear at my reaction to her presence in my bed.


I couldn't bring myself to say any more, despite her asking me what was wrong several times.  I got up and left the room, looking around at my surroundings.  My fish was there, Walter.  That was reassuring.  A piece of myself, of normalcy.  But everything else was not normal.  Her *stuff* was everywhere in the apartment.  Her tall, oak bookshelves, her overly large flat-screen TV that we had fought about when she bought it, the table we had set up as a coffee table...they were all present.  There they sat, despite my having spent the last week and a half growing accustomed to their absence after she moved out.  


A sudden terror came over me, the kind of terror that can only come from staring absolute uncertainty in the face.  It was a terror that stemmed from an utter loss of confidence in my sense of soundness of mind.  But a thought occurred to me at that moment.  I remembered the dream I had just had, wherein my brother was back in his old room.  I realized that my mind had tricked me again.  A profusion of various emotions succeeded one another through my brain.  First, relief that I wasn't losing my mind.  Then, annoyance at having been fooled again, and then a frustration that it had taken so long for me to realize this.  


I concentrated on waking up.


Once again successful, I opened my eyes for the fourth time.  This time, I was prepared for *it* to happen again.  I sprang out of bed and ran out into the living room.  Walter was gone.  I immediately knew that I was stuck in another dream.  I barely noticed the random pieces of furniture that sat around the living room.  Furniture that wasn't mine, nor was it ever mine.  The couch was strewn with text books from subjects I hadn't ever studied.  I cast them aside and sat abruptly down in their place, taking a deep breath.  


I concentrated on waking up.


I met failure, and succumbed to another wave of fear.  I tried again, concentrating as hard as I could muster on waking up, but nothing happened.  I was still sitting on the couch next to the unrecognized text books among the unrecognized furniture.  Once again, I was losing a battle with incomprehensible confusion.  I began to question whether or not that was my actual reality and I somehow didn't remember getting rid of my fish, moving in this extra furniture, and apparently taking different classes.  But I knew this wasn't true.  For some reason, I was completely sure that this was a dream.  


This sureness brought with it a new set of confused questions buzzing through my mind.  Why couldn't I wake myself up?  Could it be that I would never wake?  Maybe, I was in a coma or some other medical condition-induced, endless sleep.  I had no answers to these questions, but I did know one thing for certain.  I knew that I had my alarm set and I knew that its time was coming.


So, I became resolved to wait.  Whether it was a naivete stemming from hopelessness or an actual confidence, I simply *knew* my alarm would wake me up.  So, I stayed where I was on that imaginary couch, trapped in my own mind.


Every minute crawled by and I didn't try to keep track of them.  Time seemed to pass in my dream in equal speed as reality.  Still, I waited, unmoved.

I will be getting a roommate for my next lease, and the furniture and books must have represented my mind's prediction of his presence.

On what I always thought was a separate note, for as long as I can remember, I've also never been one who took very many naps.  With the exception of when I'm sick, I also would estimate that I typically only take less than 10 naps throughout the year.

Lately, the amount of naps I've been taking has been slowly increasing and almost proportionally, so has my remembering of dreams.  They're still very short and usually lack depth, but I'm remembering them more is the point.

My question: has anybody ever read anything or had any personal experience in line with this? That is, that dream remembrance is more common in a nap rather than typical sleep?

In the dream, I'm at the bottom of a hill. I look up on the hill and there's a large steel building. Kind of like a garage. I approach the building and there's a man leaning up against it. As I get closer, he turns towards me, and my stomach turns. I know him, but I can't see his face. I do know that I have a strong distaste for him. I walk past him and he says to me, ""Don't go any further. He's waiting for you inside. You'll die if you go past the entrance."" Then I see him (more like feel him - he radiates what I can only describe as an aura in blue). ""He"" is standing with a knife at the edge of the entrance. I keep walking as the man behind me begs and pleads for me to stop. I pass the entrance and immediately feel him behind me. The blade's at my throat. I see it bite into my flesh. 

Transition

I'm in a school building. I have an overwhelming feeling of terror. I have to get out of here. I start trying various doors around the premises. All are locked. I reach a hallway eventually that has green velvet carpet covering everything but the doors. One door has a light fixture above it. I go to the door and try the handle and then I feel them. There's a class full of... things in there. At the head of the room, one of them stands, turned towards the door. The rest are just staring at the door from their seats. There's at least 30 of them. I feel their hatred. They don't want me here. I turn and run. 


Transition

I'm back to the original setting, except I'm inside the steel building now. There's a pile of debris behind me and very little light. Suddenly there's a piercing scream coming from the debris pile. I frantically dig into it, trying to help or find the source of the sound. Then I realize that the scream isn't coming from the rubble. It's everywhere. It stops abruptly and a light shines over the pile. I move around it and come to a corner of the building. There are 12 doors, 6 to the left and 6 to the right of the corner. On the far right, a light fixture is above the door. Every other door has a black X burned into it. They have light fixtures too, but the light is off. The fixtures look old and rusted. I go to the door with the light and try the handle. It's not locked and I feel someone beyond the door. I can't seem him like I did the others, I just know he's there. As I turn the handle to enter, I hear ""I've been waiting for you.""

I don't know if the aliens did it, or they brainwashed someone to do it, or some prankster had horrible timing. Anyway, it scared people shitless, but then found out it was fake and went about their day. The next day, alien ships were in the sky, but this time, nobody cared because they thought it was fake. The ships landed and out came truck-like vehicles with blue/green ion blasters. I was watching from a sort of omniscient view until about now, now I was put into my body and started running for my life. By now everybody had realized this was real. I made it to a large ocean port, and was running past people (mostly normal people, others trained professionals like cops) building up defenses like setting up machine guns. I yelled at them while I was running past that it was no use. There were probably 1,000 people at this line of defense. I ran through a building and ran up to one of two docks. I was with this kid and his father, and the kid had some sort of communication device that he had to plant in an underground bunker. He had no idea where he was going, so I showed him the way. After this, I ran out to the end of the dock. I looked back, and the aliens had crushed the first line of defense. Now the 200 yards between me and the aliens was just a huge mass of people running for their lives, jumping over the large amount of small storage containers that basically turned the docks area into an obstacle course. Some went into the bunker, others just went to the farthest end of the 2 docks as possible (the other dock that I wasn't on was taken over almost immediately, sadly). I found the only (I thought) boat. I picked up the father and son from earlier and got out of there. Well, I think. Because at this time I somehow and for some reason fell unconscious, and again went into the omniscent point of view at the docks. The last wave of surviving people were about at the end of the docks, the aliens just 30 feet away from them. One man held what looked like a trigger. He fell onto the edge of the dock and held on (there were 100s of people clinging to the edge of the dock so as to stay above the water, don't know why), and he pulled the trigger, and the communication device the son planted earlier apparently also functioned as a unidirectional explosive, as the entire area from the bunker to past where the alien ships landed was obliterated, but left the humans safe. Now I woke up with my arm snagged in a boat, and my arm was the only thing keeping me with the boat and alive, as the rest of my body was in the water, being dragged as it was being driven very fast. I looked on the boat and saw 2 hot girls I know. I pulled myself up and they screamed. I asked what happened and how I got here. They had no idea how I got here, but we had defeated the aliens. We were heading to an island that I could just see on the horizon. There was one other boat in the distance heading there.

 I have no idea what happened to the father and son, nor how I ended up on the 2 girls' boat.

One of them I woke up thinking it had actually happened and sat there upset about it for quite awhile before falling asleep again and having the second one. They really ruined my morning. 

**For the first one -** 

I was at school again (even though I haven't been in school for about 4 years). I never went to school with my current girlfriend but in this dream I did. During recess I was out at the back circle street area where the parents pick up their kids. I started smoking some weed (It's been even longer since I smoked weed then it's been since I've been in school) and I got way too high. It's like it must have been laced with something. Then all of a sudden I am stumbling across the playground and everybody knows that I am high and they are taunting me about it. I can not form a coherent sentence and they begin taunting me about that too. I'm not just hearing them, but their voices are actually echoing in my head and reverting back on each other until they all pile up and I can not even single out one voice from the crowd of voices in my head. People jeering and laughing and calling me names. 

Finally I run off and back to the circle parent pick up area (I can still hear the voices in my head) and I see my girlfriend look back. We lock eyes and I know that she knows that I was smoking pot (she would NOT like that very much) and what happened on the playground. She looks scared of me like because I am high I might hurt her or something. Then she takes off running away from me towards her car. I chase after her as fast as I can but she gets in the car and drives away. 

After that I woke up. When I finally went back to sleep the dream that waited for me was even worse. 

**The second dream -**

I was at some kind of concert hall for a band performance of some kind and my girlfriend was supposed to meet me there the next day. I was sitting there practicing and this girl that I hadn't seen in forever walks in. I had no idea what she was doing there. (I had a huge crush on this girl for the longest time when we were younger but I never went out with her because she lived too far away for us to be able to see each other often. We talked a lot back then on the phone and computer. One day she told me that she was dating this girl that she had met and was a lesbian. We still talked a lot for years after that but eventually just fell out of contact.)

So here she is and she walks up and starts telling me how much she has missed me and I give her a quick ""How've you been?!"" hug but she holds on extra long. I look up and she brushes her cheek against mine, making for my lips. I subtly dodge and tell her I've been in a serious relationship for over a year. She runs her hand down my leg and starts fondling me and saying something that I suppose was supposed to be persuasive (I don't remember what she was saying.) while massaging my package. I push away from her and feel this really heavy and illogical feeling of being ashamed of myself for ""cheating"" on my girlfriend by ""letting"" her touch me like that (I probably would not have felt so at fault in real life, it wouldn't make sense. But in the dream I had this really intense feeling about it). I begin to think that she might say that I tried to rape her or something and I might get in trouble so I'm really worried. 

The next morning my girlfriend shows up and for some reason I am scared to tell her what happened. I'm trying to get through the day without running into the girl when I see the girl's mom walking around looking really upset (The girl's mom and I were pretty close. She is a really nice lady). I think ""Oh fuck, my worries were right"" and I turn and start to walk away. The lady starts coming towards me and I slip into a room but she sees and comes in after me. I try to explain what actually happened and she tells me she knows and she is soo sorry that that happened and starts crying and hugging me. My girlfriend walks in and asks what is going on and I have to explain the whole thing to her as well. 

I guess these dreams aren't THAT bad after writing them out and trying to explain them, but emotions are strange things in dreams and all of the emotions involved in these particular dreams were amped up by like a thousand and felt really overwhelming.

I explained how nothing would ever come of those feelings because I was dating someone and moving soon and so I would never see him again. As I dried off in a bedroom, in front of a large bed, I noticed a long, thick black hair protruding from my back. It was very thick and stiff toward my back and tapered off toward the end. I bent it near the root to see if it hurt, and when it didn't I then proceeded to pull it out painlessly. I continued to dry off and then I noticed a large horn in my back. It had a small split at the end. After freaking out a little, I shifted it in my back and it slipped out equally as painlessly and left nothing but an indentation in its place. The horn was black and split toward the middle, but came together for a while and split again toward the top. Upon further inspection, the split was twisted and at the beginning of the split was a top and bottom row of teeth. Which I noted were better than my own. I dropped it on the bed and the split came apart. Looked like an old animal bone. I picked up the hair from the end of the bed and placed it by the horn pieces on the bed and then woke up feeling like I needed to scratch my back.

1366590943.0,5,self.Dreams,1ctzik,A fantasty-like dream turned sentimental,8,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1ctzik/a_fantastylike_dream_turned_sentimental/,"I pre-written this out on other forums to share there. Lots of people praised my writing, saying it was very engaging. Since I now have the confidence of sharing this, I'll go ahead and Copy and Paste the writing:

Although it's mostly blurry from my memory, I will try my best to recall and type this out. The dream first started off a bit random but then it gets more in depth and actually started to feel like real life.

The dreams starts off a bit random. I was known around the world as an all powerfull witch/demon hunter that can choose either to execute them or be their saviour and force their master to release their contract with them so they can lead a normal life. It sounds like something straight from a manga/anime to me. But then it starts getting more sentimental.

After 10 years(time goes by fast in a dream), I built up a name being the last and most brutal executioner left, with the nickname known as The Shinigami(similar to the Grim Reaper in American culture). I had an execution to Freeing ratio of about 800K to 0. That all changed during this event. I was on the job, being a complete badass flying around this area where there was complaints of a powerful witch and a demon child causing havoc around a village(the dream takes place around 1800s sceneary). By the time I arrived, they were being driven out by the villagers. Still having to do the job, I swooped in and snatched them from the ground and flew off to the main town to start the ceromony.

I paid no mind to them as I flew over there since it felt like I did this multiple times already. The flight was eerily quiet. I felt the witch gaze upon me, heard a gasp, and when I looked towards her in my arm, her face was turned away. The hair was unique but familiar to me. Most witches had straight or wavy hair, similar to all the villagers, but she had long curly hair. I knew someone who had such hair in high school but paid it no mind. We arrive to the town center to start the ceremony. I descended down while the two of them are still in my arms, making sure I do not let go at all. The demon child looked like any demon child(well to the dream me) Budding horns and a whip like tail. I turn to the witch to see her face but she still refused to show it. Being so used to talking to witches and demons, I joked around with her. I told her, ""Mind showing me your face? I'll get a villager kid for you and you can eat them before I execute or free you."" I heard a small giggle and the witch faced me, slowly parting her hair.

What I saw was a big shock to me. Behind all the hair was a girl I knew named Caroline, the same girl I knew in High School. She looked around the crowd of villagers, gestured at a random child, smiled at me and said, ""I want that kid!"" I immediately went into a rage. I screamed with all my might to summon their master. Caroline pleaded to not summon him while the child just looked sullen. A burst of flame appeared before me. The flame slowly turned black and formed a devil-like being: pure black clothing, pale skin, red sunken eyes, elongated fangs, and tattered bat wings. When he took shape, he smiled at the child. He said, ""Hello son. It's been a pretty long time!"" ""8 f*cking years!"" proclaimed the child. The master just laughed and turned to Caroline. ""Have you been treating him well?"" She started screaming and thrashing about, constantly cursing him. This started to piss me off. 

I did what no executioner/freer did for over 100s of years. There is a mutual agreement that it's the witch's/demon's fault for making a contract with the evil beings and they should be punished. The evil beings are just doing what is in their nature. However, this did not matter to me. I let go of the witch and demon child and started choking the master. A look of fear came across his eyes, he constantly tried to escape with his flames but I did not let him. It constantly burned me but I ignored the pain. I finally had my breaking point and snapped his neck. The villagers looked in fright at the sight of this. Caroline and the demon child stood in awe at the sight of their dead master.

It is said when an executioner/freer kills the master in a fit of rage, all the evil energy from the dead master invades your body, slowly turning you into an evil being yourself. A huge jolt a pain came rushing inside me and I pass out. I woken up to a scene of a destroyed village, humans dead everywhere. Half awake, I try standing up and notice I was then surrounded by a legion of witches and demons. They knelt down to my presence. Apparently, I become their new master for the old one was killed by me. The only one standing was Caroline and the demon child, still awe strucken.

I became conscious of my surroundings after a few minutes of standing. A single tear flowed from Caroline's eye. I took everyone's contract and destroyed them all, freeing everyone. A cheer of joy was heard from them as they slowly turned back into humans. There was one contract I couldn't destroy though. It was Caroline's contract but I was wondering why the demon child wasn't human anymore for the only contract left was Caroline's. Using all my power as an evil being, I forcibly ripped the contract, which felt like trying to rip steel into two. Caroline coughed up blood as the contract ripped while the demon child followed suit. I felt my life force slowly exiting my body but all the witches and demons I recently freed, still knowing magic, each gave some of their life force to me. Enough for me to stay alive.

I awoken again half awake next to Caroline and the child's limp bodies. The villagers of the next village over heard the news and decided to hunt me down. I hear shouting of my name from a mob and decided to run. Without thinking, I took Caroline and the child on my back and tried to fly. I fell miserably to the ground after the attempt. ""Shit, I can't fly anymore."" I thought. I picked them up again and started running. I kept running and running. I already passed the angry mob of villagers but I kept running. I ran what felt like miles until I reached my own secluded home.

I take a rest, kneeling down while leaning against the wall. I completely forgot about Caroline and the child on my back and just fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw Caroline and the child huddled together on my bed, sleeping away. A gentle smile came across my face. I slowly stroked Caroline's hair and fell asleep.

This is where the dream started getting blurry. I don't remember exact details but I got the general gist of this sequence. It was a 3 year timespan of Caroline slowly trying to trust me. I try to come to terms I lost all my executioner/freer powers and that I am now human. I find out the child's name is Zachary and he slowly starts seeing me as a father figure. Caroline finally starts trusting me after seeing how I treated Zach as my own child. We fell in love, she got a job to pass time while all my funds from 10 years of being an executioner/freer can sustain us for the rest of our lives.

Caroline comes home after working, seeming a bit depressed. I come over to console her, asking her what's wrong. She said it's finally time to discuss what happened to her years back. The year I became a executioner/freer was the year she was captured by the now dead evil being. She was raped while Zach was the resulting child. She felt guilty about keeping the secret from me for so long. I told her that I didn't care that happend, as long as she is ok now. She decided to go on my back in a piggy back ride like hold. I turn around to look at her but she hid her face. ""Go kneel down beside the wall and fall asleep on it like you did before..."" she whispered. I asked her if she was ok and said it might be very uncomfortable. She reassured me, saying, ""I like this feeling the most..."" I complied to her demand and we both fell asleep like how we did when I first brought her there. I woke up earlier than her, Caroline still sleeping on my back. I gently take her to my bed and laid her down carefully. I quietly called Zachary over and asked if he can sleep with his mother for ol time sakes. He complies, adding in he's sleepy anyways. They huddle together like how they did years back while I went to bed on a separate bed I gotten where I fell asleep.

I slowly awaken by a soft warm breathe tickling my ear. I slowly turn around to see Caroline cuddling next to me. The same gentle smile came across my face again and whispered in her ear, ""I love you."" Half awake yet aware I said it, she sleepily gazed at me and a little smile came across her face while she whispered, ""I love you too."" She gave me a little kiss while she fell back asleep. Life felt bliss on that little moment. I fell back asleep in my dream, feeling as content as can be.


The dream ended and I awoke in my own bed, cold and alone. I frantically turn around to see if Caroline is behind me, of course not being there. A single tear came from eye. I whispered to myself it was just a dream, even though it felt so real. I finally swallowed the fact, it was just a dream. I went to the bathroom, washed my face off and came here to type this out. This dream felt so real and I truly wished it happend. I never had a dream felt so meaningful to me. I felt the need to just... vent it out. I may seem like a betafag right now, but if you took the time to actually read all this, thank you.

Its kind of startled me somewhat because I don't think about her during the day or anything. I can imagine you probably know where this is going. However, I will say that nothing sexual has happened in the dreams. Still, I wake up feeling a bit disturbed by it. 

In my dreams, there is usually no plot. She randomly appears. However, its got slightly more ""physical"" with each dream. The last dream we were sort of ""wrestling"" on the ground or she grabbed me in a playful semi flirtatious way. I realize how dumb this sounds. I'm just trying to get the most details out. As silly as it sounds, I don't want these to go any further. She is like some random figure that decided to show up in my dreams totally unwanted like that guys wife in Inception. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is dream anxiety a real thing. I'm 23 years old. I understand that dreams are totally random. At the same time, it is somewhat disturbing. I suppose its no different than being afraid of having nightmares which is rare for me. I don't know.

1363942328.0,6,self.Dreams,1asged,This dream has disturbed me since I woke up several hours ago. Sexual so NSFW. ,8,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1asged/this_dream_has_disturbed_me_since_i_woke_up/,"I would like to preface this explanation of my dream with the fact that my boyfriend likes to wake me up with sex a lot. I work the night shift so often he'll wake me up for sexy-time (we live together and have for two years). Yesterday he woke me up and we 'fooled' around. I then went back to sleep.    
    
In my dream I'm waking back up to him wanting sexy time again. I laugh and say that's a lot to ask, and I'm complaining about being tired. He pulls out a rather large dildo (IRL we don't have one/don't need one), and says he wants to try it out on me. He says he wants to use it  and himself on me at the same time. I'm surprised but decide to go with it.   
    
 As things progress I'm looking at the ceiling and start noticing these weird rips where paint should be. I continue to look and start trying to point it out to him, and then I see a face and a camera in one of the rips above me. I shove him off and scream. He starts explaining he joined some sex channel for money (IRL we are short on money), and thought this could be a way to earn some extra money. I tell him I want to be alone and I fall asleep in the dream.    
   
THen I wake up in the dream, the rips/cracks in the ceiling are gone but the dildo has been placed in my top drawer of my dresser. I'm starring at it thinking I'm really awake. I start to wonder what the hell is going on. Part of me was rationally explaining that I had dreamed so the dildo shouldn't be in my top dresser. I can't find him in our room.    
    
I walk into the living room and I see my roommate and he has guests over one of whom brought a dog along to play with mine. IRL my dog is a ball hog so this girl brought tons of tennis balls over. I'm laughing at how many balls my dog has in mouth (IRL the most he has held is 3) and he starts to spit out ball after ball (about 5-6). Part of my rational side kicks in again and I know this isn't right.    
    
Somehow I'm once again waking up in this dream (not sure what the segue way was) and I immediately run to my top dresser and the dildo is gone. I search the apartment my roommate acts as he would in real life. Then I find my boyfriend and I start argueing with him, he runs out and I tell him never to come back (something I would never do in real life).    
    
And for about the fifth time I'm once again waking up in this dream, and sure enough there are the cracks on the ceiling and there is the dildo in the top drawer. I run out of the apartment and start running around the town like an insane woman. I finally decide to get a grip and just go back to my apt (in the dream) and where my building should be is a different building marked ""Book Mapping"".    
    
The rational side is apparently really fighting to wake me up at this point because part of my thinking was ""This would be satans work, to confuse and change your world every time you went to sleep"" I walk into this 'book mapping' building. There are several desks and a table covered in pastries and my anxiety in this dream has gone from high to intolerable.  I slam my hand down on the desk and say ""Where is my apartment building? It's supposed to be here! And what the hell is book mapping?"" THe guy is looking at me confused so I start crying and I say ""I don't know how I got here at all. I'm lost and scared.""    
    
He points to a water cooler and suggests I get some water. The rational side starts to really kick in and I decide to get some water and if it's cool and refreshing I'll know I'm really awake. I walk to the cooler and shakily pour myself a cup. It's delicious and it's like mana from heaven. I pour myself several cups and a guy comes to stand by me. I slap him in the chest and ask ""Have you ever drank water in a dream and been refreshed?"" He says ""No.""    
    
And THAT was when I woke up in real life. I remember how cool and refreshing that water was in my dream, and I have never ever to my recollection had that happen before. I honestly was losing my sanity in the dream because in the dream- the dream would act like I was walking up in reality and then that I was waking up in dreamland. For some reason this is really bothering me. Anyways I'll let you guys decide what to make of it cause I don't get it. And it took me about an hour to truly believe I was awake and with the conscious world.

Later I heard her and another adult talking (I never knew who this other adult was) and that my mom had only 4 months to live do to cancer. I burst in to the room, tears streaming down my face, yelling at her for hiding this for so long. I yelled at her that she did this to herself (It was lung cancer) and that she just wanted an easy out (she felt stuck in a marriage). Horrible things to say, but I can't control my dream.

Now, in real life she's a heavy smoker. I'm sure it's about a pack-a-day. This dream really has me on edge about her health lately, but she refuses to stop smoking. I know it's hard. I stopped smoking about a month ago. I still get urges.

I was trying to get some booze from there by stealing it, but there were too many people. I was looking for the beer aisle but it wasnt where i remembered it from a previous dream, so i looked at some wine i could try to steal. I was wearing a hoodie so it would be easy i thought. 

I was approached by an old lady who was working at the store. ""You're eighteen arent you."" I freaked out that she knew my age so i lied ""i'm actually 24"". She said ""can i see an id?"" And i said ""not with me"" and shes like ""oh really... you should apply for a job here"". I was like ""yeah im not actually from here"" and she said ""ok well without an ID i cant let you be here"". As we walked out of the grocery store area we were near the casinos restaurant bathroom area 

She walked me away and i was in front of her. I felt a cold finger go into the top of my ass crack. I freaked out and turned around and this old fucking lady had tried to stick her finger up my ass. She laughed and pointed to the bathrooms and said something to the extent of ""you should check out the bathrooms!""

I took her advice and i walked into the big handicapped stall and saw what resembled those japanese toilets that sprays your ass clean, and so i pressed a button on it and stood back to see what happens with it. I saw a big sharp phallic robot dick come out and it staryed violently jerking up and down, squirting water out the top. It was made to violently fuck you in the ass. I was grossed out and thought ""i definitely cant take a shit here, ouch...""

For some reason i had a raging hard on. I looked down at my dick and really wanted to furiously masturbate, but the gap between the door in the stall was big enough that i was worried people would see me. I instead started smoking weed. I smoked a lot of weed in that stall, until the bathroom was overly foggy.

As i was finishing the weed, i saw like 25 black dudes and girls come in. An old white lady peeked her head in my stall and i blew smoke in her face. When i opened the stall, it was all black people sittling around on couches and tables in the bathroom, laughing and talking. They all seemed pretty cool but i started walking out.

There was one skinny looking white guy there sitting at a table. He said ""whats that smell?"" Across the room, a black guy in his 20s said ""that shit smells SWEET yo!"" I promptly informed them ""thats that dallas texas dank son!"" A big relaxed looking old guy said ""that hydro!"" And i was like ""yeah dude"". Another voice said ""yo why the fuck are we talkin bout this shit?"" And i got out of there, not even closing the door behind me. 

I started thinking ""fuck im getting out of here"", feeling way too high and paranoid. I walked over to the table in a restaurant where my family and some freinds were and i looked at my mom and asked ""hey when are we leaving?"" She instantly got up and told everyone at the table she was quickly taking me home. As we walked out a loud ear piercing alarm roared as we were like 30 feet from the exit. My mom said ""doesnt it seem suspicious that the alarm is going off as your leaving?"" And i was thinking ""fuck im in trouble"" when the alarm stopped.

Well, in part it is... but now it also functions as a garrison and a scientific research center. There are a group of people gathered and somehow we are fully aware (and accepting) of the imminent Muppet Apocalypse.

There is a way to stop it by use of an old code which is conveniently stored in my old locker. So with only moments to spare a small contingency of us rush to the hall where my old locker was.

Of course... this is a locker I had over 20 years ago so naturally I do not remember the combination to my lock. As I am struggling with the combination we start hearing bangs on the windows and doors and the occasional hilarious voice (which isn't so hilarious in this situation).

Finally I get the locker open somehow (it seems the order of numbers was marked) and grab a slip of paper with the code. It is too late. There are several screams as people are, I assume, smothered in Muppetness... (I never really did find out how the Muppets killed their victims).

Myself and one survivor run back through the halls hoping to make it to the research room. As we are going we see Muppets banging on the windows. Then they make it through and are in the halls. Luckily, as they are pretty light it is easy to push past them.

Wait... there's a bear behind me. I look back and... oh, it's a real bear... it must be on our side.

Suddenly that big Muppet bear, Bobo, comes in through one of the doors and smashes into the real bear. As they are tearing each other up we look down the hall towards the research room and it is littered in Muppets.

Getting the same idea, we rush past the fighting bears and out into the open. There is a forest off in the distance so we head for there hoping to hide away long enough to get through the carnage.

As we are running towards the woods I hear a battle cry in a very family voice. I look to my right to see Big Bird rushing towards me like an insane football player. I go low and rush towards his scrawny legs hoping with some luck that he will trip over me. As he is about to trample me I push up and he flies over me, does a summer-sault in the air and lands on his feet.

For whatever reason - I guess he just goes with the momentum - he continues to rush in the direction he was facing... I shrug and continue for the woods.

Again, another familiar yell. I look back... Oh shit... it's Statler... or Woldorf... well, in any case - one of the old brothers. The other is thankfully no where to be seen.

I hope to lose him in the long grass near the forest... but when I get some distance in the grass I still here the sound of grass being pushed behind me. This old bastard is determined.

So, I decide to ambush him. My friend seems to get the idea and takes up position beside me. We grab him as he rushes pass and an great struggle begins... finally we are able to pin him and we simply pull him apart in fluffy Muppetty stuffing goriness.

Sweaty and terrified... my friend and I look at each other... sigh... and turn to go deeper into the forest...

I will write this in the third person in order to make it a bit more entertaining, referring to myself as my Reddit username.

There was an eerie stillness to the air that sent a jolting shiver down MrBootylove's spine. It was dark, and he was alone. As he took his first few slow, nervous steps through his empty house, he somehow knew that something was terribly wrong. 

Just as MrBootylove was about to reach his bedroom, the phone began to ring. He jumped in horrible surprise as the abrasive tone echoed through the house. He swallowed hard in an attempt to control his adrenaline before picking the phone up and placing it to his ear.  ""Hello?"" squeaked MrBootylove, ""Who is this?"" There was a pause of silence which stretched on an eternity. He was mere moments from hanging up the phone when he got his response. ""Get ready 'cuz I'm coming in."" The voice was low and guttural, yet it's rage filled intensity was enough to fill any man with paralyzing terror. There was a click, then silence. MrBootylove had recognized the voice on the other end. It was an indistinguishable voice he'd heard all through out his life. It was Harrison Ford.

He dropped the phone, and immediately raced through his house, locking every door and window he passed. He knew that this was futile against Mr. Ford, but maybe it would buy him some time. Enough time to call the police, or get a weapon. He proceeded from door to door, window to window until the whole house was secured. While still frightened, yet he felt a bit easier knowing that he couldn't just walk right in. Then he remembered. He'd forgotten to lock the bathroom window. Before he could react he heard the clicking sound of his assailant cocking his gun before cold steel connected gently with the back of his head...

I was walking home from school, it was a day where my friends were off doing stuff so I was walking home alone. Scattered like leaves, all across the ground were orange Wise potato chips that someone had been eating the day before the dream.  I muttered fairly loudly, ""We could at least clean this up"" Some girl gave me an odd look. I thought at the time that 500+ chips on the ground outside school was a usual occurrence and moved on. (don't worry it gets better)

I started walking and found walking beside me Freddy and a girl I sort of know named Maliha. Freddy and I were in band together. A car blasting music drove by, I immediately thought it was a band song named clocks, and asked Freddy if that was really the song. Maliha then replied that it was: Badly Drawn Boy, suddenly the music I heard in the dream switched to badly drawn boy.

The car blasting music drove onward and now coming on to the left of us was a dirty white sedan, and a white SUV. The sedan was an old honda and the SUV was a ford or a GMC. So the SUV keeps pushing the dirty white sedan off the road a bit. It was summer time so the windows were down and I could see inside the car. There was a guy driving, a girl in passenger and another guy in the back. They were all really excited how the driver was being so daring and possibly crashing the sedan. 

They were only like 22 or something and I could tell that they were at the level of stupid person where the idea of killing someone or breaking something is as cool as it is when they make a movie. They don't see any consequences. 

Eventually the sedan goes down a side street and the SUV stays on 5th avenue. I forget about the people I just saw and just keep walking. We get to 9th street, I live on 11th so I was about home. 9th street goes both ways so when we were crossing, there were cars waiting. One of which was the SUV. I knew then it was a stupid idea, but I walked forward to here the scraping of tires. 

Here's where it gets weird. The first time I had this dream, I fell backwards and the car missed me. In the second dream I fell and was only scraped a bit by the front fender. After both crashes the dream ended, so I never got to see the faces of the people in the car afterward, I wish I could see that they were scared straight after they actually hitting me, but you and I both know that their faces weren't worried.

Just to clarify, this wasn't a recurring dream I face nightly, both of these dreams happened in one night, I had both of these in the same night sequentially. To tell you the truth I'm not sure if this dream was meant for me, If it was meant for you, let me know.

I created this thread because recently and over several nights I have had a series of dreams where I was part of some sort of story, seemingly a children's book, where I was a wolf with the ability to speak. There was also a native american, in my mind a sort of shaman, also two young brothers, a herculean (but also very intelligent) young adult man, a little girl, and many others I do not have the memory to describe.

In the first dream we were in the grasslands and I can't remember why we had to leave, but I remember the native american playing with many potions and insects. 

 The second night that this story occured in my dreams I also remember little except that I ended up wounded, or in a coma, or something that incapacitated me. Little changed the third time I had the dream, I remember almost nothing, but I do remember being on an ice flow and all seemed well having been resuscitated by the shaman.

Last night I dreamt that on our ice flow the residents where we had stopped. Tried to build a cylindrical tower, made up of smaller cylindrical parts, as if there was a need to just reach a certain height to make it to safety. All of the residents but I, the shaman, the young man, and the girl, rushed into the tower in a sort of panic. As they reached the top of the tower it collapsed and they fell into the sea. I called for the young strong man to pull the part that they were all in out of the sea and with his immense strength he retrieved it.
I peered inside and there were nothing but corpses, I saw the young brothers clasping hands. The shaman, the man, and the girl, in their grief, decided to all take something the shaman had concocted during my first dream to commit suicide. I did not argue with them on this but I decided to go my own way, saying that as a wolf I could live without them. I made my way awkwardly away from them as I heard them all coughing, and woke up.

I have had this sort of episodic structure of dreams happen many times before, but this one takes the cake, as I find myself feeling like I need resolution in the story. Does this happen to many of you?

A small metal being jumps across this stream of lava to the other side. The rock surrounding it and the sky is a dark purple. It is greeted my other small metallic beings. For some reason, anything that orients itself with the color of this dream or the feeling of this dream in real life, gives me a strange sense of dejavu. It's not normal dejavu. It's almost like a vision. And in these visions it always ends woth something that can kill me. they only last 2 to 3 seconds. But this has been happening since I was a little kid. In that 2 to 3 seconds if I change what I'm looking at or switch what I saw In this ""vision"", I get an elated feeling that I just saved myself from dying. And in some cases I can stop the vision from happening by looking at something different.

Every house looked exactly the same, and it was one of those weird cut-out pre-form houses they have in those communities they can build in like a month.  The sky was cloudy and there were no signs of life at all, not even trees or bushes.  I pull up to one house and there's a couple of unfamiliar people standing around outside.  I'm going there to shoot a movie.  I pull up and they tell me that I have to take (of all people) Jim Carey to another place where we'll actually be filming.  So he comes up to my car, and jumps in my arms and asks me to put him in the car, but I end up slipping on the grass and drop him.  He's not hurt or upset, but he's like, “We'll have to try again tomorrow.  See you then!”  And everyone goes inside.

So I'm driving away again, down a big thoroughfare with lots of traffic and shops on the sides of the road.  The clouds are crazy-looking; the sun is peeking through, but it's almost all clouds in the sky, with weird shapes reaching down to the ground, and they're all moving and shifting a lot.  All the clouds are nice and white, but the one directly behind me is the only one that's dark and stormy, almost black.  I pull over into a McDonalds to get something to eat.  I'm looking a the menu and see a guy out of the corner of my eye eating a wrap, and I ask him what kind.  He shows me it's a Tuna Poke wrap.  So I end up ordering that, and leave.

I'm at home now, but “home” is like a really upscale apartment building.  I looks like one of those fancy New York hotels in the movies, but it's an apartment.  Outside it's started storming bad, and inside the corridors of the building it's windy too.  I finally reach my room and step inside and it's just a small room, with red carpeting and dark wood paneling on the walls, and a couple small tables with wrought iron lamps for light.  On the floor are toys and a small TV (the old-fashioned kind that look like they're in a big radio box).  I turn on the TV and its suddenly like my dream becomes an old B&amp;W Mickey Mouse cartoon, but it's really awful and depressing.  The title card plays dreary music (like on a warped record phonograph) and it reads, “The Day Mickey Lost EVERYTHING,” with the “everything” in big letters.  The narrator comes on and starts explaining things, and I can't remember what he says but he had a really booming voice, but still whispering.  It shows Mickey sitting in an armchair looking sad, in a room exactly like the one I was in.  He picks up one of the toys on the floor, and it basically melts in hands, like it turns to goo and shrinks and disappears (this being Disney, all the objects are anthropomorphic; they all have faces and they twist in agony as they melt and vanish).  He does this with a few more items in the room, all with the same result.  At this point the “cartoon” cuts back to me, but the narrator is still talking, and I realize that I'm in the cartoon, and I'm supposed to be Mickey.  The toys in the room have all assembled into a weird Rube Goldberg machine, and I set it off.  It's extremely complicated, with toy car tracks and little bottle rockets.  While it's running all these weird shapes and objects fly through the air (like there was one that was a weird cartoony eye inside a triangle, like the Masonic symbol).  When the machine reaches the end, it pushes the button on the TV and the Mickey cartoon starts again.  He's walking out of the room, but when he closes the door, touching it, it melts and vanishes like the toys in the room.  He walks down the hall and out of the building, everything he touches getting destroyed, even the building itself when he walks out onto the street.  All the people inside scream when the building disappears and Mickey looks horrified and starts sobbing as he walks away.  As he goes down the street, sidewalk squares disappear and leave nothingness, and buildings he goes past do the same, all sentient and all in terrible pain.  The cartoon cuts back to me again and I have to set off another Goldberg machine to turn the TV back on.  I don't want to and I start crying because I don't want to see anything else get destroyed, but the narrator tells me that I can't ever leave the room until I comply with the way the cartoon plays out.  So I do and even more fucked-up imagery flies over the screen (like an octopus tearing the head off a baby) while the machine is running, until it eventually turns the TV back on.  It shows Mickey standing on a dock in front of the ocean, only bare land and black sky around him.  The narrator is still talking and Mickey is looking up into the sky like he's listening, and he's still sobbing.  The narrator tells him that he's ruined everything and there's only one thing left to do.  He looks down at the water and jumps in, causing the water to disappear, and he disappears with it, and then the world implodes and I wake up.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_19lm45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/19lm45/i_usually_have_really_awful_dreams_but_last/,

I was put on a low dose of Seroquel (quetiapine) to induce sleep. I have yet to do anything about the apnea, though when i did a sleep study they determined I stop breathing on average 16x an hour. (Not sure what is relevant info.) I have ALWAYS (even prior to meds) had vivid dreams and nightmares, so vivid that I can usually remember and retell in great detail multiple dreams from one night, many weeks later. As a writer, it's made great fodder for inspiration. However, my life has been in the greatest disarray emotionally, mentally, and physically in the last few weeks. When my anxiety is high, I tend to have more anxiety inducing dreams. Now i wake up literally in mid-panic attack nearly every morning, heart racing, cant breathe, feel like dying and am so exhausted from a night seemingly filled with unwanted excitement.

 To summarize my night time experiences over the last 2 weeks, it has involved consistant tooth loss (huge chunks and tiny bits, which may return in as an artifact in a dream later in the week), snakes, and what I can only describe as literal vertigo, in whch i suddenly lose balance and get wrapped up in whatever i grabbed to balance myself (i.e. a shower curtain i got stuck in last night on my way to the bathroom, and some sort of curtain in the front of a classroom by the blackboard i was approaching to write on, from whch i barely escaped to applause from the classmates that didnt offer to help). In addition, there is immense emotional and physical trama of the most extreme sort... all my worst fears: rape, torture, animals in distress, car accidents. So you know those days when you wake up from a really strange dream and it screws with your emotions the rest of the day? Its happening to me... EVERY SINGLE DAY. My questions include: any idea what could be causing this? Any interpretations on the symbolism? Anyone struggled with something similar? maybe on the same meds? Any insight would help...

This is a long read, but I'm curious to see what other Reddit users have to say about this topic. It's also something that is always heavily on my mind.

To begin, about a year ago I moved next to cemetery. Before this my dreams were always normal or just really ""off the wall"". After a week of living in my new apt I started having dreams of a woman. Most of them frightened me until I got acquainted with it. I also once had an outer body experience visiting her in the graveyard. Soon it became a routine of her visiting me. Needless to say I'm no longer frightened however, I'm wondering if there's a correlation between the prophetic dreams I've had over this year.

When I moved into my apt I started dating someone who is now my ex. I didn't know him previous to moving, so I was introduced to his friends. One of his friends is my current boyfriend. During this time I always fancied my ex's friend, but never thought anything would come of it. After dating my ex for 3 months I began to have dreams about his friend. These dreams lasted a week in a row. Every night it was something new, but in these dreams his friend and I were having a romantic relationship. In one vivid dream I was looking into his blue eyes and just knew that's where I belonged. In another, we found a black and white kitten with bright green eyes. Two weeks later I was hanging out with him and we spotted a kitten exactly like the one in my dream right next to the cemetery. We caught him and named him Cecil. A month after finding the kitten, I admitted to my ex's friend that I loved him and he just knew it too. Although he denies my dreams had anything to do with us eventually being together. Which hurts because those dreams were what lead me up to admitting my feelings towards him. However, I broke up with my ex to pursue the literal dreams I had.

In between my relationship with my current boyfriend I had a dream of him getting back with one of his ex's. Which ultimately did happen, but regardless we worked out our issues. 

I haven't had a dream or encounter with this woman for over 6 months now. I will admit I've been staying at my boyfriends far too often. I want to believe she helped me have prophetic dreams but I'm uncommon with anything relating to this topic. Any ideas?

Apologies for any vagueness but I tend to lose my dreams in my mind fairly quickly.

They are skin tight and are very soft, almost like silk, I go to sleep very quickly and soundly with them and rarely wake up in the middle of the night with them on, but they do give me some wacky dreams too.

Managed to jot these down quickly on my iPad before the memories went away, here's what I got:

Wake up in a back garden somewhere, have a stopwatch which somehow is a time travel device. I travel back to 1946, an alternative timeline, I also find out at this point I have an extra toe for some reason.

World War Two hasn't ended yet despite it being 1946 and the idea was I was going to figure out why and tell the people of that time period I knew how to end the war... Somehow.

I emerge in a kitchen, just a random kitchen, don't really recall it from anywhere, if anything it's an amalgamation of about 3 different kitchens I've seen in my life. There's a family in there, all a bit loopy to be honest. I explain to them that I'm a time traveler sent back to stop ww2. They interrupt me, get freaked out by my extra toe, and then decided to threaten me with knives, blades and any sharp objects they have, it resulted in a strange Mexican standoff as I threaten the kid with a blade, who was threatening me, but I turned the tables, but then his dad was threatening me with a massive blade. I eventually managed to clear them off with a bit of reasoning, they all went to bed arguing and acting like general arses.

Next thing I know, I'm in my room, or what appears to be my room. I had headphones on, and for some reason a towel. Staring at my computer in complete pitch black darkness. All I can hear is someone very faintly saying KILL, KILL, KILL.

It was like the walking dead circa      american civil war era. 

At first i went through the whole scenario as a lowly worker that ended up getting caught up in everything. We were on these mountains and the sky was ablaze with beautiful reds and there was a huge river snaking across the land. It was beautiful man.
But then we got word that something was happening back at the homestead so we took the horses down and seen some men dead at the side of the road with huge chunks out of their necks
I got out my colt m1911 pistol and shot them both in the head and told everyone i knew what was going on so i became the defacto leader of the workers.

We had a large group, and little supplies.. I remember we stopped in by the olde general shoppe and i bought some hard tack biscuits, some bread, bacon and an avocado for some strange reason. We went back and there was reports of a huge wave of zombies coming and some lawmen arrived and we fought against waves of zombies, but that isn't even the best part.

I actually woke up for a minute or two and went right back to sleep again, and this time i was in the same world but i began the adventure as one of the lawmen! We seen most if the things i had seen before but it turned out that that two men at the side of the road were actually some of our comrades and they died saving us when we were camped at the side of the road. 


We had to leave them behind. I was obviously the leader of the law men and in turn the leader of the whole god darned zombie resistance back at the homestead! And the most INSANE thing was i seen myself back at the homestead with the workers. Actually ME like i was looking in the mirror but then i knew i was someone else and it excited me too much. I woke up swiftly afterwards because i became aware that i was in a dream. Looking at myself in a dream was the strangest and most amazing thing.

Defending the farmstead was insane, i was actually taking the shots and seeing the zombies go down. Blood splattering everywhere though i seen more action as the police leader. I seen one of my men get torn out of a window and ripped to pieces in the homestead and i had to shoot him in the face with my 1911. It was heavy man.

Well, in my years of dreaming, there's something i noticed..

There are a few big settings where i dream (dream locations). If i picture a movie theater that was in my dream, i can suddenly recall 4-5 other dreams that took place there. There's another, a forested woody area, that also triggers me remembering a plethora of dreams. It seems that almost every single one of my dreams shares a location with another. The thing is, these aren't real locations, but rather my mind manifesting and changing real locations. 
The movie theater doesn't exist as far as i know in real life, but it's based off of a movie theater that i usually go to. But, like i said, it's still very different, yet from dream to dream it is almost identical. 
Ok, you get the point, i'm probably rambling now.. 

And for the Deja-vu. I have a theory, i don't necessarily abide by it, nor do i full heartily believe in it, but i find it interesting. 

Ok, so get this, when you dream, it can often be about things happening in real life. ei; you and your girlfriend break up, you have a dream about her etc etc. Or you just got a new job, you have a dream about being on the job. 
But when you're in that dream, do you remember that you have a life? That you're actually dreaming? Or are you wrapped up in the tales and emotions from the reality spat in front of you by your consciousness.
But plenty of dreams can relate back to your real life, right? 
Right. 
But it isn't until after we wake up do we realize that ""Ohhh.. that big strawberry ice cream cone rampaging my city, and killing everyone, was just a symbol for my dire lack of flamboyancy, which induces my irritability..""

Now, here's the basic theory. When you dream, you aren't dreaming, but your consciousness is traveling to other dimensions or lives, and experiencing a parallel universe, that can bleed and seep into our own.
The dream world is as real as the one you're sitting in right now. 

Now wait.. If that were true, how can this life affect the dream world? We already established that life's events, big or small, can form into a dream, symbolic or not. But we have also established that you don't really find the symbols until you try to connect them, after the dream is over. But how can a dream form into our world?

Ah, and this is where Deja-Vu comes into play. Maybe those small moments of Deva-ju, that only last for a few seconds, (sometimes longer) are memories, not deja-vu. Perhaps you actually HAVE experienced this before, in a dream state. Perhaps dreams affect are way of living more than we realize, yet we cannot realize until we wake up from the dream we are all in right now. 

Rest your head, go to sleep and wake up.

I'm not sure if anyone falls off or not. Teacher had some kind of equipment out there for us to use which he had previously set up, but high winds yanked them off the cliff as soon as we got out.

1st dream

I was at a party in some random house. I find my crush. We end up alone in a room. Dream me knows she likes me back, although she always acts angered towards me(in the dream). I say ""I'm trying, but you're making it very difficult."" She walks out with a grin on her face


2nd Dream 

Same night as first. I'm at my cousin's house, where I usually get to see the girl since they are like best friends. I see her down a hallway. I extend my arms to hug her. She does, and we hug a for a good while. Some time during the hug she disappears. Dream me doesn't think much of it and goes on with his life.


3rd Dream

A few nights ago. I'm at my cousin's house for a party, where crush is too. It is around 8 p.m. I scope at the house to see where I can get crush alone. I go to the bathroom. When i come out it's morning. Crush is gone :(


4th Dream (THE DREAM)

Last Night. I'm on a cruise ship or something. I'm in the hallways. It looks a lot like the insides of the two buildings on Highjacked from Black Ops II. Anyways, I'm running somewhere. I know something is wrong. It was very strange, It was like I had 2 personalities, but at the same time the dream was very realistic. 1 personality was trying to get somewhere quick, knowing something was wrong. The other one was completely confused. As I was running through the halls, I saw my crush everywhere. She was in corners, at tables, on the floor. She was crying and there was blood all around her. There were pools of blood at her feet even. Where I ended up after running was crush's room. I open the door. Her body is beneath her sheets. she has a bloody knife in one hand and her wrist slit on the other, blood everywhere. Somehow, I'm also looking into the past. That or I'm in the past looking into the future at her body. In the past, she is on her bed crying. She starts to repeatedly say my name and says ""You don't love me."" she takes the knife and stabs herself repeatedly in the stomach, and then slits her own throat, yet somehow slitting her wrist. I can't move and can't do anything about it. I'm back to the present where I stare at her body in terror and confusion. Somehow, I go back into the past, yet stay in the present, and try to stop her. She is still lying on the bed, dead, shile at the same time I'm comforting her while she's still alive and we're sitting against the wall accross her bed. Crush from the present, who I though was dead, gets up. I get really excited. She then attacks me. She stabs me somewhere. She must have stabbed me in a lot of places, because after that I couldn't get up. Crush from the past and present combine, I think(there was only one after that) and go onto the bed. She then prepares to go through with the suicide. She was trying to kill herself, but she couldn't for some reason, as if she was fighting herself. I went lucid in this part, I don't know how. I tried getting up to try to stop her because I knew I wasn't really injured. The thought that she wasn't really her escaped me at the moment(It was the most realistic dream I have ever experienced). My dream started to make me unable to move my body. I just layed on the floor and listened to her struggle with herslef. However, I was then also standing next to her at her bed side. She still fought herslef and I was still unable to move. She yelled ""YOU DON'T LOVE ME"" and stabbed herself, also stabbing me somehow. And that's how it ended.

It started with my gf, sister, sister's best friend and I were at some house party. There was this crowd gathering by the entrance of some bathroom so me and my gf went to go check it out. Apparently some girl that's known to be kind of a slut would come out of the bathroom and look around and take a guy in there with the crowd watching who she would take. The whole crowd would cheer for whoever got picked and it was getting kinda rough to be in the crowd. Then, my gf's 'ex', Lenard from the big bang theory, came into the crowd and found us. My gf was more than happy to see him. 
They started talking, hugging, and even got behind here and started holding her. Eventually he started kind of dry humping her and she did not care. It escalated to making out with him and two other random guys in the crowd. It stopped and she came back to me but Lenard followed and when I looked to where they were she was sucking his dick. The 'slut' finally walked out of the bathroom and I went in cause I needed to take a piss and my gf came inside with me. 
I started yelling at her, demanding wtf was wrong with her and what is she thinking. I told her I saw her sucking Lenard's dick and she said ""oh, you saw the pic on Facebook?"" and kind of laughed. I shrugged that off and told her it happened right now. She kind of looked mad and turned away from me and said something along the lines of it not being a big deal. I got so angry that I told her my sister and her best friend saw that and now they hate her. (she's good friends with them IRL).

I managed to get past it, and ran for something heavy to crush it with,  got a book, but when i ran out in the hallway it was already filled with web that i ran straight into. And that's when i felt the tarantula drop on my back.

That's when i woke up, extremely scared, and had to make sure it wasn't actually on my back.

While having dreams of the future that I believe are going to play out.,8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/17bcut/my_dreams_are_playing_out_throughout_my_life/,"I don't know if im crazy. or if this is a common occurance for other people. but almost all, and I mean atleast 90% of dreams that I have play out in my life, To the point where my life is becoming predictable. But I don't see it coming when a certain event is going on and I remember that I had a dream about this, Its kind of like deja vu, but a MUCH stronger sense. Almost brought me to tears a few times, but it has become such a regular occurrence that I kind of follow it. 
 One of the most memorable occurrences that made me tear up was a dream from when I was 11/12ish. I was driving around in a decently nice blue chevy truck. I was driving in a small city in the south and i had stopped at my mothers house. Talked to her and the dream continued till I drove for a long time to another city that is 200 some miles away. I got to an apartment building, parked my car got out, looked around in a cliché movie way. and than I woke up. 
Now at 18, This dream suddenly came back to me. I had no memory of this dream until one day, I had moved away from my mom about 4 months prior to this weird deja vu. I moved in with my girlfriend who lived in Atlanta, mean while my mother lived in savannah. We decided to get a bigger place and my sister moved in with us. We had lived at this place for a month before it happened. 
Out of nowhere It hit me out while I was pulling into the parking spot for my apartment. It was the most incredible, scary, emotional feeling in the world. it was the EXACT VIEW I had seen in my dream 8 years before this. and the entire dream came back to me at that instant. It affected me for weeks, I became quiet and weird and just an odd person because it was such a weird feeling. 
This dream even was down to the details, such as the vehicle, I DRIVE A BLUE CHEVY TRUCK NOW!!! and have for 6 months be for this ""event""
But even before this I would have this happen, just not as intensely, such as when I got my current job when I first moved up here, I had some guy walk by and say, ""Youre doing a great job, your on the right path"" and I had another crazy week of deja vu and weirdness. It actually happens pretty often. Only once in a while does it get that intense.  

Please tell me someone else has had this happen, I guess all im aiming at, the reason why im posting, is to see if anyone else is like that. Or has these experiences

**tr;dl**I have weird future telling dreams that basically predicted where i would be living after moving out of parents house with every detail, I still have dreams like this of me in the future and I am still playing out past dreams on a weekly basis.

I recently had a dream in which I was sitting around a poker table with Nicholas Cage and some unimportant people. They are only unimportant because I don’t remember who they were.

Nicholas Cage then yells: “TOOOOOOMMMMM CRUUUUIIIISSSSEEEEE!!!! Yooouuu have no right to be playing poker! You are a horrible actor!”

Tom Cruise looked back across the table, understandably confused. The room was silent. I looked over at a now sobbing Tom Cruise and felt the need to help. I said to Nicholas Cage: “NIIIICCCCHOOOLLAAAAASS CAAAAAAAAGGGGGE!!!!!! (This long extensive repetitive yelling of names did happen. It happens to be my favorite part of this dream) you are not so great yourself! Just because you are in a butt-load of movies doesn’t make you a great actor!” 

This seemed to make Nicholas Cage upset. His face turned a bright shade of red. He started to shake his head. “No. No. No.” He stated. “No. No. No no no no NO NO nono NO!” He said this exactly the same way that Woody does in the end of the first Toy Story. He then preceded to flip over the table.

I forget the rest.

I got creeped out like crazy and answered ""No!!"" every time. Then she would grab my ankle and become angry, trying to pull me with her through the wall. I would slam against it and she would angrily say: ""Damn it he's not a ghost."" and then I would fall onto my bed and wake up...

One day I answered ""Yes."". It took me several weeks to accomplish this and when I did she was delighted and left through the wall, never to be seen again until this day.

Are there any herbs/foods that contain certain vitamins that will help with dream vividness and recall? These need to be legal and available at a local supermarket in the USA. I know I need to keep a dream journal, but it's hard when I am always rushed in the mornings. I don't want to use an alarm to wake up fifteen or twenty minutes early because I sleep in the same room as my sister (Four kids in the house)...

If you guys could recommended certain things to do before I go to sleep and maybe some vitamins that I could get from the supermarket, that would be amazing. Also, if you could give the specific names of the vitamins that you buy, that would be awesome.

How much would self-hypnosis help with dream recall? Like where you imagine yourself standing at the top of 10 stairs and slowly walking down into water telling yourself something that you want your subconscious self to remember. It's something along the lines of that.

I'll definitely try to write down as much as I can about my dreams before I go to school. I used to keep a journal when I was working on Lucid Dreaming and I remember that it helped me out a lot. 

While I'm on the subject, are there any preferable ways to try to lucid dream for beginners? I've never had a lucid dream before, but I have tried for a while. And brands/kinds of vitamins that help with vividness or the ability to think more clearly? I always have dreams that don't make sense when I wake up, but I always fail to recognize that I'm dreaming before I wake up... I will probably start doing some reality checks again so I don't need to be told about that. I'll also post something similar to this in /r/luciddreaming but I thought: the more help, the better.

In the dream I met my ex again,  we were extremely happy,  slept together,  and I asked her why she denied her cheating to the very end.  All I remember is a deep sadness, then anger, then the dream ended. 

She did mean a lot to me, but I really don't think about her. I've accepted the good and bad parts of our relationship. Is this a sign im not over her?

From what I can understand, the premise is as follows: The government and the entirety of the world knew that within the next few weeks the world had a very high chance of ending. Every 40 minutes the government would, at multiple locations such as every few miles or so, shoot a flare up into the sky to alert people of Earth's current condition. If one flare was shot that meant that the Earth was fine. If two flares were shot, this meant that the Earth's atmosphere would soon be destroyed by this odd solar storm/hurricane/thunderstorm and that all life on Earth would cease to exist.

My dream began at a party in this reality, where it seems like most people had began to grow unwary to the odds of the world ending and were perhaps celebrating that this could be the end of their life or that that they were glad that the looming threat was over. I could feel the warmth of the house the party was in, it was very classy, golden-lit, and bright. Many people I knew were there, my friends, family, girlfriend, etc... As the 40 minute mark would approach, the majority of us would stand to look outside the window and see the flare. After a minute or two of tense fear, the party would resume and  the ""piano would continue playing."" if that makes any sense. At the next 40 minute mark, everyone looks out the window, same as before, except this time, we see one flare shoot up... Followed by another. My heart sunk. Although the room and the house were still golden lit it seemed like the atmosphere had suddenly plunged into darkness. Everyone remained speechless and in shock. The world would end then, it was actually happening, these were the last few moments of our lives. A lot of people were scared, including my girlfriend, but I didn't know how best to comfort her knowing that the world would end. Personally I wasn't that scared, just, uneasy and anxious knowing that soon I, and everyone else and everything everyone ever knew would cease to exist. I desperately did not want that to happen. After the initial shock stopped and as the flare faded away, people began panicing and crying. The entire atmosphere changed and turned into one of hopelessness and fear. Rain began to pour, rain that if you you touched you'd die. The storms began and I was able to from a window visually see Earth's atmosphere begin to collapse. It wasn't like anything I had ever seen before, it didn't even look physically possible, but in a haunting way, it was beautiful. My friend began to record it and I told him to wait... Because.. There'd be no one to ever see it. And reality hit us even more. We looked at each other stone faced and nervously. Shortly after, I woke up.


I don't know if my dream had any meaning to it, there haven't been any major emotional changes in my life recently or anything like that. I just thought that it was a really nice dream and I really connected with it emotionally. I could feel the despair and the hopelessness so perfectly. And as I looked at the sky I was afraid, yes, but not in the general sense. It was a beautiful thing to watch, the storm, and, I didn't know how to react or what to fear because no matter what this was it. The world was ending. There was nothing to be afraid of, at the moment, that was just the very nature of things and I accepted it. I just thought I'd share and see if maybe anyone could find something symbolic that maybe I might've over looked or maybe just enjoy reading.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,1357083048.0,,,True,t3_15qqcz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/15qqcz/weird_galactic_storm_that_destroys_earths/,

I must also mention that I hardly ever remember my dreams but I have a fever and I think that might have something to do with it. I keep coming in and out of the dream like some supporting character. 

It starts off with a little boy of about 12 years old. He comes home and is told by an uncle, who's a real big slob, to finish his homework. The homework seems like very tough material, especially since said uncle is getting a blow job in the next room (o.O;). A father figure comes home and kicks the uncle out and helps his son with the homework. For some reason, my dream could tell that this father was the main character. 

The next day a beautiful girl is entered into the story. The scene is outside and I realize that it's set in the countryside with vast expanses of fields and forests in every direction. The father is talking to the girl and the dialogue went something along the lines of how none of this feels right, the fields, the house, himself, herself, and even the son. Something just feels off. So they go back inside and the boy asks if they remember anything about this place since yesterday. No one can recall any memories and each person becomes deeply concerned. 

The scene changes and now I enter the dream, but I'm about 12, just like the boy. The boy, a girl of about the same age (maybe beautiful woman's daughter?), and myself are in a clearing inside the forest. We're searching the woods for something and it seems like a long time passes by. Then I hear a rustling in the trees and we chase after the noise to find another boy, around the same age as us. I'm carrying a sharp metal spear which I plunge into the boy's ribs. It went in easily and the boy drops back into a small fountain.

The scene changes again to the father, who is walking along a sidewalk in a big, massive city. People are walking everywhere on daily commutes. The father keeps looking up at the sky. You can tell he's disturbed about something. The sky becomes blacker and blacker until the tip of an enormous ship pushes through the black clouds. Lightning bolts shoot out from the sky and crackle to the ground, starting fires and explosions everywhere. Everyone is now screaming in terror and running for their lives. The father starts running, calling for his son. 

Back in the forest we see what's happening and run towards the city, which is conveniently just across the street (dreams are weird like that). I look at the little boy that is laying in the fountain, dying. Our eyes connect and everything about a robot apocalypse comes back to me. We've all been enslaved and hypnotized to believe everything around us is normal, but now the machines have come to harvest and we're completely ill prepared. Swarms of machines are flying out of the tip of the gigantic spaceship and are gathering people up in a scooping-like fashion. I shove the little boy's face into the water and run for my life, towards the city, leaving the poor boy to drown...

Most of the time it's location, but occasionally it's been actual situations. And sometimes the situations will happen more than once in real life. 
For some examples... Last year I moved to Quebec for University and I was driving up one street with my mother and was looking around and realised that that exact street had been in a dream I'd had a while back, with the exact streets, and placement of stores, and even stores themselves. Also, this past september I was driving across the country with my best friend's mother and we stopped in Thunder Bay(her home town) and she showed me where she went to high school, and I realised that I'd had a dream placed there. In fact, almost everywhere I went to in Thunder Bay gave me the feeling of deja vu. It also happened when I was in Italy. 

Every place I go and have a deja vu of the area, they are areas I've never been to before. And I've had it suggested to me that I perhaps astral project in my sleep, and I don't know exactly how that works, however I've always been skeptical that that's what it is since often it will be a legitimate dream in the location I go to later. And not just a stroll through, but a legitimate dream with people I know, and conversations, and situations that don't happen when I actually get to the place.

I guess what I'm here for is just some input on what people think might be causing this? Or what they think about it? Do they get it as well? Because this stuff has been happening to me since as long as I can remember, and I've always wondered why it is that I have such vivid dreams of locations that I go to later in life. Or have situations happen later after a dream. 

Also, just as another strange little add on that goes along with this, for any of those who have seem I am Legend. About 4 years before it came out and I saw it, I had a dream in the little town at the end where the mother and son take refuge. And in my dream the town is overrun by zombies. So when I saw that movie, and I remembered that dream, it was really very strange for me.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_15kjji,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/15kjji/deja_vu_from_dreams_to_reality/,

It was very unsteady and I fell in some sort of pothole. I had by then reached a small meadow between two forests. I looked into the forest I had just made my way out of and saw a tiger lurking between the trees in my direction. Yet unaware of my presence. I ran into the other forest which was very small. For some reason I waited for the tiger to come. It did. I layed my hands on it carefully and somehow tamed the tiger. It became very cuddly and I stroke him.

Later I were going to make my way back through another path in the forest I first came from. But along this path it was suddenly dark and creepy. A very depressing place. I had the feeling that there were things out there that wanted to get me and that I had to run to a safe spot. (I live in Sweden and the Scandinavian forests aren't places were you would expect to see tigers and such.) Suddenly I saw a beam of strong bright light that descended from the sky right down in the middle of nowhere in the forest. I felt that that was the spot I would be safe from all dangers and I was running towards that place. I don't remember if I ever got there or not.

So does any of you have any idea of what the things in this dream could mean? I'm very interested in dream interpretetion. So what do you think?

I have read that people soon about to die have had dreams about seeing a bright light which gave me some chills, even thought that there's no indication that that would happen anytime soon. I'm young and healthy. Others have said that a bright light is ""the presence of god"" or a deceased individual.

(Background: I have no military training). I was with a friend, and we were glad that we hadn't had to do anything dangerous yet. Some high-ranking officer tells us that we have a mission to scout out an area with some sort of gadget to make sure it was safe for the infantry to come in after us in large numbers. The two of us walked out onto a dirt battlefield with makeshift trenches (long piles of dirt) and spot enemy troops. I shoot at them, and I think I hit one. Another turns and fires at me.

Then, out of nowhere, this man appeared. He was tall and lanky, had short brown hair and olive skin, and he had a feral look in his eyes. He ran over and kidnapped the girls. (He didn't just run, he ran as if he was a drunken spider, which looked really creepy).

Thought I'd share.,6,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/146rlp/i_had_the_most_bizarre_dream_of_my_life_last/,"For the first time in my life, I woke up this morning terrified from a dream I had last night. I did not feel threatened, and I did not experience any bodily or emotional harm in my dream, but the sheer absurdity of the dream caught me completely off-guard, and perhaps you folks over here at /r/dreams might enjoy hearing about it.

Warning: This dream is kinda messed up/gory/possibly uncomfortable for some to read.

The part of the dream that I can remember starts off where I am walking alone through a quiet, sunny suburban neighborhood. It is not my neighborhood. In fact, I can't say that I've been here or seen it before in pictures or on tv; it is an entirely original place as far as I can tell. It is quite nondescript, though; it looks like it could be any Midwestern US suburb on a summer's day. There is not a cloud in the sky and because of the beautiful weather, families are out walking together, often with dogs. Everybody is smiling and courteous as I pass them, and they act as if I am familiar to them, perhaps a neighbor. This continues for about four or five blocks, when I notice a mother and son, who are walking towards me on the sidewalk, behaving quite differently. The child is about four or five years old, and the mother is in her early thirties. The mother is hysterical, and she is hitting her child as if to reprimand him for ill behavior - in the middle of public, nonetheless! Both the mother and the child are muttering what sounds like jibberish - it was a language that I could not identify. As I walk closer to them, the punishment continues, but the child's eyes are not on me, or his mother - they are on the front yard of the house directly adjacent to us. This is where things get really weird. The house looks just like the others in the neighborhood: cookie-cutter design, perfectly manicured lawn and bland yellow color, but there are two horrifying things on the lawn. On the left hand side, there is a perfectly circular hole about two feet in diameter, approximately 6"" deep with a dead kitten inside of it. The kitten was in two pieces, separated at the abdomen with its intestines strewn about the bottom of the hole. The hole containing the kitten was demarcated from the rest of the lawn by stakes holding yellow caution tape. The second object of peculiarity on the lawn was on the right hand side - it was a pair of severed human hands and forearms (they were severed about halfway between the wrist and elbow) that were folded neatly upon each other, palms facing up. Unlike the kitten, which looked recently deceased, the hands were in a more advanced stage of putrefaction, as if they had been lying there for a week in the sun. The hands had two biohazard warning signs placed on the right and left. As I notice this and try to comprehend it, the child aforementioned breaks away from his mother. Running onto the lawn, he grabs the two human hands and carries them to the hole containing the deceased kitten, where he begins to use the hands to play with the remains of the kitten, horrifically tossing them around the hole in a unsettlingly innocent manner. The remains of the kitten are dripping everywhere, on his clothes and around the lawn while the rotten human hands are disintegrating in his grip. The boy then looks directly at me in a stare that reminds me of pictures of WWI shell shock victims and grins menacingly before jumping into the hole and disappearing out of sight.

I then woke up and nope'd to the bathroom and started my day. It's been bothering me all day long. Do any of you know what to make of this dream? Is it nonsensical or do you think it could possibly have some sort of interpretable meaning?

If you made it all the way through this wall of text, thanks for your attention. It makes me feel better writing this down.

Instead of the gym or a classroom, the exam was out in the S block courtyard. Even though L3 Spanish was meant to be the only exam, there were nearly a hundred people there. So I sat down and eventually realised that the papers sitting on my desk weren't mine, so I stood up and went to ask about it. Turns out my exam was actually in the T block toilets (nobody else, just me) so off I trundled, worrying about whether Mr Tizzard could tell I hadn't shaved.

There was no supervision or anything in the bathroom, so I sat there with my iPod in and did the exams. No idea how the listening portions worked. I think I had my Spanish exercise book as well, though I didn't cheat. I remember vague bits about what was in the exam – something about cows, something about boats . . . it was hard, though. And I was doing two exams at once, so I had little time. After finishing and comparing notes with the other people in my class, they mentioned questions I hadn't done, so I had this sickening realisation that I had actually just not seen about half of the paper due to being an idiot.

By this point I was back at S block, where a classmate was rounding everybody up onto a series of party buses. Somehow I ended up riding shotgun (I know, buses don't have passenger seats) and for some reason my dad was in the driver's seat, though he wasn't driving. He seemed a little perplexed by everything as well. So the bus was driving, gradually getting faster, and we were driving through a big city at night. There were bloody overpasses everywhere. Eventually, I noticed some of the other buses – driving at breakneck speeds by now – had started to lift off the ground. I barely had time to hold onto my lunch before ours took off too. However, whoever was driving the bus decided that just that wasn't good enough for him, so it proceeded to barrel roll several times before I blacked out – from G-force or fear, I'm not sure.

Miraculously, I arrived at our destination without soiling myself. The buses spat us out onto this jetty (yes, they could float too) on a really nice-looking island somewhere in the middle of the ocean. I found out it was called Virgin Cuba Libre (which is basically a rum and coke without the rum – thanks, Sheldon Cooper) but my dreamy, post-Spanish-exam brain translated it as 'free virgins' and I kind of have no idea where the dream went from there.

I have vague memories of a very pretty girl with peach-coloured hair, who was actually Roman somehow and had been trapped on this island for centuries. She kept disappearing underwater . . . I think the island was flooding. All my classmates just kept partying (probably with all the 'free virgins') while I was trying to help this one girl off the island. I remember something about a door with many locks on it . . . I don't know. In the end, I seem to recall that the price for her escaping the island was that she basically had to die. But then she didn't? Or she came back, and . . . I don't know. There was a vaguely happy ending.

Then I 'woke up' and realised the part about the island had been a dream. I'd fallen asleep on the bus home after my exam, so I went in and told Mum and Dad about how I screwed up the exam. They weren't impressed, as you can imagine, but they were understanding and quite indignant I'd been made to sit two at once.

So I went out again (I don't know why, it was gone six p.m. by this point) and the girl from the island was there. Which confused me because I had been sure that was a dream. And then I started to wonder if THIS was a dream.

And then she kissed me, and I woke up. THIS close to a lucid dream. OTL",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_146dg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/146dg8/most_vivid_dream_i_have_had_in_years_party_buses/,

	But for a gleaming hilt embedded in the belly of a young girl's corpse, it was bare. Eyes vacant, a look of afflicted rumination affixed to the girls face.  Apart from nothing more than barrels of spice and salt, the girl seemed to have met her untimely fate alone; omitting her thoughts. Most of those thoughts were along the lines of a plea for a divine specter barging to her aid, or what folly if not of her own had led her to the godforsaken ballast in which she lay. 
	The lapse of course, lay on her mother's conscious. The sponsor of the decrepit, old, relict was a man of obvious disrepute, yet in the same instance, of affluent mannerism. After the girls father had      died and left her mother a lonely dowager; the girls mother had begun to indulge her less than frugal ways. Partaking in glutton and sot, living on credit she had no intention of remitting, and as a result, being forced to either breath her last or relinquish her only daughter as recompense. The latter being much below her maternal par. 
	The girls name was Alice, her name was repeated in more than a few instances during negotiations with her delinquent mother and the a-fore mentioned man. The actual negotiations were far below most civil standards. Shortly after the informal discussion, the well dressed man appeared in Alice's doorstep, sack in hand, carriage in rear. After a rather deplorable sequence of events, Alice reluctantly abandoned her pitiful attempts at combat with the man and took the bag as a mask. 
	After a short stint in the carriage, the retainers of the girl and the well dressed man halted the cart and lead the girl to a dock, where she was escorted, bag and all onto an outstandingly dreadful looking vessel and into a small room where her cowl was removed, and promptly tossed to the floor. The girls safety was not all the gang of brutes stole from her. Shortly after the girl was aboard, the crew raised anchor and set off to the blue with their new captive. After a few days, the girl had lost all sense of decency and whenever a privateer would make his unannounced entrance,  she would savagely lash out, fists and feet connecting with anything they could reach, until eventually the girls will would break and innocence was further cracked and blemished. 
	After a week, word had reached the well dressed man the girls mother had lashed out at one of his colleagues after discovering the whereabouts of her daughter. Which had resulted in the mans casualty.  After hearing this news, the well dressed man took up the girl and as if with a piece of meat to a pack of canines, thrust her into the barracks of the crew, entirely bare. Her shrieks could be heard for a very long ways away. After another week of similar, barbaric treatment, Alice was called to the well dressed mans quarters. Upon arrival, she was learned in her mothers untimely demise, the reason of which, and reason she was in fact on the craft was never made clear to her. 
	A day passed before she was moved from her 'room' to her the ballast, which was almost entirely full of barrels of varying content. The girl spent another three days in the damp, dark and musty pit before she heard the hatch open, and a crewmen materialized in the opening. As her innocence was finally shattered entirely, the girl's will was also having reached the point of complete deterioration. A thought occurred to the girl as she reached for her assailant's bodkin with a quick flick of her wrist, her attacker's throat spat red, and he fell to the floor, rendered silent by his own claret. With a second motion, the blade dove into her abdomen. The girl coughed and sputtered, and eventually succumbed to her faulting equilibrium. As she lay in that dark hole, a line of her own clot running off her mouth, the scent of foreign spice and tanned leather filled her muzzle, thoughts of terror enveloped her mind as she realized the morbidity she had just inflicted upon herself. 
	She lay there for what seemed to be merest a day, as gore seeped out of her gut, pleading to some unnamed deity to come to her rescue, or to her mother who she so dearly longed for. Never having learned the initial reason for her capture, she fought the urge to cry for the answer, but thought better of it, and decided to end her ordeal with what little amount of dignity she had left, and with her final thoughts being those of the warmth of her childhood, family unbroken and herself as pure as can be, the lights flickered in her eyes, then went out entirely and the young girl met the maker she had been so longing to aid her.

I was at a dark, dimly lit party near the punch bowl. The atmosphere felt like an alley in a Victorian-Era town, but some things, particularly the party-goers, were characters in the video game [*The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind*](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mafy7t3UVA1rgi02uo1_500.jpg). The beat of the song [*Puttin' On the Ritz*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3PnQ3tgzY) was playing on a loop. It wasn't a very good party. While talking with a few people of no particular importance, I look to my left and see in the middle of the party a Dark Elf in a black dress, and black hair. It's extremely difficult to see her, except for her red eyes. I'm terrified of this figure in black, but i'm eerily curious, as well. She turns away from me and leaves the small party. I start feeling afflicted with a need to follow behind, most likely by my need to explain my fear. She doesn't notice me.

We're now deeper in the Alleyway. There's a door with an illegible plaque on it. The dark figure takes a quick glance at me and walks inside. I start slowly walking towards the door, and carefully open the door. I enter inside, and find that i'm in an unlit warehouse, full of crates and cardboard boxes. The woman is about 10 feet away from me. She turns around towards me, and the hair she was wearing before is now a cloak. She takes off the cloak, and transforms into a vicious werewolf (nothing to do with the game now). She starts to drool, as if hungry. I realize immediately afterwards that i've delved too deep, and I need to leave. I slowly step back, with every step she responds by getting closer. I open the door, and leave.

I'm back at the party. By this time there aren't as many people as there were before. The party is even darker than it was. There are also chain-link fences that have enclosed off the area. At this point, I know she's coming for me, and i need to hide. I try hiding amongst the people i was originally talking to, but I still feel like i'm too easily seen. Eventually, I see her. She's coming towards me at a steady pace. I can see the beast in her eyes now. I start walking away from her. By the time i'm about to break into a sprint, she catches up with me, starts to devour me, and I wake up in a sweat and breathing heavily.

I've used http://www.dreammoods.com/ to determine what some of the symbols mean, but I would really like it if somebody could help me affirm my thoughts by telling me what they think my dream is about. 

EDIT: I suppose I should give my interpretation, huh?

Well, I feel that maybe, with regards to the dark elf/werewolf, there's a temptation that's hiding as something that isn't what it seems. Having the werewolf appear in the warehouse possibly means that if i give into a particular temptation, i'll let go of my ambitions.

The almost constant darkness possibly means that i'm fearful of things that are as of yet unknown to me. The growing darkness at the party following my encounter with the werewolf possibly means failure, or fear of failure. The Victorian-Era party seems to represent, according to the website, sexual repression, and the bad party seems to represent a lack of confidence with my social skills. Also, the music is cacophonous, representing that i'm unhappy. The chains that appear after the encounter seem to represent me needing to break free from an old idea or a routine. Perhaps, in this, i'm fearful of failure in life and my sociability. When I get back to the party, there is definitely failure, and I need to break free from this particular act that is harming my potential.

I seem to suddenly remember that the door sign was similar to a signature. I just couldn't read it. Perhaps this represents me making a commitment to something without taking the time to examine it, and changing my life for my individual self. The werewolf seemed like it wanted to devour me, perhaps representing the threat or fear of losing my identity.

One thing I shouldn't forget is that this is a chase dream. It's me chasing something/somebody, and then that thing is chasing me after I realize I don't want it. But by then, it's too late, and i'll need to let go of my personal identity.

2nd EDIT: Another symbol I forgot to bring out is the fact that this is involves parts of a video game, and the alleyway. Once again, according to the website, the fact that parts of this dream are in the format of this video game, perhaps I lack any ambition. Perhaps if i follow through with a lack of ambition, there's only one path I can take.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,1353011925.0,,,True,t3_1398nc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1398nc/need_help_reaffirming_a_personal_interpretation/,

But on a more serious note, last night I had one of the weirdest dream I can remember having in a long time. So it all started I was in this massive house, I didn't know why, but I soon found out. Out of nowhere, this woman ran through the room I was in. She was clearly upset, and I stopped her to ask what she was doing. I learned that there was a demon woman that had possessed the house, and we had to get out NOW. So I spent the next what seemed like an hour trying to exit the labyrinth that was this house. Every few minutes her voice would ring through the house. She would say things like ""You'll never make it out"" in the sweetest voice I'd ever heard, which would become demonic by the end of the sentence. At one point, three of us made it onto a balcony on about the seventh story. We heard footsteps getting closer and closer, and the woman to appear right behind us. Out of impulse and fear, we all jumped off the balcony.

And there I was back at the beginning. I quickly heard the same screams from the other woman running through the room. I had started over, I got to replay the level in sorts. This made it seem like I was the main character in some kind of horror video game, but before I got too far into the level, I woke up. 

I woke up and fell back asleep a few times throughout the night, and each cycle added a new Shyamalan-esque plot twist to the already bizarre dream.

Upon falling back asleep, I was back at the same old ""checkpoint"". It took two tries, but I finally made it out of the house. Well, almost. As soon as I opened the door to escape, I woke up again. Somewhat frustrated now, I went right back to sleep, determined to finish what I started. There I was outside of the house, but escaping had become the least of my worries. I was now at the beginning of a hedge maze in the back yard. Not too terrible in itself, unless you have men in suits similar to Agent Smith from the Matrix standing guard at different parts of the maze. They had these laser guns that if they hit you, you begin seeing in thermal vision, and it also made you much more visible to the demon woman. She was not happy about us escaping. Her comments were no longer sweet statements about not escaping, rather I kept hearing a demonic voice scream threats of what would happen if she caught me. I was caught a few times, but when I made it out of the hedges, I woke up again. 

It seemed way too real, but it almost seemed like I was in the middle of a boss level of some kind of weird horror video game. If you are still here at this point, I commend you for making it through all of that. I just needed to get that all out in the open, mostly just so I could come back and read this in the future.

TL;DR I was in a horror video game escaping a house controlled by a demon woman, only to have to navigate my way out of a maze while being shot at by Agent Smith from the Matrix.

In the dream ---- was still with her ex-husband xxx.  Out on her front lawn were decorative light-up pumpkins.  As ----- and I left, I backed out of their driveway and as I put my car in drive, I noticed that ------, ----‘s 6-year-old daughter, and my niece, had one of the pumpkins on her head and was running around in their front yard.  I said, “Look! Callie has the pumpkin on her head!”  As you may know, dreams often don’t make sense or skip details that would in reality make certain things seem impossible, as you will see much more throughout this dream.  After I noticed ------ playing with the pumpkin on her head, she was about 30 feet behind my car.  In my mind I thought it would be really funny to back up really fast and stop right in front of her, so I did just that.  I put my car into reverse, and floored it until I was very close to her.  When I went to hit the brake to stop my foot hit the gas instead and I ran her over.  I kept going not realizing what I had done until ------ was about 20 feet in front of my car.  I sat there for a minute, numb and in shock of what had just happened.  Stacy started screaming “Oh my God!” and crying.  I ran to ------’s mangled body.  Her organs were crushed and smeared all over the road.  I knelt by her side, crying and apologizing to her lifeless body.  At that moment her spirit rose up out of her body and just stared at me for what seemed like forever.  Then it asked me, “Why?”  Then it flew up into the sky.  For some reason after that I must have thought that I could save her.  I looked away and when I looked back her body was gone.  At that moment I knew that her body parts had been scattered all over the city of ---------- where I lived.  For the next few hours in the dream I spent driving all over the town with Stacy looking for my niece’s body parts to take them to a doctor so he could put her back together and everything would be okay.  I finally had collected all of her body parts and was on my way to a hospital to find a doctor who could help me, even though the horrible accident that had occurred had happened hours ago and there was no possible chance of her surviving.  When I got to a hospital it was closed and there was nobody there.  I continued to drive to every hospital I knew of trying to find one that was open and could help me, but every one I went to was closed and abandoned.  After I had gone to all the hospitals I knew of I collapsed to my knees with my niece’s dismembered body in my hands and screamed for several minutes.  ----- got into my car and drove away.  It started to rain.  I walked home with ------ in my hands.  Two men confronted me on my way home demanding that I give them my money.  I told them that I had none because I spent all of it on gas driving around trying to save my niece I ran over.  They stabbed me and ran away.  After laying on the ground for a few minutes I got up and continued home.  When I got there, -----, my sister ----, her ex-husband ---, and my parents were all gathered together inside.  They told me that ----- had told them what had happened to ------ and where I had been.  They all started telling me how bad of a person I am or how worthless I am or how it should have been me to die, not her.  After they were all done telling me what they thought, as ----- was going to leave, she opened the door and millions of roaches were coming out from every crack and crevice there was.  Apparently when I did what I did God summoned a plague on Earth.  Roaches started coming out of everyone but me and -----‘s mouth.  ----- looked around in fear, then looked right at me and said “Fuck you ----!”  I picked up a gun laying on the ground in front of me, put it up to my head, looked up to the sky, said “I’m sorry,” and shot myself.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_12u6m4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/12u6m4/somebody_tell_me_what_this_fucked_up_dream_means/,

[somewhat long],6,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/12psxr/can_someone_help_interpret_the_most_terrifying/,"Okay so I just had this dream like 20 minutes ago so it's still fresh. I wrote it like a story out of habit. The biggest theme here is not being able to speak and a loud music drowning throughout making it hard to hear.

Here it is:

Dream with hardly any sound and inability to speak.


Life was normal in the dream as I was listening to music with my headphones until something was amiss. I was in the living room listening to music on what appeared to be my phone when I looked at the door and saw the shape of a childs head, but entirely mercury like, just hanging through the screen door to where I could only see its neck and part of it's shoulders. This scared me pretty bad at first, but then when I tried to tell someone about it, I couldn't speak and had the feeling that I had a bad sore throat.

Soon after I went to take off my headphones becuase this same song has been droning on for now what feels like hours, when a headset fell off that I didn't recognize, and I was still wearing a pair. I then took the second pair off, which are the ones I usually use. 

Now it worked, I had no headphones on, but I could still hear the same song blaring so loud I could barely hear anything anyone else was saying. At this point the weather was terrible, with it raining pretty hard with lightning and no thunder, due to the inability to hear. Next I turned to the door again where the mercury-like figure still loomed. I went to go attack it to get it away and it vanished into the outside area after I hit it a few times. My brother then runs out into the storm after me freaking out about it, when apparently no one else could see it. He runs up to the neighbors house and just sits there like a dummy for a bit then runs back to our house. As he is running back, he falls through the boards on our porch and I go to grab him to pull him up becuase I knew the thing was going to go after him down there. I get him to safety and we get inside to the living room.

Soon after we do this, I wake up from this dream, but I can still hear the music blaring and I can barely talk, I can squeeze out a few words like something is blocking my throat, which is still sore. My mom and sister think I should look it up so I do, the webpage then shows most of the things that occured along with the explanation for the music.

The explanation was simple.




You're dreaming, wake up.





Then I actually wake up and hear the song that has played throughout the entire dream, which felt like hours, I took off my headset and it stopped. I had to make sure I could actually talk after this. I could, fortunately.

Not always people that I have those thoughts about either. Allow me to give you a little context first.  
I'm 25, I'm not sexually active, because I don't have a girlfriend, I don't watch porn, and I don't masturbate as often as most men (usually about monthly, but sometimes as often as weekly). So I'm not particularly sex-driven. I am miserably lonely, but I just want someone to love.  
Anyways, these dreams have been coming for weeks on end, almost every night. Sometimes, it is my ex, who I still see often. Several times it has been random women that I know, but don't associate with often. A couple times it has been two or more women. And last weekend, it was someone who I am not even slightly attracted to.  
I'm really wondering what's happening in my head. Whenever I wake up, I feel anxious, then whenever I see these people, I can't help but look at them as a potential sexual candidate. It's really conflicting with my social propensity, which is already awkward at best.

I first remember seeing a few friends in the back of a two cars which were parker next to each other and they were all smoking and chilling. I remember having a few conversations with people and peering at my friend gary through the the car window. I hopped out and everyone was gald to see I was back home. I tried to talk to my friend gary, but I was then watching him fall asleep like he always does. On the back of a car my friend tiffany shows up and we all sing happy birthday, but we sang it to fast and it was out of tune. 
	Teleported out to my friend wills house which ended up being very mystical, but also nefarious because he had drugs. His mom hates me and she kept calling me names and making fun of me while I talked to my friend. I was telling my friends mom how well I was doing at school with everything, but she was not convinced I was a good kid. 
	I was so upset that I had gone back into town on calvins longboard and I found a cellphone in the cement and I picked it up. When I picked it up the long board slipped out from underneath me and slid over to a party full of bikers and other rough characters. My friend Dillon yeager came over to me because the party was at his house. I asked him if that was his cellphone, and then repeated myself and he then grabbed the phone. I went around the block and had then remembered that calvins longboard was gone. At this point I am riding on a longboard that was actually just a small round plate. I kept getting on and off the longboard because of very steep hills. 
	Now I was at an area that consisted of a gas station from my hometown which is always in my dreams, a thin 2 foot wide space that extended for about 30 feet behind this station, and also a fence above the ledge with light posts holding up the fence. My old bible study friend brian who is 45 years old called me on my cellphone, and asked me if I had been convicted of a sin, or a wrongdoing. After trying to explain to him that I was good I went into a paralytic state and magically was sliding on the ground in between this ledge and station wall. My eyes were open this entire time while sliding and I went around a corner and at this point I am on an enclosed top boat.
	On this boat two demonic presences were pacing back and forth in a very sinister manner. A man spoke out and was harmed and then thrown off the boat. I tried to go attack the spirit with my bare hands and it grabbed me. While it grabbed me he stared into my eyes and let me down. While he did this I saw a demon or two resembling Golem from lord of the rings jump from the rocky shore of which we were departing from. The demon spoke words I cannot express. We ended up finding our way to an island which was inhabited by demonic spirits. In this town it was not safe to walk out of certain doors of certain establishments. It was not wise to wonder to far from a building. I was with Makenzie walking over to a building that had kids partying in it. All the buildings consisted of kids partyin in it. I walked around this building and I lost Makenzie. I went out back and found her but a dog approached me and I rubbed its belly. Two boys came out of the building and said hey you cant be out there. I knew he meant it was because of the demons. It was so real it was not funny. Makenzie and I walked down to the dock where the shore was and all of the water was what our cloudy skys look like at dusk. The perception of my surrounding was very opposite to that of a normal setting. At this point the scenery faded and I woke up.

SO: im outside of my local library, and the whole sky is a dark cloudy blue grey and theres a storm coming, like wind and humid air.

we sit down, (sidenote: one girl is a a flat chested black haired ballerina. my mind made her up, ive never seen this girl before. any of them really) and the meniacle librarian serves us our plates of banana bread.  i look at it, and i whisper to the ballerina, ""Don't eat it. it's poisoned. pretend to eat it."" and her and i looked at the other girls, and they got the memo. but not one of the girls. She was the brown haired, frumpy one, who seemed like food was her everything. So as all of us girls spit out our bread in our napkins while frumpy stuffed her face. My hypothesis was correct: it was poisoned, and frumpy fell over an died. the librarians knew something was up, but they pretended not to know. and they kept trying to kill us. i don't remember all the details of that part. but finally, ballerina and i decide to run and hide, as the other girls. i hide under a desk, next to a shiny black forties phone. i don't see the ballerina, until a few minutes later i hear the librarians calling for us. i peek my head up a teeny bit, and see the ballerina in a blue tutu balet outfit, doing the pose when she stands on one foot and the other one extended behind her and her arms out horizontally, and shes on a pedestal. i call the police, and one comes in and he's in forties police officerwear.

From what I remember, I'm at work at 6 in morning (when I usually work nights) and I'm going through my normal routine. I'm a cook so it's loud and fast paced. I have to take out the trash and go outside to do but I notice that there's some door I've never seen before and I enter it. It leads down a narrow set of stone stairs to a gigantic rocky and cavernous opening with torches hanging off the walls and store fronts and small houses built directly into the rock walls. It's damp and dank. People are moving about and doing their own thing like they would on the surface. For some explainable reason, I decide it would be a good idea to climb to the tallest rock in the cavern, sit down, and masturbate. Whilst masturbating, I see a few people walking on a path directly below me and I get quiet and hide my junk. They pass and I sit there in the wonder of this huge cavern I never knew existed.

Next think I know, two Japanese women are beside me, one in her 40's and the other in her 70's. They can see my raging boner and the younger of the two says, in perfect English, ""com' on, let's see it! It's not the first dick I've see."" I sheepishly show them and younger bends over and sucks it a few times, pulls away, and winces. The older, who can hardly speak does the same and says, ""it's okay."" (WTF?!).

They leave and I notice a large circular room off to my side with windows and many young women walking about, working. I see one, who I think is fairly attractive, and she sees me. Better go introduce myself, wang and all. She admits she wants to bone but has to clear it with her boyfriend. We go into the circular room, with people still in it and negotiate with the boyfriend who has low self-esteem. I think, ""fuck this!"" and walk over to the young woman, take off her shirt and pants and put her on the circular bed (yes, in the circular room) and go to town on her vagina, playing it like Greek lyre with my fingers. She responds positively throughout the interaction. I ask if she has a condom (safe sex, even in my dreams) and she says she doesn't. The two of us barely get dressed make a run to the local 7-11, stopping every so often for a little clitoris jiggle. I dash into the store and run out ripping the packaging and putting that thing on my wang. She's ready to get down in the bushes and it turns-out she's a contortionist and I go crazy on her but can't seem to orgasm, though she has multiple times.

I pick it up and start heading to put it back in the dining room where he keeps all is stuff. As I'm about to walk through the doorway from the laundry room into the kitchen, something rather large, invisible, and rather light jumps on me from the ceiling and a struggle ensues. It felt like this thing was trying to get into my body from behind similar to the way you put on a jumpsuit that zips up from the back. Well, during this struggle, I wake up, and still have the same feeling in the back of my head, on my back, and on the back of my arms and legs. I also felt like there was some other consciousness sharing my mind with me, it really started to freak me out. Shortly after, I started to fall back asleep, and wake up choking on something. So I think to go get some water, but can't bring myself to move, fall back asleep for a second and wake up again choking on the water that I never drank. Finally, I bring myself to get up, get some more water and have a smoke. 

Another thing to note is that when I woke up, I felt nothing similar to a bout of sleep paralysis, this was something very different.

Now, I'm not a superstitious person generally, but this really freaked me out. I don't even know if this should be posted on /r/Dreams, but this was the only board I could think of to post it on.

Well first things first, I was passed over for a job today and go the rejection by email. I really wanted to work at the place but alas it didn't work out. So after my morning errands, I started to a nap.

First part of the dream, I dreamed that I sent a thank you note to the job thanking them for taking the time to interview me and stuff (I actually did this in real life before I went to sleep). In the dream, I got an email response from Kevin (which is probably the new hire , because it is a small shop). Kevin's email said:

&gt;Subject : No fucks given like the ""c"" in ""humor""

&gt;Email: Thanks for interview blah blah blah 


That WASN'T the original subject line. He added that. And I almost didn't understand it. But it makes sense now that I think about it. I almost want to ask the job did they hire someone name Kevin to test the knowledge of my dream. Any suggestions/ideas as for the subject line?


Second dream: I was helping someone out moving bikes and stuff and my uncle came by. He read the side of my sneaker which said ""Drink the Sole"". He brought it to my attention and I had to inform him that it means 'sole' as in shoe, not 'soul'. People said that was creative and interesting but I have no idea what that means either.

Eventually they leave me-- not upright, but nailed to a cross laying flat on the ground. I die, and leave my body. I can see my dead self laying there. Not sure what happens between, but eventually I find myself walking into the ruins of a small cathedral. Everything is now blue, and I get the impression that a great deal of time has passed. The ceiling is tall, and I can see some sort of winged, dark angel-like creature climbing around in the wooden rafters high above my head. I'm holding a shotgun. My crucified body, still nailed to the cross, is on display at the front of the church, just like Jesus would be but it's me. I seem to be here to get my body back. As I get closer to it, my body starts talking to me, saying, ""When are you coming home?"" When I try to get close to my body, the angel attacks me. It's so much stronger than me, and I try to shoot it with the shotgun but it has no effect.

The first part of it that I remember is of me and someone else (I don't remember who) in some kind of corridor. the walls were made of concrete, and it was somewhat dark, there were many rooms and hallways branching off of this main hallway, and we were trying to get to an exit, there was a profound sense of dread at this point, and as we turned a corner, we came face-to-face with 3 aliens. they were bigger than an average human, and had very thick legs, which looked like an elephant's, sans toenails. And equally thick manlike arms, each ending in 3 fingers. Their bodies were grey, and very round, but the creepy part was that they each had a thick, serpentine neck, about 3 feet long, ending in a disturbing humanoid face, which was white, like a porcelain mask. Of a babies face. the faces were smooth and had totally black, shiny eyes, and mouths that never moved (Their eyebrows, cheeks and noses moved normally).
 
Needles to say, these guys freaked the shit out of me and my companion, who turned and ran into the nearest room. I was about to do the same, when one of the aliens held out it's hand to me, fingers open, as if telling me to wait. It then took a single step towards me and lowered it's face until it was level with mine, and I heard in my head, a deep, long-winded and breathy voice, speaking in a language I don't understand. I asked it what it wanted, and it just looked at me, then blinked and ""said"" ""Want"" deep and long, as it slowly turned it's head to the others, who then joined in, all ""speaking"" in the same voice, ""saying"" ""Want"" a couple of times.

 
The next part I remember, was 3 years into the future. The aliens could now ""speak"" English, and I had made friends with the same one that first ""spoke"" to me. Over the years it had taught me their language (which I now heard as English). We had a routine of me asking it what it wanted as a greeting, to which it would reply ""Want"", then we would talk about things such as philosophy, physics, food, human behavior (I would occasionally try to explain religion to it, but it would always just slowly shake it's head and ""Sigh"" sadly).
Then one time, I was going into a kitchen where two aliens were preparing food (There were many aliens at this point, but people tended to distrust them, so they mostly kept to themselves), I was rounding the corner when I decided to eavesdrop on their conversation. I had another deep sense of dread at this point and a feeling that the aliens were planning something malicious, but as I listened, they were only talking about carrots tasting weird.

The last part of the dream takes place 2 years after, (5 years have passed since the first meeting) I was talking with my friend (They didn't have names, but each one had a unique presence) and he told me it was ""time"" I asked what he meant by that, and he replied that their ""Purpose"" was ready, and that I would be ""the one who would see"". I asked if they were going to destroy or enslave us, and he blinked in shock, and ""said"" ""No. Help."" so I asked if they had only come to help us and he replied ""Not only"". So I asked what he meant, and he ""said"" ""Help us too. everyone."" then he told me I needed to ""Open"". I was confused until he sent me an image of a person opening his 3rd eye. So I sat in lotus position, and imagined a third eye opening in my forehead, and I saw something I still don't quite understand;
The landscape looked like there was a sandstorm and a blizzard going on at once, but high up in the air, there were these cone-shaped craft flying everywhere. There were also bigger, round, hockey-puck shaped craft flying slower. They were all shooting at each other, it was quite chaotic. I somehow knew (the way you sometimes just know things in dreams) that all this was caused by human technology, or more specifically, the things we were feeding our technology.
I closed my third eye, and my friend patted me on the shoulder and ""Said"" ""you will pass it."" Then he took me to a little cone-shaped craft, and I got inside, (it was like the passenger seat of a car) there were no controls, in fact there was nothing but the window and the seat. I sat in the seat and opened my third eye and the craft started to rise. I guided it with my thoughts, dodging the other craft and their bullets, and broke through the storm/blizzard. after that I just remember flashes of flying the little craft through a vast red dessert, I thought it was mars, but I can't be sure.

Or living out normal things with people I didn't know, yet they and situations felt normal and familiar. I've had instances of deja veu, where I feel like I had experienced something I had already done in my dream. There have been instances of lucid dreaming as well. Such as falling asleep and only to awake in what I knew was my current room, then which I would wander out into my house, only to encounter apparent dream versions of people I knew. In one instance, they had been sitting in the hall outside, waiting for me to ""wake up"". I would also like to note that everything in the dream was extremely dark/grey and color faded. And I could read things such as my alarm clock, or look my self in a mirror (blurry though).
    
Though, a certain dream has always stuck with me. It was when I met my first love. I spent the night over at her house, we fell asleep in bed together. I awoke in a dream where I was laying with her in the very same bed. Her being in the very same position which she had fallen asleep in. The sun was shining brightly through the blinds, and her normally black hair was bright blonde. I recall looking around at my surroundings (her room), everything was normal, and in it's place. There was a feeling of sanctuary in that sunlit room. I immediately knew I was dreaming, the sense of lucidity was very apparent, yet it felt more like another realm than a dream. It simply played out like normal life, and I was entirely aware of my actions. I woke her up, and chatted with her about ""us"", and our sexuality. I recall her asking if I was ""sure about wanting her"". I replied, ""I was"". We then proceeded to make love.

This ones gonna be really hard to explain.
I've had this same dream several times and I think its probably quite unique.

I'm sort of in a huge, floating desert. There are huge 'boulder' type entities, millions of them. Some are somehow obviously good, some seem to be pure evil.
Its hard to explain, but these boulders seem to 'collect' together, and the dream shifts from evil ones collecting and 'nice' ones collecting, strange, I know.

However its not this that bothers me, its the horribly intense emotions that come along with it.
When the 'bad' boulders collect, I can't even describe how it makes me feel in the dream. I get an extremely overwhelming feeling of absolute dread, fear, death and depression. Somehow it feels like its truly the end and the whole world is against me. Now imagine those emotions I just described x100, and then some. In the dream I feel like that, while hearing horrible sounds of people screaming at me. Its literally the worst feeling ive ever experienced, regardless of the fact its in a dream.

Then, the good boulders somehow defeat the bad ones. I get this huge feeling of happiness and relief, up to the point it feels so positive its unnerving and creepy.

Then the bad boulders defeat the good ones again and the cycle continues for what seems like hours.
I've had strange dreams my whole life but this one just stands out... I've only had it 3 or 4 times and haven't experienced it in years (I was about 11 I think, now I'm a month away from being 18).
Any questions? And if anyone can offer any insight that would be great.

""Murder

To dream that you have committed a murder indicates that you are putting an end to an old habit and a former way of thinking. This could also refer to an end to an addiction.""

""Knife

To dream that you are carrying a knife signifies anger, aggression and/or separation. There may be something in your life that you need to cut out and get rid of. Perhaps you need to cut ties or sever some relationship. Be more divisive.

I couldn't just ignore this man, I had to know his secret. He walks on to the path I'm on. I turn around and ask, ""Did you really just walk on water?""

I looked in his eyes, and I could tell he was deeply spiritual and in touch with the universe. He was an Asian man, rather tall, earthly, and humble. ""I only speak in whispers.""

""What? Speak up, I can't hear you,"" I moved in closer to the man.
Again, ""I only speak in whispers."" Then after, it's all inaudible.

I was quite intrigued by him and felt very at peace and comfortable talking to him. He then begins to kiss my head, then my chest, then the left of my stomach. It seems somewhat sensual, and I enjoyed it, but it seemed deeper than lust. We were connected, in some way or another.

We broke up in May 2011, so its quiet some time ago, and i still dream about her. Less frequently now, but still. I feel that iw moved on, since i never think about her, or miss her now days.
I dreamt that we cuddled and i said to her that i waited for her so long, kinda like we where re-united. I feelt all those old feelings, the love, the compassion for her, her smell.
And now i feel really shitty.

We stopped at a diner for breakfast. It was incredibly dark outside even though it was morning and the diner had a very eerie vibe. We got bloody mary's but they were green. The diner was full but everyone was quiet, all watching a movie that seemed to be on a screen and also taking place in front of us through the waitresses at the diner. I don't remember what happened but we left being chased. I was then at the campsite and it was so dark I couldn't see anything. My friend was gone and I was stumbling around panicking because it was so dark. I was trying to find a bathroom just to see something. There was a rapid river and i lost my footing and fell in. Then it almost seemed like I blacked out in the dream and saw myself out of body with someone shining a flashlight on me and my head was cracked open.
When I came to an older woman was carrying me in her arms (there was no way she could've been carrying me in real life). It was morning and very bright. Everyone was watching me and I could tell I had been missing for awhile. I felt incredibly weak and felt that everyone was somehow afraid of me. 
Then I woke up sweaty and freezing cold...

Basically, in the dream I was still a high school student (I'm actually four years graduated). I was preparing for school in the morning, but it must have been about 7 am because I sensed that there was about 30 minutes before I had to leave to go to school. For whatever reason I feel very restless and so I decide to leave early. As I head out to my car it is very grey outside and there is a pretty steady downpour, and the world just looks more grey and miserable than I've ever seen in real life, more like a movie. I start driving and once I hit a main road (granted it seems to be a town/route I've never actually been to) I notice a little boy, probably no older than two, running against traffic off to the right just on the inside of the white shoulder line. Naturally, I swerve over and park in the shoulder a bit further down, and get out and grab the kid, who is obviously lost. Frantically and no paying no mind to the rain, I start searching for someone who must be the kid's parent. In not very long, I notice a bit further back off the side of the road a slowly walking figure, maybe five feet tall, wearing a tan colored trench coat. As I approach, I realize this figure is holding another child, a little girl, who also must be around 2. Here's where things just get wild: The figure, upon approaching, had the stature of a small woman in her 60's or 70's, but wore a very barbie-esque bleach blonde wig and did not have a proper face. Where her head should have been, underneath the wig, instead was a porcelain-like face, too small as though from a baby doll. The features of the face didn't move, nor did the head swivel at all, just stayed straight-facing as the figure slowly walked. Terrified, I continue past at the sight and notice even further behind me off the side of the road a fence. Next to this fence is a large mound of moving people, most looking to be teenage males dressed in casual attire, just swaying and stretching and contorting as though they were all trapped in this mound and trying to reach something. My only thought was that they must all be homeless and somehow debilitated, and I turned in now even more of a panic back towards my car. I still searched for people who might belong to the child I had picked up, and soon noticed a few figures ahead past my car. Luckily it was at this point that I woke up, as if shaken out of sleep.

This really still has my hair raised and I've been awake almost twenty minutes now. The dreariness of this dream was so vivid and well set, sometimes I really have to wonder where the brain gets this stuff. It almost seems like the subconscious brain just feels like getting you going now and then, and so finds just the right pictures, scenes and emotions to really shake you up... Anyway I think I might finally try to get a little more sleep now.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_y3fjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/y3fjq/just_woke_up_from_what_is_easily_the_most_eerie/,

We were on an embankment of sand looking out at the ocean several yards away. There was that strange green beach grass around us and I could feel it scratching my leg making me itchy. 

""Do you know what they're calling it yet?"" I asked of Jin. He's a pre-med student and I often picked his brain. 

""Menarius I think."" He stared at the ocean not making eye contact with me. I told him I thought the name sounded stupid and he did not respond. 

Our conversation was in reference to a sickness that was killing everyone. It was not in the air, or in the blood but inexplicably it was passed on by touch. It attacked quickly and painfully and death was generally swift. The symptoms were unknown to me. No one seemed to understand where it came from or what to do about it. 

Down the beach a bit was a small gathering of people enjoying the hot sun. Nothing left to do but keep on living, I guess. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen. 

As I watched the quaint scene play out on the sand I heard a piercing scream from the water. Female. I jumped up and Jin did the same beside me. I recognized the girl. 

Her name was Erin and I had gone out on a few dates with her but blew it. It didn't diminish my affection for her and I always wondered if we would get back together. Now she was screaming and trying to pull herself out of the water. 

""Menarius"" Jin said beside me quietly. There was nothing we were going to be able to do. 

Erin was trying to get herself out of the water. The top half of her body had made it to the sand but water still crashed down on her legs and up to her waist. When the ocean would roll back out, I could see that her legs had somehow congealed together. Her bottom half looked like a flesh toned grub worm. Her screams were agonizing to me. 

""Something about the salt in the water is making it worse"" Jin told me. I didn't understand but nor did I question. Onlookers on the beach simply stood there. Some covered their faces with their hands. Some were on cell phones. No one could touch her. They just had to watch her struggle. 

Jin and I left the sandy hill and stood on the beach proper a bit in front of the ocean staring down. Erin had gone white and was wailing through her tears. 

Suddenly Jin grabbed my arm and yanked me aside, saving my life. How I didn't hear it I don't know but a Jeep sped down the beach toward the death scene and was unconcerned with me being in the way. It pulled up to the small gathering and stopped. A man jumped out. It was Erin's father. 

I heard her screaming ""Daddy"" at the sight of him and begging for his help. Without hesitation he ran to his daughter and pulled her up to the dry shore, cradling her in his arms. Jin winced audibly. Her father was now sick too. He kissed her forehead, pet her hair, tried to comfort her as best he could. 

Not wanting to see anymore the two of us turned away and began to walk down the beach in the opposite direction. Members of the small beach crowd did the same, leaving Erin and her father to themselves.

In the dream I'll be seduced by another man, I always know this man in the waking world and we have sex or some steamy make out session or just foreplay.
These dreams even happen when I'm sleeping with my boyfriend.

I always feel so guilty when I wake up and realise I've been dreaming about doing things I'd only ever do with my boyfriend to other guys to the point where I could cry.

Then, last night I had a dream I was having sex with my boyfriend but it had the same atmosphere as a cheating dream and when I said my boyfriends name the boyfriend in my dream said ""What the hell WhyteCrayon?! That's not my name! Who the hell is ******?!"" and stormed out.

And then, the song ""If I die Young"" by The Band Perry started playing on white speakers and everyone started to dance with the music.

 I turned over to turn on the little light beside my bed and it won't turn on. Usually this is my tell that I'm dreaming, but I didn't notice it at the time. When I turn back to face the larger part of the room, I notice a webcam is floating in mid air, angled like a snake about to strike. I calmly run out of the room, hoping the thing won't notice how scared I am. I find my father is downstairs, and notice that it is 6:58am. I'm shaking and trying to explain what is scaring me, when I notice the webcam thing is now floating at the top of the stairs. My cat runs upstairs to fight it, and I, frightened that it will hurt her, run after her. As I pull her away from the thing, she starts to hiss and scratch at me. I wake up.
  
  I shift to turn on the light, it doesn't turn on. The thing is back, floating beside my bed. I run into the bonus room next door, where my brother is laying on the couch. I try and get his attention, but he's watching movies on his laptop. It says 6:58 on the screen. I notice a crying toddler is right outside the room. I go a bit towards it, before realizing that there should be no children in the house. I'm yelling at my brother to notice this child, as it runs towards me. As she collides with me, I ask him ""who is this, who is this?"" and he says ""Duh, it's you."" I realize I'm dreaming and say as much, my brother smiles and says ""Yeah, alllll night long."" I wake up.
 
   Fully unnerved, I try to turn on the light. It won't turn on. I know I'm dreaming. I start crying. I try and wake myself up. This repeats two more times. One last time I wake up, and try the light. It works, and I'm awake, with tears still on my face.

 So I decide to get up and get on the computer cause I don't think I'll be sleeping again tonight. One note: As I was moving to turn on the room light, I wondered if I was still asleep. Then I notice my cat has taken a roll of toilet paper and shredded every bit leaving a nice mess for me. :) Knew then that I was truly awake.

I'm on a couch in my grandparents small vacation home in North Carolina, well when I say vacation home I mean twenty-five year old trailer that is beginning to show its years. The couch is a tawny brown, and has the appearance of corduroy. I like the feeling of it against my skin, it's fuzzy almost like a dog's ear.

I stand up and look around for the remote thinking that there has to be something worth watching, but something outside draws my attention, a feeling that something is looking at me. I walk over to the window and peer out into the yard. Nothing seems out of place. The grass is fading to brown along with the change of season, and the creek is babbling its way down the hollow into the forest, but nonetheless I can feel the hair standing on the back of my neck as something draws me out the front door.

I walk down the porch steps, and feel my bare feet sink slightly into the dew covered ground. The air is cold, but I don't mind. I need to know what it is that is giving me that watched feeling.

I make my was down the hillside to the little bridge crossing the creek, and walk across feeling all the more pensive. The big barn door is open, so I peer around, checking if the coast is clear, then slink in. Every sort of old farm equipment one could imagine is hanging on the walls, or laying on the bare earth floor, but it is none of this that piques my interest. Instead it is the wide carpeted staircase to my left that draws me in.

I don't remember this? This barn has been around for longer than I have been alive and I don't recall ever seeing a staircase in it before?

Nervously I make my way up...ten...eleven...twelve...thirteen steps, into a Victorian style living room flush with ornate wall hangings and a gaudy lit bronze chandelier casting an eerie light around the room. I feel as though I should leave, like I don't belong there, but my curiosity is overwhelming, and I need to see more.

I walk through the room, trying to avoid touching anything to an open door in the back left corner. It's a bedroom, though judging by the dust on the dresser and mirror no one has been here in a long time.

This is the general state of things as I look around the rest of the place. A kitchen with rusted faucets, and bare cabinets. A dining room set to feast a large host. Two more dust covered bedrooms. The place hasn't been touched for untold years, but is a total mystery to me. Where did it come from? Why have I never seen it? Thoroughly confused I leave down those stairs, and walk back into the yard. I must be dreaming. This is beyond strange.

I put my first foot on the old wooden bridge leading back towards the house when I hear a pounding from the top of the barn. Like a deer in the headlights I freeze, staring at the source of this sound. Like an avalanche it hits me, knocking me to the ground.

I sit straight up in my bed, gasping for breath looking for my attacker. I'm covered in sweat when I realize that I'm safe. I'm in my room. Its over.",,False,,t5_2qmbx,False,,,True,t3_wqgju,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/wqgju/so_guys_ive_been_having_the_same_dream_on_and_off/,
