Me: Yes. Well, I danced on Tuesday because I had a performance, but I only really moved for one or two hours, two and a half max.

Doc: That's still quite a bit of exercise, but okay. You haven't exercised since then?

Me: I took floorbarre this morning, but that's not really a work-out exactly, just mild resistance training. Kind of like a really gentle yoga class.

Doc: So what you're telling me is that you exercised this morning?

Me: Just floorbarre.

Doc: I think the antibiotics are doing the best they can. You REALLY just need to rest, you need to give your lungs a chance to recover. 

Me: I am resting. I've been resting. I'll be able to rest even more soon. I have to dance all day tomorrow and for a couple of hours on Monday because I have a performance, but after that I should be able to take a break. Well, I'm flying to Mexico on Tuesday which I guess isn't very restful, but once I'm there I can definitely rest a LOT.

Kind of crazy since they have almost 40k in combined comment and link karma, and posts there rarely made it to /r/all.

She barely checked her mod queue to release fair posts that were caught in the spam filter, and rarely (if ever) returned modmail.  

And since they NEVER participated in their own reddit much anyway, preferring /r/makeupexchange, I think this is for the better.  (I don't know why they didn't just find an alternate mod and hand over the reins, but whatevs.)

I'm posting to let everybody know.  I'll be posting here from now on.  It does seem that with over 5 times the subscribers, two additional mods (who are proud industry professionals), and an active interest in keeping their reddit a success, I think this place will be better suited for us all, anyway.

I propose that, similar to how /r/guns does their shooting matches, we will set the ""challenges"" or exhibitions or what have you as follows:

Once a week (or two weeks, or what have you), one person will post a challenge. In it, they will give a time constraint and 1-3 other rules as they see fit*. Then, the general populace will have 6-13 days (again, depending on the deadline of the challenge) to record a video of them dancing to the song. Once the video is recorded, the entrant posts it as a reply to the challenge post. On the day of the deadline, whoever posted the challenge will judge the entries and choose a ""winner,"" who will post the next challenge. 

To clarify, this isn't a competition and the poster has no obligation to pick the ""best"" dance--someone can just as easily ask and the poster can let the requestee make the next challenge. I just think this is a good system because it requires an individual to post a dance before they can post a challenge, and thus we'll hopefully get more good performances as a result.

*Regarding the 1-3 other rules, they can be as variable as desired. A challenge can have restrictions on song use, incorporation of props or specific styles, etc. What makes a challenge fun, though, is having a bit of direction without putting too much constraint on the type of performance, so to future challenge posters, keep that in mind.

All that said, let's get this going!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DANCE CHALLENGE, ROUND 1      
DEADLINE: 8/31/2011

**Rules:    **

* Minimum time is 45s, maximum time 75s (1m15s)
* Any style with any number of people is okay
* Can be choreographed (though please specify if you do freestyle!)
* Must use the song [Alors on Danse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoT4N43jK8). Remixes of the song are allowed (e.g., [Kanye West's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORqMkdP8TLo), or [Damon Paul's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpzNt0pZm3I)).

I will choose the ""winner"" on Sept 1. Any questions/comments/suggestions, please say something!

For years I have admired ballet, Women look beautiful while doing it and ive always fancied doing it myself, Since I was about 10, I have danced before, Did a contempory dance class thing for a couple of years when I was around 10 but Ive always maintained that ballet is for 'gays when I know full well it isnt, My mum would probably be supportive and take me but im just afraid of the huge amount of prejudice there seems to be towards guys who start doing ballet. Im 17 and a half, 6 foot tall and well built, Not particularly muscular but not fat, Ill get a picture yet, I dont want to get laughed at, Also would they put me with some like beginner kiddie group to learn because that would probably put me right off, Ballet is an amzing sport and I want to do it but Im not sure. Im not afraid of performing, I got up and danced all the single ladies by beyonce in a black gym leotard in front of all my years parents and half the year for a just kind of fun jokey show when I did drama in school, I know some people will just say ""Just go for it!"" but it isnt that easy :(

I was wondering if some more experienced dancers might be able to give their opinions. I obviously don't expect to be professional, but I'm wondering if with enough practice I'll be able to learn some advanced techniques at some point down the road or if it's already too late. Most people that I see have had decades of experience with excellent teachers; I'll just be dancing in my house -_-;; I'm going to give it a shot just for the hell of it, but I'm not sure what my expectations should be for my skill level.

I hope you'll check it out and ask some questions about my storied and oft-rumored careers...like:  

* my studies from the age of 7 at SAB and Joffrey 
* training at David Howard's on work-study scholarship through my teens 
* [working with Eddie Villella in the early years of the company,](http://i.imgur.com/olC1o6a.jpg)  
* why I left dancing to pursue [other freelance performing art forms](http://i.imgur.com/hVDU7gx.jpg),  
* why I returned to the classical form,  
* and what I've been up to since...including:
* [my Atheistic choreographic works in Texas](http://vimeo.com/markpanzarino) (&lt;--video),  
* [my fine art,](http://i.imgur.com/T6lP3T0.jpg) and

I decided to become a ballet dancer when I was 5, and worked hard to reach my goal. Moved away from home at age 16 to go to a ballet school in my neighbor country and managed to get a professional contemporary/classical ballet degree, but stopped there. Almost all years I was there I had back problems, and I concluded that the sacrifice for becoming a professional would be too big (very long term I'd suffer from bad chronic back pain (still have chronic back problems, but doesn't bother me too much in my day to day life) less long term I, short term because I would have to give up every waking moment to manage to keep my back healthy enough to keep dancing etc. and lots of other things) I was 19 when I stopped.

After I had made the decision to stop dancing I was a complete wreck and  had a big identity crisis and went through a depression for a few months (still kind of recovering three years later... I'm not the same person I used to be.. and occasionally have break downs crying because I miss dancing so much, especially after I dream about dancing for instance)

I left the last ballet class I had, about three years ago, crying. I've slowly managed to watch some ballet and dance again and enjoy it rather than just trying not to cry.

This may sound crazy for some, but I'm sure others who has been dancing and wanted nothing more their entire life can relate...

Anyway, I miss it a lot, and I want to be able to enjoy dancing even if it's not at a professional level. I have avoided it until now because I'm worried I won't be able to enjoy it since I will not be at the level I once was, and never actually be able to reach the level I wanted to reach.

But then I think back to when I was a kid, and how wonderful it was just to dance! And I think that somehow I should be able to ""lower the bar"" and be able to do it simply because I love it without mourning over what could have been.. so I emailed a ballet studio in my city that teach adult ballet classes, improver level, and I'm going there for a free trial class on Monday, but I'm scared to death!

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? Can anyone give me any advice or warnings on what to expect or tips on how to prepare, mentally and physically?

I'm worried I'll be too bad, I'm worried the class will be too bad which will depress me, I'm worried my back will be too problematic so I can't enjoy it at all and I'm worried I'll be too sad and again leave the class crying. 

I'm hoping I'll still be able to do some things, I've been working out quite a bit and should have a stronger core than ever before, I'm hoping I can forget about whatever I see in the mirror and just enjoy having the music move my body, I'm hoping it can be the start of a new ""era"" where I can actually enjoy dancing again and do it quite regularly.

It could easily go both ways and thinking about it is making me a mess.

help..?

**Edit**:
one more question..

I have one more issue that I would just like to put out there to sort of organize my thoughts or whatever, since you guys have given me such great feedback I feel like I can open up a bit more... Another ""issue"" is that I'm terrified I'll feel horrible about my body. I was borderline bulimic when I was dancing, and I rarely felt happy about my reflection. I'm definitely not thinner now than I was then, and I am currently working out and eating healthy to try to ""get my body back"" (If I weighed the same now as when I was dancing I would be thrilled because now I actually see how thin that was! I never appreciated it bck then, which really sucks! :P) but I'm still a lot ""softer"" to put it nicely than I would like to be and I'm worried this will freak me out when I see myself back in a ballet setting where my expectations for what I should see in the mirror are very different from the mirrors at home... I'm assuming I'm not the only one who's body has changed after not dancing for hours a day, and if you wouldn't mind I would really appreciate to hear about how you handled this when going back to dance! Hope I'm not asking too much or too personal, but we all know I think that with ballet half (or more :P) is kind of how you look. No matter how good you are you won't ""look"" good or at least not get a job unless you're thin, so my body image is pretty messed up. It's a lot better now that I haven't been dancing, so that's why I'm worrying it might go back to being completely twisted and messed up again... I'm repeating myself now I think, I just don't know exactly how to put it... anyway.. comments??

I'm a lanky 6'4 guy, and I loove house/tech/pretty much anything else also that isnt jazz, and I like moving to it. However, I feel 'awkward' and I can tell by expressions of others that I'm pretty terrible at it.

This is purely an ego thing. I know dancing is an expression and there's no 'wrong' way but I want to be good enough to be impressive.

Can you give me any resources for dancing to electronic music? ps: I've seen the infamous video on youtube.

Thank you kindly.",,False,,t5_2qhs0,False,,,True,t3_1hybot,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/1hybot/tired_of_being_a_terrible_dancer/,

My SO is a dancer/choreographer, and I'm a software engineer / computer scientist.  I was sitting in on her rehearsal today, and it seemed like iTunes was not suiting her needs very well.  She was trying to work on a particular phrase, and iTunes does not make it easy to rewind the piece - it's designed for skipping forward and back, rather than rewinding/fast forwarding.  Also, when other dancers wanted to start playing the music for a different piece, they didn't know which piece of music was for which piece of dance.

Knowing how to code, I figured I may be able to help her.  I talked her about what she would want in a choreography-focused music player, and we came up with a few ideas, but I want more input before I get started.

Here are some of the ideas we developed:

- rewind and fast forward buttons, rather than just 'skip track', 'previous track', and 'pause' buttons
- a field for the dance piece's title, along with the musical pieces title
- remote control, probably through a smart phone (Apple and Android I think can do this with some media players already)
- music ""checkpoints"", so you can easily start the piece at specific moments.  For example, being able to jump to the moment when a large group enters or exits the stage.  Or, if there's a phrase you want to practice, you can immediately jump to the start of that phrase at the push of a button.
- automatic beat analysis, so you can view your music in terms of measures and beats, rather than minutes and seconds (this would take a lot of work to get the presentation right, but the algorithms to do the analysis exist)

Questions for all of you

1. Would this be helpful? Would you use it? If your current player had some or all of the above features, do you think they would be helpful, or would they get in the way?
2. What other features do you think would helpful?  Are there different ways to implement the above features that you think could be more helpful?
3. Is there already a music player available that is better for choreography and dance?  Even if it isn't explicitly made for dancers/choreographers, is there one out there?

I'm serious about wanting to do this, so please give me whatever feedback you can think of.  I'll make an update post when/if I manage to make something stable enough to let you play with it.",,False,,t5_2qhs0,False,,,True,t3_1299tz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/1299tz/would_you_like_a_choreographyfocused_music_player/,

Now I've been to a handful of dance clubs over the past years for occasional celebration. Birthdays and what not. Never really accounted much to it but I was usually just the wall flower. 

Yesterday I was pressured to dance in a (hip hop/ pop) club, I realized how silly I looked and came here looking for some tips. Mind you that I have two left feet and no rhythm! Oh and to make things worse, I was with my date and last night was suppose to be THE NIGHT. I ended up being a disappointment. Not even the sheer amount of liquor I had ingested could help. I just have this mental block where I am too concern about how I look which at the same time makes me look more silly. Its easy to say ""dont worry about it! dont even think about it, who cares"" but thats not the case for me. **How did you overcome this mental block**? Aside from that I came here to look for a few easy moves I can start off with and work my way up. Im not looking to perform in Dancing with the stars, I just dont have an idea of what people do in the club. Let alone on the dance floor when everyone is watching. My best move is the head bobble and the ""shout and raise your hands in the air"" type of shit. But imagine doing that for the entire time. You get the idea  =(

A video perhaps even a tutorial would do great. Maybe even an inspiring story. Or perhaps maybe someone can share exactly how they practice at home.

I currently hate dancing and will do pretty much anything to avoid situations where dancing may arise. I swear I'm not saying this out of inhibition - it's not that I feel embarrassed or anything, I just don't get it. Whenever I do dance, I feel like I'm missing the point. Like I'm trying to tell jokes in a language that I can't yet speak.

I've come to accept that learning to dance is a pretty important skill, though, so I've decided to take classes. The problem is: I don't know what kind of dance to learn. I tried salsa dancing for a couple of months but I don't know many girls who also know salsa, which makes it a bit pointless for me, with it being a partner dance and everything.

So for the sake of weddings, balls, clubs - what's the most useful dance to learn? It's important that it shouldn't be a dance which requires that my partner also knows it. Just something that doesn't make me look awkward and odd?

Thanks in advance,

James",,False,,t5_2qhs0,False,,,True,t3_12j76s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/12j76s/whats_the_most_useful_kind_of_dance_to_learn/,

Well some people when they think about breakdancing usually think about all the flips and tricks. Yes those play parts in our dancing, but The main foundation is Top Rocks, Footwork, Power, Freezes. Anyways whenever you see a bboying top rocking it just means he's usually on their two feet or standing and doing the step thing they do. 

In actuality that in itself is a dance on it's own. Take sometime to watch some funky top rocks.

We went to a local swing dance a couple months back and while I could do the basic steps, I got really frustrated since I didn't know any moves outside of very simple turns.  Whereas she could watch some of the other people and mimic their moves fairly easy, I had a hard time.

Would it make sense for us to take a class together or should I try to somehow catch up in skill?  Also, is it possible to go as a couple and not have to change partners every two minutes but stay with your partner the whole time?  If she were more at my level of dance ineptitude, I think I'd feel better about it.

Have any of you had the experience of trying to learn to dance with a worse partner?  How'd it go?

I must warn you that this is a VERY long post and that this is possibly one of the most controversial topic in the dance community. This post will focus on two subjects in particular: breaking and ""hip hop"" choreography. Further disclaimer: this is not simply MY opinion but the collection of FACTS. I cannot properly cite my sources, so keep that in mind too. Please read through everything BEFORE criticizing or drawing conclusions. Or just don't read anything, hit the ""back"" button, and enjoy your day =]

First, a little background about myself: I'm currently a college kid teaching hip hop classes at my local studio. I'm currently an officer for my school's bboying (more commonly known as break dancing) club and I am part of a co-ed, choreography based team. I got into dancing in high school and follow the southern California choreography circuit and the U.S. bboy scene very closely via multitudes of youtube videos, classes, events, and in very fortunate, rare cases, discussion with celebrities of the scenes. Now, enough about myself.

Hip Hop is defined as a culture, which started in the 70s, comprised of 4 elements: MCing (rapping), Scratching (DJing), Graffiti (tagging), and Bboying (break dancing). The parentheses denote mainstream nomenclature. Rule of thumb: if it isn't one of the above, it isn't hip hop. Even the dance styles such as locking and popping (two COMPLETELY separate dance styles, by the way) aren't considered hip hop; they are called funk styles that began in the 60s as a series of ""party dances"" that were strung together, developed, and cultivated to what they are today.

Now, what about this ""hip hop"" choreography that studios teach? First, if they aren't teaching breaking fundamentals or moves, it isn't hip hop. Second, these classes began around the 90s when studio jazz dancers started to imitate and replicate the street dance styles (breaking, popping, locking, vogue) and teach it to their students. It increased exposure of a ""hip hop"" style but it neglected the roots and history of where these jazz dancers got the moves they taught.

This leads to the biggest issue of the so-called ""hip hop"" dance style (or, as the Koreans call it, Urban style or LA style): there are no basic fundamental moves to teach. Each class and each lesson of an urban style class is the instructor's own interpretation of music in the form of choreographed 8-counts. Compare this with breaking: everyone knows about the basic starting moves such as windmills, six-step, and baby freeze. There is ALWAYS a basic fundamental in every dance for people to learn in styles such as ballet and jazz, yet what are the basics for ""hip hop"" choreography? A bboy can tell you what the basics moves for bboying. A ""hip hop"" choreographer can not. In this practical, basic definition alone, true hip hop dance is bboying.

I say all this with no disrespect to dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Lyle Beniga, Keone Madrid, and many others whom I hold the highest esteem for, but true hip hop dance heroes are the bboys such as Storm and Ken Swift and many leaders of the bboy scene today such as Kid David, Casper, Machine, and the countless, talented, and often underrated bboys. I have a love for both scenes, but history is important and to ignore it is to ignore the hard work of many who kept true hip hop moving forward. Just because something isn't hip hop doesn't mean it is not beautiful, expressive, nor skillful; it's just a different way to do things.

No TL;DR. You either read it or you didn't and for those that did, I thank you and look forward to your opinions or thoughts and I would love to discuss any points that weren't quite clear or any tangents to this subject.",,False,,t5_2qhs0,False,,,True,t3_ln8gr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/ln8gr/hip_hop_choreography_and_bboying/,

The overarching idea is to have a few different pieces like this, with similar odd-timed dance music. Musicians seem to enjoy it, but it would be great to maybe put together a show with a choreographer in the future.

I am currently getting help from a friend on learning to dance, but I was wondering what I can do to practice and get better in my free time when I don't have access to my friend or a studio?  Any help is appreciated!

**EDIT 1:** I am thinking mostly of ""smaller"" skills that I can learn and practice to help me as I begin doing more instruction, like things I'm able to do at home.  Maybe some simple poses or exercises to help me prepare.

**EDIT 2:** I also do yoga at least 3 to 4 times a week for posture and balance, and I also do a bit of strength training when I can.  In terms of balance, I have a hard time maintaining a stable foot/ankle when I'm balancing on one leg.  I have also always been very flexible, but my hips aren't very flexible, so I have a hard time staying balanced doing anything with my feet turned out.

Also, for those who have talked about strength, are there specific exercises you recommend?

I loved the answers!

* But, I'm getting serious into dancing and would love to know if there are any websites that constantly updates on dance culture or possibly have dance groups participate and contribute content. 

Pretty much a site that curates a large amount of dance videos from dance groups.
Kind of like Techcrunch for Dance. I digest large amounts of information for my field and sites like Techcrunch &amp; Business Insider does it perfectly, but for Dance, it seems I'm disjointed by following separate dance groups on youtube. Actually, Fader or Pitchfork magazine is closer to what I'm looking for Dance. (I want to be immersed in it)

* The website has to exist, but I'm not having any luck finding it. I googled every term, but usually takes me to some pretty lame pages.
The closest thing I've run into is Worldofdance.com. They're great, but they seem to only highlight Chachi and Mos Wanted Crew. 

* I want more of an overall digest of 100's of dance groups not just the two.
at the moment my main digest for dance inspiration is Mywaydance and Yak films. They both do brilliant jobs. But I'm looking for a website that covers all of them.

Thanks guys!!!

1321070291.0,8,self.Dance,m9h35,This is pretty embarrassing but I thought I'd share a story (and possibly get some feedback as well?),8,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/m9h35/this_is_pretty_embarrassing_but_i_thought_id/,"First: I had an incredibly long, elaborated version of this written down and instinctively clicked the reddit logo before posting so I am rewriting it from scratch (and will most probably skip some details this time around. Feel free to ask questions if everything's not clear)

I should start by saying that I'm a 24 year old, straight male and I have a secret. I've always wanted to dance. I was born and raised in a French town of Canada and when I turned 3 my dad bought me my first set of ice skates. I learned to ice skate before I started school but I think that's fairly common up here. My dad had played hockey in college, and so did his brother... being raised in the 60's here you either played hockey or were the laughing stock of your neighborhood. It was only natural to my dad to push me into it. Unfortunately I wasn't very good at it, and I'm not sure if that's why, but I also didn't like it that much. I played a bit growing up but never joined a team and stuck to playing on outdoor rinks mostly because all my friends also played. It was always more of a social thing for me, I hated the cold and couldn't stand the older kids who acted like they were gonna be the next Gretzky. 

My mom had always been a fan of dance movies. I guess that's pretty common to any woman who was in her 20's during the 80's and it would be a lie to say that watching those with her weren't part of me growing up. I was raised speaking only in French but I could recite every single line from west side story (deeeeaaar kindly sergeant Krupke!) before I could speak proper English, and I knew all the move in Footloose. Nowadays I get my 'fix' watching Glee. That's right, I'm a 24 year old straight man who never misses an episode of Glee!

Anyways. When I was a bit older I had a friend who's cousin took a hip hop dance class. At one point I guess the word got out in their family that it was a good way to get the kids off the N64 and my buddy started taking the classes as well. After a while they'd be more that happy to show their moves off every chance they got and got me really interested. I wasn't too aware of what the hell hip hop was yet (I was 9 or so) but it seemed cool to me, so I asked my parents about it. Now I can't blame them totally for this, but they refused. My dad said that dancing wasn't for boys and signed me up for karate classes instead (which in a way was similar to dancing and I kept with it for 5 or 6 years). This kinda makes my dad sound like an ass but it was rural Canada in the late 90's (my dad watches So you think you can dance! now), and as a 9 year old (still true today) I had so many interests that it was probably hard for my parents to know if it was something I actually was gonna enjoy or something I'd get sick of after a month.

Fifteen years or so later. I'm 24 now and I still want to dance. I don't want to do it as a career but I've seen multiple dance shows in the last couple of years (I've moved for college and now have access to a lot more culture) and I've pursued education in a scientific field which I love but I still have the desire to just do it. When I'm alone I'll sometimes clear an area in my room, put a Youtube video and try to follow along, until I realize that I'm a grow man dancing in his bedroom, get slightly embarrassed and stop. I've never told anybody this before, not even my girlfriend of 4 years. We did attempt 2 different dancing classes: salsa and swing, but didn't enjoy it. Both classes required the girls to go around and switch partners (which I heard is pretty common in those classes) so I ended up spending 90% of the evening with strangers and it kinda took the fun out of it. The Youtube practice sessions thing have come in handy though as I often get complimented on my sense of rhythm when I dance at parties or when I'm out with friends, something that surprises everyone because you couldn't tell by looking at me (way to skinny for my height, comic book/science-related t-shirt, typical nerd look)

And that's it. This is my story r/dance. I've thought of taking classes before, but I feel so ridiculous because it seems like I'm too old to start. I'm really interested in the freer style of modern dance which seems to be something people start with at a very young age. Contrary to couples dancing where people start when they feel like it (or because their girlfriend/wife drags them) and has a lot of 'beginners' classes for adults. I have a very hard time imagining myself taking modern classes with a bunch of 10 year old girls who are miles ahead of myself.

Sorry for the long post, just thought I'd share and I'd love to hear your stories, especially if you've started dancing in your 20's (or older!) and eventually got to a point where you were good enough for it to not be embarrassing! :)",,False,,t5_2qhs0,False,,,True,t3_m9h35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/m9h35/this_is_pretty_embarrassing_but_i_thought_id/,

They know its my first time teaching but it's kind of a weird event that celebrates underground art in general, so I thought it would be a good low pressure place to gain experience.  

It's up to me to teach whatever style(s) I choose. I was thinking Botting/isolations/Floating/Gliding...butalso considering liquid/Digitz 

Well, in going over the details, a few things have surfaced that are WAYYYY different than what I anticipated.

--it's one big giant room
--they are expecting several HUNDRED people
--With the exception of a smoking spot outside, all the action goes down in the one area. Which means, during my workshop, a bunch of people are probably going to end up doing it that didn't even KNOW there was a dance workshop...

I was thinking I'd have 3-12 people and be in a side room or early for the people that specifically wanted to do it. 

Now Some people will be too shy and what not buy even still, I could easily have 80/90 people! 

God knows how much variation in skill level. Any ideas/modifications/encouragement/words of wisdom/prayers for managing such a large group and as a n00b instructor?

2. Don't bounce up and down. Dance smooth.

3. Men, don't push the woman around . Lead by indication, not by pulling and pushing.

4. Don't break your frame. Forearms should stay parallel to the floor in open position.

5. Don't let your elbows pass your sides in a push. In open position, keep your elbows slightly in front of your center line.

6, Don't dance with your arms. Keep arms firm and don't keep time with your arms.

7. Don't let your hands rise up during a push. Keep forearms, wrists, and hands parallel to the floor.

8. Don't float around. Anchor your weight at the end of each set of movements.

9. Don't use your thumbs. Use fingers only, keeping your thumbs clear, and never squeeze!

10. Men, don't advance forward to lead anything. Step to the side, and/or back, but not forward.

11. Don't look at the floor. Look up, be proud, and smile.

12. Men, don't start a pattern on the one count. Start on the and-one.

13. Ladies, don't back lead. It hurts our feelings.

14. Don't get too far apart. Stay close, take smaller steps, and keep your frame.

15. Men don't lift you hands high over the woman's head to lead turns. Lift just above her head.

Couldn't have created a better list myself.

That is all.

I am a 17 year old female, and I have always had a secret desire to be a dancer, however I have little confidence (especially when it comes to performing) and instead of trying to do a dance routine I would mess around and laugh at myself. Over the years I have tried to attend dance classes but usually leave after one lesson because i'm no good or don't think i'll be good. I have rhythm and am good at party type dancing, as i'm pretty good and confident at making my own dance moves and finding the beat and rhythm do you think I could start a hobby in dancing? What types of dancing do you recommend? Any similar stories? Oh and the big question... have I left it too late?

I started doing bellydance/tribal fusion to learn better control but it was very technical and I found I couldn't apply it much to the other dancing I was doing. It was also very discouraging because it takes years before you get anything out of it (unlike some of the others- ceroc, etc). I love dancing but would like to be part of a class where I can see improvements. The movement in bellydance was too micro (at a beginners level).

Basically, I can pick up choreography pretty well and fairly quickly. I have decent flexibility and I'm still working on it. However, I lack creativity and the ability to create my own choreography. It's like a very talented artist, who could make amazing replications of some of the best artwork..but cannot even begin to produce an original creation.

I started learning ballroom dancing in December, and it's been a great deal of fun and has helped me in many aspects of my life.

The only issue is how expensive it is to learn.  I know that there are certainly other, cheaper studios to switch to when I run out of money for this endeavor, but I'd really like to continue just in general.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any resources aimed at helping fledgling dancers afford the lessons?

I've done some Googling, but it's mostly large, professional sponsorship places that are returned.  I doubt they'd be up for helping me with my piddly lessons, haha.  I figured I'd ask on here because some of you may have actual experience with this kind of thing or other advice.

By this I mean, you can understand when that popping looks like what people might call ""the robot"" dance sometimes but they might not understand how technically difficult it is to strobe or tick. Musicality in dance is the same way for non-dancers or musicians, they feel it, but they dont know why or what it is that made that particulary interesting to watch. 

So I'm wondering, (**TL;DR**)  are there any lockers out there on reddit?

They have a small team. I'm teaching two acro classes and one modern class, but just got asked today if I'd mind choreographing a small modern group for their intermediate/senior team.
Because the team is still small, the group is small and the age range is big, though they're all great dancers. Two seventeen-year-olds, one thirteen-year-old, one twelve-year-old, and one VERY advanced ten-year-old.
It was hard finding some music that's appropriate for that big of an age range but I settled on ""Us"" by Regina Spektor (I realize Regina is somewhat overdone for Modern, but I've only seen one dance to this song done before). My next step is costumes. What would you recommend for this song that would look appropriate on both older girls and younger girls?
My first studio ordered catalog costumes for every number and sometimes those got a bit tiring; I'm not a fan of the super-overdone sequin dresses as the whole thing looks too ""competition"" style. My second studio gave a fair mix of catalog costumes and home-made ones, though sometimes it got too predictable. Just, ""Oh, get some black short-shorts and we'll throw a nice top on it.""
The one thing I was kind of thinking was black shorts, white beaters, and baggy plaid overshirts, but I kind of pushed that out of my mind because it doesn't go with the song very well.

""Respect My Step is a project set to connect the dance community via viral video and social identity. An online network where dancers and non-dancers alike can come together to share ideas in dance, culture, and innovation. The idea began to brew when an unlikely duo of choreographer, Jermaine Browne, and technologist, Edgardo Burgos, began to discuss the future of dance as well as advancements in technology.

“I wanted to give dance a bigger voice.” said Jermaine. “Get it to a larger audience and put a name to the nameless faces who share a passion for dance. A place to bring everyone together.”

“Technology affects every sector in life and culture,” continued Edgardo, “so I started thinking about how the dance community was affected. How can technology embrace the dance community?”

Together, they learned about each others fields, discovered and explored possibilities to make their vision come true, and created the perfect synergy of technology and dance. With a name like Respect My Step - everyone can relate. Jermaine explains: “Peoples passions are a part of them and they shouldn’t be judged for what they enjoy to do. You are who you are and you should be respected for that.”

has anyone else been in this rut? what did you do to get yourself noticed? how did you become a better dancer? i'm co-choreographing a duet for our spring show with a good friend of mine and i really hope that it will showcase what i can do, but i'm feeling really lost and frustrated.
