These are super simple thoughts that any artist or creative person (sharing in makinghiphop because y'all are my favorite tho) can use to overcome writer's block or remind yourself all of the different directions you can go. Rappers and producers alike will hopefully find some inspiring stuff here!

emphasize repetitions

abandon normal instruments

accept advice

accretion

a line has two sides

allow an easement (an easement is the abandonment of a structure)

are there sections? Consider transitions

Ask people to work against their better judgement

ask your body

assemble some of the instruments in a group and treat the group

balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle

be dirty

breathe more deeply

bridges -build -burn

cascades

change instrument roles

change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency

children's voices -speaking -singing

cluster analysis

consider different fading systems

consult other sources -promising -unpromising

convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element 

courage!

cut a vital connection

decorate, decorate

define an area as 'safe' and use it as an anchor

destroy -nothing -the most important thing

discard an axiom

disconnect from desire

discover the recipes you are using and abandon them

distorting time

do nothing for as long as possible

don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do 

don't be frightened of cliches

don't be frightened to display your talents

don't break the silence

don't stress one thing more than another

do something boring

do the washing up

do the words need changing?

do we need holes?

emphasize differences

emphasize repetitions

emphasize the flaws

faced with a choice, do both

feedback recordings into an acoustic situation

fill every beat with something

get your neck massaged

ghost echoes

give the game away

give way to your worst impulse

go slowly all the way round the outside

honor thy error as a hidden intention

how would you have done it?

humanize something free of error

imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar

imagine the music as a set of disconnected events

infinitesimal gradations 

intentions -credibility of -nobility of -humility

into the impossible

is it finished?

is there something missing?

is the tuning appropriate?

just carry on

left channel, right channel, center channel

listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly

listen to the quiet voice

look at a very small object, look at its center

look at the order in which you do things

look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them

lowest common denominator check -single beat -single note -single riff

make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame

make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last thing on the list

make a sudden, destructive unpredictable action; incorporate

mechanicalise something idiosyncratic

mute and continue

only one element of each kind

(organic) machinery

overtly resist change

put in earplugs

remember those quiet evenings

remove ambiguities and convert to specifics

remove specifics and convert to ambiguities

repetition is a form of change

reverse

short circuit (example; a man eating peas with the idea that they will improve his virility shovels them straight into his lap)

shut the door and listen from outside

simple subtraction

spectrum analysis

take a break

take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance

tape your mouth

the inconsistency principle

the tape is now the music

think of the radio

tidy up

trust in the you of now

turn it upside down

twist the spine

use an old idea

use an unacceptable color

use fewer notes

use filters

use 'unqualified' people

water

what are you really thinking about just now? incorporate

what is the reality of the situation?

what mistakes did you make last time?

what would your closest friend do?

what wouldn't you do?

work at a different speed

you are an engineer

you can only make one dot at a time

you don't have to be ashamed of using your own ideas

1370654865.0,37,self.makinghiphop,1fwhay,[Discussion] Why's everyone trying to make it so fast?,46,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1fwhay/discussion_whys_everyone_trying_to_make_it_so_fast/,"I'll start this by saying I'm not the best rapper in the world. I'm alright, but to get to alright I've put thousands upon thousands of hours into the craft. I don't mean for this to come off as hate, but I've just been wanting to say this somewhere for a while. 


If you are just starting to make music, or have just started in the last few years, **take your time**. I'm not calling people out for posting music here, because this is a perfect place for new musicians to post their music, but I guess I just want people to understand that you don't have to ""make it"" today.



Everyone is always quick to give out the advice, ""never give up"" and ""let haters hate"" but I don't hear enough people emphasizing the fact that, for 99.999999 percent or rappers, rap is not a gift, it's a skill that takes years to perfect. You will most likely struggle, and be incredibly frustrated by the fact that you can't make things the way you want to, but that is all part of it. Eventually it'll start clicking and things will sound more and more how you want them to.  


Take the time to study rappers, learn how to mix your own shit, and develop a style that is unique to you while not being afraid to push the boundaries of it. Focus more on whether it's fun and rewarding rather than success, and the hope is that eventually you'll know when its time to take the next step. 

Last, but not least, understand the the chances of any of us ""making it"" is minuscule, and you are no different. You need to come to terms with this. Although it is a possibility, imo you should focus on the journey. That's the fun part.  

I might be wrong, but I hope other people agree with me. 

TLDR; Rap is a craft, not a gift. Take the time to develop it before you start the ""hustle"". ",,False,,t5_2sqw4,False,,,True,t3_1fwhay,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1fwhay/discussion_whys_everyone_trying_to_make_it_so_fast/,

1374687281.0,35,self.makinghiphop,1iyvig,[Discuss] Real Rappers Can Take Criticism.,38,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1iyvig/discuss_real_rappers_can_take_criticism/,"I've noticed that a lot of the feedback i get on both the daily feedback and cypher threads is really quick, mostly positive, and leaves me feeling empty.  I'm the type of dude who thrives by fixing the problems, and hearing ""yo that is dope"" doesn't do much for me.  In my attempt to fix this i have tried to start giving constructive criticism to some submissions and lead by example.  Now most people man up and even appreciate it.  Even if we disagree, it is all art any ways, and we are trying to get better, so it is all good.  Recently, though, i noticed that i will give some feedback and come back and not only will it get down voted, but my cypher submission will be downvoted as well.  When i saw that, i began to realize why people don't give much criticism: the stakes are too high when you are later asking those same people to vote for you.  

So before i rattle off some solutions, do others even think this is a problem?  Are people in general cool with the type and amount of feedback they receive?  I'm sure there are plenty of people who light up when they see a simple ""this is fire"" comment, especially when it comes from an MC they admire.  I also am sure there are people out there who vibe on the feedback, and want to hear more real talk.  

Here's some ideas, in no particular order:

Make a tag that spells out what type of feedback you want (e.g. ""Keep it positive."" or ""Trying to get better, tear it apart"" or ""I have a specific question about this specific aspect of this song.""  

Require people to leave a comment if they give a down vote, at least on the cypher thread.  The temptation to selfishly hand out down votes in a competition is too high for some people to resist.  Sometimes shit needs to get down voted (broken links, offensive raps, etc.) but there should always be a reason behind it that is better than ""i want my submission to be above yours.""

Lastly, I know people decided on the voting thing, but i think some of this could have been resolved by the two bracket idea. All we'd have to do is require people in bracket A to give feedback to people in bracket B.  That way people aren't just trying to give positive feedback for the sake of later votes, and people aren't tempted to selfishly down vote a submission just to increase their own prospects.  

Anyway, just some thoughts.  I love this sub and spend far too much time on it.  It has a lot of great things going for it.  I just wonder if any one feels me on these specific problems.

Edit:
TL;DR
Does the feedback suck because:

a) People want to give good feedback but are scared of hurting people's feelings?

b) People want to give good feedback but are scared that if they do, they will get downvotes on the competition threads?

c) The feedback doesn't actually suck, and that people like me are just in the minority and shouldn't expect constructive criticism?",,False,,t5_2sqw4,1374691289.0,,,True,t3_1iyvig,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1iyvig/discuss_real_rappers_can_take_criticism/,

----------

alright, so last week went pretty good except for the fact i don't know how to count **ayes**, so i'll work on that.

----------

**How the cypher works**: There are 5 judges. They must listen to every entry and reply to every entry that they believe should move on to the voting thread. If an entry gets 3 or more ""OKs"", it moves on to the voting thread.

Judges can choose to give feedback to entries they haven't chosen (I didn't make it mandatory because of time issues.)

Also, whoever produces the beat for the week has the choice to take the spot of a judge and choose which entries should move on. 

IMPORTANT CHANGE: SUBMISSION OF ENTRIES ENDS SATURDAY, 9 PM EST 

Schedule:

Tuesday 10 AM - 4PM - New cypher thread is posted

Tuesday - Saturday 9 PM  -- Post your entries

Next 24 hrs are dedicated to the judges choosing entries

Sunday 9 PM - Voting thread is posted

Voting ends Monday at 11 PM - Winner is declared, contact winner for next beat and theme, blah blah blah

Your judges: ReeG, SooWooMaster, LD5ifty, Manisphesto, and IbrahimT13 (who takes the place of kailman).

Two other things:

1. judges can participate in the cypher, but they can't be voted on or win

2. judges must give 15 OKs, but they have a limit of 25

I've just put together a website where I am going to record some of my piano improvisation and upload the piano music along with the midi data, so that you can sample it for your own music, or use the MIDI data. You have my permission to use it for any song you want, including commercial projects. Its improv, so at times hit or miss, but I hope it is useful.

I think this could be very helpful to a the beginners and to those without any substantial keyboard skills. 

I plan to add new content often as long as the response is positive, so check back! I've only got two files up there now, and I've kept them pretty simple for now - I'll try out some more esoteric stuff in the future.

The soundcloud has a simple drumtrack I used to keep time, but the download is just the piano and midi data in a .zip

Right now the name is The Review Exchange, also I was kicking around the idea of Play It Forward, however that domain was taken.

The premise is you have to feed 3 tracks before you submit your own, the feed would have a minimum word limit and also a rating from 0-100; there would also be a section when submitting your song to write any description or things you particularly want feed on.

The songs you feed would be chosen first from those with the fewest feeds, then from the ones which have been there the longest.

This can take away the problems of

1. People just leaving their tracks without feeding others
2. People only feeding the good songs and ignoring the ones which actually need feed

Also, with the rating system I was thinking of setting up some kind of ""top songs of the week"" chart, where the positions would be based on how people have rated your track.

Another thing I was thinking was an Artist Spotlight for who evers song had finished first in the weeks ratings.

Anyways, I just wanted to see if you guys thought this was a good idea and if you would have interest in participating in something like this before I go through all the work to set it up.

1364074482.0,30,self.makinghiphop,1avore,Some tips for the Emcees/Producers who record. ,33,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1avore/some_tips_for_the_emceesproducers_who_record/,"After mixing the 24 hour cypher last night, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give some links and tips for people who are home recording. 

I'm not criticizing the quality of the tracks at all. Not everyone has money to throw around on $500 microphones. People will use what they have. But there are some things you can do to make the quality of the recording better. Like it or not, the quality (especially DIY) is a factor in how people respond to your music, whether they know it not. 

For people who are actually interested in the science behind this. Here is a [2010 Study by Earl Vickers of STMicroelectronics](http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/loudnesswar/loudness_war.pdf). This paper was explained at the 2010 Audio Engineering Society (AES) Convention. 

&gt;Physical fatigue, in turn, may consist of two types: 
mechanical cochlear fatigue and neural or biochemical 
cochlear fatigue. Keeping in mind that loudness (a 
perceptual phenomenon) and intensity (a physical 
phenomenon) are not perfectly correlated, Johnston 
suggested that mechanical cochlear fatigue may be due 
to high intensity, since outer hair cell damage appears to 
correlate to intensity. [59]
High loudness, on the other hand, can cause outer hair 
cells to depolarize, suggesting the possibility of 
biochemical fatigue. In addition, the inner hair cell 
firing rate is largely proportional to loudness (not 
intensity), also suggesting biochemical fatigue. [59]
Johnston mentioned that listening to something that 
sounds harsh, even if it’s not that loud, can make us 
want to run screaming in a few minutes; it’s not clear whether this is a physiological or intellectual process 
[59]. In a comparison of various loudspeakers, Berkow 
noticed that more distortion components can give 
speakers a fuller, richer sound, but they also cause 
fatigue and “wear the ears out sooner” [49].

The point being. Even if people themselves don't realize it, over compressed music can have real effects on the hearing process and affects the way the brain processes music. People are more likely to say really compressed music sounds better, but are actually less likely to listen to it again. 

Most people who make music don't really realize this, and this has been a point really pushed by sound engineers. See [The Loudness War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war)

There are two types of compression. Dynamic Range Compression and Audio Compression. 

**Audio Compression** is what most people who listen are familiar with. This is really different compression algorithms for making file sizes smaller. 

MP3s are an example of this. MP3s compress the lossless audio (.wav) so that the file sizes can be smaller but keep as much information as possible.

This is why a .wav file of a vocal track can be 60mb. But an mp3 can be 12mb. MP3 can compress the size and how much information is kept is related to file size and quality. An MP3 320 kb/s (kilobits per second) will sound better than a MP3 128 kb/s because the 320 is processing more information per second. 

MP3 128 kb/s is equal to radio quality (If I remember right). MP3 320 kb/s is pretty much equal to CD quality. So thats something to remember when you're rendering and saving your tracks. 

Since most people use Soundcloud, they should know that SC reencodes all tracks to 128 kb/s when streaming. So if you decide to upload the .wav of your track that is lossless and 60mb. When people are streaming it, it will only ever play back at 128 kb/s. Which is why it won't sound as good as you hear it in your DAW or playback like itunes. What you upload your track in is only good when people are downloading it. Their download will be the quality of whatever you uploaded. 


**Dynamic Range Compression** is what most people are familiar with when they make/record/mix music. 

The Wikipedia definition is 

&gt;Dynamic range compression, also called DRC or simply compression, reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet sounds by narrowing or ""compressing"" an audio signal's dynamic range. Compression is commonly used in sound recording and reproduction and broadcasting.

For a simpler idea. Check [this post from /r/wearethemusicmakers that is basically an Explain Like I'm 5 post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/1aivub/can_someone_please_explain_compression_like_i_am_5/c8xvud2)

If that isn't good enough. Youtube is full of videos of people explaining things like this and showing examples. 

Most DAWs come with a compressor in the effects list. So pretty much everyone should be familiar with what they look like.

So the first tip. 

If you don't know what Compression is, or when it should be used - **You shouldn't be doing it**

Don't throw it on your track just because other people do it. Take the time to sit down and read and learn what it is and when you should be using it. 

There is nothing wrong with compression. Heavy compression is a staple of hip hop, but it has to be done in moderation. I'm not going to name any people specifically, but I've heard tracks from people in here whose music was extremely over compressed. Learning how to use it when it needs to be used, and not overdoing it will make your tracks a lot better. 

Tip two for vocals. Read this link

http://audio.tutsplus.com/tutorials/recording/how-to-record-vocals-in-a-bedroom/

Recording vocals is a big issue with home recording. If you're not in an isolation booth with a good microphone, you're not going to get studio quality. That's obvious, but there are somethings you can do to make your recordings sound better. 

Depending on where you're recording, you're probably getting a natural reverb in your track. There are ways to dampen it, but not totally get rid of it. 

A reflection filter is a good thing to use. It will dampen the sound in the area facing you while you record. [Here is a picture](http://www.inta-audio.com/images/products/medium/1282810601-04367200.jpg)

If you have the money to buy one. Great. If not, it is possible to make your own. You can get some [Auralex Studio Foam for $5](http://www.zzounds.com/item--AUR2WD01CG)

Shop around. Read reviews. See what people say about different brands and check prices on different thickness of foam. 

A Pop Filter is also a good idea. If you say the word **P**arachute, or any word with a P. You'll notice that you have to push air out of your mouth to enunciate the letter. That popping noise is easily picked up on a microphone. It will also pick up Vocal Sibilance. Think of the *tsh* sound of a hi hat. That sort of sound does occur in vocal tracks. Usually around the 5Khz and above range. Here is a [picture](http://www.karmamics.com/shop/images/D/RF_1_Trinity_Filter_Natural.jpg) of a pop field in front of a mic, surrounded by a reflection shield

[You can find youtube videos for creating your own for just a few dollars](https://www.youtube.com/results?q=make+your+own+pop+filter&amp;aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=w1). Really all you need is a round apparatus and women's nylons for a really cheap filter. 

So that covers the areas where you're facing and recording. A lot of people forget about behind the head. Sound may be directed at one direction, but it bounces around a room as it hits reflective surfaces (walls, windows, corners). This is why people typically get a fairly reverbed track when they don't record in a treated room. 

Heavy blankets are actually a very cheap and easy way to dampen this. It won't get rid of it, but it will help. Hang heavy blankets along the walls, in the corners, over windows, under the seals of doors, and especially on the floor if you have a tiled floor (that isnt carpet). It's a surprisingly cheap way to reduce the dramatic reflections a room will give off when recording. It's also good for the room you plan on mixing in if you're using near field monitors. 

Here's another link for explaining this 

http://audio.tutsplus.com/articles/general/soundproofing-and-acoustic-treatment-for-home-studios/

Those are just a few things. If anyone does decide to read this. Check the links. Read other websites. A few cheap and simple methods can really up the quality of your recordings.

1366972809.0,30,self.makinghiphop,1d5a5c,A thing or 2 about recording/compression on your vocals. I posted this a few months ago but i think it´s time again.,32,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1d5a5c/a_thing_or_2_about_recordingcompression_on_your/,"I´ve noticed that some of the MC´s here at MHH don't really know their way around recording techniques.
This is not a bashing, I'm here to help you sound more professional.
One really important thing with recording vocals is compression, i´m not going to explain how compression works but i´m going to give you some pointers.

Google where you can find the compressor in your DAW.
Now there are 4 parameters that you can change on the compressor:

* Threshold: At what dB do you want the compressor to kick in. -This will depend on the source.

* Attack: How fast the compression will kick in after reaching the threshold. -Faster settings for a more noticeable compression, slower setting for a more transparent sound. a good start on vocals is around 3ms-8ms.

* Release: How fast the compressor will let go once below the threshold. - Most compressors will have a ""AUTO"" mode, this often works really well.

* Ratio: -Higher setting for a more noticeable compression, lower setting for a more transparent sound. For rap vocals you should be around 4:1 - 8:1 (often closer to 4:1 rather then 8:1).

The mic is your weapon of choice, and the new USB-mic´s that are out there are really awesome for the price. You don't even need a expensive sound card. And remember, record in a bigger room with lots of furniture rather then a sterile closet.
Remember that this isn´t rules, these are just pointers..

You accent the beat, you're like another part of it. Think of drums, right? Drums have the bass and snare doing seperate but equal rhythms, and then the high hats following suite. It's like the musical Plessy v. Fergussion. Listen to Andre 3000 and notice how he rhymes on the 3 instead of the 4, on top of just making his voice follow the drums. 

That's a very broad question. I mean you could say anybody here needs tons of work. What you need to focus on is keeping your flow consistent and making sure your lines are even and rhyme.

Honestly, I'm trying to shy away from that because I don't want to be mean... But this needs a complete rework with rhyme scheme and delivery. It's elementary. White boy rhymes. Switch up ya flow.

Not just reading but rapping. It's basically like working out. When a body builder is trying to grow and bulk up, he doesn't just stand there and stare at the weights, he lifts them. 
You gotta work not just your mental muscle but your mouth, throat and lungs and train them to work how you want them to. 

When I write a verse, I'll go drive around for an hour and rap it out loud trying to see what works and what doesn't. To answer your question though, going over your material is just one way to improve your writing. 

Reflection is one of the greatest tools we have for improving.

If you enjoy rapping then keep writing. If I quit every time somebody told me my shit was wack i'd still suck at spitting. The more time you put into the art the more natural it will become to do all those things. The majority of these things (Flow Cadence Rhyme Schemes Compelling Content Vocal Inflections) come with time. Right now you need to focus on actually rhyming when you rap. 

If you start out a line, ""Sometime's when i'm at school i feel like cutting class"" Then with your next line, the last word needs to rhyme with class. So you could say ""But my mind is screaming no my dad will whoop my ass""
Work on having an ending rhyme every two bars at least.

Then once you have a verse written, 8, 12, 16 bars, go over that shit like a vagillion times. Yeah I said it. A VAGILLION. Then once you feel like erasing every word you wrote from your memory and never spitting another verse, that's when you will start to get better. 
But don't quit rapping because some dude on the internet told you you're bad. Especially if he is a self proclaimed ""Dope Ass Nigga"".

Most of it in my first post. If that was you rapping you really, really need to learn the basics. The mechanics of rapping:

Flow Cadence Rhyme Schemes Compelling Content Vocal Inflections

I don't think you had any of these working for you. 

The key to flowing. Rule #1 you have to feel it with or without the track. Since real free-styling is off the top and sporadic, saying the first thing that comes to mind takes skills (wordplay) as your know. Rule #2 Don't concentrate or focus too hard or it'll sound like you're trying too hard. Listen to the track, find that unique rhythm and let it rip. Flowing is just another instrument on top of the drums and bass-line nothing more. By flowing to different tracks it'll improve your range because you can't be limited to one flow pattern/style (i.e. you can't rhyme the same to a Twister track like you would to a Lil Wayne). Keep trying its good exercise if you want to perfect your craft. 

Get dozens of instrumentals (slow, medium and fast) and snap day in and day out. You'll find the speed/tempo that fits you the best by doing this exercise. That's a must to take it to the heavy weights. You must have that,""I'm a rip this beat apart"" mentality to master rhyming on instrumentals. Close your eyes feel the beat and start spitting.
	
as i tell people all the time just experiment, don't be scared, play an instrumental and just go with it, you don't even have to make sense of what you say just try spitting fast then slow try different accents, lower and higher the pitch in your voice but i won't get into it extremely don't have a whole lot of time on my hands got some rhymes to work on myself so check out this article i found for one of my friends the last time i was busy lmao it really helped him and it will elaborate on what i have said above!

Reply: What's up and thanks for getting in touch. Condfidence is number one when it comes to improving delivery. It's amazing how far that little concept goes. My man J. River was shooting the video for a song of his today and you should see how he commanded attention out there on the street with cars going by and everything. He wasn't phased by it, wasn't shy at all. What I mean is he got out of his own head...and got out of his own way. He put on a show with confidence...like a professional. 

KNOW how good you are (even if you have doubts). Visualize who you want to be and then embody that image. I don't mean be fake by any means. But obviously if you want to stop ""sounding like a little girl"" you are going to need to change something. A successful and beneficial change begins with the confidence that you can make that change. 

My point is this. If you are going to use phrases like ""sweet rhymes"" (in the way I imagine you saying it) and then expect it to sound hard on the mic...it's not going to happen. That's because you've grown acustomed to behaving completely different than what you are envisioning in your head. In your head you're envisioning other rappers voices using your lyrics...at least to some degree, do you agree? A lot of people sound tight that way...but can't pull it together on a track. That's because you should first be confident in your own ability to perform. Rap is not like an open-mic night poem where the words carry most of the meaning...it's a performance and your flow is akin to an actors ability to act. The lyrics are like the script. Both are vital. In a sense you should master rhyming before you master writing rhymes. As long as you recognize the areas you need to improve upon, though, you're on a great start. 

Also, make sure when you rap, you rap loud, some people don't realize that and rap low into the mic. That is a tell tale sign of an amateur. 

Practice your favorite male and female MC's rhymes in your own voice. If there's something about your voice or flow you don't like (for example you sound like a child), change it up and do the complete opposite (right in the middle of your rhyme..don't stop) and if that is too much in the opposite direction, pull back and find a middle ground until you're happy. Practice perhaps changing the pitch of your voice up or down a notch just to see how it sounds, speed it up a little and add your own words in, slow it down and cut out some words, sing and then go back to rapping, play around with this for a while and don't be embarrased. The goal is to be comfortable flowing to a rhythm. Even if you're not saying anything that makes sense, take some intstrumentals with you on a car ride, find the beat, and just freestyle like, ""dadada doh, move back the bottles of Mo'/ blah dada blow, who's got the mind of a foe"" 

... it doesn't matter what you say, the idea is just to be comfortable with maneuvering your flow over an instrumental at the drop of a dime. This is not the time for you to worry about coming up with dope lines. You should be able to find the beat within a few seconds of hearing a record and then just use your words and flow as an intstrument over it. Anothing thing to notice when you're flowing is the emphasis' you use, if it's way off base or worse, you don't use any, then it's going to hamper your delivery and you'll sound more like you're talking rhymes and not rapping them. 

If you already have decent rhymes then you are ahead of many people who visit the site. However, delivery is just as tough (and more important in terms of handing in a final product) and lots of people don't see that. 
Another thing, if you sound like a little girl when you talk, then you're going to sound that way when you rap. Don't fake an accent necessarily but embrace different dialects if you have to...for some people it's easy to rap in different styles and still sound natural. (see Aries Spears impression of Snoop, DMX, etc. in our Videos Section) For others its nearly impossible. Usually, if this is hard for you, you might have to work on your rhythm. If you don't really FEEL a beat's rhythm and get in tune with it as the hungry artist that you should be...then you'll tend to resort to rhyming in the manner you talk...and in your case, you don't want that. 

It's cute that you admit to talking like a little girl, but there's no need for you to rhyme that way. Your flow has little to do with your voice for the most part so believe that you can sound like a girl and still flow sick. 
But finally, confidence is the biggest thing. People can feel it through the speakers. Trust that you have the ability to sound amazing on the mic and your delivery will improve immediately. Lastly, make sure you're having fun and never take it too seriously.

A lot of people using this subreddit seem to be producers trying to get started, if only just to get their tracks used by some local rappers. What if we gave them a push?

I was envisioning something like this (although all suggestions are welcome): once a week, we'd choose one producer dedicated enough to take on the project. He'd post a thread (highlighted in the sidebar) with a couple of his beats, and any rappers (or anyone considering rapping, or pretty much anyone really) on this subreddit could pick a beat and try rapping over it, submitting it to the thread. The producer could, depending on his level of interest/commitment:

a). Just pick the best freestyles over his beats and set them in order to make an EP

b). Get sent the vocal recordings by each rapper who participated and master them into a rough EP, maybe putting several rappers on each song/whatever his or her preference.

c). Listen to each of the rappers' flows, figure out which rapper he prefers with which beat, and PM them to collaborate on a track or two together.

Regardless of how seriously the producer wants to take it, by the week's end he'd have multiple samples of people rapping over his beats, and a demo tape of sorts to shop around to local rappers if they want to get serious. 

What do people think? I was thinking it might be a good way to help people get started/encourage more collaborations.",,False,,t5_2sqw4,False,,,True,t3_vwc5v,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/vwc5v/anyone_interested_in_weekly_producer_features/,

How it works: There are 5 judges. They must listen to every entry and reply to every entry that they believe should move on to the voting thread. If an entry gets 3 or more ""OKs"", it moves on to the voting thread.

Judges can choose to give feedback to entries they haven't chosen (I didn't make it mandatory because of time issues.)

Also, whoever produces the beat for the week has the choice to take the spot of a judge and choose which entries should move on. 

IMPORTANT CHANGE: SUBMISSION OF ENTRIES ENDS SATURDAY, 9 PM EST 

Schedule:

Tuesday 10 AM - 4PM - New cypher thread is posted

Tuesday - Saturday 9 PM  -- Post your entries

Next 24 hrs are detected to the judges choosing entries

Sunday 9 PM - Voting thread is posted

Voting ends Monday at 11 PM - Winner is declared, contact winner for next beat and theme, blah blah blah

Here are your judges: ReeG, SooWooMaster, LD5ifty, Manisphesto, and kailman 

Two other things:

1. judges can participate in the cypher, but they can't be voted on or win

2. judges must give 15 OKs, but they have a limit of 25

He releases the track and it sucks, no flow, no good lyrics, nothing is good about it. So 2 weeks down the road I get an email, the email is the guy telling me about the track, it turns out it got over 12000 views and 212 likes in one night. I was skeptical so i looked at these likes and it was all bot accounts, no real ones besides for a couple. I asked him about it and he told me about his ""cuz"" who can market real well. The guy keeps asking me to use my beats and i tell him no and he does it anyways, I just got an email saying the track with my beat on it is complete and that hes going to send it to me soon. With not even asking. And its not like its going to be for free or anything, he is actually going to be selling it.

Lets take this moment to go over the rules AGAIN, and clear up any questions/confusion you my have.

* **MUST BE SELF POST** Edit: As in submitting as a TEXT post, NOT a LINK.

* That means **DON'T** just ask for beats/rappers. State specifically what you're looking for to include style, concepts, etc. 

* **YOU MUST INCLUDE LINKS TO YOUR WORK.** If you don't have anything recorded yet to show off, THEN GO RECORD something to show off. If you think your shit is so hot someone is going to steal that shit, THEN DON'T POST COLLAB CALLS.

I'd rather let the subreddit manage itself but there has been a rash of people breaking every rule and that has been bringing down the quality that this subreddit is known and strives for.

1). **Voting on Submissions:** I don't want to get rid of the downvote button on links, because it's a useful tool to pick out trolls and the like, but bear in mind that if someone submitted something, they probably put effort into it. If you don't like something, fair enough, but on the whole, don't downvote. There aren't enough readers for it to matter, anyway (what's the most upvotes a link will get? Maybe 10?), and I don't want to discourage people from submitting.

So if you dig something, upvote it to let the creator know, and if you don't think it's very good, then don't. But I don't really see the point in downvoting unless someone is clearly trolling.

2). **Criticism:** Let me make one thing clear: the entire reason this subreddit was created is to encourage people to create their own music, and so they can have somewhere to post it where they know people won't shit on them just because they don't like it.

Constructive criticism is definitely encouraged, but the one thing that really won't be tolerated here is comments like, ""Wow, this kinda sucks,"" or ""Sorry dude, don't quit your day job."" These comments are utterly useless and have no reason to exist - this isn't r/whydoesmymusicsuck. If I do see someone leaving a comment along these lines, I'll warn you. Then, I'll ban you. **This is the only bannable offense in this subreddit.** If you're being a douche and adding nothing to the community with your comments, then, sorry, but you're gone.

Hopefully I won't have to do this, because I don't want to ban anybody, but this subreddit is to help support people who are creating music. If you don't like it, then most of the other hip-hop subreddits are more than happy to let you critique to your heart's content.

2a). **What Makes Criticism Constructive.** Obviously I'm not going to ban anyone for being tactless, but this is an example of a bad comment.

""I really like the beat on this song, but your rapping...not so much. You might want to stick to producing.""

*Good constructive criticism*: ""I think your lyrics are a little one-note, you might want to branch out and talk about subjects other than fellatio. Also, you may want to practice hitting the syllable harder, which might make your flow a little harder-hitting.""

Don't forget, just because part of your comment is complimentary doesn't mean you're exempt from the ""comments need to add something"" rule. No offense to anyone, and I'm sure you all have impeccable taste, but this isn't really about your opinions on the music. It's about helping people improve, so try to only comment with helpful things.

 That's all, and keep posting, people!

**TL;DR:** This subreddit was created to encourage people to start creating music, or to help improve people by offering suggestions. Try to keep then in mind when voting/commenting/etc.",,False,,t5_2sqw4,True,,,True,t3_jnknh,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/jnknh/feedback_in_rmakinghiphop/,moderator

This isn't taking away from the weekly cypher. People might not be interested in this, I don't really care. If they are, thats cool. 

If you feel the need to post here about how this is unnecessary. Good for you. I don't care.

So here are the rules.   

- Spit 16 bars. That is the minimum. A few bars over is no big deal. If you spit 32 bars, your submission won't be voted on.

- **Private Message** me a **download** link to your submission. You can link a soundcloud as long as it's downloadable. Let me elaborate on this for the retarded subscribers. Don't publicly link your soundcloud in the comments. Click on my username and send me a direct message

-  Submission has to be mp3. Don't link me to a 50mb .wav file. If you can't save and upload your submission as an mp3, then you're too dumb to enter. 

How it will work.  

- People will PM me their submissions. It's Thursday at 8pm. Deadline is Sunday at 8pm EST. If you PM your submission at 8:01EST, it won't be counted. 

- Voting will go from Sunday night (after Breaking Bad) and will end Wednesday night at 8pm EST.  

- All the submissions in the voting thread will be nameless. I'll make an account on Soundcloud and upload all the submissions. There will be no order to how I upload them. You might be the last to PM me and the first to be uploaded. 

- If Soundcloud is giving any problems. I'll upload the submissions to a different site.

- Submissions will be named Submission #1, Submission #2, etc etc.

- I can't force everyone to listen to every submission, so I'm not going to try. I hope people don't scream and complain about it

- If you submit but don't vote. You're not disqualified, you're just an asshole.

Most recent song I could think of was Jay Z and Rick Ross https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6boMS4KtnNE 

Would also like some advice on the timing. Sounds like it's quarter notes then it ramps up in speed(sorry i'm not sure of the musical term to use). if I didn't know any better it's almost like an automation that speeds up the hat timing in a ramped fashion. It's not just quarter then 8th, it's almost like it is ramped up from slower to faster so you hear the inbetweens and it's a cool effect(sounds like it is smoothly speeding up from quarter to 16th or 8th whatever). 

Basically, my question is how is this done? I have some theories but I bet you guys have some experience doing this and my attempts to recreate it have been falling flat.

* We compose a list of all Redditors who are participating
* One person starts with a verse to a beat (which we will select later)
* That person records and uploads their verse
* At the end, they have to call out another Redditor from the list.
* The called out Redditor will have one week to create theirs. If they don't put it up within the week, we move on to somebody else.
* Repeat that shit

Here's how you sign up:

* Either PM me or just leave a comment in the post, or email me at sheehan35@hotmail.com (put ""Reddit Cypher"" as the subject)

1. You must be subscribed and participate in the sub either thru the Daily Feedback Threads, Flip This Challenges, Cyphers, or comment thru-out the sub. If you don't have enough activity, you'll have to wait until VOL 2 to submit. So GET ACTIVE.

1. You've got to not have shit quality. Seriously. Condenser mics or extremely well mixed dynamic mics. 

2. Bring your A+++ game. None of that did this in five minutes or for practice shit. 

3. No jacked beats aka original beats. Sample based beats are ok. Not a beat used by a famous/kinda famous/sorta famous/used to be famous artist. 

4. Beats submitted must be at max under 2 min consisting of change ups and transitions and what not, or 24 bars from start to finish. Beats will be used as interludes. Spots are limited. **THIS ONLY APPLIES TO INSTRUMENTALS SUBMITTED, NOT FINISHED SONGS**

5. You may only submit ONE song. If you submit a song, and another artist submits a song with you as a featured artist, thats fine. 

6. I'll PM you if your track is chosen. SO DONT PM ME.

-----

Ok, those are the rules, now here are things to keep in mind.

* ANY style is accepted to include, but limited to: boom bap, trap, 90's thug dmx-esque tracks, pop, r&amp;b, etc. As long as its hip-hop-ish in nature, it will be considered.

* DON'T GET BUTTHURT IF YOU DON'T GET PICKED. I'm going to be curating this project myself, listening to EVERY song submitted. I'm choosing songs based on quality and talent. 

* If you have a dope track but shitty quality/mix, I'll try to arrange for that track to be mixed fo' free by either myself or another member of r/MHH. 

* If your track gets chosen i'm going to need a WAV or FLAC of that track for my sudo mastering.

1372601253.0,21,self.makinghiphop,1hd51h,[Free Ableton Preset] Here's my Ableton DrumRack sampling preset for you guys.,24,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1hd51h/free_ableton_preset_heres_my_ableton_drumrack/,"Hey guys, thought I'd share [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qo29r2die1nmfs3/%5BDrumRack%20Samples%5D%20-%20Choked.adg) with you. It's my default Ableton 9 DrumRack slicing preset, and it will (hopefully) really speed up your workflow if you use it. Don't know how many of you use Ableton and have the Suite for DrumRack, but I thought I'd post it anyway. Here's how I use it:

* First, install it by dragging the file into the Ableton browser location ""User Library &gt; Defaults &gt; Slicing"". It should take no time.

* Import an audio file into Ableton that you intend to sample. While we're at it, why don't we look at this week's FTC sample, ""[It Never Entered My Mind"" by The Singers Unlimited &amp; Oscar Peterson](http://www.mediafire.com/download/l2ao62f0gkiicao/The_Singers_Unlimited_%26_Oscar_Peterson_-_It_Never_Entered_My_Mind.aiff).

* How you choose to ""chop"" it up is your call. I always warp the file and then go transient mark to transient mark and create warp markers where I want to chop it. To listen to each slice I find it's easiest to set Global Quantization to None (command + 0) so that I can play (when the little speaker icon shows up in the Clip View) from each transient mark and hear how the sample will start. So I add a bunch of warp markers where I want to chop it, and I'm good.

* This is where the preset comes in: when you're done chopping, right-click in the Clip View and select ""Slice to New MIDI Track."" When the dialog box comes up, select the preset you just installed - it should be called ""[DrumRack Samples] - Choked"" and is probably first on the list of presets. Make sure that you're slicing per warp marker as well.

* This will map all the individual slices to Simpler chains in a new DrumRack track. They're all set to the same choke group and have a release of 60s, meaning that all you have to do to trigger is press a key/pad/what have you, and it will be muted when another key (another sample) is triggered.

So that's just the basics. I also included mappings to the macro controls, and I'll explain them briefly:

* 1: Velocity controls how much the MIDI velocity of triggered notes affects the volume of each sample. Choose 0% if you don't want velocity to affect the volume, i.e. every sample will play at the same volume regardless of how hard each key/pad is struck. 100% will create a massive difference in volume from low velocities to high velocities.

* 2 &amp; 3: Attack and Release settings control the onset and decay of each sample. These should be left as is for the most intuitive, simple sound. Longer attack times create noticeable fade-ins each time a sample is triggered, and lowering the release will make each sample decay (fade out), after the key or pad is released, for the set amount of time. The default long release ensures that each sample will play until the next is triggered.

* 4 &amp; 8: Transpose and Detune control the pitch of each sample. Transpose is essentially a coarse measurement in semitones from -12 to +12. Detune is a fine control that is measured in cents (100th's of a semitone) and can be controlled from -50c to +50c. Note that pitch is directly correlated to time in this preset, so raising the pitch of a sample will also speed it up. This can be useful for slower songs you want to sample at a higher speed, plus we all love the cool sound of a classic soul song pitched up. Or at least Kanye does.

* 5 &amp; 6: Filter Freq and Filter On control the individual filters for all samples. Honestly, they're not that necessary since they control everything at once - if you want to filter your samples, you're better off putting a filter plugin (such as Auto Filter) across the whole track (uses far less CPU and has more flexibility/parameters and a better UI). I use this if I only want a few samples to be filtered, and then I unmap every other sample from this macro. Then I have control over the filter parameters for those few samples. *Note:* Filter On is a weird control: values 0-63 are Off, 64-127 are On. Just a function of how MIDI works.

* 7: Spread somewhat controls the stereo width of a sample. By default it's set to zero, meaning no additional processing is used. When engaged, Ableton creates subtle detuning between left+right which creates the idea of psychoacoustic separation and spreading between L+R. It can be useful, but it can really be overdone. Use this control VERY sparingly unless you know what you're doing - you can really ruin mono-compatibility through abuse of the Spread control.

So that's it guys. I understand this explanation may have been a bit more advanced for some of you, and if you want me to I can try to throw an imgur album online with some screenshots demonstrating what I'm doing. And I made the preset in Live 9, so let me know if it doesn't work in 8 (no idea about the compatibility) and I'll make one for 8 as well. Hope you guys can find some use for it!",,False,,t5_2sqw4,False,,,True,t3_1hd51h,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1hd51h/free_ableton_preset_heres_my_ableton_drumrack/,

What if every x weeks there was a sampling contest?

At the beginning of those two weeks we would select a sample. People would submit songs that they thing would make good samples and then the community would vote on the song that they like the best.
THEN all producer interested would make a beat incorporating that sample and submit at the end of the two week period and the community will vote on the beat that they think is the best or makes the best use of the sample.

I want to redo the vocals to this considering I was using a 100 dollar mic, a 20 dollar interface , no preamp. and a OLD laptop....Also I have no expierence in Mixing/Mastering so if you wanna team up that'd be cool. 

Honestly I just want to hear everything done with someone who knows what they are doing with equipment they know exactly how to use....

Do you have any ideas for the subreddit?

Is anyone graphically talented? I think having our own banner at the top would be a good start at drawing in more users.

The sidebar needs an update as well, and I'd like to get a few people's help fleshing that out with information. Beginner guides, subreddit rules, posting help, and any ongoing subreddit work.

Any CSS freaks here?

Can't vote for yourself. 

feel free to upvote and downvote the comments to keep track of which ones are contenders for you. up/downvotes will not affect the outcome. 

Voting ends (roughly) midnight (PST), Friday night. 

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE ENTRY. THAT'S WHY VOTING LASTS TWO DAYS. most of us listen to at least some of the entries as they are posted, so it's not unreasonable, but I think everyone understands why this is important and fair. on a related note, this is a lot of entries. if next week is similarly bumrushed, we will try one of two things: bring back the concurrent and staggered flip challenge, which will definitely cut down on entries into each, or shorten the submission period to 4 days. if we do something like that, we may vote to decide, but will not over think this and consider a whole bunch of suggestions.

So lately i have found myself listening to a lot of music and I really want to make beats but I'm having trouble starting.

I'm using ableton and slowly I am learning the interface and I can get around pretty well but making actual music is difficult. For instance I can make okay drums and an okay melody(?) with a synth but they don't ever fit together. I don't really know anything about music and whenever I look for tutorials they seem to be about something really specific but without understanding basics I have trouble following them. 

Are there any particularly decent tutorials you know of that will help a beginner?

Is there any music theory I should learn?

Is there a good book I can read? (this is really the best way for me to learn)

I'm guessing that over time I will develop a feel for what sounds good after tons of trial and error but I need some help along the way.

You can check out the beats and get more info [here](http://tencent.bandcamp.com).

Essentially it's going to work like this:

You download the tape, rhyme over whatever you want, and send me the vocals (I ask for the vocals because many of these beats are not fully mixed and I will need to make changes before they're ready to be released). Then I'll put together a group of 10 or so of my favorite tracks and release it as a mixtape later this year.

For the benefit of everyone involved, there is going to be high quality control on this thing. So if you're just learning to rap, this isn't for you. I expect to throw out a lot of submissions, but regardless of what I use for my own project, these beats are open to use as you like as long as you send me a link, make sure to credit me, and offer them for free.

So we need to pick a theme. A few of us discussed Summer as a general theme, because we're planning on releasing this right when it's coming out, and that's a nice upbeat theme that should hopefully keep the writing positive. Think of of your best memories when you're writing, and try to paint your favourite moment when you're beat making.

That's not set in stone though, so if someone has a better theme, comment here and we'll discuss it.

As for the logistics. Below I've posted a table of Rappers, Beatmakers, and Producers.

I need rappers and beatmakers to speak to each other, and come up with collaborations that both parties are interested in. If both a rapper and a beatmaker agree to work together, both of you send me a PM and I'll update the table to note the collaboration. You can start working immediately if you want, the time frame is roughly a month. I'll make another post with the hard deadline when all the pairings are worked out.

If a beatmaker wants to make a posse cut, feel free to contact more than one rapper. Everyone is free to collaborate with anyone else as many times as they want, so if a Beatmaker wants to make both a posse cut and a one on one track, that's cool with me.

I'd like to shoot for a maximum of about 15 songs, just to keep it tight. I'd like people to bump this more than once. If we have too many songs, we'll either vote as a community on which songs to keep, or we can vote on keeping them all.

As for Producers. I'll need your help doing some base level mixing on some of these tracks. I'd like to mix the whole thing myself, I think I can make it sound pretty phenomenal. I've just started my own studio, and I've already mixed some tracks for some redditors and I believe they're happy with the work. If someone has an objection, please raise it here.

I can finally deliver something that I hope everyone can enjoy on some level. I've had a shitty day so I decided to not wait and just get it out there.  
I remember sitting down and making each of these tracks. I've really poured my heart and soul into this project. They all took time and none of them are rushed out, every track has days of work behind them from the first cut, added instruments to the mixing. So if possible download it in FLAC so you get the highest quality with all the little extra spice that's in the mix.  
The lead track is what inspired me and gave me confidence that I could mix my sampling and instrumentation together into a ambient mess of sounds.

There's just something about cats like Hiroshi Fukumura and Jiro Inagaki that inspires me to make nasty cuts.  That and obnoxious 80s synth-disaster pop songs.

This is not a bashing, I'm here to help you sound more professional.

One really important thing with recording vocals is compression, i´m not going to explain how compression works but i´m going to give you some pointers.

Google where you can find the compressor in your DAW.

Now there are 4 parameters that you can change on the compressor:

Threshold: At what dB do you want the compressor to kick in.
-This will depend on the source.

Attack: How fast the compression will kick in after reaching the threshold.
-Faster settings for a more noticeable compression, slower setting for a more transparent sound. a good start on vocals is around 3ms-8ms.

Release: How fast the compressor will let go once below the threshold.
- Most compressors will have a ""AUTO"" mode, this often works really well.

Ratio:
-Higher setting for a more noticeable compression, lower setting for a more transparent sound. For rap vocals you should be around 4:1 - 8:1 (often closer to 4:1 rather then 8:1).

The mic is your weapon of choice, and the new USB-mic´s that are out there are really awesome for the price. You don't even need a expensive sound card. And remember, record in a bigger room with lots of furniture rather then a sterile closet.

Remember that this isn´t rules, these are just pointers..


Much love.

""We really just need to find a better way to separate the ""hey look at this dope beat I made"" and the ""Hey look at this dope beat I made, now tell me why it sucks and what I could do to improve it.""
This is just an idea, but what if every week we had a MHH mixtape released. 20 songs. Instrumentals, finished songs, whatever. All of the people posting their songs who aren't really looking for feedback would still get to share their music and it would kind of clean up the front page. At the end of the week we would post it in one post and people could download it and listen to a whole weeks worth of beats.
I would be willing to receive tracks and compile the mixtape if nobody else wants to.""

When I read **produced by _______** I assume that the person listed as producer did the mixdown at a minimum.  When I read **featuring ______** or **collaboration with ______** I assume that the person listed as a feature or collaborator is at least aware of the existence of the track and generally I assume they would have input on the end product.  I know for a fact that many of the tracks posted here do not follow this sort of logic since pretty much anyone using one of my beats puts me down as producer and it seems like if someone posts an acapella they can expect to be listed as **featuring**.  Now personally I don't care much about how I am credited if at all, but I think given the amateur nature of most of the submissions here we should all think about how to title tracks so that people don't get the wrong idea.  I know some people might not be happy listed as a producer on a track that sounds like it was recorded on a cell phone and played back through a clock radio.  Here are some guidelines I would follow:

* **Vocals By ___**: You used some vocals someone posted for free to use but the vocalist had no input on the track.

* **Beat By ___**: You used a free to download beat but did your own mixdown with no input from the beat creator.

* **Produced by ___**: You worked with the dude who made the beat to create the finished track. Who did the mixdown isn't a big deal, it's more that he had input on the end product.  Producer credits are a strange beast, you might have a beat by one guy but production by another guy for instance.  Best bet is just talk to the dude and ask how he wants it credited.

* **Featuring ___**: A vocalist sent you vocals to mix in specifically for your song.  He is aware that your song exists and at least hears the end product and says he's cool with it.  

This is how I would prefer to be credited personally (although like I said it's not a huge deal for me) and I just wanted to see what you guys think about this.

original:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYNsGhe-vFg

""touched"" version:  https://soundcloud.com/badtouch/lifetime-novox-1

so first of all, this technique does not work all the time, and probably doesn't even work most of the time. for it to work, the vocals have to be placed dead center of the mix, and there has to be other elements that are pushed left or right, if not hardpanned completely to one side.  the guaranteed downside is that the result with be mono, and any element that you might want to keep that is also dead center will be removed.

so here's what this is:  drag the original track into a DAW or editor and break it into separate left and right mono channels. take either side and invert the waveform. place both the left and right channels in the center of the soundfield, and that's it!  anything that was placed center (equal amounts of signal sent to the left and right sides) is now completely gone. there will probably be some residual reverb, since it is generally not an entirely symmetrical effect, but the bulk of the vocals (and most likely bass, kick, and snare) will be eliminated.

i made the technique demo downloadable, in case anyone wants to use it for the [challenge], but i would recommend trying this out for yourself.

So we've had a lot of interest in another collaborative mixtape. I'm going to start taking names now. We're looking for both beatmakers and rappers.

Mixtape Sign Up Process

1. Post a link to your material, and if you're looking to rap, produce or both.
2. Go through other people's material, and find someone you want to work with.
3. Contact them through either reddit, or through the links they've provided.
4. Notify us of your collaboration by posting the details here.

I'll keep a table in this area listing all the people looking to take part. I'll also maintain a second table of collaborations.

Let's try to do this in a month. So we'll set a date for July 6th. I'll update everyone a few times over the month so people can report on their progress.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, JUST ASK.

So this week the game is ""hig pig"" (if this goes well I plan on picking 4 or 5 games so that they could be cycled throughout the month) 

How it works: It’s a word game that asks you to solve a riddle. The answers are two rhyming one-syllable words.

Simply announce your hig pig clues to the other players as quickly as you can make them up. When someone guesses an answer, they shout it out. For example: “What is a hig pig for an overweight feline? Answer: a fat cat.”

Since we aren't playing this in person, the first person to respond with the answer also gets to post their riddle for the next one. Your answer may or may not be the right one to the riddle (the person will tell us when the guesser got it right) but if your answer fits, you are welcome to post another riddle/clue (this may create many branches of comments/word play but that is the point!)

Since this is the first round I will begin;
What is the hig pig for sugary candies?

[Monday Mixtape Vol. 1](http://www.mediafire.com/?ktvtl09kd9dl6)

Pretty happy with the turnout. We got some dope stuff on here. Almost everybody who sent a track in wanted me to review their music. I'm not really interested in writing out full reviews for every song that gets sent in, so i came up with 3 awards that will be handed out each week.

Most Professional Sound - This is awarded to whoever I feel sends in the most professional sounding content.
Most Replays  - Given to whoever gets the most plays in my iTunes for the current week.
Most Room For Improvement - This is given to whoever has the most work to do to get where they should be.

*DISCLAIMER* These are my personal opinions and in no way should you take them to heart. This is merely a scapegoat i'm using to avoid having to write long reviews.

SO. 

Awards for this week go to:

**Most Professional Sound**: P64

**Most Replays**: Babaji

**Most Room For Improvement**: Cupid's Thug


Let me know If this is something you guys want to keep doing. I have the time and I don't mind managing everything. As long as people send me stuff every week I will keep posting these. Let me know if there's anything I can do to improve the format, upload site, etc...

Finally,

Please keep all Mixtape discussion in this post. If you're feeling frisky and want to rap over somebody's instrumental, just post a link in this thread. That way everything stays organized.

I know I'm still new around here, so I probably wouldn't be a part of it, but, just for the fun of it, everybody just got together to do a major collab album or mixtape. Maybe drop something like once a year or just a one time thing, whatever. Like I said, I'm still new in this community, and to reddit, so maybe this has already been done or discussed. But, the thought just entered my head. One of the mods or established could setup a soundcloud or youtube specifically for MHH stuff, maybe? I don't know, just tossing it out there. Thoughts, ideas, suggestions, hate filled rants at the notion?   
     
Edit: This idea just hit me, just use winners from the collab challenges or cyphers and turn it into a mixtape, or something.    
     
Edit: This seems like a good starting point for a guideline [ButUmmLikeYeah comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1ii6qd/discussquestion_this_may_have_been_brought_up/cb4r9am) and a good idea from a [rrr159 comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1ii6qd/discussquestion_this_may_have_been_brought_up/cb4rdzy) Does anybody think there may be a way to improve on this in some way or set it up properly?    
      
Edit: Should we start a subreddit like the making of making hip hop that would be used specifically for doing projects like this, so that we wouldn't inundate this subreddit with the project or piss of the mods somehow?

Recently I have been working on a trap mix that was about an hour long, and planned on posting it and promoting it all day. Obviously that has not been the case.

I finished the final touches of the mix on Thursday, in which I saved my file, exported the mp3, and went to sleep. The next day I woke up wanting to sync the mix to my phone so I could listen to it at school all day just to get me more hype about posting it Saturday.

Once I tried turning on my computer, it froze. My computer has not turned on since, and all of my packs, samplings, music, everything is now stuck in cyberhell.

Then i realized that the only copy of my mix was on there as well. Fucking bummer. 

Cried a little, shouted a little, cried a little more, than just kinda sat here for awhile until I figured I should learn from my mistake, and try and help all you guys out as well.

Buying a backup storage drive is a more important than you may think! Seriously, there is nothing more infuriating than getting all of this awesome work done, just to have it screwed over and lost.

We spent a good hour thinking of all the different ways to make an effective bassline. We came up with tons of methods such as:


1. ""The Low End Theory"" (named after the album by A Tribe Called Quest) where you take the sample, duplicate it, put it through a low-pass, and drop it on top of the original sample. Basically this just amplifies the original bassline of the sample. You can tweak the pitch an octave for a sub bass, too.


2. Overlaying a few sine waves (as many as you want really) and dropping the octaves to various levels until you find that nice rumble in the sub while preserving the punchiness in the speakers. Run the waveform through a compressor/fuzz to add a little warmth and crunch to it. This could take a while to get the perfect sound, but once you have it - you know you have it.


3. Use a VSTi or built in virtual instrument on your DAW. Logic's Basement Bass is a notable one. Same with FL Studio's 3xOsc, Subtractor in Reason, and various other available virtual instruments. Some tweaking of VSTi's can give you some really far out bass sounds. Effects and filters can also be applied to add to the sound.


4. Record an actual analogue instrument such as a bass guitar (duh), a moog synthesizer, or even the lower keys on a piano. Various filters and effects (reverb, chorus, etc.) can be added to these to add spirit and authenticity to it.


I know there's tons of other methods for getting a really raw bass sound.


So r/makinghiphop, what is YOUR method?",,False,,t5_2sqw4,False,,,True,t3_qfaku,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/qfaku/how_do_you_make_a_bassline/,

Do you need to hear the beat your gonna rap over or do you write first then go over the beat?

I personally used to write then revise nonstop because either my lines were too corny or my syllables/flow was off. Now I'm getting the concept in my head, and when I write, I recite a line before I write it, so I get it right the first time.

Hey sorry about the late post today. I'm sick as fuck right now and my mind's working half speed. 

Really good stuff this week though. ""Tell Me"" and ""Oh ah"" have been in heavy rotation.  

Any feedback from you guys? Should we keep doing this? Any complaints? Just let me know!


EDIT:

I forgot to give a huge shout out to Sinyes for the ultra dope artwork! If anybody else wants to submit artwork feel free to send it in. As long as it fits the dimensions I'll use it.

I know there are some new people joining in on the mixtapes so let me reiterate some things:

You can submit a track every week. We've had some really dedicated artist who have been on almost every tape so far, such as Atheist and DemiGod(actually on every tape). 

Send all submissions to indywrecks@gmail.com with the artist name and the track title IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. This will make it way easier for me to stay organized, and when someone forgets to send in an artist name, I won't be using their real name accidentally. This is probably the most important point I'd like to get across.

Finally, to all the people who have sent in their tracks and said ""thank you"" or ""Keep up the good work man"" or ""Hey let me know what you think of my track dude"", I just want to let you know I read all of it. I don't have time to reply to everybody's emails, so don't think I'm just ignoring you specifically. I don't reply to anybody. Unless of course it pertains to an issue with their track. But I do read every email and listen to every track sent in. 

Alright, I'm gonna go try and kill this flu with some jack daniels and sriracha's. Wish me luck and I'll see you guys next monday!

They all seem to share a characteristic sound. I've got a decent ear for only analyzing beats for a short while, but discussion with you guys always boosts my hiphop production knowledge.

In the example below, ""lookin 4 tha suckin"" I hear a strum or arpeggio pitched down a little, some 808s, and that squeaking at first then around :40 is where the drums come in. Does it sound like all of the drums have a low pass or low bandpass? or are they slightly pitched down? maybe both? This EQ drone or less emphasis seems to be characteristic of their sound...



[lookin 4 tha suckin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kKrSrUhbvc)


and just for fun, here's one of my favorite beats at the moment


[throw them gunz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99r8JSdI7s)


What about this Raider Klan Phonk song. Just seems like a high pitch synth, strong 808 line, hard hitting kicks, weaker snares, and tamb's with a flanger? The tambs sound high pitch but theyre not so loud, is that compression or eq, probably both, but I like having these discussions on here as people usually drop some knowledge that I hadn't thought about.

I don't think this is considered a collab call, but if I'm wrong I'm sorry I'll remove this.

I want to make a beat with a guitar riff I heard in the Tenacious D movie. It's not an actual song, I think it's a modified version of a part from an Emerson Lake and Palmer song actually. I can't play guitar and the people I know who do can't record.

So I was wondering if anyone could maybe record this riff for me so I could work it into a beat I want to make? I would greatly appreciate it and would definitely give whoever did it credit on the song.

[Here's the riff](http://youtu.be/EiYRZp_BZKM?t=45s), the part is from :45 to :58 in the video.

Alright so I've been making beats for a few years, but my problem is finishing a project... I'll start with something that sounds great and has potential, but then I'll get stuck at some point. I usually give myself time to ""forget"" what I've done by starting a new project, but when I come back to what I've done, I'll still be stuck in the same place... Eventually I'll give up and start something new,  and end up repeating the cycle.

I've been told that I should just loop what I have, but I feel that's way too simple and easy... I've also been told that I should just keep going at it via experimenting, but the outcome tends to be worse than what I had originally.

So... How do you usually combat writer's block, and how often do you end up with something that just sits on the shelf?

Only write as much as you spit. Everything you write must be spit and flowed to a beat halfway decently. You can then fine tune the song from there if things are off, etc. Use your ears, listen.

2. Don't be another generic rapper. There are thousands of people rapping out there, if not millions. Inject some truth into every song about your life, your personality, your mood at the time and make the song UNIQUE. Which leads into...

3. Don't be complaining all the time. This is the other side of the coin. Rapping too much about yourself ruins a song I think and I cannot listen to an MC dish out a life story unless its someone extremely talented with some grade A production. Anything goes here (clubs, drugs, money, dissing, wordplay, metaphor, etc.)

4. Don't try to sound like any mainstream rapper. Those people are just like you... individuals with their own sound, voice, experiences, etc. They had to fight their way into the game like anyone else and anyone who becomes a famous MC deserves the fuck out of it, don't try to ""top"" them or it will sound bad....this is another thing that takes time. A style of rapping that people know you for is something honed through repetition, which leads to

5. Play to your strengths as an MC. If something comes easy to you, do it. The way a human brain works is basically the more you use a faculty, the better you are at accessing those areas of the mind. For example, someone who is interested in building and racing remote control cars when they are a teenager could grow up to be a mechanic, or a machinist. Recognize your faculties and use them.


That's all, I felt I had to post this. Just some random thoughts about MCing and if anyone else has any more they'd like to share just post it below,

I just bought a huge(!) drum sample pack and after i finished my purchase it said i was able to download this pack 7 times before the link expires. So i thought i will download it once for myself and share the link with you afterwards until the link expires lol.      

Right now i'm saving everything on my computer so i can reinstall windows later today and after that i'm going to download the files for myself first and posting the DL link here afterwards.  

Is there any interest in a sample pack like this? Also this might violate ToS/copyright, so if the mods don't want this to happen here pls tell me. Cheers!

* I'm gonna put a cap of 20 beats/songs for each week.
* First 20 people to email me their tracks will get their stuff on the mixtape.
* DO NOT send me tracks you don't feel like sharing or want other people to rap over. 
* ONE track per person per week.
* Send me an email to **indywrecks@gmail.com** with your track or a link to where i can download your track. In the email include your artist name and track name. Nothing else.
* I am going to post the mixtape every Monday around noon.

There is still some stuff to work out so we will see how it goes. If I get more than 20 tracks in a week then the people who don't get on the current week will possibly be carried over to the next week. If I get waaaay backed up with tracks I will have to figure something else out. 

Either way, I'm stoked to see what everybody has so send me your tracks NOW so i can post a tape this Monday the 3rd.

Alright, week two saw a pretty big drop off in the number of people participating in the weekly collaboration project, so I've decided to switch up the format.

I'd like to do a mixtape with everyone participating in the same spirit as the collaboration project but with a month time frame. I want to say straight up here, that anyone participating keeps full rights to their contribution, and that applies to now and the future. This is purely a community collaboration project, there's no money, sponsorship, or advertising involved. Just people getting together and making dope music.

So we need both beatmakers and rappers to sign up for this. If you have a beat already completed, that's perfect. Link it here, and I'll make a nice table keeping track of everything.

I'll going to make an arbitrary cap at 15 tracks. Any more than that and we'll lost interest with the listener. I'm willing to bend though, so nothing is set in stone.

As a rapper, snag any beat you see and spit over it and then get in touch with me for mixing.

If everyone is okay with this, I would like to mix the project myself. I have another post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/qzg3a/free_mixingmastering_starting_my_own_studio/) offering up mixing/mastering services for free, and I would like to extend that to this project. Everyone participating will get their contribution back in a nicely mixed .mp3 file that you can use for your own promotion. Free of charge. This includes beatmakers.

If anyone has any questions. Just ask.

**SIGN UPS ARE NOW CLOSED. PM Me if you still want to participate, but chances are slim.**

**tl;dr Mixtape Project. Sign Up Below. Everyone Invited. Free Mixing/Mastering For All Tracks. To Be Released By the End of April**

Edit: Only two rappers contributed to the last Weekly Collabotion Project, and they were [InSpectre](http://soundcloud.com/inspectre/fly-verse) and [Jack Griffin](http://soundcloud.com/inthelionsden/fly-shit-prod-cloud-tiger). InSpectre had three votes for the win, although Jack Griffin's entry was fairly late in the game. Both were great contributions. Thanks guys!

I think it's a good beat, but we have to keep in mind the lyrical content of cyphers, along with the overall tone and mood. I don't think that it matches. Also, I'd rather use a beat from somebody who's not participating in the actual cypher.

However, I don't want to go all super dictator on this, so it'll ultimately be up to you guys.

Listening to the beats on my favorite albums obsessively and trying to pay attention to how they layer tracks -- bass, snare, high hat, filler, melody, etc. I downloaded Su-preme MPA for my phone to play with and quickly save beat ideas as I have them, since it was a hell of a lot cheaper than a drum machine.

Where I'm headed: My friend has an Axiom 49-key MIDI controller they're willing to long-term lend me while they travel, and I may be able to get my hands on a computer where I could play with Ableton Live. My current plan is just to keep working at it, and hopefully suck less over time.

What's been most helpful for y'all in getting started? I've been looking on YouTube -- most of what I've found for Garage Band at least is people copying the included (finished) loops, and I'm trying to focus on fundamentals and building beats from scratch before I get too far into using loops.

So we decided to come up with a new way of doing the Monday Mixtape. Our comrade jbrizzly is currently working on a website for the Mixtape and so far it is looking pretty rad.

How it will work is you guys will send me an mp3 of your track and we will post them on the new website's frontpage. You guys will be able to vote on the tracks posted right on the website, and the top songs will be released at the end of the month on the Monday Mixtape Bandcamp. 

I haven't decided how many tracks will be selected but i'm guessing around 15 depending on the number of entries. This format will bring some competition into the mix and hopefully make for a higher quality tape.

We're still ironing out the kinks, but I wanted to make a post and get some feedback from you all. Let me know what you think works and what doesn't. 

In the mean time, I'm still accepting tracks until we get the website up and running.

I'm a biter, and of course there is no real emulating the style of the 

Super Villain). But what does he do to produce beats that sound like 

that? I have heard his beats described as having an ""unfinished sound"" 

in a way. I suppose that means that the samples he uses are minimally 

tampered with, of course accompanied by a lot of vocal samples to 

compliment the sample. I noticed that the drums in his beats don't 

seem to hit as hard as other beats, yet the beat still is awesome. For 

example, it seems that other instruments dominate most of the sound 

in the beat like in the song Orris Root Powder (posed below). Is this 

just a matter of preference to try and accentuation the drums in a 

sample you use? I would appreciate anyone who knows anything about 

his style of production to chime in. Thanks everyone.

[x-post from r/hiphopheads]",9,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/10r80z/mixoff_official_entry_thread_details_inside_xpost/,"This thread is to provide information on what the mixoff is, how it works, and how you can join.  

The simple explanation - everyone who wants to participate contributes three samples.  Out of the collected sample pool, users create songs.  At the end we vote on favorite songs.

Detailed explanation - 

**To participate you must first upload three samples.**

1) These must be instruments, synths, breaks, or beatboxing.  Or basically, anything except pure vocal samples.  *It is recommended, but not necessary* that everyone submits two instrument samples and one drum sample.

2) Samples can be a solo instrument, a combo of instruments, or whatever except for voice.  You can upload a precut loop, or upload a raw sample.

3) Samples can be any length, but try to keep them under one minute long.  

4) **Most importantly** - Also upload a txt file explaning where your samples came from.  This isn't necessary, but highly encouraged.  If you can't remember where the break is from, ah well.

5) **Also important** - name your samples as ""YourUserName - sample name"" for easy recognition of who has uploaded what.  WAV or lossless format is preferred, but again not necessary.

6) **You upload/download samples from here** - FTP info - host address dny.webformix.com.  Login information can be found [here](http://dny.webformix.com/)  If you have problem logging in, send me a message.  Find the ""hiphopheads MIXOFF"" folder in the main entry.  If you need an FTP program, I recommend CuteFTP for Windows, which you can download  [here](http://download.cnet.com/3055-2160_4-10000625.html?&amp;tag=pdl-redir_)

**Everyone then makes a song out of the collected sample pool.**

**DUE DATE FOR SAMPLES BEING UPLOADED IS THE END OF THURSDAY OCTOBER FOURTH.**  If your samples are uploaded on Friday the fifth (Pacific), you won't be considered for voting.

_______________________


**Make your song.** 

Your song can only use music/break samples from the collective sample pool.  

**Exception** You can use any voice samples you want; singing, acapella raps, your own rapping, scratching.

___________________

**Upload your final track**  

**Due Date: The end of Saturday, October 20**

You have a little over two weeks to make a track.

1) There is a folder already created for placing your tracks.  You can upload your track any time before the due date.

2) Please name your file, ""YourUserName - Song Name""

3) **Also**, include a txt file explaining which samples you used, including whatever voice samples  Also nice to include is what software/hardware you used.  

________

**Voting** 

Due date is October 27, one week after tracks are due.  Create a text file, and name your first, second, and third favorite tracks. First favorites get 5 points in voting, second gets 3, third gets 1.  Add the points up, that's the winner.  

_____________

If this is your first time making music, I recommend Sound Forge and Fruity Loops, which may or may not be able to be found on torrenting sites.  Sound Forge is good for cutting samples to make loops/etc, Fruity Loops is a fairly easy to use sequencer.

**Cypher**

We could call it like Reddit Cypher or something like that. Everybody who wants to participate would submit their reddit username and their rap nickname. One person would start with a verse to some instrumental, and call out a random person from the list of names. That person would have 5 days or so to put their verse up. If they don't, we move on to somebody else. In the end we could vote on the best, if we wanted.

**BATTLE**

We would create a bracket of people participating. One person starts, the other person has two or three days to put their response up. The first person has the same amount of time to do the same, then the second person can go again. And Reddit votes for the winner to advance.


Would you guys be interested in doing something like this?

Open to anybody!,10,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/nw2gc/planning_to_make_a_subredditwide_track_open_to/,"I'm thinking that, as a community, we should get a feel for how we interact with each other. I realize that we have the beatmaker-rapper dynamic worked out pretty well, but I think we should go further than that. So, I'm proposing an experiment. In the spirit of the [Slaughterhouse 20 Minute Freestyle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGr0-xZQEz4) I think we should have a running track on this subreddit. Anybody who wants to participate can download the track, append their verse to the track, and leave a 16 bar instrumental of their choosing for the next rapper to jump on.

Now, I'm pretty sleep deprived, and this might be a terrible idea. I'll check back tomorrow to see what y'all think. Gimme your thoughts, opinions, and suggestions so that I can buff up this idea.

EDIT: This doesn't need to be a freestyle. It can be whatever you want; a written verse, a chorus that's never (or maybe) repeated, or even a singing part.

EDIT 2: So, the rappers who have volunteered so far are:
Illuscio, MaskingTape, MasterRaps, DirtyDaisy, and d00mraptor. I'm thinking the instrumental should be [""Ante Up"" by M.O.P.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8U9xaE1E_I). It's a strong beat with high energy, and a great introduction beat. 

Rappers, record a 8-16 bar verse over said instrumental, and post the rap **AND** the acapella on your Soundcloud (the non-acapella track is for reference so we know how to fit your verse in to the full version). 

TheoScheepers or I will then consolidate them all into one track, and release it in a different post. Good luck!

Read his comments here. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/1kakup/cypher_vol_35_all_emcees_welcome_to_spit/cbo11jl

How do the rest of you feel about how last week went in general? What was good about it? what was bad? Did we as judges do our job well or are we being too selective and strict in our selections? Should the minimum number of entries we ""aye"" be increased?

The goal of this was to ensure people would actually take in the entire voting thread and vote fairly while encouraging everyone to work harder to make better entries. I don't want people to feel like they're being deprived of listeners or a fair chance at winning so if people feel like that's happening now, speak up.




**EDIT:** Thanks to all the detailed feedback so far. It really shows everyone cares about this shit and wants to see it get better. It seems like most people agree that while it's not perfect, we're heading in a positive direction. It doesn't sound like we need to make any huge changes to what we're doing right away, but I think some immediate basic changes we should start with next week are the following

1. Select at least 2-3 new judges if not all of them

2. Judges will hold off on making selections until after the Saturday deadline. 

3. We as judges will make more of an effort to let more non-selected entries know why they weren't selected, but please don't expect us to do this exclusively as it's already time consuming to fairly listen to everything and make selections. The entire community should share the responsibility of providing feedback to artists who don't make the cut.

Or, people saying it sucks but won't tell you why or how to improve.    
       
I'm trying to get myself back into it and learn and progress, now that I have the time for it. But, I would like to have some sort of teacher to guide me.  
     
I mainly just like making the beats and doing the audio engineering parts of it, but at some point I would like to try my hand at rapping and singing again, though it's not as important.

Black signifying the dark outlook on life, maybe even slightly depressed. White symbolizing a more positive outlook, or happier tracks. Then static being a conflict of the two which will result in a bit of craziness (also possibility for hype/banger tracks).

Does anyone have any tracks they would be willing to suggest for a project like this? All contributors would be obviously credited on the project and (if desired) shouted out on the song. 

We are just a group of friends who enjoy making music. This is something we are doing for fun, but none of us really make beats. So where better to look than this sub?

I have been preparing myself mentally .
I have the oldest computer out of anyone I know my friends call it the fossil. It was brand new when I went to college in 2005. It got me through everything. Every time shit got hard, fucking with beats was something that would take me away for a little while. Eventually I grew to love it and I feel a need to do it and a drive to be great at it. 
And now...when I'm going through one of he most trying times in my life, which prompts me to start immersing myself in hip hop more than ever...the thing finally died on me. Right in my arms. I've been posting from my phone lately because the fossil had been runnin so slow. It didn't even have enough ram free to use FL9.
So now I have no way of making beats until I have enough money to buy a new desktop. Oh and all of my beats were on there and not backed up on any other hard drive. Stupid I know but I couldn't afford a damn external. 

Anyways, I can still try and do the flip this challenges from my phone but the formatting will be weak. Also, I probably won't be doing any actual FTC submissions any time soon.

EDIT: **UPDATE:** I think it is just a problem with the video card. The computer will turn on, its just that my monitor wont turn on anymore. I Think everything is going to be fine with saving all of my files. However, I kind of loved the idea of a ""rebirth"" that some of you described. I think at this point I would be ok if it was all lost (Though I dont think it will be).

Nevertheless, I cant afford to fix the comp anytime soon, so Ill be contributing a lot less until further notice.

Thanks so much for all your guys' support and sympathizing. It kept things in perspective for me and helped me keep my head up.

Y'all are the best.

1356056428.0,9,self.makinghiphop,157c1g,[Discuss] Tips EQ'ing properly,9,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/157c1g/discuss_tips_eqing_properly/,"So I was going through the feedback thread and was looking for a guide I came across a while ago about properly EQ'ing different instruments to get the sounds that you want when I came across a post that [someone else made](http://www.crazypellas.net/producer-talk-107/a-guide-giving-you-frequencies-for-the-sound-you-want-when-eq-ing-53269/) and I just did some editing to make it more readable on Reddit.  Not exactly what I was looking for, but this is a very good guide to give everyone a place to jump off of for those curious about proper mixing and EQ'ing.


**General:**

&gt;20 Hz and below - impossible to detect, remove as it only adds unnecessary energy to the total sound, thereby most probably holding down the overall volume of the track

&gt;60 Hz and below - sub bass (feel only)

&gt;80(-100) Hz - feel AND hear bass

&gt;100-120 Hz - the “club sound system punch” resides here

&gt;200 Hz and below - bottom

&gt;250 Hz - notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum

&gt;150-400 Hz - boxiness

&gt;200 Hz-1.5 KHz - punch, fatness, impact

&gt;800 Hz-4 KHz - edge, clarity, harshness, defines timbre

&gt;4500 Hz - exteremly tiring to the ears, add a slight notch here

&gt;5-7 KHz - de-essing is done here

&gt;4-9 KHz - brightness, presence, definition, sibilance, high frequency distortion

&gt;6-15 KHz - air and presence

&gt;9-15 KHz - adding will give sparkle, shimmer, bring out details - cutting will smooth out harshness and darken the mix

**EQ Reference:**

&gt;*Frequencies*

&gt;50Hz

&gt;* Boost: To thicken up bass drums and sub-bass parts.
&gt;* Cut: Below this frequency on all vocal tracks. This should reduce the effect of any microphone ‘pops’.

&gt;70-100Hz

&gt;* Boost: For bass lines and bass drums.
&gt;* Cut: For vocals.

&gt; General:

&gt;Be wary of boosting the bass of too many tracks. Low frequency sounds are particularly vulnerable to phase cancellation between sounds of similar frequency. This can result in a net ‘cut of the bass frequencies.

&gt;200-400Hz

&gt;* Boost: To add warmth to vocals or to thicken a guitar sound.
&gt;* Cut: To bring more clarity to vocals or to thin cymbals and higher frequency percussion.
&gt;* Boost or Cut: to control the ‘woody’ sound of a snare.

&gt;400-800Hz

&gt;* Boost: To add warmth to toms.
&gt;* Boost or Cut: To control bass clarity, or to thicken or thin guitar sounds.

&gt;General: In can be worthwhile applying cut to some of the instruments in the mix to bring more clarity to the bass within the overall mix.

&gt;800Hz-1KHz
&gt;* Boost: To thicken vocal tracks. At 1 KHz apply boost to add a knock to a bass drum.

&gt;1-3KHz

&gt;* Boost: To make a piano more aggressive. Applying boost between 1KHz and 5KHz will also make guitars and basslines more cutting.
&gt;* Cut: Apply cut between 2 KHz and 3KHz to smooth a harsh sounding vocal part.

&gt;General: This frequency range is often used to make instruments stand out in a mix.

&gt;3-6KHz

&gt;* Boost: For a more ‘plucked’ sounding bass part. Apply boost at around 6KHz to add some definition to vocal parts and distorted guitars.
&gt;* Cut: Apply cut at about 3KHz to remove the hard edge of piercing vocals. Apply cut between 5KHZ and 6KHz to dull down some parts in a mix.

&gt;6-10KHz

&gt;* Boost: To sweeten vocals. The higher the frequency you boost the more ‘airy/breathy’ the result will be. Also boost to add definition to the sound of acoustic guitars or to add edge to synth sounds or strings or to enhance the sound of a variety of percussion sounds. 

&gt;For example boost this range to:
&gt;Bring out cymbals. Add ring to a snare. Add edge to a bass drum.

&gt;10-16KHz

&gt;* Boost: To make vocals more ‘airy’ or for crisp cymbals and percussion. 

&gt;* Also boost this frequency to add sparkle to pads, but only if the frequency is present in the original sound, otherwise you will just be adding hiss to the recording.

**Individual Instruments, what frequencies do what.**

**Kicks:**

&gt;* 60Hz with a Q of 1.4 — Add fullness to kicks.

&gt;* 5Khz with a Q of 2.8 — Adds attack to Kicks

&gt;* bottom (60 - 80 Hz),

&gt;* slap (4 kHz)

&gt;* EQ - Cut below 80Hz to remove rumble
&gt;* Boost between 80 -125 Hz for bass
&gt;* Boost between 3 - 5kHz to get the slap

&gt;* Processing - Compression 4:1/6:1 slow attack med release.

&gt;* Reverb:Tight room reverb (0.1-0.2ms)

**Snares:**

&gt;* 200Hz - 250Hz with a Q of 1.4 — Adds wood to snares

&gt;* 3Khz with a Q of 1.4 — Adds attack to snare.

&gt;* 7Khz with a Q of 2.8 — Adds Sharpness to snares and percussion

&gt;* fatness at 120-240Hz

&gt;* boing at 400Hz

&gt;* crispness at 5kHz

&gt;* snap at 10kHz

&gt;* fatness (240 Hz), crispness (5 kHz)

&gt;* EQ - Boost above 2kHz for that crisp edge
&gt;* Cut at 1kHz to get rid of the sharp peak
&gt;* Boost at 125Hz for a full snare sound
Cut at 80Hz to remove rumble

&gt;* Processing - Compression 4:1 slow attack med release.

&gt;* Reverb: Tight room reverb (0.1-0.2ms)

**Vocals**

&gt;* Fullness at 120 Hz, boominess at 200 - 240 Hz, presence at 5 kHz, sibilance at 7.5 - 10 kHz

&gt;* General: Roll off below 60Hz using a High Pass Filter. This range is unlikely to contain anything useful, so you may as well reduce the noise the track contributes to the mix.

&gt;* Treat Harsh Vocals: To soften vocals apply cut in a narrow bandwidth somewhere in the 2.5KHz to 4KHz range.

&gt;* Get An Open Sound: Apply a gentle boost above 6KHz using a shelving filter.

&gt;* Get Brightness, Not Harshness: Apply a gentle boost using a wide-band Bandpass Filter above 6KHz. Use the Sweep control to sweep the frequencies to get it right.

&gt;* Get Smoothness: Apply some cut in a narrow band in the 1KHz to 2KHz range.

&gt;* Bring Out The Bass: Apply some boost in a reasonably narrow band somewhere in the 200Hz to 600Hz range.

&gt;* Radio Vocal Effect: Apply some cut at the High Frequencies, lots of boost about 1.5KHz and lots of cut below 700Hz.

&gt;* Telephone Effect: Apply lots of compression pre EQ, and a little analogue distortion by turning up the input gain. Apply some cut at the High Frequencies, lots of boost about 1.5KHz and lots of cut below 700Hz.

**Hats:**

&gt;* 10Khz with a Q of 1.0 — Adds brightness to hats and cymbals

&gt;* Hi Hat &amp; Cymbals: sizzle (7.5 - 10 kHz), clank (200 Hz)

&gt;* EQ - Boost above 5kHz for sharp sparkle

&gt;* Cut at 1kHz to remove jangling

&gt;* Processing - Compression use high ratio for high energy feel
&gt;* Reverb: Looser than Bass n Snare allow the hats and especially the Rides to ring a little
&gt;* Get Definition: Roll off everything below 600Hz using a High Pass Filter.
&gt;* Get Sizzle: Apply boost at 10KHz using a Band Pass Filter. Adjust the bandwidth to get the sound right.
&gt;* Treat Clangy Hats: Apply some cut between 1KHz and 4KHz.
&gt;* Hi hats/cymbals - clank or gong sound at 200 Hz, shimmer at 7.5 kHz - 12 kHz

**Toms:**

&gt;* Toms - attack (5 kHz), fullness (120 - 240 Hz)

&gt;* rack toms - fullness at 240 Hz, attack at 5 kHz

&gt;* floor toms - fullness at 80 - 120 Hz, attack at 5 kHz

**Other Percussion:**

&gt;* conga/bongo - resonance at 200 - 240 Hz, slap at 5 kHz

**Guitar:**

&gt;* Treat Unclear Vocals: Apply some cut to the guitar between 1KHz and 5KHz to bring the vocals to the front of the mix.

&gt;General: Apply a little boost between 100Hz and 250Hz and again between 10KHz and 12KHz.

&gt;* fullness (240 Hz), bite (2.5 kHz), air / sizzle (8 kHz)

&gt;* Acoustic Guitar:

&gt;* Add Sparkle: Try some gentle boost at 10KHz using a Band Pass Filter with a medium bandwidth.

&gt;General: Try applying some mid-range cut to the rhythm section to make vocals and other instruments more clearly heard.

&gt;* harshness / bite (2 kHz), boominess (120 - 200 Hz), cut (7 - 10 kHz)

**Bass Guitar:**

&gt;* bottom (60 - 80 Hz), attack (700 - 1000 Hz), string noise (2.5 kHz)

**Horns:**

&gt;* fullness at 120 - 240 Hz, shrill at 5 - 7.5 kHz

**Strings:**

&gt;* fullness at 240 Hz, scratchiness at 7.5 - 10 kHz

&gt;Happy EQing.

So I promised a few of you that I would post the stats from the Monday Mixtape a while ago. I figured now would be a good time to do it. Here are the top 10 plays and top ten downloads since we started 10 weeks ago.

So print those off and post em on the fridge at home or do whatever you weirdos would do with shit like this. It is pretty interesting to see the trend in plays i guess. 

Anyways i wanted to remind you to send in your tracks for this week before midnight Sunday, and let you know I am now a mod and will do everything within my power to be the modiest mod there's ever been.

I actually have no idea how to do anything yet so give me a week to figure everything out AND THEN I'll be modding shit left and right. I might even change my name to Modney King, or Mod Stewart. MODIMUS PRIME.

I want all original beats from Redditors, Original verses from Redditors, and it will be hosted by me, Ill Deliveries (a Redditor). I will be contributing tracks of my own and would love to feature on tracks from those interested. 

The idea is still very raw and I haven't fully thought of a title. It will most likely incorporate ""/r/"" though. I would like to do multiple volumes keeping the same theme. There are some intellectual dudes on this site, mix that with the genre I grew up loving and I think the product will be unreal. 

See some of my stuff here from last years ""Mad Science Mixtape Volume. 1"":
