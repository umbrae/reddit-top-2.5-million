And I flipped over the bars after hitting a hidden crack at the bottom of a puddle. But after 4 months on the bike, 4,500 miles, 8 states, countless sketchy highways and bridges, I finally collided with a car.

This morning I picked up a suitcase in which to store my panniers for tomorrow's flight and had bungied it to the rear rack of my barely loaded (one nearly empty front pannier) Long Haul Trucker. My *next* stop was the bike shop, where I planned to box my bike and have it sent up to Maine. 

I'm cruising along in the bike lane, doing my usual 12-14mph, when a car zooms past me cuts right, taking the corner very tight. He turned so fast I just didn't have time to react.
I hit into the rear quarter of the vehicle and fly over the handlebars and onto the pavement. 
I pop up onto my feet, assuring some onlookers that I'm okay. 

Immediately get the guy's license plate before he can head off, and dial up the police. It wasn't until they were on the way that I noticed my front wheel was bent in half.

Sitting on the curb, I kind of chuckled to myself. I could hardly believe my luck. Literally on the home stretch of the tour, the final five miles, I get tagged by a car and am fortunate enough to be able to walk away.

Cops show up. Guy has an expired license, no registration, no insurance. He doesn't live in this state (Florida). Neither do I. It's a big mess. He ends up with a bunch of tickets, and his girlfriend drives them away. 

The cop is kind enough to drive me to the bike shop, where I just say screw it, and have them box everything up, bent wheel and all. I guess I'll deal with getting a new one in Maine.

I later found out that my Nexus 7's screen was cracked, basically ruining my tablet. And I've got some gnarly bruising on my hip, as well as a sprained left thumb.

I posted this mostly because I wanted to get it off my mind. I don't know that I'll be able to recoup any money from this guy. Since he has no insurance, I'd have to take him to small claims court. But he lives in Michigan. And I'm not coming back to Florida any time soon. I'm sure it's possible that I'm entitled to some restitution, but I'm mostly just glad to be as unharmed as I am. 

I do have one mechanical question, as I know very little about wheels. The one that was bent in half is toast, I know that. I don't have enough funds right now to replace it with one of a similar quality. But since it has a pretty expensive Shimano hub, would it be worth it to snip off the spokes and keep the hub for sometime in the future when I could pay someone to have it ""relaced?"" Or even just to sell it on it's own? Or is it always better to just get a new one?

Thanks for listening. 

TLDR: Hit by a car on the last 5 miles of a 4,500 mile tour. Guy has no insurance, no license, no registration. Wheel gets bent in half, computer is broken, I'm pretty much okay.

This recent, first-hand knowledge was pretty helpful, it let me see things and stay places I would have otherwise missed.  When I was pre-planning my trip, other than the basic info on the ACA maps, the only other way to get somewhat up-to-date information on the routes was to scour 1-to-2 year old CrazyGuyonaBike blogs.

This got me thinking, what if I created a website where the touring community could post information about towns &amp; places, the kind of stuff you would pass on to a cyclist going the other way?

I think maybe a Wiki-style webpage, broken down by route, section, then town?  It would break down something like this:

* TransAmerica Route
    * Section 8 (Alexander, KS, to Girard, KS)
        * Eureka, KS
            * Comments:

""The town recently installed a shower for cyclists in their park, but there's no hot water"" ***BillyB*** *(6/17/2012)*

""Only decent supermarket for 40 miles in each direction"" ***JohnRacer*** *(8/24/2012)*

""The Mexican restaurant, El Loco Polo, is cheap and has good food"" ***SurlyDave*** *(5/02/2012)*

1350197166.0,46,self.bicycletouring,11ga59,Things I trust: Some reviews of gear for bike tourers on budgets.,50,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/11ga59/things_i_trust_some_reviews_of_gear_for_bike/,"After two monthlong tours in two years, I've kind of settled on some things that I trust implicitly to work and not break. So, I wanted to share. As a bonus, I'm a giant cheapskate, so these things are also generally pretty cheap - or, in some cases, the ""cheapest decent option."" All were 100% functional for the uses I put them through - namely, 4000 or so miles over two separate tours, totaling over two months living with them. All of the mileage was in the summer, on road bikes, and in the US, so if you're doing something different - riding the continental divide in winter on a pugsley? - you'll likely have some different needs. 

**Rear Rack**: I use an [Axiom Journey](http://www.treefortbikes.com/product/333222352103/448/Axiom-Journey-Tubular-Alloy.html) rear rack. It costs between 35 and 40 bucks depending on where you buy it, and it's the cheapest rear rack out there with flanges to keep your panniers from flapping into your wheel. It also has a max load of 150 lbs, and a nearly universal  mounting system for the upper eyelets that uses tubular aluminum stays instead of those flimsy steel strips. All of these are features that can be had individually on much more expensive racks, and only rarely combined. Yes, a Surly Nice Rack is probably better in one way or another, but it's also three times the cost. The only downside is that the attached light mount is very flimsy. That's OK - it's just a piece of metal bolted on. Most bolt-on reflector mounts (cheap or free at your LBS, just detach the reflector) can be attached with minimal effort and do the same job. 

**Pedals**: [MKS Sylvan Touring pedals](http://www.amazon.com/MKS-Sylvan-Touring-Bicycle-Pedals/dp/B005I6D48G). These can be had from $30-$40. Put some toe clips on 'em and you'll pedal away happily. They look like bad old pedals from the 80s, but they're made with high quality materials and good seals. Best of all, you can repack them on the fly. Mine started making a bit of noise after I put 3500 + loaded miles on them, so I stopped and repacked them in about 15 minutes and continued on my way. The only tools necessary are a small adjustable wrench (for the lock nut and cone) and some kind of pliers to take off the dust cap. That's the kind of thing you can find most anywhere, if you're not carrying it yourself. In the months that I've ridden on them after repacking they're still going strong, and I expect to get another 4000 miles out of them before replacing the bearings. If you really have to ride with clipless pedals, go ahead, but I've always felt just fine with my platform pedals and hiking shoes.

**Lights**: I've had really good luck with Cateye Opticube headlights like [this one](http://www.outsideoutfitters.com/p-20444-cat-eye-sport-opticube-led-headlights.aspx?variantID=48048&amp;gclid=CMfC1ZDt_7ICFQVgMgod8jEAVg). They're the brightest cheap headlight I've ever used, have a very sensible mounting system, and don't drain batteries very fast. Nightriders are brighter, but in the general $20-$30 range, this is about as good as it gets. 

**Tires**: I swear by the **regular** [Schwalbe Marathon tires](https://encrypted.google.com/shopping/product/255872551734448247?q=schwalbe%20marathon), which are about $40 each. My touring partner has used both Marathon Plus and Marathon Supreme tires, and in both cases the tires wore prematurely and/or totally failed before finishing 2000 miles. Also, they got flats riding in the midwest. The fact that it costs more doesn't mean it's an upgrade! My front Marathon has not been replaced since I got it (4000+ miles ago) and is still going strong. My rear was replaced after about 2000 miles because it died to a 2 inch nail. (It caused a slow leak that I didn't notice for about 2 days.) I have had about 5 flats with these tires, all of which were in southern Arizona, land of cacti and tire-death. If you're in southern AZ or going there, get some tire goop and puncture-resistant tubes. Otherwise, just get some Marathons and you'll be fine. 

**Panniers**: I use Ortleibs. I won't bother linking because you probably already have them. They're probably the most expensive thing I use, and they're great. My stuff has never gotten wet, and the panniers are bombproof as far as I can tell. I'm jealous of all the folks who use kitty-litter boxes though - I think they might actually be better. Definitely cheaper.

**Stove**: I've used a [Trangia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trangia) stove for cooking just about every meal I ate for the duration of my tours. Specifically, we used [this kit](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/708400493537174181) which is not quite large enough for two hungry big dudes, but perfect for one person. The stove takes some getting used to, but has notable benefits: It's indestructible, being that it's all very simple nesting aluminum. It can be made to simmer, for pancakes, or boil water scary-fast if you want. It thrives in high winds - they just make it more efficient. It's very stable. It burns alcohol, which you can buy at pretty much any hardware store. Or liquor store, if it comes down to it. Also, alcohol is SUPER CHEAP compared to MSR canisters and such.  I could go on and on, It's a good stove. If you want to go the even cheaper route, you can make your own - just punch some holes near the bottom of a tin can, or make a [beer can stove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove). The trangia's advantage here is that it comes with a limiter that controls the amount of oxygen allowed to burn, so you can change the amount of heat output, and that it comes with a well-designed windscreen that minimizes heat lost to the environment. Both of these allow you to conserve fuel, saving money in the long term. Both could be made with a bit of DIY ethic, though. 

**Sleeping pad**: You don't need a Therm-a-rest. It will pop. Just spend $10 on a blue closed-cell foam pad from Wal-Mart. [Like this but cheaper.](http://www.rei.com/product/374053/standard-blue-foam-pad-regular) Roll it up with your tent poles inside, strap it to the back of your bike, and ride off. Maybe take a 3x3 square of pad to sit on while cooking? It's super cheap, and it's not like you really need to worry about the extra quarter-pound of weight. Also, if it gets dirty / scuffed / torn / sunbaked you don't have to worry. It was like 10 bucks! Need more padding? Buy two!

So, there you have it. All this stuff has held up for me under what I feel was pretty demanding conditions, and I expect it to continue doing so as I continue to ride. Feel free to share your own cheap but trustworthy stuff!

The last 3 days of riding were hell. Off the prairies and onto the Canadian shield. After weeks of flat and hot I am now in hilly and hot. I shipped about 20lbs of stuff home from Kenora and that helped alot. But I still was not able to shake that feeling of just wanting to go home.

Today made it all worth it again. Staying in a motel in Nestor Falls I decided I needed another day to rest and not be sleeping in my tent. Got my laundry done, showered, shaved then decided to check out the local air tour place. I love to fly and have seriously considered becoming a pilot so I jump at pretty much any chance I can get to be in a plane. Apparently they only do air tours for a minimum of 2 people so the owner decided to let me ride along for free on a trip to pick up some rich drunk ""fishermen"". The flight out was incredible. Seeing lake of the woods from the sky is truly majestic. We picked up the rich old drunks, dropped them off at their high end resort and proceeded to fly back. 

My favorite part about flying has always been take off and landing. So these short hops were more than I could have hoped for. Until the pilot turned to me and said ""I have some paperwork to do, mind taking over for a bit""...................shit yeah. So I got to fly an airplane today. The heat the bugs the flat tires the hills. None of it matters anymore. I am feeling great about the choice I have made to go on this trip and look forward to what comes next. Everything up to this point has been 98% positive and this just blew it out of the water.

1341674971.0,45,self.bicycletouring,w6hy8,Scumbag Cycle Tourist?,51,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/w6hy8/scumbag_cycle_tourist/,"So my fiancee and I ride a tandem when we tour.  We are not new to this sport and have spent about 4 months together on the road over all.  On this last trip we pulled a free kid trailer with us for our gear.

Loved it.  Every moment of the ride was better with a trailer.  I can't tell you enough here how much better the trailer is for tandem tourists.  The bike rides like a tandem again (not a bus like it does with gear), you can take what ever you want (we choose camping hammocks, a french press, and pillows), packing up in the morning is a breeze, and honestly its safer.  

We thought that we would be more visible and cars would give us more room but we had no idea what we in for with the trailer.  It was a free kid trailer made by Adams over 15 years ago (I picked it up curbside on trash day for free).  

The effect on passing cars was staggering.  We road Hwy 1 down the coast for a week over the holiday and what we found was that 98% of all cars, busses, and motorhomes gave us more room than needed.  Some going as far as crossing the double yellows completely.  It dawned on us day two that they were looking back not because of the funny tandem but because they were gawking in disbelief that we would endanger our kid on this road.  

We dont have a kid though...

We stumbled upon this little trick by accident.  We have already upgraded to a fancy Burley used trailer off craigslist.  On a side note we like the two wheeled trailers over ""BoB"" style trailers because while climbing the trailer doesn't rock back and forth.  Two wheels are better than one especially when flying down these mountains.

My question is this.  If we continue to use this ""kid"" as a shield to scare away cars, does this put us in the ""Scumbag Cycle Tourist"" category?  

Personally I think not.  I believe and so does my fiancee that on safer roads with less cliffs that exposing your child to exercise is far less of a risk to your child's well being than truckstops and riding around in a motorhome.

1349365153.0,41,self.bicycletouring,10xum0,My view (and tips) for stealth camping,43,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/10xum0/my_view_and_tips_for_stealth_camping/,"I've been cycling for more then three months now without any previous experience on touring or traveling. I had absolutely no clue when I paddled away from home. I still have no clue what I'm doing but I wanna share my view/tips on stealth camping.

**No one calls the cops.**
Are you making a mess, making fire (don't do that!) or destroying things? No? Than why would they call the cops? All the people I met in the night or in the morning near my tent where stunned by my ambitions and actions. From the hundreds of people I met while I was camping only one said something like ""This is not a good place to camp"". And that was because I was 'in his way'. The rest admire the fact that you take a risk and do what most people only dream of.

**See a good place early in the evening?*
Go for it! You've plenty of time the check the surroundings, make yourself a dinner, read a book, write a story or develop a new profession (yes, you can always learn!). Having a few hours in a certain place makes you more comfortable what ends up in a better night of sleep!

**Avoid big cities.**
Cities are nice for resources, food or 'taking a day of'. But cities are mostly not good for wild camping. There are people everywhere! And no offense, but people in (big) cities tent to be more on themselves. Setting up a tent in a city park is not a good idea. Trust me on this one.

**Check your map.**
I use MapDroyd on my Android device to navigate. Besides the offline mode and ease of use it has plenty of detail. Zooming in gives you farm roads, cycle roads, off roads and footpaths. The last one is your best friend. As the name suggest there will be only people walking. No cars and mostly no bikes will come here. And who is walking these days anyway?

**Ring a door.**
Have problems finding a (good) spot? Ring a door. What is the worst thing that can happen? They say no? Most people are happy to help. Have you ever helped a stranger? And how did it feel? Seeing a smile on someones face because of you is a very powerful feeling.

**Enjoy!**
Take a look at the enclosed pictures (what can be found on my [website](http://www.vanafeenfiets.nl/blog/6-stealth-camping.html)). This is just a fraction of spots I've been. Have you ever seen such a stunning beauty without paying lots of money? I doubt it. And besides the view there is another strange feeling. It's the feeling of freedom and no picture of word can describe that.

I got myself set up with a fairly [small pack-out](http://i.imgur.com/A6qSU.jpg) by using an Axiom handlebar bag and an [HMPL No.15 saddle bag](http://i.imgur.com/lYVwE.jpg).

The trip started in Vancouver, BC. I rode East along the Lougheed Highway (#7), then up over the Crowsnest (#3) to Osoyoos, then North along Highway 97 to Kamloops. Nearly 800kms in 7 days of riding plus a rest day in Penticton. There were some [pretty big hills](http://i.imgur.com/Ye7Vv.jpg) (started that climb at sea level...) and some really gnarly roads, but it was quite beautiful up in the mountains. After the mountains comes pastoral farmland in the Okanagan Valley. There weren't much in the way of bike routes, but they did have [alternatives](http://i.imgur.com/xuUcu.jpg).

Day 1 was [121kms of mixed urban, suburban and rural riding](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216952). I know that isn't really a big day but I got a late start and hadn't ridden that far in a single day yet this year, so when I got to my motel I opted for [a two beer shower](http://i.imgur.com/xKxRs.jpg).

Day 2 was the most [painful thing](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216945) I've done in a long time. 1700m of climbing over 106km, getting me from sea level to over 1300m elevation. It was pretty desolate out in Manning Park, with nowhere to refill water bottles or take a break. That, combined with nowhere to purchase bottled or canned beer at the lodge made me very happy to have hauled [leftover beer](http://i.imgur.com/HaRIV.jpg) from the first day up all those hills.

Day 3 was a [much needed break](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216938) after the climb into Manning Park, but it didn't feel that relaxing. Seriously steep descents on terrifyingly narrow cliffside shoulders with no guardrails on single lane highway isn't very fun. That day's [shower beer](http://i.imgur.com/mIhoi.jpg) was cathartic.

Day 4 [was wonderful](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216937). Rolling hills through farms and vineyards. The first 60 or so kilometres were generally downhill and that part of the day flew by. The afternoon's climbing was offset by the beautiful descent into Osoyoos. Having a beer store right beside my motel made [showering a delight](http://i.imgur.com/XW2V5.jpg).

Day 5 was [supposed to be easy](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216930), but it here where I discovered that heading North at this time of year is pretty dumb, because there's a consistant 30km+ wind blowing out of the North. Day 6 and 7 featured the same lovely wind, but on day 5 it was gusting enough to make me fear being launched off the road. I was struck twice by tumbleweeds and at one point saw a small garden snake being blown across the highway. [I quite enjoyed](http://i.imgur.com/OxSdr.jpg) arriving at my motel and settling in for a day off riding.

Day 6 was a continuation of [rolling hills](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216935), farmland, vineyards and headwinds. It was here where my legs had finally developed to the point that I no longer felt sore at the end of my rides. I had intended to stop in Kelowna for lunch but was on a roll so blasted through instead. Vernon is a pretty town and I quite [enjoyed my evening](http://i.imgur.com/hGNJ9.jpg) there.

Day 7 was [pretty much the same](http://app.strava.com/rides/24216951) as day 6. By this point it had begun dropping down to freezing at night, and wasn't getting above 10C until mid afternoon, although it did tend to reach up to about 20C by 4 or 5PM, after which it dropped rapidly back down to near freezing. With bibs, jersey, winter jersey, mtb shorts, arm warmers, knee warmers and two pairs of gloves I was still generally uncomfortably cold in the mornings. Probably explains why I saw no other cycle tourers for the last 5 days of riding... Still, it felt great to climb the final hill up to my motel and enjoy the [end of the ride](http://i.imgur.com/AmiBG.jpg).

The next day my sister, girlfriend and a friend all drove up to pick me up and I got to cruise back to Vancouver in comfort. It was quite nice to get back to [my own shower](http://i.imgur.com/9XAl6.jpg) and bed :)

I bought a bike three weeks before departing and here's what I learned.

- If you're bringing a bike on an airplane, try to avoid telling them it's a bike. It immediately tacks a 200 dollar charge on.

- Chaffing isn't as big of a concern as people think.

- Anybody can do a bike tour, given that you have the time and patience for it. You just peddle. 

- Little dogs are terrible, awful creatures.

- Bicycle Route 1 through Virginia is a piece of shit.

- Ashland is a cycling heaven of sorts. Everybody there was either really stoked to see us touring or they were really bummed that outsiders had infiltrated their little private cycling club.

- Clipless isn't the rage everybody claims. I actually preferred BMX pedals.

- Axiom Champlain panniers are doo-doo.


That's about all I learned. Other than the fact that you don't need to train for this sort of shit. My legs felt awesome by the end of the tour. Like I could punt kick a small child over a mountain.

http://imgur.com/a/KUAoI#0


So I thought I would share my trip from April 2012. 

Me (17) and my Dad (49) live in Australia and we are decided to do a Californian Bike tour from San Francisco to Los Angeles. We chose to do it in 14 days. I took my singlespeed roadbike and my dad bought a $500 commuter bike in San Fran. People were always shocked that I did it on a singlespeed but it really wasn't an issue at all, I just needed to build up lots of speed before tackling hills. The simplicity and ease of use of a singlespeed is also a nice benefit. We spent 2 days in San Franc and L.A. and one night in the rest of the places we visited. We had highs and lows but overall it was one of the best things I have done with my life so far!


We stayed in motels averaging $90 a night for a two bed room and that worked quite well. You can really appreciate a nice hot shower and comfy bed when you are in the saddle all day. The whole trip was about 700km (430miles) but we did cheat a bit and do some portions of the trip on bus. There is no reason to feel bad about taking the bus if its going to safe you a lot of hassle and time. If you can take your time and enjoy the ride its a lot nicer than constantly stressing about making up the miles every day. The worst point of the trip was getting three punctures in a row while being lost in a dodgy part of Fremont at around 11pm. We made it through, though!

Since we were riding from north to south on the right side of the road we got a lot of great views of the Pacific ocean. Little things like that can make a big impact on your tour. We tried just about every fast food chain on the trip and everything tasted great because we were so hungry all the time. The trip cost around $5,000 each but we did stay in motels, buy lots of stuff and eat out a lot. We received literally no road rage from drivers and there weren't many times we felt unsafe, which was great. I don't even remember any particularly nasty hills (except for maybe around Malibu).

Some of the Highlights of the trip were:

- Pretty much all of San Francisco

- The awesome fresh fruit from the farmside stalls

- Monterey Clam Chowder

- The wonderful Californian sun

- All those 99c cans of drink!

- San Luis Obispo was probably my favorite place we visited (So nice there!)

- The Getty Center

- All the nice, helpful people we met along the way!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In summary here are my top five tips for other people thinking about doing the same thing:

1 - No matter how much research you do on the internet at home, nothing compares to local knowledge so every time you set out for the next stretch your trip have a chat to some of the locals for advice on your route. The we found the best place for this were bike shops because the folks there are always helpful, interested in your trip and can give you the best route possible to your next destination.

2 - Be generous with your time when planning and be flexible when on the trip. Some of the best parts of our trip were when we had the free time to just explore and check out places that look interesting. 

3 -  This may not be for everyone but we both bought a little bike mirror that attaches to your glasses like this: http://www.nordicskiracer.com/equipment/2009/mirror-on-glasses.jpg (not my picture). This was great for keeping an eye on traffic when the shoulder is tight and reassuring yourself that your travelling partner is close behind. It was slightly annoying to set up but definitely worth having.

4 - Don't worry about the type of bike you take that much, if you are aiming to do around 50km a day or less then pretty much any bike will do. 

5 - I would also recommend doing it with a friend, though that's up to you. Just having someone to watch your stuff when you are in the bathroom, double-check the route and generally make conversation with makes things a whole lot easier. It was also a great bonding experience with my dad, who probably doesn't have that many adventures left in him.

I have been excitedly planning my first bike tour for this coming summer and this subreddit has been a tremendous help and inspiration to go through with this.

One issue I can't seem to get passed is the idea of stealth camping. Having never done it, I may just be a bit paranoid. I don't really like the idea of trespassing. It seems this might lead to unnecessary conflict.

Has anyone had success just knocking on doors and asking for permission? Personally, I think I'd feel better about it if I knew I wasn't likely to be chased out.

(pics in post),39,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/zpqnq/first_stealth_camping_s24o_complete_pics_in_post/,"Stealth camping is something I've always wanted to try while bike touring, especially here in southern England where the countryside is full of fields, footpaths, and little forests that look like ideal cover for such camping. Of course, you are not supposed to do it, but my rationalization is that if you leave no trace, don't bother anyone, and are gone at dawn, it's hard to see it as a really bad thing.

In some ways bike touring and stealth camping seem perfectly matched - you're much more mobile than backpacker, giving you a wide range of location choices, and yet your vehicle is quiet, maneuverable, and easily concealed, unlike a car or motorcycle, letting you disappear up a trail or path.

This weekend we finally gave it a shot, riding from Oxford to Bath (about 110km). Although it was a beautiful weekend, the early morning start featured plenty of damp mist: http://i.imgur.com/vIFdjh.jpg

We foraged some amazing cherries along the way, growing by the path up the hill leading to the Faringdon Folly. It must have been an orchard at some point, as there were several varieties of cherries unlike any I've had from a store. These yellow ones were delicious: http://i.imgur.com/IQwYSh.jpg

Then we stopped by Malmesbury Abbey - the entranceway the bikes are leaning against is nearly a thousand years old: http://imgur.com/a/aqD0O#4

Here was our lunch spot, next to an iron age hill fort known as Badbury Hill, now called Badbury Clump after the small forest that grows there today. http://i.imgur.com/eCjBAh.jpg

Legend has it that this was where King Arthur defeated the Anglo Saxons in the Battle of Mount Badon, although that's pretty speculative. Anyway, it was a pretty spot. Here's another view from the edge of the earthworks: http://i.imgur.com/uQ4cMh.jpg

Finally, we approached Bath, and decided to look for a place to sleep (and eat!). Near Kingsdown we got lucky - a nice secluded spot with a quiet country pub just a few minutes ride away. The camping spot was close to a quiet footpath between some fields, but the trees provided cover and there was a good flat place for setting up a tent. We were pretty much invisible from the path and the closest farmhouses were pretty far away. Here's the exact spot: http://goo.gl/maps/f5LVM

The pub had an amazing view over the valley: http://i.imgur.com/DUftSh.jpg 
...and Sharp's Doom Bar on tap: http://i.imgur.com/h19pk.jpg

Here's me with my beer in the back garden: http://i.imgur.com/s1ct1h.jpg 
And this was the sunset we watched as we ate dinner outside: http://i.imgur.com/wAztvh.jpg

After dinner it was nearly dark so we returned to our camp spot, and pitched the tent by the light of our rear red lights. It was a nice spot - dry and the owls were hooting in the trees above us. Next morning, we broke camp right at dawn, and made breakfast at the edge of a nearby field (back on a footpath, so no more trespassing issues).

We somewhat jokingly began calling things out as one of the laws of bike touring. I started to wonder--what are the real laws of bike touring? The things that would stand up no matter where you are touring and what the circumstances.

The initial laws as I see them:

1. Eat before you're hungry.
2. Drink before you're thirsty.
3. No matter what, and especially when you're lost, remember: This is the Trip.

I'm hoping /r/bicycletouring is interested in helping me write the rest.

Thanks! I posted the 15 that seemed most important here:

In previous years, I've avoided touring around my native land for one reason: the roads suck. Before this year, I'd done some 100km+ days around Warsaw and to other cities (Łódź, Ostrołęka, Olsztyn) and traveling on roads with 90kmh speed limits is no fun. I'd avoid smaller roads, I never knew where they'd end or worse - turn to sand.

In the past month and a half, since I discovered the gmaps/sv combo, I've been finding roads like the ones [pictured on my blog](http://www.ridingmyassoff.com/). Great asphalt, very low traffic. Sure, the routes might be slightly less direct (145km to Łódź vs 130km two years ago), but they're just *so much nicer*. 

I usually use the bike route option to map the path then go over it to check for large roads and make detours as needed. Then I'll make a [cue sheet](http://jedrek.me/_f/mikolajki.2013.07.06/2013-07-08-11.44.34.jpg) so I don't need to check my phone every 30 minutes... and I'm off.

1. NO, I am not saying this is an end-all Ultralight list. It's easy to find a lot of faults. It is, however, lighter than most and is a 2-pannier deal.

2. My electronics are an exception to the weight rule. I'm not posting this to brag, just to help people trying to decide what clothes/cooking gear/extras to bring. Obviously, a laptop and 5lbs of camera gear isn't ultralight, but that's how I'm rolling this trip!

I went to my LBS to shoot the breeze, and and saw a frame outside on display.

""Oh that frameset is my size.. $225, not bad. Holy crap this is a Long Haul Trucker?!""

Turns out that it was the display model, and has a couple cosmetic scratches. So they were selling it for less than half price, in a color I didn't know it came in! (Maroon) 
Not only that, but because I bought a frame, they gave me a discount on a Brooks B17, which all totaled out to less than the frameset alone would cost online!

1352072064.0,29,self.bicycletouring,12mxbj,Hi /r/bicycletouring I am a 19yo guy that wants to cycle all around the world. Would you all be so kind to give me a few pointers? (x-post from /r/bicycling),42,13,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/12mxbj/hi_rbicycletouring_i_am_a_19yo_guy_that_wants_to/,"I've been thinking about doing this for the past 2 months and I decided that I will do it.

A little about myself: I've been cycling since I was a kid, but it was all the cycling in the park type. More recently my dad passed on his [bike](http://i.imgur.com/QV49Z) to me. For the past year I have been commuting to work on it for an hour a day, and I really enjoy the rides to and fro.

My dad is partly the reason I want to do this trip. He cycled across the USA in his younger days and did a motorbike trip across Australia and his stories are endless from them. I was hoping my trip would build my character and provide me with a view of the world. Another reason is that I want to be able to do something incredible with my life before I become unable to. 

My current plan: I am working for the next year and so (to save up money for uni and my plans) till I start university in the fall of 14'. I will end university in 18' and I plan to take a year (or more) after university to cycle around the world, starting in Singapore and ending in Spain. So theoretically speaking I have 5 years to plan and execute my trip. 

Route: I plan on taking the route along the pacific (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China) and cut through China along the Great Wall through Kazakhstan and into Europe by means of Russia, Poland then up and round through Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and France cut across to Italy and back to finally end in Spain.

My experiences haven't been much, I've done day trips around and about Singapore, but that's the extent of it. I plan to try longer trips in New Zealand to test out the camping out experience/ being self-sufficient on the trip. I have done camping on it's own before too, I've climbed Mount Tahan. I know how to change a tire, raise my seat, fix broken spokes, fix a chain. But that's the extent of my current ability.

My questions to you guys: I believe I will be requiring a touring bike (the type I've been riding). Should I build one from the basics or purchase a second hand one? What type of material should I be looking at? (My current one is steel and I like the sturdiness of it.) Are the wheel sizes very important? (I enjoy the big wheels on my current bike 29'' I think it adds up over a long distance) How should I be training for this? I know I will need to know a lot more about bicycles and maintaining/fixing them, any advice on where to look?  

So /r/bicycletouring  what else do I need to know or would you guys suggest I do? 

Thanks for listening.

So here's what I've got so far if you can think of anything else to put on I'd really appreciate it, or if I'm wrong about anything please correct me.  
  
1. Keep a high cadence throughout the cycle. This means keep your legs spinning fast, it's a lot more efficient than pushing the pedals slowly and using your power.  
2. When going up a hill keep your bike in a low gear and keep your feet spinning fast.  
3. When going down a valley accelerate down the slope so you have more momentum to carry you up the hill.  
4. Drafting is when you keep within a meter of the rear tyre of the bike in front of you. The person in front of you will break the wind and you will be pedalling in their slipstream. This makes pedalling ~20% easier. Drafting however is a skill, and you should try to practise it on the training rides.  
5. During a long ride take a packet of sweets/biscuits/raisins or any other high sugar snack to keep your blood sugar up. A 70 mile ride can burn upwards of 2000 calories so this essential.  
6. Whenever you stop on the road for any reason eg. puncture, fall, injury the first thing you should do is GET OFF THE ROAD. Then you should tackle the problem.  
7. (Edited version: Make sure you go to a bike shopp the adjust you sadle to the optimum height.) (origional)The height of your saddle should be just below the top of your hip bone when you're standing next to your bike. This will make it hard to touch the floor with your foot when you're cycling but will make it a lot easier to pedal.  
8. When you see a pot hole ahead that looks dangerous point to it as you pass it so the riders behind you can avoid it.  
9. Make sure your helmet does not move about on your head, otherwise if you crash it could fall off and possibly give you a serious head injury.  
10. Always carry two inner tubes, some tyre levers and a hand pump, if you become separated from the group and both you tyres get punctured you will be stranded.  
11. The part of your foot that makes contact with your pedal should be the ball of your foot, rather than your heel or toe.  
12. (edited version)Clipless pedals and some cycling shoes with cleats can make the tour a lot easier if you are confident with balncing your bike.  
(origional: The best kit you can buy to make your trip easier are some clipless pedals and some cycling shoes with cleats. These allow you to clip onto your pedals so you can use the upwards motion of your foot to help turn the pedals. It also spreads the pressure of your pedal around your foot rather than just the ball of you foot. Amongst other thing to help improve your efficiency)  
13. (edit)Always carry sun cream.",,False,,t5_2sdwm,1360470934.0,,1k,True,t3_187gie,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/187gie/list_of_tips_for_noob_tourers/,

Me and my girlfriend wanted to do a different vacation from the usual city sightseeing trip, so we decided to travel with our cyclocross bikes around south France and to sleep in a tent. After a week of buying the necessary stuff and of planning the rough itinerary, we took a train from Milan, Italy (where we live) and went to Nice, France to start pedalling from there. 

We followed the cycling lane all the way to Antibes, then we started going uphill, passed through Valbonne and after some steep climbs arrived in Grasse, the perfumes capital. From there we took a coach to Digne-les-Bains (to avoid the mountains, because we overpacked and they would have been too difficult to ride), then we cycled south and overcame Bras-d'Asse climb, and rode through the amazing Plateau de Valensole, a vast slice of land with lavender everywhere. The weather was very hot (41°C) and the asphalt melted on our wheels, but the landscape was breathtaking.

After arriving in Valensole, we went to Manosque and then followed the beautiful road to Aix-en-Provence, passing on the Durance river on the Mirabeau Bridge. After a crazy descent along the Route National (a huge highway where bicycle were allowed) we entered Aix and stayed there for a day, visited the city and then took the train to return home, passing through Marseille, Nice, Genova and finally returning to Milan.

Eventually, we stayed in France for 6 days and rode ~200 km, maybe not many but it was our first experience and we encountered a lot of climbs so it wasn't easy with all the gear we had. 
We had a fabulous time there and we loved this trip. We enjoyed especially the freedom that bikes give, and the amazing landscapes that we would have miss by going by car or by train. 
We can't wait to plan another one next year.

Here is an album I created with some of the pics we took: http://imgur.com/a/GBuf4

Have a nice day, enjoy your bike trips as we enjoyed ours. Feel free to ask anything. :)

I'm a commuter in Chicago, about 10 miles roundtrip (thank god for this mild winter thus far). I picked up a rubberized Swiss army gas mask bag (date inside says 1973) from the Army/Navy surplus shop for about $5. It's rubberized, which makes it waterproof, and just the right size for a handlebar bag or rear seat bag.

It has two heavy-duty snap closes on the top. When you open it, it has a large velcro'd side pocket, a pocket on the bottom, and one on the side which holds a bottle of grease perfectly. I took the clips from the original strap and cut them down so I can adjust them to attach to the handlebars.

I use this mostly to keep an additional cable for locking my front wheel with my U-lock on the back, as well as some basic repair tools.

My girlfriend and I were planning to take our first tour across Kansas but the forecast changed at the last minute and we had to move our trip south to avoid snow. I got some wonderful advice and suggestions for destinations from this subreddit and we decided to go from Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge to Caprock Canyons. We were trying to keep costs to a minimum and tried to DIY whatever we could (I fixed up a free trashed bike, made most of the panniers and bags myself, and we made our own cliff bars.) A lot of the tour was fantastic, but the wind (which I stupidly didn't consider when making plans) made nights hellishly cold and physically prevented us from moving forward without walking at some points. Between that and a knee injury, we decided to turn around at the Texas border and hitchhiked part of the way back. At the time it felt like a massive failure, but a lot of the trip was fantastic and we got to meet some wonderful people when we went looking for help. It was also a great test run for a longer trip I'm hoping to take from Jackson Hole to the northwest corner of Washington this summer, but I think my girlfriend might be done with touring.

The portal focusses primarily to cyclists using gps devices for navigation. But it provides valuable information for all touring cyclists.

On [biroto.eu](http://www.biroto.eu/) you will find at present 227.153 km of cycle paths in Europe, official trails, as well as tours by members of the biroto community.

For each cycle path there are an interactive map and an elevation profile of the cycle path, the GPS track for download, information about cyclist-friendly accommodations (Beds4Bikers), sights and other infrastructure along the bike trail. All information can be printed as a tour book and is the guide for your tour.

You can register for free. The usage of the services will not be charged.

And if you will not find the tour of your ideas in the 227.153 km, plan an individual tour using bitoro.eu.

biroto.eu is a portal for participation. Similar to a wiki, all members of the biroto community can contribute for the benefit of all:
* upload gps tracks of your own tours,

* add or adapt descriptions of bike routes and tours,
* plan stages and generate detailed maps of the destination in the tour book,
* add cyclist-friendly accommodation,
* add and adapt other infrastructure (e.g. bicycle repair shops, ferries, ...),
* create your travelogues.

To find the route or tour you are looking for there are two pages which support this:

* a [list of routes and tours ordered by country]  (http://www.biroto.eu/RTFS.php)
* an interactive [map with routes and tours]  (http://www.biroto.eu/RTFM.php)

After checking out Ken Kifer's site a bit and hearing all the good things he had to say about the Schwinn Voyager I actually found one on craigslist for $150 that I talked down to $80. 

I bought a $11 nashbar moustache bar

Slowly I began to build the bike up, first getting racks and panniers (total spent: $55 for both front and rear racks AND panniers!) then building my first wheelset (Shimano Tiagra hubs laced to Sun CR 18 Rims which cost 38 for the rims/spokes/nips and the co op actually gave me the hubs). And bought a Brooks B17 Flyer for $110. 

I then built up the drivetrain, finding parts from the co op (which I still need to pay for!) and using some suntour bar end shifters that I bought on eBay ($50) 

All told I have spent just under $300 and this thing is a dream! All this is with the help of my local bike co op so I really can't advocate for people to seek their local one out!

I'm very excited about the bike and hope you guys dig it too:

First off, I wanted to say that I am happy to have found such an interesting subreddit with like-minded people, been happily browsing and reading the discussions for several weeks now.

Secondly, turning to the question in the post title, on August 30, I am going on an 800km tour along the Baltic Sea coast with a couple of friends (aged 25-32, of various nationalities), and we’re looking for some other people interested to join our little group that like to call themselves the Knight Riders. Both the starting point and the end point would be in Riga, but we’re going to take a local commuter train both in and out of Riga ([here’s a rough outline of the route](http://i.imgur.com/PzD3uoE.png), subject to changes). This means that people from almost any Baltic region / north-east European country could easily get to our start/finish point, others are not excluded of course (instead of nationality we would rather appreciate some self-sufficiency skills).

In addition to being bicycle commuters we have some experience in touring, mostly 1-3 day tours, with some sports cycling background (on-road, off-road), and in this tour we plan to do at least 100 km per day, mostly sleeping in tents or staying with CouchSurfing members, or at some guesthouses.

The route is quite flat, lots of forests, this is a rather scarcely populated area (compared to other European countries), with small towns and villages, fishing ports. With more populated areas we'll try to avoid main highways but we won't go offroad or dirt roads unless absolutely necessary.

Let me know if you have any questions, comments, critique, suggestions. (I know it might be risky to go on a trip with total strangers but that does not deter us from exploring the world, does it?)

The idea is that you leave in the afternoon, bike 2 to 10 miles, and campout.  In the morning you get up and bike home.

The advantages are that you know the weather forecast, plus you aren't locked into your gear choices for very long.

I'm riding down the west coast right now. Last night I arrived in Crescent City, CA around dusk and wasn't able to find a spot in the woods outside of town that wasn't an active bum jungle (fresh trash, trails, bike parts, bedding, shits, etc everywhere I looked).

Luckily, a group of 7 other cycle tourists [on an epic quest](http://www.atripsouth.com/) appeared on the highway and we all camped pretty obviously on a beach.

After a fire and din din I slept out (everyone else opted for tents) with my bike (3/4 loaded) about 10 feet away away - [Here's the scene. My bike and sleeping bag are visible near the center](http://i.imgur.com/JVbi8.jpg). At around 5am I saw someone kind of rummaging around our dinner area (food, pots, pans, etc). I figured it was one of the dudes I was camping with and went back to sleep. 

A few minutes later I saw the same person take my bike and start walking away with it. At first I thought it was one of the guys playing a trick on me (hide someones bike - classic)...but they just kept walking.

Oh shit! I grabbed my pepper spray and took off after him, intercepting him right before he got to the road. I yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!"" He replied ""It was just sitting there."", dropped it (drive-side down in the sand, of course) and split. 

I'm consider myself a deep sleeper and it would have really, really, really sucked to loose my bike and gear (On top of the usual camping/bike equipment - I've got a few k worth of camera and computer equipment on board!). 

I've toured tens of thousands of miles all around the US and never come this close to having my shit jacked. I usually don't even bother locking up outside of big cities. 

Today, I find I've become bum-racist.

Lesson learned? 

TL;DR 
I was camping on the beach and some bum started walking off with my bike in the middle of the night.

Seriously. There are entire systems of little bike highways and under river tunnels (only for bikes), it's spectacular. You almost never need to share surface with a car.

The result is I get lost easier, so many turns and such. I've never been too good at non-grid urban navigation anyways. 

I discovered that Google maps on my phone has turn by turn navigation. It works pretty well here.  So I popped in an earbud, dropped my phone in my handlebar bag and peddled off chuckling at the soft lady voice butcher Dutch pronunciations. The problem of course is bike path directions are more convoluted so you often need to double check the map with your surroundings.

We all know how it is, we're on a bike, it's easy as pie to stop for a split second to snap a photo, put on a glove, or consult a map. I can't be the only one, however, who gets into a groove and hates stopping, preferring to balance or onehand the operation.

So there I was ripping through the beautiful countryside of South Holland with Google's confident voice playing copilot. Occasionally things would get muddled and I'd need to check the map. I had a system. Hold handlebar with one hand while using the other to lift up the lid of my bag. I'd then peek inside at the strategically balanced phone.

It was quite perfect, I mean I never needed to slow down, only had to take one hand off the bar, and divert my eyes from the road for no more than 5 seconds or so. What could go wrong? :/

Well, a bent handlebar, a broken brake lever, and 60€ / 80$ later for a new brake lever later and thankfully it's my pride that got hurt the worst, not me, my bike, or the parked car.

*TL;DR* Crashed into park car while riding and fussing with Google Navigation. OP is dumb.

Usually I like to let my journeys meander, rarely consulting a map, but I was in a bit of a hurry and quite lost, so I succumbed to the bewitching siren's call and lost all sense in the process.

**Starting Out**

I did all this on a shoestring, my cycling partner did not. 


My bike cost £280, his cost £1300+


Mine made it to France and back, his did not.


I'm highlighting this just so if you are planning a tour, be mindful that your very expensive road bike super-awesome everything may not hold up for long when fully loaded and tackling the dirt tracks you will inevitably end up on! 



My bike was heavier, clumsy and a beast. But she was solid. We christened her Old Bess.



[My bike](http://www.bikesandprams.co.uk/product.php?xProd=1808).


[My tent](http://www.gelert.com/products/solo_tent).


**Heading Off!**

Unfortunately, thanks to the geography of the UK, our first 3-4 days were going to be the toughest terrain-wise. This was up-and-over the Scottish Southern Uplands, through the Lake District, then across the Yorkshire Dales!



[This](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=George+Square,+George+St,+Glasgow&amp;daddr=B7076&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=55.509971,-3.070679&amp;spn=1.701487,5.410767&amp;sll=55.120699,-3.360443&amp;sspn=0.053696,0.169086&amp;geocode=FaBfVAMdrCW__yEUm6GpsF0aOSkH78g9oEaISDEUm6GpsF0aOQ%3BFWHMSAMdlgTN_w&amp;oq=lockerbie&amp;t=h&amp;dirflg=b&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=13&amp;lci=bike&amp;z=8) was Day 1's basic route.


Cycling out of Glasgow wasn't too interesting, lots of lovely tours of suburbs, etc. The cycle route south (74) is mainly the old main road between Scotland &amp; England that is now basically empty thanks to the M74 Motorway. 
The first day featured steady, leg-killing climbs for a long time, but first day adrenaline got me through. Once we got up in the hills, it was our first taste of wilderness, amongst the clouds and sheep. 


The pay-off coming down from the hills was incredible, huge declines for miles through forests and wind-turbine farms. We could see the sunshine spilling into valleys ahead, and raced to be first in it.


Was nice seeing parts of my own country that I'd never explored before (The south of Scotland is surprisingly lovely, I've only ever really explored the Highlands, Islands and Central Belt before really)
We consciously decided not to let finding a campsite stress us. 



Our method was as follows:
*find out sunset for that day


*start keeping an eye out for a good secluded pitch 3 hours before sunset


That's all, wild-camping is easy if you give yourself the timescale to find somewhere you feel comfortable enough, and at 10-12mph average, this way you have a good 30 miles of countryside to choose from and explore.



The first night we camped at the side of an old, disused farm track that now lead nowhere, hidden from the road 5m away by a copse of trees. Sporadic trains could see us, and in the morning some train go-ers definately got a full frontal view of a naked wildman eating cereal bars.



**Day 2** [Click for Route!](http://goo.gl/maps/wel2m)



A nice mix of main roads and country roads took us towards Gretna, very scenic and the air thick with the good old smell of manure. A motorway warning sign told us of heavy rain expected, but thankfully it must have missed us.


On to Carlise, we had planned to stop there for an hour, but ended up extending that as the first of many things started to go wrong with my cycling partner's bike and we had to find a bike shop.


Towards Penrith our route was cordoned off by the police. The policeman gave us the option of taking the closed road, but warned us we'd have to walk our bikes past a pretty gory accident - or to take a parallel road that he told us about. When the policeman was thinking of our options, he obviously never took into consideration the fact we were on heavily laden bikes, as the parallel road we took can only be described as a big fuck-off hill. Which was teeming with diverted traffic.


What was a brutal climb eventually leveled out into a view of the whole of Penrith and its valley. My partner took to the verge to fix his wheel while I kept on.


Two men with four dogs told me I wasn't going to have to pedal for a while, and before I could register what they had said the road dropped into an extreme down-gradient - no traffic in front or behind - just the sweet sound of tyre on flawless tarmacadam as I powered it downhill into Penrith.



In Penrith my partner discovered a broken spoke! So I set myself up on a bench in the town centre, got out my camping stove and made some urban noodles.



Fixed, we continued on and found a super-picturesque camping spot. We gambled on a bridal path that lead through fields and fields until we came to one with no animals, and a stream. Pitched up beside the stream, washed our things and selves in the stream. There was only fields and fields and fields in view, the distant rumble of a train and the bleating of our neighbours the sheep.

On June 28, I went on my first bike tour after being inspired to do so by one of my best friends, as well as all of the fun adventurers in r/bicycletouring. I wanted to celebrate my birthday, finishing grad school, love, and freedom. (I posted [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1ga4v2/doing_a_short_weekend_tour_from_la_union_station/) a couple of weeks ago)

I started my journey in downtown LA and planned to head out through East Los and then take the San Gabriel River Valley Mid-Trail to the coast, taking the PCH all the way down to San Diego. I had a great time and was very happy for about 30 miles. I ran out of water and stopped at the Walmart in Long Beach where, in the scramble to get in and get out, I made a huge mistake and neglected to lock my bike. I came out of the store not ten minutes later and, to my complete horror, found my bike and gear no longer parked at the rack. That's where my trip ended.

I'd like to thank this community for all of the inspiring photos, stories, and advice. Your stories kept the dream of bike touring alive for me while I went through some busy and tough personal times. While this has set me back, I plan on doing the exact same ride when I'm able to buy another bike and some gear. Call me dumb and indignant, but I really, REALLY loved the 30 mi. that I did get to ride and want to see it the whole way through one day.

Thanks and safe travels to all!

I wanted to go Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, anihC (read it backwards, I'm currently applying for the visa and have heard they sometime check the internet?!), Pakistan, India; a pretty common route. Unfortunately the Pakistan visa is pretty much impossible to obtain anywhere except one's home country, so the only other way to India from anihC is through tebiT (illegally) and then Nepal.

I have read about people doing -35 (Celsius) in places like Kyrgyzstan before, but I really need to know more.

Does anyone have any recommendations as to what I should wear. I'm thinking something like amazingly warm socks, good waterproof boots, thermal leggings, mountaineering trousers, 2 or 3 thermal tops and a gore-tex jacket, under-gloves, waterproof snow gloves, ski goggles for snow storms and wind on the 5,000m plateau and a nice Russian-style hat.

Does anyone have any experience in temperatures well below zero? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I learned that there is one thing that everyone wants done and no one wants to do: WEEDING. In small towns, I have found that just by talking to locals, you can easily find someone who is not only willing, but ecstatic to pay 10 dollars per hour to have their weeding done. Often this will be a mother with a baby in hand, who has a garden suffocating in bindweed. 

Some may still be put off by this, but I can tell you with complete honesty that I have only had positive experiences with this. The exchange feels totally mutual--you are providing for them a service, and they are providing you with the ability to keep going. It is an excellent way to spend a rest day, and you will often leave with sixty dollars, a full belly (almost every time they have invited me to eat dinner with their family), and a new friend/pen pal.

I recently got into bicycle touring last year and have been taking a few small 1-2 day trips around the bay area. One thing I realized is that when I ride (fully-loaded or not), I still seem to be slower than most of the other cyclists on the road. This could be due to my surly lht being heavier than a lot of the other bikes, but it's been bugging me as of late. 

2 weeks ago I was riding in Big Sur along Highway 1, and I felt like I was pissing off a lot of cars. I was working hard up those hills, but the bike lane was small at times and I had to venture out in the main lane. After a few close calls, I felt like it was necessary to move closer to the shoulder. But because of that, I wiped out on some gravel while I was travelling downhill and a big chunk of my helmet broke off. Ever since then, I've been pretty nervous about riding on the road at all... 

Anyone have any suggestions for me on how to get more comfortable with this? I don't want to stop touring, but I want to make sure I'm following all the right rules. Is there a minimum speed? Any ideas why I might be slower than others? What's weird is that I'm a marathon runner and I'm pretty fit, so it was weird for 50-60 year old men pass me with such ease.

I recently returned from cycling the Great Ocean Road in Australia. This was my second attempt at bicycle touring and my first time to camp while touring. It was a short trip of four days, but it was extremely rewarding and quite an amazing experience. 

I did this on a crappy single speed bike that I bought used for A$150 and with the cheapest camping gear that I could find. I learned that you don't need fancy gear, a lot of money or too much experience. The hills were steep, the rain was wet, the air was fresh and the experience was real! I advise anyone considering bicycle touring to just go for it!

Anyway, here are some pictures for your viewing pleasure! There are 14 of them.

General notes: BC and the Okanagan valley were HOT, 34C / 93F.  The temperature only dropped after Field BC / Yoho National Park.

It was my first time in the mountains and I learned that 10km/h (6 mph) is a comfortable speed when going up hill for 7 hours (Allison Pass).  Gearing of 53/39, 11-27 is low enough.

The guide book mentioned a gas station atop Roger's Pass, and that station is closed, while a hotel and [restaurant](http://www.flickr.com/photos/63056612@N00/6164976332/in/set-72157627585605629) have opened up instead. :)  That place seems to be a neat meeting point for cyclists.  As I was pulling in 3 cyclists who were headed in the opposite direction (West from Toronto to Vancouver) were getting ready to leave.  We chatted for a bit and exchanged notes about the road ahead/behind.  As I was pulling out, I saw another touring cyclist stop in, and on the down hill ride I saw 6 more touring cyclists going up.

Throughout the route traffic is fairly consistent (and loud) with a car going by every few seconds, so cycling more than an hour after sunset isn't safe.
I tried riding later than that one night and it was frustratingly slow and got two flats due to unseen debris.  On that one late ride, I had to wait a long time (minutes)
for a break in traffic before I could even attempt going through any sharp left hand bends in the road.  (Speeding motorists sometimes drift into the shoulder).

***

I had 6 flats (much higher than previous tours) 3 of which were due to hitting hard to see stones on the road while heading downhill at 77 km/h / 48mph.

I only brought 5 tubes and spent much of the time on Day 3 looking for replacements tubes and a spare tire to replace the spare tire I had to use.

On Sunday 8 of 8 bike stores in Kelowna were closed, 3 of 3 bike stores in Vernon were closed, 2 backpacker/outfitter stores didn't have bike parts, Canadian Tire and WalMart didn't have presta tubes or 700c tires.  The bike store in Revelstoke didn't have long stem tubes.  In Golden one bike store was closed due to vacation ""Sept 6th through 26th"", while the other bike store was closed for renovations.  So in general the only bike stores that were open when I was there were in Vancouver and Jasper (end points of the journey).

On the bright side, I flagged down a driver and she let me take a tube out of a bike she had mounted in the rear rack. :)  It was useful the next day.

Also while in Golden BC I was feeling a bit indulgent so had a $27 rack of lamb for lunch and sat there in the restaurant looking out the window.  At the end of the meal a cyclist on a Cervelo rode by I ran out of the restaurant and started shouting for him to stop.  The waitress must have had a heart attack when she saw me run. ;) Well, the cyclist had a spare tube which he graciously gave me.  I went back to the restaurant and explained my good luck.

***

On the bright side my left pedal seized up completely 32 km out of Kelowna, and I was overjoyed when it happened because I was carrying a backup set of pedals whose weight was unwelcome on the first 2 days of climbing.

I didn't want to ride much after sunset (~19:20) and I was sleeping in every day (except the first) so generally getting on the road at 10:30 so I didn't have much time most days.  The hunt for tubes on day 3 meant I didn't start riding that day until roughly 13:00.

I was way behind schedule (230km) by Day 5 and had to catch a train the next day.  I could only make up the distance if I rode at night.  I knew traffic wouldn't make it fun, plus I only had one spare tube, and the ride would be on the ""Icefields Parkway"" so the temperature would be at or below freezing over the entire night.  Yeah.  Not fun.  So I caved (safety before pride) and rented a car in Lake Louise.  On the plus side I got some nice pictures on that route and I stopped just before a 2050 meter 6700 ft summit and gave a much appreciated sealed bottle of Gatorade to a cyclist who was [climbing that section](http://maps.google.ca/?ll=52.179853,-117.062759&amp;spn=0.020526,0.055747&amp;t=p&amp;z=15&amp;vpsrc=6).


All in all it was a good tour.

I think disc brakes are the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm in the market for a commuter mule (trekking bike as they say here in Germany) and I've noticed that the market is split between disc and rim, even on the higher quality bikes. I was appalled to find high end bikes with hydraulic rim brakes. If you're gonna go the hassle of hyrdo, why waste it on the rim? I'm welcoming to ideas and opinions on why it might be that rim brakes still have a stronghold on the upper echelon of bikes.

No hard feelings on rim brakes, but it sucks finding a bike I really like and then noticing it's got v-brakes. If there is a good reason as to why they spec them, I may be open to having them. Is there anything specific to touring that makes rim brakes more desirable?",,False,,t5_2sdwm,False,,,True,t3_1e5k5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1e5k5g/why_are_rim_brakes_so_popular_still_xpost_from/,

Myself and a friend are looking in to touring through Sweden and Norway in September and with the route about it will be roughly 3,600miles.

Got some questions and posting this here to get some sage advice.  

The route above has us cycling all the way and getting the euro tunnel through to France but we have been thinking about getting a ferry from Hull through to Sweden or Norway.  What would you suggest?

We would like to be doing up to 100 miles a day with very light camping equipment, we are both very fit cyclists and will be doing a whole lot more training to get ourselves ready.

Is the weather good at this time of year?

Can we wild camp? I have done the highlands of Scotland and that was acceptable.

We are looking at cycling for about a month so we may have to make the route smaller.

Where should we go in Sweden and Norway? The only thing I have on my list is Oslo as my great grandad is from there and I take after him so would really like to go!  We're just looking at getting out in to the sticks.

We are going to have to get the most amount of calories we can daily so our lunches are going to be very important.

Finally, the other person cycling is still after a bike, I have an audax bike which is definately up for the task and I have shown him, Dawes touring bikes, audax bikes like mine, surly touring bikes and other road bikes which have all the bolts for panniers/mudguards.

Hopefully you can get a whole lot more out of this than I'm currently thinking of.",,False,,t5_2sdwm,False,,,True,t3_1617y9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1617y9/touring_in_norway_and_sweden_from_england/,

Most rain gear (sub $500 for a set) seems useless for extended riding, as the rain finds a way in, or the sweat just collects.  Though if I'm wrong, any thoughts on that subject are welcome.

This is a trip that would start in the early spring of the PacNW and end, ultimately, in Maine (hence the thermals).  I'm looking at avoiding most civilization, so I'm not sure how often I'll get a chance to stop somewhere a dry my clothes.

Everything but the outer pants would be Merino Wool, probably from Minus33, as I've really liked their products and they should help cut down on weight/size.  I'm still up in the air on outershell pants.  I have one pair of Kuhl Renegades that I've been extremely impressed with, but their other products seem slightly heavier and less quick-drying.  Any recommendations there would be helpful, especially if it's something that I can zip off for a pair of shorts.

I know this is a topic that's been discussed... often (I've been a member of this subreddit for nearly 2 years), but it's usually a footnote of someone's gear and I'm having trouble finding many comments that match up.

Most every GPS tracking app I've found wants to track you in real time, updating every 2 seconds, and that would just drain my phone's battery in a couple hours.  I'm looking for one that would only upload every 30-60 minutes, conserving battery power.  

I'd even be happy with a online map website that I would need to text /email my GPS location to for it to update, that way I could do it 1-3 times a day.

The SPOT Satellite device does something close to what I want, it will update your location every 10 minutes on a map but it uses its $120 satellite device and $100/year service plan to do it instead of just a smartphone app.  I'm fine if I can't update because I'm not in cell range.  

Does anyone have any recommendations?


--EDIT--

OK, so I finally found what I was looking for, well, close enough anyways.  I downloaded the Android App Backitude (Google Latitude is included on my phone's Google Maps) and set it up so it would only update my location when I manually updated it.  Backitude has a widget to ""fire off an update"" as it's called, so you can place a shortcut on your smartphone's desktop so it's just a button press away.

But Google Latitude is kind of annoying because only your ""friends"" can see where you currently are, and I wanted to be able to display this information on a public website.  Luckily, Google also produced a ""Google Public Location Badge"" which is a few lines of code you can drop into a webpage and it will show a little map zoomed in to where your last location update was.  You can get it here --&gt; https://latitude.google.com/latitude/b/0/apps

I also found a wordpress widget that does exact what I wanted, it will show a map with your location history on it, but its only for wordpress and I'll probably just stick with what I'm currently using.  Here it is if anyone else is interested --&gt; http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-latitude-history/

I will be travelling solo and pretty light with a 32ltr pair of panniers on the back (arriving later today) and staying in hostels on the way.
have basic breakdown here,-
blois ~35miles
limoges~ 140miles 
brive~ 65 miles
cahors~ 65 miles 
toulouse~ 75 miles
foix~ 55 miles
berga~ 85 miles
barcelona~ 75miles
-note the first day i will probably just get train out of paris to Orleans to save the hassle of cycling out of the city
basic route stuck into [bikely](http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/paris-barca-1)

so firstly im stuck on what bike i take initially i was set on taking my road bike, but thinking about it more my head says the hybrid would be better choice, atm rb has 700x25c tyres, hybrid has 35c that are a bit knobbly. pic of them both http://i.imgur.com/O4EOI.jpg?1 (will swap the clip-in peddles over if i go with hybrid)
main worry with road bike is it not being able to handle weight of panniers/heard that it will kill my knees going up in the Pyrenees  since gears wont go easy enough also im not the most comfortable descender at the best of times due to a bad crash couple of months ago and with the added weight on the back fearing i will not be able to enjoy going down any hills due to being scared to death! 
one last thing is the clearences on the brakes with the road bike make it hard to fit mud guards are they necessary ? if i take the hybrid i will probably fit some, but on the road bike i will just wing it and hope for some nice weather.

anything other info about maybe nice roads to take since route isn't stuck in stone/good places to stay on the way, also as i am doing this ride solo something to ease my mind that i will be fine on my own would also be welcome ;)


thanks !                                                                       
  
**edit**- thanks for replies.  
Leading on another thing is my parents are a bit worried of me going on my own to say the least, im confident ill be fine and can look after myself pretty well, but are there any things i should be wary of while touring on my own- also to keep their mind at ease what sort of plan would you have if something did go wrong how to contact people back home, i mean carrying lots of id with important numbers i suppose is obvious thing is there anything else i can do??",,False,,t5_2sdwm,1344017230.0,,,True,t3_xm98p,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/xm98p/couple_of_questions_about_touring/,

Saturday morning: mediumcore do 40km, meet the softcore at a train station. We then did another 20km, lunch, another 20, winery, then camp, then pub.

Sunday morning: breakfast out, 30km, then lunch at a winery. Then we split up: softcore did 10km to the nearest station, the rest of us did another 40km to a different station.

(Warning, I waffle a lot, go read the tldr)

For the last few months I've been thinking about buying a bike as a means for transportation and getting myself in shape. Then, a week before Christmas, while Browsing bike related corners of the internet, I came across a blog (and subsequently many more blogs) documenting someones adventures as they toured all over the world and I felt inspired.

I fantasized about loading up a bike with camping gear, setting off into the unknown and having an adventure, with the freedom to go where I want and do what I want to do, all while eliminating two of the major costs of travel - accommodation and transportation.

The idea became an obsession and I soon found myself reading everything I could online about touring, wild camping, bikes and everything inbetween. And then it hit me; I could actually do this. I could get of my arse and go do something cool. *What?!* screamed my inner procrastinator. *Go outside? Do activities? What's gotten into you? You haven't ridden a bike in five years, there's no way you can make this work!*

But I'm going to ignore that devilish voice (that is esponsible fo the fact I'm posting here rather than revising for my imminent exams) and cycle through Europe this summer, camping for free whenever I can and staying in hostels in the cities I want to explore. 

So I've been trailing round all the bike shops in my area asking questions, seeing what I could conceivably purchase with my recently bulging bank account (student loans ftw) and test riding bikes. I've mainly been looking at dedicated touring bikes and really like the [Dawes Horizon](http://www.dawescycles.com/p-599-horizon.aspx), so much so that I very nearly bought one yesterday after a test ride.

While I was waiting for pedals to be put on the Horizon so I could take it for a spin the seller recommended I consider the [Dawes Clubman](http://www.dawescycles.com/p-596-clubman.aspx) an Audax bike that he described as faster, lighter, more fun to ride when not loaded with gear (which I will be doing a lot when not touring), and more than capable of handling a tour of europe so long as I'm not taking the kitchen sink with me. 

I was a bit wary as I've got it into my head that I need a dedicated tourer, where words like strong, sturdy and bombproof are more likely to come up than light or fast, so I didn't take it for a test ride (but plan to next time!). I've been wondering, since I got home, if I wasn't a bit hasty dismissing it. I love the retro look and I did test a road bike that was exceedingly fun but not practical for what I want; could the Clubman strike a balance between them? I also think I may be being too cautious, because I will be trying to travel as lightly as I can, while still camping. 

My problem is I don't know very much about bikes, and would like these questions answered by someone who isn't trying to sell me anything.

1. Would the [Clubman](http://www.dawescycles.com/p-596-clubman.aspx) be capable of touring Europe with a reasonable but not excessive load?
2. What sort of load would each bike be capable of carrying? (I weigh about 75kg)
3. Can you personally reccommend either of these bikes?
4. Which one would you choose and why?

Thanks!


**TLDR;**

I am an inexperienced cyclist and I want a bike for cycling daily around my city, fitness, and touring europe in the summer, I'm almost sure I want [this](http://www.dawescycles.com/p-599-horizon.aspx) bike but [this](http://www.dawescycles.com/p-596-clubman.aspx) one looks awesome and is faster, but is it up to touring?

If I take my mountain bike, I will take some days off to ride trails. That is a plus but not necessary. This will be my first long tour, so I'm not sure if my choose of bike will seriously hamper me or not. 

I am on a relatively tight budget for outfitting my tour completely and while I'd like to purchase a new bicycle specifically for touring, I don't think I have more than a thousand for my bicycle and cargo system. When I was looking at touring bicycles, it seemed like they were around a thousand or more for everything included, most being even more.

I already own a [Motobecane Fantom Elite](http://www.motobecane.com/ds/feds.html) with a full suspension that can be locked out. It is around 30 pounds for the bicycle itself without any extras such as bags, tools and extras. I do have slick tires already on it and have done day trips on the bike. In those cases it was a comfortable but slow ride. After reading the necessary elements of a touring bike, I'm under the very firm impression that it can stand of to the riggers of the task except for cargo space. I can't credit card and probably can't go ultralight, so I'll need the space of a trailer.

The two trailers I have my eye on are the BOB Ibex and the Burly Nomad. The Ibex because of the ability to go on some trails and the Nomad because its general features. Also if I was to go with a trailer and changed my mind about the bicycle after a few day trips, I have more options of bicycles at a cheaper price. I'm not really considering cheaper bicycles for a fully loaded purpose, I'm too concerned about abusing my investment. The use of a trailer alleviates this.

The mountain bike and the trailer is the cheapest and preferable option for me, but I can also do a cheaper bike and trailer without abusing it too much.

Now I will have around four to five months of ""free"" time before I start college again. So I was thinking of touring home from either my current base MCAS Beaufort, SC or MCRD San Diego, CA back home to MN. I know that going the fastest rout would be around 1,500 miles, but I want to do a 2k. Meaning I would have to add some extra destinations.

For the bicycle I am looking at currently is the Surly Long Haul Trucker. With front and rear panniers. For pedals I was thinking of SPD compatible pedals that are both clipless and platform. The SPD seems to be a better way to go since there are more selection on the road if something were to go wrong. Also if something were to go wrong with the clipless I could still use the platform side of the pedal.

An odd idea that I have is to record the trip using a gopro hero2. Then at the end of the trip make a long time lapse video. I understand the gopro has about two in a half hour battery life. What I was thinking is combining a dynamo with a solar panel to power it throughout the trip. Maybe have a few extra batteries too. Then every night use my netbook to transfer the files to an external hard drive.

This would be my first long tour also. I cannot buy the bicycle for a few more months too. I was wondering were you can have drop off points for food? Also how do you replenish water when you are out of a city for over three days at a time? How do you stay away from being bored on the ride? Lastly where are some great locations to visit while on a tour?

I'm about to go on a six week tour and I'm taking several electronical devices with me.

-I have a Garmin Oregon 550 GPS with topographical maps of Europe which makes planning beforehand easier (I'm traveling through Spain, France, Belgium and Holland)

-I have a Samsung 551 smartphone for making photos and incidental phonecalls/emails. The camera isn't great but suffices. I'm not planning on making tons of pictures.

-My iPod (Classic, 6th gen, 160GB) holds ~70GB of music.
I could put some movies/series on it, but I haven't yet.
Although 'unnecessary' I like to cycle with music on.
Maybe not all the time, but being on tour for six weeks, solo, I figured I'd take it with me. I use Apple earbuds with the small, handy remote controls, so i can change tracks and volume while cycling.

-For charging, I bought the Biologic Reecharge Power Pack.
Connected to my hubdynamo it should be able to charge forementioned devices via usb without any problems. I installed it only yesterday, so I wonder if it works properly.

I can't think of anything else I need, and in total, this doesn't take up too much space. I read of people bringing their 17"" notebooks, GoPro- and single-lens reflex cameras, and others taking nothing that would require electricity.

This is difficult, but the 3 greatest highlights of the trip would probably be:

1. Coromandel Peninsula, North Island--Beautiful coastline, amazing beaches (Hahei/Hotwater Beach).

2. West Coast, South Island--Wet and buggy as Hell, but there's something awesome about standing on the beach with sand between your toes, looking up at the Southern Alps.

It's a 42cm [Gravity Liberty CXD from bikesdirect.com](http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/liberty_cxd.htm). I live in San Diego, so I'm going to bike home from Seattle in about a month. My decision on my touring bike was for a few reasons. It has a carbon fiber fork, it's disc brake compatible, it's burly enough for cyclocross so it should be just fine for touring, and it's inexpensive. I came up on a set of Bontrager Duster 29er wheels. They've got a bead width of 23mm, and I've got 'em wrapped with 35c Schwalbe Marathon Supremes. The combo makes for a comfortable ride, they've got impressive grip, and the rolling resistance is surprisingly lower than I would've expected for such a fat tire. I removed the junk Tektro brake system with Avid BB7 Road calipers, HS1 rotors, EBC gold pads, and compressionless brake housing. The brake modulation and stopping power, even when loaded is amazing. I kept the inline brake levers on the flats of the handlebars for brake access when on them. I kept it 8sp with the Shimano 2300 series brifters, I love them because the release is at the thumb. Some might question the durability of such an entry level brifter, but I've rocked the same ones on my road bike for 3 years now. I replaced the crank with an FSA Tempo 165mm crank set, better than the Lasco 172.5mm cranks. I replaced the 2300 series derailleurs with a 105 rear and a Tiagra front. I replaced the SunRace cassette with a Hyperglide 32-12, a solid range for climbing speed. I put on a Bontrager RXL carbon seat post to soften the ride of the aluminum frame. 1.5l water bottle carrier with a Camelback tube n mouth piece. It only leaks when the bike is on its side. For a rear rack, I got a Top Peak child carrier disc compatible rack. It attaches to the frame at 6 points, and is over-designed to handle a fragile human life, so I figger it's burly enough for about 60lbs of gear in the Ortlieb bags. One last thing I did to it is put on some SKS Longboard fenders to keep the wet Northwest roads off of me.

4 pounds, 3 season, 2 person, 1 pole

Made of the highest quality rip stop polyurethane coated nylon. 29sq feet of sleeping space, 17.5 sq feet of vestibule. This guy sets up very very fast and is very very storm proof. It has 2 doors and 2 vestibules. You can grab some stuff or go pee without disturbing your partner! It attributes its weight to being mostly mesh which has the added benefit of being very cool when it gets too hot. Also, the condensation rolls down the fly instead of dripping into the tent. My personal experience with this tent has been 100% positive and ever since I first saw it I knew I had to get one. Since my Flint 2 was stolen in Italy, I now have the opportunity to upgrade.

Finally went and purchased it today on sale for 263 at Bob Wards

We're planning a tour from Toronto to Winnepeg for our first tour together (me and my husband) for next summer. It will be my second lengthy tour and his first, with oodles of short tours, a few over nights and a week here and there. 

I have never ridden with another person before so I am a bit nervous. Does it get competitive or do you get into sync pretty quickly? What about when one person is a stronger cyclist than the other? 

I did Brisbane to Cairns and back down to Bundaberg along the coast of Australia, closing in on 5000km by the end of it with a few side tracks. Learned a heck of a lot but more than half of that was just through sheer mind power and getting past the exhaustion and frustration of making a terrible map choice haha That's all internal though, how do you keep it together with a partner who is probably equally frustrated? 

This one is just over 2000 so I think it's a good start. We're taking all of July and August so we can stop and camp out at a few national parks and really enjoy the views. This is sortof his introduction to Canada.

Going with panniers this time (doubt I'll ever use a trailer again). We're planning this far ahead so he can build up his endurance and balance with full panniers. Camping out on crown land for the majority, when we find the big parks we'll rent a camp site for a few nights.  I'm pretty decent at finding hidden camp sites for that peace of mind at night.

Anyone done this route before?

Hand built in the shop in our backyard, these two dudes are making beautiful trailers and front racks.  Built from the ground up with quality materials and craftsmanship, they live and breath bikes.  One is a lead bike mechanic at a local bike co-op who's been bike touring his whole life, the other is a sometimes frame builder and courier who has dreams of making tubular tires and crafting his own bike shoes.  In short, they know what they're doing.

[www.fftouring.com](http://www.fftouring.com/)

From their site:
&gt;Our goal is to make sensible equipment to allow you and your bicycle to have a nice time together, at home and on the road. We have found bike touring that a healthy dose of minimalism combined with smart weight distribution and flexible cargo options makes  for comfortable and fun riding day after day, week after week, riding solo or in a group.
For that dose of minimalism, We have been inspired by the PCT thru-hikers and the amazing array of handmade and DIY gear that is to be found on the internet.

Cool thing about the trailer: as it attaches to the seatpost it handles really well and doesn't put the strain on the rear dropouts or chainstay as many other trailer designs do.  Furthermore, it enables you to take your fancy roadbike on a tour without needing a rack or having to fear that the extra weight is going to lead to breakdowns.

What are your thoughts reddit?

(Especially interested in advice from female tourers),14,4,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/14qk4n/the_list_help_especially_interested_in_advice/,"Planning my first tour - Southern Tier from Florida to California, to begin on New Years Day.  Weather will range from cold (2500m elevation gain) to just right to possible warm/hot.  Mainly, I think, the weather will be just right (please tell me if I'm wrong).  

I'm a solo female tourer so I particularly welcome advice from women.  But any advice is greatly appreciated.  


Anyway.  My list:  

**Sleeping**

* Tent (yet to be decided/purchased - recommendations very welcome.  I'm looking for a roomy one man or crowded two man - something that will allow two people, if necessary, but will mainly be used for me and my stuff.  Oh, and a small pack size, 12-15in would be ideal, but up to 20in)

* Sleeping bag

* Sleeping pad

* no pillow (I will use my towel/clothes)


**Hygiene**

* toothbrush

* toothpaste

* multi-use soap (I read about one here, can't remember the name of it right now - it's designed for skin as well as dishes, and anything else, really.  And it's biodegradable.  Help?)

* micro terry towel

* small face towel

* TP

* sun screen

* toner

* hand sanitizer

* clothes line

* bug spray

* tampons (ladies - anyone use the luna cup?)


**Navigation**

* ACA maps

* Compass

* (phone, if necessary)


**Storage**

* [40 L panniers](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Cycling/PanniersBagsRacks/Panniers/PRD~5024-314/mec-world-tour-2-40l-cycling-panniers.jsp)

* zip lock bags

* bungee cords

* anything I'm overlooking?


**Safety**

* pepper spray

* bike lock

**Clothes**

Bottoms:

* black cycling skort

* black cycling tights 

* rain pants

Tops:

* black wicking tank top

* gray cycling tank top

* black spandex beater w built in sports bra - the only thing I've got that gives me added support, but it's super 
thick (for a beater) and I haven't decided if I want to take it - advice?  

* blue underarmour long sleeve turtle neck/base layer

* fleece

* rain jacket

Underwear:

* socks - 2/3 wool pair, 4 ankle socks (in non-cold weather, I'll be in sandals.  I like my feet to breathe)

* a weeks worth of underwear (too much?  It's so small..)

* Bikini

* Bras: bikini top (quick drying and versatile - also wicked comfy), a racerback convertible and maybe a regular bra.  

*Aside*: any ladies here have a big chest?  I'm not planning on taking any sports bras, as they rarely help and the ones that do are crazy expensive.  I've never had a problem on my bike in a regular bra.  What's your experience been?  


Shoes:

* black merrel/vibrim sneakers

* flip flops OR merrel sandals.  Don't know yet - advice?  

Other:

* LBD for out and about in civilization

* Hat - do I need one?  


**Bike Related** (on the *To Do* list for this week is learn some bike maintenance at a shop - once I do that, I'll have a better idea of what I need, so this is subject to change)

* tool kit

* spare tube or two

* gloves (for cleaning/repair)

* rag

* lights

* helmet

* riding gloves - do I need them?  I've never had a problem.  The longest I've been on a bike is 3 days/200km.  


**Eating**

* fork/spoon

* cup/bowl/plate

* hydration system (bottles - probably 1x1L bottle and 2x2L bottle - 5L total.  Is that enough?)

* knife

* [Trangia Mini](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/CookwareUtensils/Cookware/PRD~4000-918/trangia-mini-stove-with-cookset.jsp)

Food:

* buckwheat (my favorite grain)

* olive oil?  what oil would you recommend?

* salt/sugar

* tea

* any other things I should bring with me, instead of picking up along the way?  On the whole, what do you do, by way of food, usually?  I'll be on the cheap, so can't go out to eat every day.  


**Medical**

* allergy meds

* inhaler

* pain killers

* disposable gloves

* bandaids/gauze

* disinfectant

* wrap thingy for sprains

* glasses


**Comfort/Other**

* Phone &amp; charger

* Netbook &amp; charger (debating this - any advice?)

* headphones

* camera &amp; charger &amp; SD cards

* nook &amp; charger

* journal

* pens

* guestbook (for people I meet along the way to write notes for me)

* sunglasses

* headlamp

* sarong

* duct tape (it's like the force... it has a light side and a dark side and it holds the universe together)




I think that's it.  Any and all help is greatly appreicated!  Thanks!!

edit: spelling and formatting

edit 2:  added at the recommendations of you lovely people: 

* bike pump

* handlebar bag

edit 3: so many people are recommending not bringing the netbook.

I would start by moving out of the Appalachians and towards the coast, perhaps through Raleigh, N.C. and than following the coast the rest of the way. It looks like there are hostels the majority of the way. 

 I have a good bit of experience with winter hiking (including sleeping in sub zero degree weather) but none with winter touring. I think as long as I get to lower altitudes before heading North it will be fine. Any advice on this matter? Advice on gear or if anyone has experience, advice on routes?

I'm thinking it would be fun to do next year. I've never done any long distance cycling, and an organized event like this wouldn't be too bad - they feed you snacks and carry your gear and arrange sleeping locations. What sort of training and equipment would I need for something like this? My bike is probably not set up for this (10 speed Benotto from the early 70s). I'm planning on getting involved in one of the weekly rides that departs from near where I live.
