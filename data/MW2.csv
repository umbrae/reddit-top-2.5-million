Those of you who have played with me, you have probably noticed that I don't talk normally - I do have a lisp (birth defect) which is quite noticeable and embarrassing sometimes. I would also like to say NOT ONE REDDITOR has even ASKED me about it. I was quite shocked and surprised no one said a word to me about it, and totally ignored it.

Now, tonight, I get put in a Ground War lobby with a bunch of little annoying kids who are all 10th Prestige and bragging about it (wonder how they got that), when one decides to target me. This is exactly what he said to me:

**""WHAZZA MATTER WITH YOU DUUUUUDE? YOU GOT DOWN SYNDROME? I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS DUDE BUT YOUR TALKING IS LIKE ALL FUCKED UP, WHAT THE FUCK GOT MILK""**

I couldn't even respond to that. To be so insulting as to call me out on it then ask if it's Down Syndrome? Then:

**""HEY EVERYONE! EVERYONE! GUESS WHAT? GOT MILK HAS DOWNS SYNDROME! HA HA HA HE'S GOT DOWNS HA HA HA GOT MILK HAS DOWNS""**

Rinse and repeat for the next 5 minutes or so.

This is why I fully endorse complete banning of kids off of Xbox Live until they are 18 years old. I have never heard such insulting madness from anyone on Xbox Live, until today.

1. The red dot on your radar which shows the location of an enemy is dimmer if the enemy is under something. That is, there must be an accessible point above the enemy. So if you're wondering whether a guy is inside a building or on the roof, see if the dot is bright or dim.

2. The big warehouse by A on Quarry can see just about the entire map. It is perfect for sniping and picking off people at long range.

3. Holding down a position is not camping. Sitting in a random corner waiting for people to walk by is. If you're afraid you're camping, consider this: if you can't be paid back easily, you aren't camping. As soon as I get killed by a camper, I know exactly how to kill him. Camping is not a good strategy, but it annoys people because it's just fucking annoying to get killed by a little bitch waiting in a corner. Staying in a building killing people out of windows, however, is not camping; it's how you win the game.

4. The FAL is a 2 hit kill within range even without stopping power.

5. FMJ does not make your bullets hurt more. It just decreases the amount of damage they lose going through surfaces.

6. Silencer + heartbeat sensor = deadly

7. Don't neglect LMGs. I recently started using the L86 and I currently have more kills with it than any other gun this prestige. It will not lose in a head on engagement, and it can devastate multiple enemies. Just don't try to run and gun with it, and use bursts to get longshots. LMGs do not decrease in damage over range, and their only disadvantage to assault rifles is the lack of mobility. As long as you don't try to run around and you just stick to holding down positions, no assault rifle can match your firepower.

1287511442.0,49,self.MW2,dtfin,A warning about GameBattles,62,13,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dtfin/a_warning_about_gamebattles/,"**tl;dr My team submitted indisputable proof of our win in round 1 of the summer season playoffs and it was completely ignored by GB admins.**

Those of you who may be thinking about playing competitively on gamebattles, I'd like to issue a word of caution.

The Method (the team I'm on) played our first full season this past summer. We did pretty well for a new team, and even made it to the playoffs at the end of the season. However, in the first round of the playoffs, something incredibly unjust and absurd happened. We were supposed to play a team (Habitual Killers) who ended the season somewhere around 30th on the ladder (we were just shy of 100th). We set up the lobby, invited their leader, and were about to start the game, but they didn't have 4 players available. The rules for the playoffs state that each team must have 4 players to play the match, and if a team shows up without the appropriate number of players, they must forfeit the match. So we waited for the allotted 15 minutes after the match start time (even a little longer), giving them time to try to find another player. They were unable to do so, so we closed the lobby and submitted a ticket requesting their forfeit.

We tried to contact GB live support because we know this team has refs on their roster and might try to cheat the system. They were even bragging before the match that they've never lost a dispute because of this. However, as per usual, GB live support was offline. That shouldn't have been a problem, though, because we submitted a ticket with our proof as well.

But, after waiting a day, we discovered that our ticket had been closed in favor of Habitual Killers, with the following admin message:

""Since the Asst Head Referee went into the match late and your opposing team got a referee under 30 minutes after the scheduled match time I will have to award your opponent with the win.""

So even though we have proof that they only had three people in the lobby (you can even hear them in the video saying they don't have anyone else online) and proof that we allowed more than 15 minutes for them to find another player, they got the win because they contacted a referee first (keep in mind they have referees on their roster/friend's list).

Needless to say, we reopened the ticket and tried to get what we assumed had to be a misunderstanding rectified. But that ticket, too, was closed with the same response. Both myself and the team leader then tried to contact live support, who was finally online. We ended up talking to the admin that closed both tickets in the first place, and he all but said explicitly that our proof didn't matter since the other team contacted a referee first.

If you're interested, here is the proof (the match was scheduled for 9PM EST):

Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFsxpMAucOI

Photo: http://i.imgur.com/UoTBB.jpg

Team leader's convo with admin: http://i.imgur.com/wp47O.png

We contacted the global admins of GB expressing our concern for the poor administration of the site, and one responded saying he agreed with the decision made by the admin. During that conversation, our team leader made a very fitting analogy, to which (as far as I know) the global admin made no response:

&gt; There are three people in a room. Person A, Person B and Person C. Person A kills Person C. Person B witnesses the crime and attempts to call the police. The police are unavailable at that time so person B gets to work compiling as much evidence as possible to show his innocence and to present it to the police when they become available.

&gt; While person B is busy compiling the evidence for the police to show Person A is at fault, Person A gets in contact with the police. Person A tells the police that Person B is responsible for the murder of Person C. The police ignore all evidence presented by person B and place person B under arrest solely because Person A contacted them first.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, but I just thought some of you might be interested to know that the GB administration can be highly unprofessional.

P.S. Just to be clear, none of us are butthurt about losing or anything. We honestly expected to lose round 1 anyway, and we probably would have had we actually played the match. We're just dumbfounded and outraged by this sheer lack of professionalism from the site that's backed by MLG (and really the only site where you can play competitive CoD).

Maybe we can all add to this list and make it something that is worth reading? What things have you learned while playing MW2? It can be map-specific or game-specific etc or just a weapon tip. I'll get the ball rolling and I'll add to it as others contribute.


## List of MW2 Tips

- Try not to use the mounted miniguns too much. If you've a group of enemies right across from you, then by all means, let it rip. But if you're firing it and just hoping to get lucky, then you're putting yourself at risk. The minigun basically puts a bullseye on your back. The entire enemy team will know where you are and consider you a quick and easy kill. 

- I'm not sure about the other sniper rifles, but the .50 cal and the Intervention are both one shot kills WITHOUT Stopping Power. In regular mode (i.e. not Hardcore mode), thermal scopes are all the rage and using Cold Blooded will usually give you that extra bit of an advantage when going against other snipers (not to mention the fact that you won't have to worry as much about enemy killstreaks smoking your ass). Do note however that your secondary weapon might not be as powerful. Consider the map size etc before choosing one or the other.

- If a claymore detonates, the blast is focused towards the direction of the red sensors. This means that you can stand behind a claymore and safely shoot it. This also means that you should try and estimate  what direction your enemies will be coming from before just plopping a claymore down in any old place.

- Using Marathon and Lightweight will allow you to escape the blast of a claymore (in regular mode - not tested in HC), IF you continue sprinting right on past. This has worked on even well-placed claymores (an often rare occurrence).

- Claymores go hand in hand with the perk ""Scavenger"" if you're trying to hold down a position, as Scavenger will allow you to refill your equipment from the dead. Note that you can only have TWO claymores on the map at any given time. This means that when you place a third claymore down, the first claymore that you placed will automatically detonate. Keep this in mind for Hardcore modes, as I've sometimes killed my team mates doing this.

- In HC mode, you should always try to use a silencer. It has little to no effect on the damage of your gun. Contrary to popular opinion, there IS a map on HC mode. You just have to press the Start button to bring it up. Whenever I hear and unsilenced weapon, I immediately press Start to bring up my map and see where it's coming from. Cold blooded is also a VERY good perk in HC modes. Besides not showing up on UAVs, you're pretty much safe from enemy killstreaks. Also note that Stopping Power is useless on HC modes.

- In regular mode, you should TRY to use a silencer (depends on the gun). It really does help when you're flanking opponents.

- Those who quick scope efficiently died a WHOLE LOT while learning. Keep that in mind.

- On shotguns such as the Spas, it is better NOT to aim down the sigh (ADS). It might take a while to get used to firing shotguns from the hip but you'll thank me for it after a few games. You can use the perk Steady Aim to increase your accuracy, as well as unlock a Grip attachment. If you're wanting to go around ""shotgun only"" (it's fun), I'd suggest using Marathon, as it'll give you that extra bit of flanking power.

- In Search and Destroy, when trying to plant the bomb, try to create a diversion on the bomb site that you won't be planting it on. I sometimes put C4 on a vehicle or some drums and detonate it just as I'm about to plant. Smoke Grenades work a charm too in certain situations. 

- Use a sensitivity level that you're comfortable with. 

- Switching to the Tactical 10 button layout may allow you to pull off drop-shots, but your knifing skills will be affected. A drop shot is basically when you drop to the ground while shooting. It gives you an awesome advantage in one-on-one situations. It does take some time getting used to though.

- A cooked frag grenade is awesome. If you're trying to clear a room, cook the grenade and then throw it in. 

- Playing music through your microphone will get you muted. It will also prevent you from hearing footsteps and other important things.

- If you're using the Scrambler Pro perk just because it extends the time for claymores to detonate (by 3 seconds), try using the Sitrep perk. The Sitrep perk allows you to see claymores, tactical insertions etc through walls. It's also a great perk for hunting Boosters. 

- In FFA, I use the killstreaks Predator, Harrier, Pavelow. Once I get the Predator, I'm basically a shoe in for the rest. And once that Pavelow comes in, it will usually rip people to shreds and most likely win me the game. A silenced weapon in FFA is also a great advantage.

- If you feel as if you shot the other person first. Or if you feel as if your opponents bullets are bending around corners as you attempt to get behind cover, there's a good chance that it's being caused by latency. This could because your connection is slow, you're using a wireless connection or someone is using your connection to watch Youtube videos and torrent. Basically, there are a large number of things that can cause latency.

- Thermal scopes in HC aren't as effective as you'll find that a lot of people are using Cold Blooded (in some instances, the entire team). The popularity of Cold Blooded on HC will also make it harder for you to get kills with your killstreaks. I've gone games where my Predator - Harrier - AC130 combination has gotten me no kills whatsoever.

- Don't run around the map like Rambo unless you're good at running around the map like Rambo. If your KDR is horrible, you're probably (read: you are) doing something wrong.

- When you start a game, be wary of those who will launch noob tubes directly from their spawn point onto yours in the quest to get a few easy kills. This is ESPECIALLY true in game modes such as Search and Destroy. Usually they'll launch them a few feet infront of your spawn point in the hope that you run straight into the blast. There has been times where the rest of my team have been wiped out in one blast because of someone noob tubing the spawn points.

- On the PS3, you can press the L1 button to speed up Predator missiles. Obviously on the XBox, the button is in a similar place.

- If there isn't a UAV up, I usually set my harriers to bomb an area that is furthest away from my team mates as possible. I rarely fail to catch someone when I do this.

- If you get an Ammo care package and you don't need it, try using it as bait (note - if you have idiots on your team, they will probably take it).

- When placing a Sentry gun, make sure that it's not easy for the enemy team to go around and disable it from the back. I see these things being placed in the middle of maps where just about anyone can run up behind it and knife it.

- You should try out going prone while you're sniping. You'll have a great advantage over the other gung-ho snipers standing around like idiots.

- If you're using SP w/ no silencer, which I do all the time, then do a quick risk assessment on a group of enemies. If killing one is going to give your position away to 3 or 4 guys immediately and you're not in a position to get them all, then don't fire. It's not worth it for 1 kill.

- Since you don't have Cold-Blooded, killstreaks will rip you apart. After your first killstreak death, switch to a class with CB until the killstreaks are gone. You'll save yourself, and your team, a lot of deaths.

- Always keep one eye on the radar. If you and all of your team-mates are looking in one direction, the chances are you'll be ambushed from behind with a minute, so turn around and I can guarantee you a few kills.

- At the start of the game, most people will go certain ways on most maps. Go the other way - I find myself going left, with my whole team going right, and getting 4-5 kills right at the start because I'm not caught in a stalemate at the other side of the map.

- If you're using Bling so you can get silencer/noob tube/whatever as well as red dot/holographic sight, take a few games to try using no sight. Using no sight is just as effective with a bit of practise, and either frees you up to use a silencer and noob tube together, or use Scavenger (the best perk imo).

- The Steady Aim perk is extremely hand with assault rifles. It gives you half a second to get a few bullets into your enemy while they're looking down the scope. I've had a LOT of kills using Steady Aim.

- Shoot and move. If you stay in one position for more than 3/4 kills (or more than a minute, two at most) then they will deliberately hunt you down. And, while you're looking forward, you'll be knifed. So move, even if only a few feet, just to catch them off guard.

- The red dot on your radar which shows the location of an enemy is dimmer if the enemy is under something. That is, there must be an accessible point above the enemy. So if you're wondering whether a guy is inside a building or on the roof, see if the dot is bright or dim.

- FMJ does not make your bullets hurt more. It just decreases the amount of damage they lose going through surfaces.

I'll post more as it comes to me. Feel free to post your own or argue against any of my points. I'll add other people's tips to the list.

Basically the following information is compiled from a variety of sources. These include twitter feeds, live blogs, live streams, leaked youtube footage, and frantic shouts from god-knows-what tabs i had open in firefox. As such, not all of this information can be accurate for certain, but i would estimate around 95%+ of what I have down now is correct. 

We anticipated that live video streaming of the multiplayer reveal would be possible, but treyarch decided that no recording would be allowed. As such, the stream of information about black ops was heavily suppressed and it has been rather painful to accumulate even this incomplete set of data. From what I have seen, this is the most comprehensive list of revealed features on the web at the moment. So enjoy, discuss, and feel free to add any links, or correct anything I have posted.

NEW MODES

---Combat Training---

**Four brand new game modes (called Wager Matches)** -- separate from your standard rank progression in multiplayer competitive modes. You ante up and put your COD Points on the line and wager on matches. The top three players split the pot. 

1st = 3000
2nd = 1800
3rd = 1200

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg_8mPoloBo

1. **Sticks and Stones** - you're equipped with a Crossbow and Tomahawk and Ballistic Knife. 
2. **Gun Game** - A series of progressive weapons, from pistol to shotgun to sniper rifle, granted to the player after kills. There are 20 tiers of weapons in this mode.
3. **Sharp Shooter** - all players start with the same randomly selected weapon, which cycles (every minute). So everyone has the same weapon at the same time. 
4. **One in the Chamber** - you have just a pistol with 1 bullet. 1 hit ko's. Each kill gives another bullet. 3 lives.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS FROM GAME PLAYERS:

- ""With damage it’s almost exactly like CoD2""
- Switching Weapons ""feels slower""
- Bullets that hit enemies make a very obvious sound. ""*Makes firing through walls at targets perhaps too easy.*"" from one observer.
- Debates over graphics. One Commentator says they are too ""cartoonish"", others don't see it that way.



UPDATE: UStream is back up at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/We-The-Gamerz-Channel-3 (Cellphone Quality, not very useful at the moment as they are not allowed direct video footage of the game)

UPDATE 2: UStream was shut down again by security.

UPDATE 3: I am adding to all parts of this still pretty solidly. don't forget to refresh and re-read!

UPDATE 4: OK I'm off soon, been at this for around 2 hours. The main things to have emerged are the massive customization options, wager matches and combat training (offline singleplayer in multiplayer maps).

UPDATE 5: I'm back simply because i stumbled across heaps more info. There are reports of people capturing direct feed of gameplay at the event. Hopefully i can post links to high-quality gameplay vids soon.

UPDATE 6: Tried to tidy this messy post a bit. Hopefully it's a bit clearer, less repetition.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_d8i3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/d8i3q/live_text_updates_of_cod_black_ops_multiplayer/,

This weekend, at my daughters second birthday party, my nephew and I decided to play a few matches while everyone was preoccupied with the kids outside. 

Then the shit hit the fan, mom got all mad, that we were playing with kids around and these games promote violence... yada, yada, yada.

So, me being the asshole son I've always been, said ""Don't knock it unless you try it"". I went on about how it could be therapeutic. After a slight pause, she took the controller.

She loved it. She's like, ""Oh my God, the gun fire feels so real!"". She then commenced on what was the most dizzying, funniest, and downright enjoyable MW2 match I've ever seen. She  get one kill. All of us were astonished. 

BTW, my mom is 70. I'm 34.

The [response](http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/g4ehq/do_you_know_of_any_bugs_in_mw2_relating_to/) I got from r/MW2 was fantastic but once the list began to grow, I realised there were many more than I ever imagined. So, I thought it would be best to create an overview to make it as easy as possible for others to find in the future.  
  
There were one or two points relating purely to aesthetics that I haven't included because I was initially looking for things that actually affect gameplay and therefore are useful for players to be aware of. While I have confirmation from r/MW2 for most of these, over time I do intend to test them all out for myself. The final column will be marked with an *X* when I have either personally tested them out or have seen substantial video evidence.  
  
Nevertheless, all of the points below were either submitted by multiple redditors or were found on the [Call of Duty Wiki](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty_Wiki), so we can be pretty confident that the list is accurate. Of course, if there is *still* anything you wish to add, please shout it out.
  
Thanks for everybody's help!

I got so pissed off that I made it my mission to take down all enemy air support. i.e. whenever an enemy harrier strike was called in, I would immediately kill myself and switch to a SOH Cold Blooded Stinger class, just to dash their hopes and dreams of getting high killstreaks. For the next two games, I completely focused my attention on dismantling their air support. It was great - beyond the initial airstrike, their harriers couldn't do shit. And if they managed to bring in a Chopper Gunner, I would take that down pretty quickly too (Sleight of Hand works great with a Stinger). 

Finally, after three games of doing this, they turned on their mics and called me out. By this stage, I was fucking fuming. Not only had they spent the past 3 or 4 games noobtubing everyone; but they had the cheek to question why I was so persistent in taking down their air support. So I replied: ""If you noobtube, I am going to make it my mission to take down your air support."" I even told them that I had been killing myself just to switch to my Stinger class.

In the next game, they **still** decided to use their noobtubes! However, to my delight - a few of my team mates, who must have heard our mid-game conversation, decided to follow my lead and kill themselves, just to switch to anti-air classes whenever enemy air support was called in. They had an AC-130 up at one point, and I think it lasted about 5 seconds.

After the game was over, these bozos got so annoyed that their killstreaks were being taken down that they called me a ""try-hard"" and rage-quit the lobby.

I cover my six with claymores and wait. A lot. And when I kill you and your buddy, I move to my next little hole and wait. Rinse and Repeat.

I know, you hate me. Why would I want to play this game if I'm just going to hang out in one spot and shoot the slow and foolish, right?

Well, here goes. 

First- I play MW2 on a 32 analog TV, with a wireless internet connection split between 6 devices. I can't see you at a distance as well as you can see me, and if I run into you up close you'll win every fight due to lag. I'm doing this because it's the most likely way for me to get kills and have fun.

Second- I have a heart and some respect, I only play team-based or objective gametypes. I won't be lurking around in free-for-all ruining your day. I don't use noobtubes unless it's to finish a challenge, and I'm not a OMA RPG spammer or some bullshit. I'll split your wig legitimately, promise.

Third- What do you think sniper rifles and LMGs are for? Engaging at a distance, area denial, that kinda stuff. Anyone you see running and gunning with a LMG or a sniper rifle out is an idiot or a noob, or quite possibly so badass they need a handicap to give the rest of us mere mortals a chance. Your pick.

Fourth- It actually helps the team. It's the meta-game, dude. If I'm overwatching a spawn point, the enemy can't spawn there. Likewise, my team will spawn on me consistently, and as long as I stay alive and safe, the spawn point stays alive and safe. 

To my team: If I'm not dying, the enemy is not getting points. If I'm covering an area, that's one less place you have to worry about as long as you see that green triangle glowing. If I'm scoped in and protecting the target or defending the flag, you don't have to go running back from whatever epic mega-murder streak you're on to go defend the objective. I got this, homie. And as a bonus? If the other team is stupid enough? I rain Hell on their heads for you from the background with my killstreaks. 

Plus, you know where they're going, time after time: To revenge kill my ass. Hang out, catch them on the way to kill me, I'll happily be the bait.

So there it is, I admit to my crime. Haters gonna hate, so bring it on.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_c2v5l,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c2v5l/confessions_of_a_camper/,

As suggested [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/cg9vv/dear_mw2_have_we_made_any_sort_of_comprehensive/) I've put together a quick register so that we can all find each other more easily. If everyone adds their names and systems, we'll have a one-stop list of people you can add for a good friendly game :)

Register on the form here: http://bit.ly/8ZUcK4

View the register here: http://bit.ly/a8CECh

This was knocked together in about 3 minutes, so let me know if it's broken or otherwise not fit for purpose ;)

EDIT: I've added all the playlists, including hardcore (all the ones listed on http://callofduty.wikia.com anyway). If you want to change your selection, just fill the form in again and I'll delete your duplicate entry.

I'm probably not going to add any more fields - I think we've got most of what people need to know, and now that quite a few people have answered it'd be a right hassle to add more and get people to fill it in again ;)",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_cgcvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/cgcvb/rmw2_player_register/,

As you already know - the Call of Duty subreddits have always been fragmented into separate subreddits, based on particular games in the series. That probably won't change, as it's nice to have game-specific subreddits. However, having a main r/CallofDuty subreddit as the gateway to these other subreddits means that COD-playing Redditors will no longer have to travel from subreddit to subreddit like nomads in the desert. It also means that we have a place to discuss everything about about the series. See a cool Call of Duty 2 video? Want to discuss where the series is heading? Looking for a place to discuss COD 4 strategies? 

Another great advantage of this ""central hub"" is that it unites all Call of Duty players under one banner i.e. The guys from r/mw2, r/codbo and r/mw3 will get to voice their opinion and mingle, regardless of whether they've stopped playing MW2 or Black Ops.

Make sure that you pay [r/CallofDuty](http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/) a visit. We're still working on the design of the subreddit.

1285449205.0,23,self.MW2,div2m,Sniper rifle tips,35,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/div2m/sniper_rifle_tips/,"Back in January, I decided that I wanted to get better with the sniper rifle. I'd go into Free For All games with the Intervention as my primary weapon and the Stinger Missile as my secondary. That way, I'd never have the choice to take the easy way out and switch to a shotgun or a machine gun etc. A few months later, I was winning public FFAs with just the Intervention and coming out on top in Search and Destroy games. Here are a few things that I have learned along the way. Hopefully, some of you will find these useful:

* **TAKE THE SHOT!**. This is the most important thing that I've learned. If you hesitate and try to be uber-careful, then you will most likely fail. I see this all of the time when I am spectating other players in SnD. They scope in, hold their breath, line up the shot and then... chicken out. Instead of actually focusing on taking the shot, their mind begins to wander and they start to worry about what might happen if they miss. Will my team mates make fun of me? Will I give away my position for nothing? Then... when the enemy player is just about to leave their line of sight, they panic, rush to take the shot and more often than not... miss. I have **rarely** seen a procrastinating sniper do well in MW2. What you **should** do is scope in, line it up as quickly as you can and then immediately take the shot. Throw caution to the wind and fire. Let it become a reaction instead of a decision. If you miss, no biggie. Just change up your position and catch out those hunting down the red dot on their radar. You **will** see results just by following this rule. 

* If you're quickscoping, make sure that you take the shot **AFTER** you scope in. Most people (including a lot of random retards in public lobbies) seem to be under the impression that a quick-scope is a shot that is taken before the person fully scopes in. This is because a lot of people watch killcams and see that it *looks that way*. The reason it looks that way is because less Frames Per Second (FPS) are shown in killcams and game winning kills. In reality, the person probably just scoped in **really** quickly and *then* took the shot. The problem with taking a shot before you scope in is that your shot will have the same accuracy of a noscope. This means that it will be largely come down to the distance/luck. So if you're wanting to get better at quickscoping, then you're going to have to scope in first. Over time, you'll get better and quicker and achieve the same ""effect"" (i.e. the killcam/spectate effect).

* This isn't proven by any means, but for some reason, my shots with the Intervention don't seem to be as accurate when I have the Thermal scope equipped. Maybe it's just my imagination?

* When quickscoping, I usually select a sensitivity higher than my default (which is 3). If you're at the default setting, then you should probably push it up to 4 or 5. However, doing this will make it harder for you to get long-range kills. 3 is great with an Assault Rifle. However, when you need to take a dragshot with a sniper rifle, it is horribly lacking.

* A dragshot is when you scope in, drag your scope across an enemy and then take the shot, **really quickly**, just as the scope is passing over your enemy. Aim in as close to the person as possible and then drag the scope in their direction. Then, just as the scope is passing over their body, immediately take the shot. This is great for close encounters. It's also pretty good for long range shots.

* Don't attempt spawn snipes if the players on the other team have a faster connection than you. Usually, it doesn't end well. If it's SnD, I don't see why you should even take the risk. 

* It's best to stick to a specific area when you're using the sniper rifle. You don't have to camp. Instead, you can patrol the edges of the map. Just make sure that you watch your flanks and use a claymore. I used to run into the bunker on Wasteland with my sniper rifle equipped, only to be noobtubed, knifed by commando players, shot by akimbo shotguns and semtex'd. So, one day, I decided to play less aggressively and stick to the edges of the map. I got 30-0 on FFA that day and I haven't lost a FFA on Wasteland since. 

* Sleight of Hand is a **huge advantage**. Seriously. You NEED to be able to scope in quickly, lest you end up in a close combat situation.

* Stopping Power will lessen your chances of getting hitmarkers. If you're using the Intervention (or a bolt action sniper rifle on another COD game), make sure that you're using Stopping Power.

* Steady Aim ISN'T needed for quickscoping or sniping in general. Ninja works just as well. Steady Aim will only help with noscoping.

* If someone on the opposite team is a better sniper, just change classes for the game. Seriously, there is no point in getting into a sniper battle with somebody who is quicker and more accurate than you. Just let it go and change your strategy.

Because it's a great well-rounded gun—probably the most balanced in the game. Of course, that's the reason most people complain about it. However, in a game where the objective includes killing a lot of people your best tool is the one that helps you kill the most.

I'm also a fan of the FAL, which makes me a try-hard. I'm a fan of the ACR, which makes me a try-hard. Sometimes I use the SCAR, which makes me a try-hard. I've been a try-hard for using any shotgun, machine pistol, and even the silenced USP. I'm a try-hard when I use the riot shield, the knife — with or without Commando or the tactical attachment — throwing knives, hand grenades, and even blast shield.

The fact of the matter is, even if I play terribly and have a difficult time pulling off a positive KDR most of the time — I'm a try-hard every time I kill somebody because I decided, for five seconds, I was going to do something more useful to my team than eat a bullet sandwich.

**TL;DR: I suck at this game, but apparently I'm a try-hard every time I kill somebody regardless of what weapon I'm using.

Screaming racial slurs before battle commences shows that you’re ready for war, especially race war.

If your targets don’t look like Indians, you’re using the red dot sight incorrectly.

A full ammo clip is useless on an empty stomach. Keep a box of Pop-Tarts and a quart of chocolate milk within arm’s reach.

Send your opponent a text message in the heat of battle. When he pauses to check it, shoot him in the face.

Camping is fun until a bear appears. Be the bear.

When setting up a time for a clan battle, keep in mind that Naruto airs at 7:27 p.m.

You will never have to search for a nOOb; the nOOb will coming searching for you. When he does, blow up the C4 you’ve hidden at the bottom of the stairs.

Winning at all costs encompasses picking up cheap wins. No one gave Neo shit about exposing glitches in the matrix. If an enemy quits as a result of glitching, that just gives them more time to go fuck themselves.

**EDIT:** I'll compile an ongoing list here for future reference.  
  
* All weapons w/Holographic increases aim-assist.  
  
* AK-47 w/ACOG or without any attachments has zero idle sway.  
  
* Claymores can be knifed from the rear without receiving damage.  
  
* Cold-Blooded^Pro can be unlocked by repeatedly shooting at a helicopter spiralling out of control; each bullet hit counts as one destroyed aircraft.
  
* Desert Eagle and .44 Magnum iron sights are misaligned; corrected by Tactical Knife.  
  
* F2000 w/Red Dot is unaffected by EMP.  
  
* FAL iron sights are misaligned.
  
* FAL w/Holographic increases damage output.  

* FAL w/Red Dot is misaligned.  
  
* M9 w/Silencer offers no advantageous effects.  
    
* M16 w/Holographic lessens recoil and has tighter spread than any other attachment.  
  
* M93 Raffica w/any optics is misaligned.  
  
* M240 w/Silencer offers no advantageous effects.   
  
* MG4 iron sights are misaligned.
  
* MG4 w/Silencer offers no advantageous effects.  
  
* P90 w/Akimbo reloads faster.
  
* P90 w/Extended Mags gives extra 3 seconds sprint time.  
  
* Riot Shield attracts enemy Sentry Gun/Aircraft fire indefinitely, regardless of other targets being available. 
  
* SPAS-12 w/FMJ or Grip offers no advantageous effects.
  
* TAR-21 w/Red Dot is unaffected by EMP.  
  
* TAR-21 w/Red Dot and Heartbeat Sensor can be aimed with HBS still visible.
  
* USB.45 w/Akimbo makes knife kill faster than Tactical Knife; however drawback is slower.

**e iii:** I just realised I have no idea whether any of these are platform-specific or not; so if anyone spots any above that are, please say.  
  
Update: **Excluding the aim-assist point which does not exist on PC, I have reason to believe that none of the above points are platform-specific**.  
  
**e iv:** I've seen quite a lot of posts being downvoted which are making claims about various weapons/attachments etc. For the sake of accuracy within this list, could I please ask that you specifically point out the error you are downvoting. I only ask because many comments contain two or more facts and some have been repeated making it less likely for them to be false and making downvotes seem unnecessary.

* Distance from Harrier - All players get threat based on distance from harrier. The max distance is pretty far.
* Has attacked Harrier - Anyone who has attacked the helicopter gets threat
* Player Score - Highest scoring player in view gets most threat.

Whoever has the highest combined threat from these four factors will be the helicopter's Primary Target. The harrier will only target a player if it has seen more than 50% of his body.  Harriers will also track threat on other airborne targets, enemy harriers included.  Because this was doubted initially, I thought up an experiment to test it:

Private match, A and B join and each grab 7 kills on each other, then call in their harriers.  A is CB so the enemy harrier can't see him.  B has a riot shield and uses it to absorb all of the fire from A's harrier.  (Warning: tanking a harrier with a riot shield may crash a PC version of MW2!)  B's harrier will have no targets, so if A's harrier is on the same plane, or lower, A's plane with be shot down by B's.  It is unconfirmed that a harrier will fire at an enemy plane that isn't lower or even with it.

We, the valued members of the /r/MW2 community currently playing on Xbox Live, hereby request that you please create a video or audio file of you reading out the seductive comments BlakeII7 leaves in your MW2 Weapon Guide comments.

Sincerely,

The Undersigned

EDIT: Sunoiki definitely came up with this idea. And sorry it's a bit rushed, I wrote this out inbetween matches. :D

EDIT 2 (thanks SmokyMcBongster): Here's the running list of the quotes:

**The first comment that started it all**:

&gt;His voice was smoother than the standard British accent, it was like butter on hot bread, but it held a baratone akin to gravel, the voice is the opposite of itself, it is harsh and soft at the same time. I don't watch his videos for the info (though that is quite good) I watch them to hear that voice.

&gt; P.S. - I'm kidding, if you somehow didn't get that.

**Followed up by these:**

&gt;His voice, it is with similar qualities to an oil painting being made in front of you, with the archaic brush strokes of liquid paint an opposing contrast to the final product, a cracked and dry paint that while not a smooth or free as when the paint first touched the canvas, now shows the subject with even more detail. His voice follows the same pattern, smooth and flowing, yet harsh and detailed.

&gt;ahem ""His voice, it is a sweet and subtle quality. It calmly flows like the lapping waves of the ocean on the beach after a harsh storm. Yet this quality is offset by the deepness to it, it feels as if those lapping waves are falling down upon stones. However these stones have been worn away with time, with the never ceasing ebb and flow of the ocean. As they are now worn smooth, they are flawlessly round, not a crack nor a mar defiles their pristine surface. That flawlessness is his voice.""

&gt;The most remarkable thing about his voice is the way it sticks with you, the power, the boldness of it. The only thing that I can compare it to the majesty of a waterfall. The unbridled power of thousands of gallons rushing and falling down. But the power is only one aspect of it. As I mentioned before, it is how it sticks with you, it is something that you can't shake, like the mist of a waterfall, it is all around you, heavy in the air. You feel it lingering everywhere. His voice does the same, it is something that you have not just witnessed, it is something you have experienced.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_crvm1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/crvm1/xboxahoy_a_petition/,

I'm in my 30s, have a family, full time job, other obligations that keep me from playing my xbox as much as I want.

That being said, I typically buy one game at a time and play it till I get bored.  The first game I played that captured my attention similar to what I remember my reaction in an old school arcade was COD4 MW.  Games came and went, but I stuck with it, absolutely enamored with the online playability.

While I'm not going to rehash the standard complaints regarding MW2 that we've all discussed ad naseum, it's still the only game I want to play right now.  I've tried the BF, L4D2, ODST, and various other games that have come out in the interim, but they just don't hold my attention the way MW2 does.

My gaming expenditures for the year then, are pretty low, and a $15 cost to effectively ""recharge"" my interest in a game I already know and love is still a small price to pay - made even better by bringing over maps that I'm already familiar with from the old game but with the new gun options and kill streaks.

That's my 2 cents, which probably won't be that popular, but I thought I'd throw it out there.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_c45zi,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c45zi/why_i_dont_have_a_problem_with_the_map_packs/,

1281486519.0,24,self.MW2,czq1v,A reasonable discussion on why the grenade launcher is bad for the game:,29,5,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/czq1v/a_reasonable_discussion_on_why_the_grenade/,"If you're just gonna come here to bitch and complain or brag and troll, on either side, you might as well just leave now.  

Personally, I think the main reason why it's so hated is the feeling of lack of control that it creates in the person who is killed by it. In most other situations, when killed, you can pinpoint something you did wrong, or at least could have done better, to either survive or get a kill. In short, you can learn a lesson, gain experience and knowledge, and become a better player for it.  

Being killed by a grenade launcher doesn't provide that option, and therefore, fosters frustration. There's nothing that can be done to prevent it. Die randomly from across the map? Get killed by enemies camping every choke point? Unload on an enemy who doesn't notice you're there, only to have them just manage to pull the trigger once and also kill you?  

There is nothing to be learned from these situations, no other tactic that that could have been used to ""outplay"" the people who use the grenade launcher. This perceived lack of control and lack of ability to influence the events and outcomes of a game that you yourself are playing creates an atmosphere of frustration, devoid of fun or competition.  

Beyond that, this is meant to be a game requiring not only split-second reactions and precise aim, but prior thought and decision-making.  You are meant to use all of the available options to you, whether it be your primary, secondary, equipment, special grenades, attachments and perks in a conjunctive effort to best prepare yourself for any situation. You are supposed to have to think about what you want to do before you do it. Enter a building? better switch to your secondary if you're using a sniper as a primary. Going into open space? Put that shotgun away and take out an AR. Enemy got you pinned around a corner? Flash/stun them and make your escape or get the kill.  

Using the grenade launcher, and only the grenade launcher, like most people do, completely eradicates any decision making. It's a simple, brainless, easy way to go through the game by abusing a clearly overpowered weapon. It removes any overarching strategy or thought process, gets rid of the need for aim or timing, and makes the game uncompetitive, and therefore, un-fun.  

Any opinions on this? Or other opposing ideas?  

**TL;DR: The noob tube creates uncompetitive gameplay that causes a disconnect between a users actions and their ability to learn from their mistakes, causing frustration at the lack of control**  

**EDIT:** Meant to include... Obviously any reasonable person is going to understand that they're not always going to succeed in a game. They will die, often, and the important thing that can come from that is learning how to play better. And like I mentioned, being killed by a grenade launcher, you don't really get the feeling that the other person outplayed you, or did something better than you, just that they were abusing the system, and there's nothing you can do to counter it.  

And that really the only parameter that was dialed back to balance the grenade launcher was the fact that it only got two shots per spawn. And you can see how easily that was overridden.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_czq1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/czq1v/a_reasonable_discussion_on_why_the_grenade/,

Anyway, I'm currently in the process of recording the 4th version of the ""series"" and I am *absolutely* determined to make it the best one yet. Yesterday, I got a few funny kills, but nothing extremely special or ""wow""-worthy. Today, however, was much different. I decided to hop into a FFA match and try to find some boosters. I figured it would be pretty funny to get a pair of boosters with a claymore kill. Luckily enough, fate did not let me down. I landed in my FIRST pre-game FFA lobby, only to find 7 guys with the same clantag. ""The motherload"", as Sandy Ravage puts it. They were all candidly chatting away with one another about ""partners"" etc and where they'd all meet up. Without thinking, I instantly changed my clantag to theirs. One of them remarked ""That LAWLROFL guy is a randomer"", to which another retorted ""Yea but why did he change his clantag to ours?"" I then got messages asking me if I had a boosting partner. I didn't reply, but by now I knew that they ""kind of"" trusted me. When the game started, I didn't shoot at anyone. I just followed them, walking beside them and building up their trust. I waited until three of them started boosting right in the open before I decided to strike. I planted a claymore behind one, it exploded, killing him, and I proceeded to let loose with my UMP, killing the other two guys. Another guy of theirs then appeared out of nowhere and I Spas-12'd him. I then spent the rest of the game trying to get more claymore kills etc (I got a few). Anyway, the next game arrived and I knew that they didn't trust me anymore... so I decided to put on the Cold Blooded Pro perk, which would hide the red name above my head. The game started and I ran to the boosting spot they were talking about, where I found three of them. Once again, I didn't shoot at them and kept patient. Two of them started putting down their Tactical Insertions when I quickly planted the claymore in front of them, got the double kill and killed the remaining guy with my UMP, getting the ""first blood"". Most of them then left the game. I then left the game, pissing myself with laughter, knowing that I had all of this mayhem recorded on my computer.

Thinking things couldn't get better, I then joined a Team Deathmatch in Skidrow. I ran towards that building that a few people like to camp in. As I got to the top of the stairs, I noticed that FOUR of them were there, with their backs to me, looking out the windows. I quickly planted the claymore. I was about to get a double kill when a third guy walked into the blast zone at the last second, giving me a triple kill. I then finished off the fourth guy with my silenced Spas.

3 years.

3 fucking years it takes for someone to find this Photo Frame, which says ""Allah is Beautiful"" by the way, and all it takes is one person to make a video, and then Activision patches it just days later, well removed, but they got onto it straight away, but nope not anything else the community has complained about for the past 3 years. 

I find that offensive. 

After the whole JTAG experience on XBOX where modded lobbies began, then onto PS3 with the whole jailbreak thing, the constant complaints about this shit.. never fixed.

Two years to patch the rock glitch on fuel was it?

The overpowered weapons, perks, etc etc. 

Complaints after complaints, video after video, forums posts on and off official forums, everywhere you go, big youtubers and small ones, your friends and just other players in the lobby, all saying the same things. 

Nothing done, nothing patched. 

Just one guy is all it takes, claiming millions of muslims are offended by this, and that he has the right to have this removed; of course  he's speaking on behalf of all muslims like most fundamentalists seem to have the authority to do.

...

I don't blame IW for this, the makers of CoD4 and MW2 no longer exist as far as I'm concerned; this is Activisions doing, for Profit and Prophet of course. 

Why so few patches earlier? Same reasons. 

Offended not by the killing civilians in the airport (seen differently within the context of the game and mission of course), not knifing players, not slicing peoples throats, not teabagging someone with your balls, not all the other shit I've mentioned.. but a photo frame..

I support Free Speech, I do not support a persons right to not be offended. Get fucked.

Infinity Ward has now (possibly?) removed Favela altogether.

The Boy and I are switching off games in Dom last night, I play one match then he plays one. His turn, running around with his Uzi/RPG deal and having a pretty good time of it. Gets Care Package and runs to the culvert by C and throws the marker right at the base of the fence. ""You might not have wanted to do that"", I say but he just shrugs. Waiting for the drop he manages to get an enemy and that nets the Predator. CP drops on the other side of the fence, out of reach despite attempts to somehow, somehow get close enough to activate the crate. No dice. AC-130. Well, that sucks. The Boy goes quiet. He LOVES the AC-130.

Manages to get a couple more kills and so here he is with the Attack Helicopter with the Predator in hand. Calls in the Heli. Runs around a little and calls in the Pred. *WHOOSH* Here comes death from above and as the missile flies wouldn't you know the Helicopter flashes in front of the screen and he winds up taking it down. The Boy just looks at me and I remain stone faced. If I so much as giggle he'll throw the controller at me. ""Tough break"", I say.

The match drags on, his team loses C only to gain A. Spawns at A, kills a few spawn trappers and gets CP. Then Predator. Activates the predator and hits two enemies that had just been killed by a team mate. Moves under the wing of one of the planes at A and calls in the CP. ""I don't think that was a wise choice, buddy"", I say but by this point he's silent and not amused. CP lands on top of a wing and sits there, teasing him with a Stealth Bomber. Oh, you can hop around and jump all you want but that fricken thing is stuck on the roof so you might as well forget it. Ouch.

Give the Boy credit, he's not screaming and is just playing with cold rage. Reckless and re-spawning a lot but keeping it together on the outside. Can't say I'd do the same.

Match is almost over. Finally gets another CP. Drops it in the middle of the road. No way he's losing this one.

Totally understandable. But if we're in the business of helping each other, I think it wouldn't be so bad if, between all of us, one fave camping spot gets revealed per map. I think there's 22 maps, so we'd only be ""giving away"" 22 lucky camp locations between all of us.

I'll start, and tell everyone how I like to roll on **Rundown**:

By flag A, there's a long 2-story building with three staircases leading up to the 2nd floor. With OMA or scavenger, place claymores on the closest and furthest staircases (not the middle because it's rarely used), then stand on the ledge behind the fridge, facing the claymores. The fridge blocks almost all of your body from bullets and you're ready to pop anyone who gets by your claymores. You can also try to peek out over the ledges to kill enemies in windows on the other side of the map, and you'll be able to see a spawn area to your northwest (if facing looking out over the ledge). Admittedly, and by very nature of this thread, this is cheap...*but* if you can't figure out how to get a killstreak on Rundown or finish it without a rage-quit, try this method.

Don't get me wrong - MW2 was a fun game but it felt so unbalanced IMO that I was more than happy to change.

A couple of reasons I changed to COD:BO include:

* COD:BO feels more like COD4
* Noob tubes and explosives in MW2 are shocking
* Poor perks and perk combos in MW2
* Unbalanced guns (UMP being one) in MW2
* No IW support
* Bad killstreak setups (a spin-off being boosters) in MW2
* Deathstreaks (I like the idea and perhaps it could be refined but perks with health support is a no-no)

MW2 took the game/series to another level so I hope MW3 can refine and combine the good parts from both MW2 and COD:BO.

Since then, I just can't get over the fact that MW2 is much more fun to play (in my opinion). I've also noticed that a lot of my friends are starting to load up MW2 again. 

While things like Commando and Danger Close still exist, they don't really bother me as much as they used to. Why? Because the things that I dislike about Black Ops have really put things into perspective. 

* Last Stand is rarely used in MW2. Seriously, the perk is so infrequently used that whenever I do notice somebody using it, it's a surprise. In Black Ops, it sometimes **feels** as if 50% of the players are using Second Chance. I've been close to double kills and triple sprays, only to have one or two of them fall onto their asses and riddle me with bullets before I get the chance to reload. Frustrating as hell.

* The games that Infinity Ward make have a certain panache. The way the player moves, the environment, the feel of the guns, the graphics, the sound... I go onto Black Ops and it feels plastic, if that makes any sense. The footsteps still don't sound right. The guns feel like pea shooters. The ambient noise is annoying. The graphics aren't as appealing. The maps are... ""ok"" (Compare Terminal to any Black Ops map. Or Wasteland. Or Favela.)

* The RC Car is the most annoying killstreak. Ever. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to introduce it as a 3 killstreak. 

* People don't have to aim their SMGs in Black Ops. They simply just equip Steady Aim and spray from the hip the entire time.

* The camping in this game is just amazing. It feels as if everyone and their dog wants to play defensively. What makes it worse is that they try to justify it in several different ways when its pretty clear that they're just worried about their KDR. It's got to the point that I actually considered recording the gameplay of some of the worst offenders and putting the footage up on Youtube. I watched one guys gameplay on Christmas Eve. He sat in the corner for the whole game. Whenever he died, he'd make his way back to the corner. The entire game consisted of him doing this. I was in a FFA just before Christmas and it felt as if everyone was ADS camping. When I killed one of them, I was so pissed off about the whole experience that I started shooting his corpse and knifing it while cursing the house down. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCh3oBqwsto 

* Then there's the lag, drop in FPS, the ability to buy attachments without completing challenges, the shitty sniper rifles and shotguns, the lack of time delay on claymores and the godforsaken **PANIC KNIFING**!

It's bullshit, I just quit out of a domination game where my entire team was 2-9, 1-9, 0-8, or 4-10. 

Most of the time, it's really the stupidity of the players and teammates. I'm sitting there at level 10 on a team of all prestiged level 70s. The enemy has 2 harriers and a chopper gunner up and NO ONE is shooting ANYTHING down. 1.) Why does no one shoot the chopper down and 2.) What are you supposed to do in that situation?

1287859769.0,22,self.MW2,dve9u,I just finished Sit Rep Pro VI!,23,1,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dve9u/i_just_finished_sit_rep_pro_vi/,"I can't even count how many hours this one took to grind out, but I finally got #750 to complete the Sit Rep challenge, and I thought I'd share how I did it and talk a little about what is now my favorite perk.

I finished the challenge before I was able to prestige, but that's only because I focused solely on busting claymores (and the occasional C4 or tac insertion). I quickly felt like if I wasn't primarily focused on shooting enemy devices, I was never going to finish. Luckily, you can actually get this done relatively quickly if you make a game out of hunting these devices down while still trying to contribute to the team or being in the top 3 of FFA.

So here was my class of choice.
Weapon: MPK5. Weapons don't matter as much as the FMJ, if you ask me. I found that I'm pretty accurate with the MPK5, so I stuck with that. FMJ is needed just for that extra oomph through the wall.

Secondary: Either a pistol or the AA-12. The shotgun allows you to just spray the claymore if you're trying to hit it quick with enemies around, and the pistol allows for more accurate shot placement. The flow of the game kind of dictates this one, but I usually stuck with the shotty.

Perks: Marathon, Lightweight, and Sit Rep are pretty much non-negotiable, in my opinion. You need mobility to get across the map towards any flashing red objects as fast as possible. What makes the Sit Rep challenge to frustrating and challenging is that your ability to complete it is highly dependent on other players. They have to set the devices and live long enough for you to blow them up. Speed is very important, because I found that most players are not really thinking about living too long or camping like crazy. Most players like to set a trap in an odd part of the map and move on.

Semtex is the most accurate equipment that you can also throw long range, so I usually rolled with that. But the frag and C4 can be quite handy, as well.

Game type: Sabotage or FFA were the most lucrative for me. They tend to feature a lot of claymore users and encourage a lot of camping. Sabotage restricts spawns to certain parts of the map, without these spots shifting like you'll find in TDM and Dom, so it makes claymore placement more predictable. FFA is probably the best option, however, because as soon as you find a game with a claymore+scavenger guy, you've hit jackpot. 8 times out of ten this guy will plaster the map with claymores, letting you rack up huge numbers each map. I usually played an FFA map, and if I only got 2 or less claymores shot in the game, I'd move on to a new lobby until I hit pay dirt. Be picky here, it saves you hours and hours of time. Note: you don't have to boost, you don't have to quit during the match if the lobby is cold, I did all of this legit and while it was hard, I wasn't crying myself to sleep or anything. And my performance probably got better as a result, because I became a master of my class. Sit Rep is so wonderful, after you get used to Sit Rep Pro you can pinpoint enemy locations better than with a UAV. Even the players using Ninja couldn't hide from me after a while. I felt like Daredevil running around the map full speed, pausing only to listen a little bit, track an enemy, and make him think I have some wall hack when I nail him through the wall. This little trek of mine helped me get ""How the...?"", ""Omnicide"", ""Heads Up!"", the fall camo for my MPK5, and a slew of other (in my opinion) fairly difficult challenges. Knowledge of enemy position, with a claymore or not, gives you the advantage of surprising them. Sometimes I'd make a game of following guys right behind them until they turned around and then delivering a satisfying headshot. I really felt like I was in kleos at some points out there.

So there's my story. For anyone thinking that they are up to the challenge, I don't think you'll regret it once you get going. I rock that green Sit Rep emblem now with pride, now. For anyone else who has also completed this, I'd love to here how you got it done. Sorry for text bomb, but after 10s of hours of grinding this out (plus my rangers being in the world series), I have a bit of excited typing syndrome.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_dve9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dve9u/i_just_finished_sit_rep_pro_vi/,

So here's what happens:


1. MW2 tries to be your mother, pretending like spawning in front your enemies is good for you. ""No, seriously, they got like vitamins and shit."" I spawn, re-orient myself just in time to see the SPAS carrying ghillie man and then I die. Repeat 1-2 times more.



2. I manage to spawn not in front of the enemy and I started to run over and lock-on to the AC130/Chopper/Harrier. MW2 thinks is the best idea to spawn my teammates around me. **Teammates who don't have Cold-Blooded like I do, perfect for the AC130 to see and just drop a bomb in our area**. I die along with my teammates. Repeat step 1 and 2.



3. By the time I fully lock-on it flies away, leaving me ready to punch someone in the face. During the whole time I hear things like ""WHY IS NO ONE TAKING THE AC130 OUT, I'M COVERING THE FRONTLINES RIGHT NOW YOU NOOBS"" and ""Nice AC130 faggot, how about you play the game like real man you fucking pussy"". 



4. Enter a new room, rinse and repeat.

I, like many other MW2 players, prefer Predator over Sentry for my 5 kill reward. The instant gratification of the Predator is just easier. If I'm in the zone I don't want to stop. The Predator is almost always at least 1 kill. I'm only 1 away from my Attack Helo/Harrier then. 2-3 is not uncommon, especially if guys on the opposing team aren't smart enough to run away from each other once they hear my Predator. (Seriously this irks me by the way. If you hear ""Enemy Predator Incoming"" then get away from me.)

The main reason I don't use Sentry is because I don't want to wait for it to arrive, risk getting killed and having it stolen, and then having to run over to a nice spot and plant it. I could have gotten my 7 reward by that time. Predator missile is just open, aim, boom, let's continue with business.

What I've noticed is the Sentry gun - if well placed and well guarded - can take out more, on average, than a Predator. In other words, it has higher potential. But it's just too much of an investment. You have to get to a low traffic area. You have to wait for it. You have to risk it getting stolen. You have to nanny it or somebody's gonna knife it in 5 seconds. It takes 90 seconds instead of 10. That's easily 1/5 match duration if you seriously think about it. But play it right and you can get 4-5 enemies with it, plus you can take down some guys who are recklessly trying to flank it.

A few issues spring to mind:

- The subreddit stylesheets have a limit. This means that we can't append everyone's gamertag/id to their reddit username.

- Even if you do get your GT appended to your username, other's are completely unaware as to what timezone/location you're living in. For instance, someone from Belgium would have difficulties playing with somebody from California, because of time differences and (more importantly) latency issues.

- ""Hook-up threads"" are ok. i.e. somebody posts a thread saying ""Hey guys, I'm on XBox... add me."" However, they take away from the content of the subreddit. They're also disorganized, in the sense that your ""Hook-up"" thread might only get seen by a small set of people.

- Different people prefer different game modes and playlists. You may be in the same location as another Reddit, but if he/she loves Search and Destroy and you detest it, it's not really that helpful.

- Some people don't like talking over their mics. Others do.

So, I've made an *attempt* at fixing these issues. What I've done is created a [custom PHP application](http://waynewexford.byethost22.com) that is specifically tailored to fit the needs of Redditors that play Call of Duty. The site allows you to submit all of your details and search for other Redditors by:

- Platform
- Location/Timezone
- Games (MW2, Black Ops, COD 4)
- Game modes (Search, Domination)
- Microphone usage

You can use the above attributes to narrow down your search.

The site can be [accessed here](http://waynewexford.byethost22.com). Bear in mind that it's still in its early stages and that there may be a few bumps (bugs) in the road. Also, it's on a free host at the moment, so there may be a few performance issues.

I figured that the best way to do this challenge (and any other finishing moves challenge) would be to do it in free for all, as you can control the game winning kill for yourself. Throughout a few games, I basically just racked up a bunch of care packages, sentry guns and emergency airdrops throughout free for all games. At 29 kills of one game on Crash, I had at least a 10 point lead and about 2 minutes to do what I needed to do, so I ran to a nearby building and began throwing a few of the packages. I then just waited for people to flock over to either steal the packages or kill the people stealing the packages. When people started to arrive, I just began launching more markers. Some kid ran into the building I was in, and although I was tempted to kill him, but had to just turn around and run away. I jumped out of the building and got stunned, but threw a few more markers before dying. I respawned and began to run back to where I was when all of a sudden, I received points and the game ended. I only wish that the killcam was from the point of view of the package so I could have seen how it happened because all we got to see was me running. The kids that I was playing with seemed very confused as to why there were about 12 packages on the ground in the last few games, but they learned soon enough.  
It only took me about 6 games of trying for the challenge to get it, so it was much easier than I thought, but I still feel quite accomplished for completing a challenge that nobody I know has been able to complete without boosting.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_cxavp,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/cxavp/i_just_completed_the_droppin_crates_challenge/,

What I _was_ doing was trying to complete the challenge for calling in X number of care and sentry drops.

Several times in the game I'd get a killstreak going, but die before calling in the drop(s) I earned. Finally I had to call them in, as the game only had a few kills left in it. I get a bunch thrown down before 'airspace too crowded' blocks me, and then while I'm waiting I get shot in the back. Crap.

Thankfully, it spawned me around the corner and I start rushing back to the spot. I can hear them steal one of them (least favourite sound in the game), but they couldn't have all landed yet so I figure I'll make it there in time to stop them. 

I'm halfway there when I hear my _favourite_ sound in the game - 'URK!' - and the game ends. Winning kill-cam just shows me running inside a building, which was disappointing, but you could still hear the random 'URK!' which made up for the lack of a proper view.

A lot of people start off by spamming shots at the opponent while simultaneously raising their scope (this was me for about two weeks). If you shoot before the scope is fully up, it's considered a ""half-scope"". The bad thing about a half-scope is that it has the same *randomized* accuracy as a no-scope. The reason most people shoot before they scope in is because when they look at killcams and game winning kills, it seems as if the other player didn't even scope in fully. In reality, he/she was scoping in fully: It's just that game winning kills and killcams in general have less FPS (frames per second) than the game itself. In essence: A quickscope is when you scope in as quickly as you can before instantly taking the shot. Of course, doing this perfectly comes with practice.

* If you don't need to quickscope, then don't. There's no point in quickscoping an AFK (away from keyboard/controller) player. There's no point in quickscoping a player who has his back to you (unless he's just about to turn a corner and leave your sight). 

* If you're looking for practice with the sniper rifle, create a class with a sniper rifle as the primary and a lock-on launcher as the secondary. This way, when things are going badly for you (they inevitably will), you won't be tempted to switch to your machine pistol or shotgun.

* On the other hand: I've always felt that pistols make the best secondary weapons on a sniper class. If you miss your first shot or get a hitmarker, you can quickly switch to your pistol and let it rip. I prefer the M9 because of its accuracy. However, others prefer the revolver or the deagle because of their power. Pistols have a quicker switch time than other secondary weapons. In the time it takes you to switch to a shotgun etc, you'll probably already be dead.

* Try and stick to the outsides of the map with your back tilted towards the wall, ESPECIALLY IN FFA. This lowers your chances of being shot in the back, from the side etc. For instance: If you're not experienced with the sniper rifle, running into the bunker on Wasteland during a FFA is going to be painful.

* Quickscoping in a private quickscoping match is different than quickscoping in a public game. Just be aware of that. There will be times when you'll be up against Commando knife-monkeys, UMPs, akimbo shotguns... you name it. They'll test your patience and make you want to switch to a different class. Your goal is to stick with it, regardless. 

* In FFA, try and find a high traffic area and patrol it (the area around A Domination flag at the top of Favela, for instance). Learn the spawns and learn what routes your enemies will take in order to get at you. Stay focused and ready.

* The reason a lot of snipers do that double tap thing is because they're trying to stay focused and ready. I've often felt at my best with the sniper rifle when I'm playing like I have ADHD and a ""Come at me bro! I'm ready!"" mentality. Obviously, you don't need to do the double tap - it's a personal preference. Just try to be ""on focus"" the whole time, like you're watching a horror movie and you expect the bad guy to pop out at any moment. 

* **You do not need** Steady Aim if you are quickscoping. Steady Aim will only increase your ability to no scope. I find Ninja Pro to be a much better counterpart as I like to sound whore and figure out where my enemies are coming from before I see them.

* FMJ is my favorite attachment for the sniper rifle for the obvious reasons. The Heartbeat monitor distracts me, the silencer works better in HC and extended mags are overkill, in my opinion. 

* Just because you're quickscoping, it doesn't mean that you to discard all cover and run at the enemy like Rambo.

* I usually use a higher sensitivity when I'm sniping. I use 3 for Assault Rifles/SMGs because it allows for accurate shooting over distance and I use 6 when rolling with a sniper rifle. The downside is that I'm less effective with my pistol when I'm on sensitivity 6.

* Stopping Power is a must when playing aggressively. One hitmarker = trouble when the enemy player has an automatic weapon.

* Do NOT move while quickscoping. For some reason, if you try to quickscope while moving/jumping, the hit detection isn't as good and it feels more randomized. Stop moving, take the shot, start moving again... rinse and repeat. This will save you a lot of anguish.

* Sleight of Hand Pro is cool... but I feel as if it isn't necessary. It feels different when you're not using it, but I don't think it puts you at a greater disadvantage. Using Marathon instead can sometimes force you to pick your shots more wisely, as opposed to just spamming shots.

* The .50 Cal has a quicker raise time than the Intervention. The .50 Cal is a semi-automatic and is just as powerful. The Intervention is a bolt action, but I feel as if it is slightly more accurate. 

* Sniping in SnD is a whole different ball game. It's an unforgiving game type and the pressure of having others spectate often proves too much for people.

1286906183.0,19,self.MW2,dqadu,CUAVs are apparently awesome,22,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dqadu/cuavs_are_apparently_awesome/,"As much as *I* have always found CUAVs called in by the enemy to be extremely frustrating I never really considered them useful in the killstreak progression. If my streaks are set to EDrops, Chopper Gunners or AC130s, why should I choose the CUAV? I don't really think CUAV is a suitable replacement for the goto Predator Missile but if you find yourself bored and in need of a change, the Counter-UAV does have a few neat tricks.

These are my thoughts after only two nights of playing with them.

* The essential obvious: They block UAVs which is nifty. I find this to be *less* useful than typical because I like to play with /r/ (or those other guys I play with \*cough\*) and, generally, enemy killstreaks are kept to a minimum. The idea of holding on to a CUAV to specifically block an enemy UAV means that I will have an unused CUAV at the end of 9 of 10 matches. Actually, I suspect that is closer to 19 of 20 matches.

* You can hide EDrops, Sentry Guns or friendly Care Packages. (You cannot hide your *own* Care Packages because they both take the 4 streak slot.) When playing for fun I like Sentries and EDrops. Covering the map in static makes it less troublesome to pick up the goodies. For bonus synergy, dropping in a Sentry Gun with the EDrop gives you a sure fire way to protect your stuffs.

* The CUAV hides friendly Predator Missiles, Harriers, and other air support. If you have ever called in the Predator and watched that clump of enemies scatter before you, *I* should have been there. Since CUAVs come immediately before the Predators it is hard to cover your own Predators but the madman on your team will probably be getting the Pred around the same time you get your CUAV. The doubles and triples are much easier when they cannot see that red ring of death. The same is true for other air support; as a bonus, you also block the Harriers from showing up on the radar. The punk with a Stinger will waste a few seconds looking for the plane which gives you a few more seconds to stretch the most out of it. It also makes it more likely that someone will kill the AA before it fires.

* The CUAV hides your gunfire. This means you can walk into a room with 4 guys and kill them one by one and they won't even realize what is happening. You can clear out a spawn and watch people running away from the *very same building*. People have no idea that you are there. To make this cooler, the CUAV essentially gives your entire team silencers without the damage/range reduction. This means you can get more kills without dying and if you have any sense of tactics whatsoever you will *easily* fracture the enemy team. Killing off a whole bunch of radar blind enemies is cake.

* A single CUAV can instantly change the momentum of the game. It makes it harder for the enemy to coordinate and more likely to run into people running around without a specific purpose. It is especially frustrating for players such as myself who are radar dependent. They have no clue what is happening anywhere and the sudden advantage your entire team can quickly end whatever streaks they were working on.

Most of this is pretty obvious. I just suddenly found myself getting insanely lucky when the CUAV was up because no one knew I was in their base, killing their mens. People would run right into me immediately after I slaughtered two people. I watched Snipers lean out of windows to shoot someone across the map while I was blowing off their teammates heads. And calling in Sentry Guns without worry about people finding me was awesome.

So yeah. The CUAV is very much a team focused killstreak but it can be used to your advantage to help you get to the next streak on your list. It isn't the right option if you are going for the big stuff but I really enjoyed my CUAV/Sentry Gun/EDrop setup. CUAV/Sentry Gun/Pavelow would probably be a more kill focused streak option. If you don't like Sentry Guns I would suggest CUAV/Harrier/Pavelow. Getting another three kills with CUAV is likely but takes some luck. If your team loves UAVs than mixing in some CUAVs is brutal. Likewise if you have a few people running the classic 5/7/11 as the double Pred kills are much easier when they don't scatter.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_dqadu,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dqadu/cuavs_are_apparently_awesome/,

It's as if people believe that anyone can pick up a sniper rifle and instantly start quickscoping everyone. I hear some people complaining about it because they feel as if players shouldn't be able to use the sniper rifle at such a short range... but... it is a gun, isn't it? And *technically*, yes, you can kill people with a sniper rifle at short range. Not that any of that really matters because MW2 **is** just a game. While we're at it, we could also complain about the fact that players respawn and that certain guns having little to no recoil. There is a list of things there. I find that the people who complain about quickscoping are also the same people who complain about MW2 being a game that supposedly caters to people with no skill (whatever the hell that means). Yet... when someone uses a technique that literally takes months of practise to be used effectively, they rant about it in an almost semi-jealous kind of way. 

Some people don't realize that:

* You usually only get one chance when quickscoping. If you miss, you die.
* It isn't always a one shot kill. More than often, you **will** get a hitmarker. Hitmarkers are absolutely rage-inducing as your opponent, who could be using an SMG, will make you pay for it.
* You're up against guys with automatic weapons, shotguns with large spreads, players using Marathon and Lightweight and grenade launchers. I reckon they have the advantage in any close quarters fight.
* When you come up against more than one foe, you don't get to spray and pray. You have to be quick and accurate. Otherwise you're dead.
* The reason it is so difficult is because you have to aim in as quickly as you can using a long-range sight and let the shot off as soon as you can. Usually, the ""shoot while not fully scoped in"" technique doesn't work that well at all. You have to realize that killcams and the final game winning kill replay show less frames per second than what you're seeing in-game. Therefore, a lot of these quickscopes look as if the person didn't even scope in fully... when they did. i.e. it's usually just an illusion.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_d3vsq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/d3vsq/i_really_dont_get_the_hate_directed_towards/,

It makes my head hurt.  

There is a brand new release of hacks that came out this month and they have *everything* to do with the recent PS3 exploits. [These](http://pvhax.com/showthread.php?t=39081) are the new hacks that were released this month (these are also on a SHIT load of other forums) and yes, they were due to the PS3 exploits that happened in this exact same time frame. Anyone who wants to say these aren't related, when these hacks clearly need 3.55 geohot, is either blind or purely ignorant. In fact, the hackers who are posting these hacks even SAY that's the reason.  

Yes, there have been hacks before (that ALL got patched), but these are not the same hacks. These are a completely different patch of hacks... I don't know how much more I can stress that to people.  

But you're right, it's just IW being ""lazy"". A defunct company with almost no employees left, they're all just sitting in their office chairs eating doritos. The company that has patched every single hack we have had before, but suddenly they just don't feel like it. They feel the need to blame it on the PS3 exploits that oh so coincidentally happened right before these hacks were developed. Because they're just trying to save face....riiiiight. Because IW has *so* much to lose. If you couldn't tell by now, this paragraph was pure sarcasm.

These are not the same hacks you've seen before, the ones that have been easily patched. These are a direct result of the PS3 exploits, and there is no possible way for IW to patch them.  

I can't wait for all of this to be proven right when Sony releases a system patch and the hacks magically stop working. I say magically because it's IW's fault and IW's ability to patch the hacks!! OoooOOoOO, mysterious!!  

Fuck, get a clue. I did a shit ton of research trying to find these hacks so I could use them for good, and host hack-free games myself, and the hackers are openly saying this requires 3.55 Geohot and the hacks are due to the PS3 exploits..................and this is coming straight from the hack creators.....",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_f4old,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/f4old/i_want_to_clear_up_some_confusion_in_this/,

The other team were a bunch of loudmouths, calling other people ""faggots"" etc. Anyway, in Sub Base, I was the last guy left because, after a few seconds, my entire team got wiped out by predator missiles and spawn snipers/rushers. To make matters worse, their UAV was called in. 

At this point, I feel as if I have nothing to lose so I just run towards the enemy spawn, taking out one guy along the way (he was just camping in the corner with a 50cal). As I'm running along, another guy tries to quickscope me from behind, so I spin around, dropshot and take him out. I was lucky because he had at least two clear shots on me from behind and missed. 

After getting inside the building, another guy jumped down from the balcony above, spraying everywhere. I dropshot and shoot him with my PP2000. It only takes a a bullet or two because he's already seeing red/injured from the fall he just took. After that, I turn around and attempt to leave the building. However; after turning around, I see that another guy is right beside me. I shit myself and ""panic knife"" him. So now, there are two guys left and all of this has happened in under 25-30 seconds. I'm ""in that mode"" and they're all coming for me, trying to get the final game winning kill. 

Soon enough, another guy appears from the entrance, trying to quickscope me. I shoot at him, run out of bullets, hide behind a crate while he's spamming his Intervnetion, reload.... and then reappear again, spraying like a mad man. He's dead. Now it's One vs One; and I know that the guy is in the building with me because I could see two dots on the radar while I was diving and throwing flash bangs at everyone. Anyway, he appears at my side, trying to shoot me. He injures me and then wastes the rest of his magazine shooting the box that's to the side of me. 

I recover, notice the silence, realize he's probably trying to reload and then run straight at his direction. Suddenly... I can't see him anywhere. Seriously. He's gone. So I walk towards the area he was last at, aiming down my sights, hoping that he hasn't somehow managed to get behind me. Then, out of nowhere, he appears from behind a box. He tries to knife me, I drop to the floor and wildly fire from the hip. I get him.

Even on Reddit, when you big up one game or knock the other, you'll get mixed replies and it usually descends into a ""Fuck you! Stop liking what I don't like!"" styled argument.

""Update: I just left a security meeting with the coders here at Infinity Ward where we discussed a lot of solutions. I feel good about the meeting, but of course I can't go into detail on the possible solutions we discussed as we don't want to give out any information that could potentially hinder the security any further.

Once I have more information, I will post it here. 

The key factor I want you to know is, that while any update takes time, we are looking to make the process as quick as possible and nothing is being left unattended.

Our main focus right now is on:

1) Preventing hackers from affecting legitimate players.

2) Addressing users who have already been affected.""



The original post can be found [here](http://www.infinityward.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=371760); thread had already been submitted here, so I had to make as text post.

My team was art of eXecution (aoX) and I play under the tag ""Clayster."" It was on PS3 due to Sony buying the rights for MW2 &amp; B:Ops to be on the circuit (Major League Gaming circuit, lan at events not online) exclusively on PS3. All previous Call of Duty events have been in the form of ""OPCE's"" or ""Online Pro Circuit Edition"" save for the yearly MLG Nationals (or Championships.) Xbox 360 still holds ""OPCE's"" but they are called MLG 4v4 Ladder's (same prize, same setup, just no pro status to the players that place top eight.)



There's quite a few rule restrictions, which most gamers hate, but it's to provide a less ""random,"" or ""luck"" factor and to level the playing field in the sense of gunskill and teamwork. With claymores around every corner, chopper gunner's in the air, and 'noob tubes,' it gets a bit ridiculous/hectic to try and play a match for $10,000 :p


Competitive (Major League Gaming, MLG) settings: No Launchers No Akimbo No Riot Shields No Bling No One-Man-Army Everyone must have Copycat deathstreak 

**A lot of gameplay settings are changed, respawn is extended, SnD bomb plant/defuse limits extended, etc. No Killstreaks Regular Mode Only


Uhm, that's about all I can think of at this moment. If ya got any questions, ask me!

1284159930.0,16,self.MW2,dcamh,Guide: Why lag happens OR It's Not All About Latency!,20,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dcamh/guide_why_lag_happens_or_its_not_all_about_latency/,"Okay. So lately I've been reading and hearing a lot of people complain about lag, and everyone's quick rationalization is either a) the host is horrible (which is some bitter truth for some of you assholes who can't set up a router following simple documentation) or b) the host is far away.

Well, that's not always the case. And my goal today is to teach you guys some basic computer networking that will help you understand how MW2 (and all of Xbox Live's) multiplayer system works and explain why lag can occur.

First off, we'll need to learn some simple networking terms and devices. So let's dive into expanding your dictionary!

* **Router** - a device that is used to connect two or more networks together. This is NOT a switch, in the sense you're not connecting computers but networks!
* **Switch** - a device that connects computers together. Not a router, etc, etc, read the definition above.
* **TCP/IP** - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The international rules for data transmission over the internet.
* **Packets** - pieces of data that are encoded/decoded according to TCP/IP rules for transmission over the internet. Think of a packet as an envelope - on the outside it has sender/recipient information, and inside the envelope is the data.

Okay, so we got that stuff out of the way. Let's move on to how the internet operates!

When you want to transmit data over the internet, an application sends the data to the protocol stack to be encoded and prepared for transfer. (You don't need to know how this is done, it's very technical). When the packet is prepared, it is sent to your router, which, in turn, will pass it to your cable/DSL modem. The modem will transport the packet to your ISPs servers, who relay the packet through the appropriate servers until it reaches its destination. In most cases a packet will be passed through at least 10-15 servers until it reaches its destination.

Most applications use the TCP protocol for transmissions. This protocol is **connection-oriented**, meaning a connection must be established between the sender and the recipient. Here's what it would look like (translated in English):

* Hey, [recipient], are you there?
* Hello, [sender], yes I am.
* I would like to send you some data!
* Okay, please send your data to me!

And the data transfer begins. As packets are transmitted, the sender logs all the packets that are being sent, and as the recipient receives them, after a predefined interval in the connection setup, the recipient will acknowledge the data letting the sender know that data is flowing just fine.

But what happens if there's a problem?

Well, let's say data is being sent like this:

* Sender sends packet 1--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 2--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 3--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 4 -----------------&gt; Sender
* Sender sends packet 4--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 5--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 6--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 7 -----------------&gt; Sender

Now, say a router is malfunctioning and misrouting packets. The TCP protocol employs error detection and correction, so if the recipient receives a malformed packet or is missing a packet it will request the data to be resent. So it would look like this:

* Sender sends packet 7--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 8------MALFORMED--&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 9--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 8 -----------------&gt; Sender
* Sender sends packet 8--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Recipient says send me 10 -----------------&gt; Sender
* Sender sends packet 11--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 12--------------------&gt; Recipient
* Sender sends packet 13--------------------&gt; Recipient

See what happened there? The recipient noted a malformed packet was received, and requested at the next acknowledgement for the packet to be retransmitted. After transmission, the sender waits before sending any more data to ensure that the recipient is now properly caught up, in which case the recipient requests the next set of data.

That's great! But it's not how Xbox Live and games in general work.

TCP is great for fixing errors and data transmission in general, but it introduces a lot of latency by sending acknowledgments and dealing with error correction. We couldn't have that in games, as the lag would be far too unbearable.

Luckily for us gamers, there's another protocol, UDP! (User Datagram Protocol). This protocol is **connectionless**, unlike TCP, so instead of negotiating a connection, UDP simply sends the packets.

This is great for gamers. By disregarding error detection and acknowledgement, we cut down on latency a lot. But here's the problem - the sender will never know if packets are being received correctly or not! So if packets get misrouted or malformed in route, they will simply be discarded by the recipient. This is unacceptable for file transfer, as you would very likely download files only to find they're corrupted.

This is a common source of lag! If packets are malformed or misrouted your Xbox will simply disregard them, and your game is forced to wait until the next packet is received to update your game. This may not be so bad if you lose a packet or so every so often but lose 3 or 4 in a row (which is very possible) and now you're looking at waiting 200ms or so until you can get a usable packet.

And that's the end of my guide (unless I edit it of course!) If I've screwed up, please let me know and I'll fix it. Please feel free to post questions and I'll do my best to answer.

Otherwise enjoy your new networking knowledge and go brag to some friends, or something.

**EDIT**: shagoth/WarriorThree made a couple of excellent points I'd like to outline here.

Firstly, most players with a router (aka all of them, lol) will most likely be using a method of opening ports called uPNP (Universal Plug and Play). The basic concept of uPNP is that it will detect outgoing connections and open the appropriate ports to allow the incoming traffic to be routed successfully without fear of misrouting or being dropped by the router's NAT (Network Address Translation - determines which packets from the internet are meant for which host on the LAN and routes accordingly). While uPNP in itself is fine for Xbox Live, and recommended for novice networkers, many routers (including almost the entire Cisco/Linksys brand) uses a buggy and possibly broken uPNP implementation. To test your NAT, the best way is to check MW2's Xbox Live screen where it will tell you your NAT status. If it's anything but Open (Moderate or Closed), you've got work to do. If you already have uPNP enabled and you're still getting a Moderate or Closed NAT, you may need to look into manual port forwarding. For each router the process is different but there's an [excellent website](http://www.portforward.com/) that will give you step by step instructions for almost every make and model of router, including most popular third-party firmware (DD-WRT, Tomato).

Secondly, if you're playing over wireless, you should expect at least a little bit of extra lag due to radio interference. If you're playing in a suburb where everyone around you will likely have a wireless router, the signals can interfere with each other and force clients to continually resend packets to the wireless router, and vice versa. If you're having troubles with wireless interference, you can use [this excellent free application](http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider) which will show you the wireless networks in your range and what channels they are on (NA players will be between channel 1-12, EU players will be between 1-14). Then configure your router to use the least crowded channel. If you're still having issues, you may consider switching to a ""simultaneous dual-band router"" which enables use of the 5GHz spectrum with Wireless N devices (you'll need an 802.11n adapter for your 360 in order to take advantage of the new spectrum). 5GHz has not been widely adapted by users as the technology is not found on many routers quite yet so in most areas you should not have many wireless networks to compete with, if any at all. You'll also avoid interference from your controller, wireless headset (if applicable), microwave, cordless phone, etc. which all use the 2.4GHz band by using a 5GHz capable router.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_dcamh,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dcamh/guide_why_lag_happens_or_its_not_all_about_latency/,

I watched him play a few games recently when something subtle finally hit me.  My brother patrols, I focus.  My focus actually gets me killed more often.

Suppose I'm on Karachi and I know that the enemies are going to try to flank by moving through the street.  I'll flank them by getting up high and then I stare down the street with my rifle and get ready to shoot when they get there.

My brother, on the other hand, gets a flanking position but doesn't stare.  He watches for 2 seconds, leaves, checks another area, checks his back, comes back and checks again, etc.  This really improves his playing, but it's not the checking his back that saves him.  It's not watching the enemies move up the street that saves him.

When the enemies round the corner and move down the street, they check for enemies on high ground.  If I'm playing, they see me standing there ready to take a shot.  I kill the first guy, but the second or third guy takes me out after they dodge behind the cover and have a fire fight.

If the enemies round the corner and my brother is playing, they don't see anybody on high ground.  They rush down the street and try to get into position.  When they are halfway there, that's when my brother is coming back to check on the street again.  Now they have no cover, are halfway to their destination (So turning back is bad for them), and are stuck in a sprinting animation so that it will take them longer to aim down sights.  My brother ends up killing all three of them.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_cp9z6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/cp9z6/patrolling_how_being_less_focused_can_help_you/,

I played about 20 games in a row where at least one person was using an obvious cheat or hack. I'm tired of it, and I feel like the multiplayer in MW2 is broken. I came here to post some ideas for how I feel like it could be fixed both on the console and PC.

* FFA should either be called ""Booster Hunter"" or it should be something more like a target game where one person is the ""target"" (maybe even whoever has the highest k/d or longest streak) and that person is worth double the points of the regular people. 

* On objective games like Dom or CTF, kills should not count toward your K/D ratio. Also, the nuke ability should either take 25 kills *without* a killstreak reward or should be disabled all together. I mean, it's WAY too easy to get a nuke in DOM or CTF because all you really need to do is put thermal on a LMG and sit in a corner somewhere.

* Let *players* host games! That way cheaters can be kicked by the host, or at least make it so that players can vote people to leave like Left for Dead did. 

Anyone else got ideas?

TL;DR: MW2 multiplayer is broken. Here's some ways it could be fixed.

1274156860.0,17,self.MW2,c5f2w,The Y (or Triangle) double tap,18,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c5f2w/the_y_or_triangle_double_tap/,"Thought I'd share it here, since I've realized a few of it's many advantages in MW2. 

A few popular uses double tapping Y (triangle) in MW2:

**Sniping**  
For those who are quickscoping/no scoping, if you double tap Y quickly, it actually centers the sniper rifle so your shot goes straight through the middle of your crosshairs (as it does not always do so when you no scope).  
** Reloads**  
If you get caught reloading a clip that isn't completely empty, and encounter an enemy, a quick double Y tap will cancel the reload and give you a chance at fighting back.     
**Search and Destroy**  
This one is probably my favorite reason for the Y double tap. When playing search, there is a such thing as ""ninja defusing,"" which consists of defusing a bomb within 5 seconds of it being planted. In order to do this, the most common setup is a class with cold blooded pro and ninja pro, so that you are completely invisible. A lot of people also use a sniper class for this because of the advantage of a ghillie suit. Then, what most people do, is find a nice spot to hide where they can keep their sight on the bomb and can't be spotted (such as the plants next to bomb site A in favela), and lay prone.  
When you lay prone, and constantly double tap Y, your body becomes more concealed as it forces your character to basically reach at his hip from the side, so that you take up less floor space.   
Ninja defusing is hilarious and satisfying, the reason I like doing it from time to time, and a double Y tap makes it a little more efficient.

I can't think of other reasons for the Y double as of now, but if you know something, let us know! Just thought these few tips would be helpful.

After 1, nothing appears to happen. I went ""eh?"", then figured it must be some kind of hacked lobby, so I bailed out. I join another game, and after dying I notice that my title has been changed to ""owned."", and my emblem is that of the direct-impact grenade launcher. I go to change it back to the normal, and **OH HOLY GOD FUCK.**

All my titles are gone, except the rank ones (FNG, SSDD etc), the country ones, and ""The Specialist"".


In ""Barracks"", my score is ""-1450520"", my wins is ""-691"", my kills is ""15154"" and my deaths is ""-19193"".

All my challenges have reset; both general and weapon-specific.


""Prestige"" has disappeared from the ""Challenges"" section.

In short; what the fuck just happened, and is there any way (other than starting afresh) that I can restore my account to how it was?

In the past, it was a rarity for me to end up in a hacked lobby. However, since Monday, I've ended up in at least 15+ lobbies where system tampering was obvious.

Here's what I've learned (because some people in lobbies are stupid enough to to talk about their new abilities with others):

* I've heard the term ""infection lobbies"" being thrown around a lot. I'm guessing that these ""capabilities"" are given to those who join these lobbies. i.e. they don't need a Jtag.
* ""Super Jump"" lobbies (where you can jump to extraordinary heights) seem to be all the rage at the moment.
* People who have joined these infection lobbies have their clan tag permanently set to [{@@}]. When playing in the same lobbies as these guys, you'll most likely witness spam text appearing on your screen at various points throughout the game (even if they're not the host). It'll say something along the lines of ""**TheirGT**: INFECTED BY SHARK ON **Web URL** | Team HCD"".
* From what I've learned, this text is displayed whenever the person presses the Select button on their controller. I heard two guys complaining about how the hack they're using doesn't allow them to see the scoreboard.
* The hack they're using allows them to see through walls (aimbot). It also gives them chrome colored guns.
* I've seen guys shooting Assault Rifle bullets out of the Intervention.

Whenever you see this text etc, be sure to file an XBL complaint under system tampering. I do it almost religiously whenever that text spams my screen. Whenever somebody with the [{@@}] clantag joins a lobby of mine, I message them and tell them to ""Fuck off with that shit."" Surprisingly, a number of them actually quit the lobby in response.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_gz77k,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/gz77k/hacking_on_mw2_xbox_live/,

I could try my hand at that, but I don't know how good I'll be at it. Also my setup is in the living room of my apartment, so it could be difficult with my roommates around.

I know hacking has always been an issue in MW2, but now it's a full scale problem. Usually a night of playing online would result in one or two encounters with hackers at best. However tonight and last night, almost every single match I tried to play was ruined by hackers.  
  
Lately I've been pretty much sticking to Demolition and Domination. Tonight I decided to play a bit of S&amp;D and the first match I landed in had me spectating the last man. It seemed normal except that every kill he got triggered a message in big red text across the screen. For instance, when he detonated a Claymore, it said *BANG and the dirt is GONE!*, made me laugh, lol. But then every match I tried to play afterwards was just hackers with aimbots. I've noticed that they seem to turn any game-mode into a Free-For-All -- or in any case, they make everyone (both teams) spawn at the same place so they can stand their with their invincibility killing everybody.  
  
Last night I found a hacker who was able to change the map during a match! While a match was loading with one map, he changed it to Highrise, then mid-game he changed to Sub Base. Then he was hovering up in the air with an aimbot and he must have accidentally activated super-jumping because I ran up some stairs and flew up into the air, but then he turned it off in time for me hit the floor and die.  
  
So I was trying all different kinds of game-modes but they're all full of hackers. I actually started having a decent Demolition match in Skidrow but then I notice how every enemy Care Package seemed to be a Chopper Gunner or AC-130. Then after previously getting 4 out of 4 clean headshots down the tunnel at the beginning of the match, I was now unable to kill someone after getting three headshots on them. needless to say, they were using invincibility -- yet for some reason they were trying to hide from me, lol. It's not so bad if you come across a fair hacked lobby, but they're extremely rare -- in fact I think it's probably accidental when they let you in. The mostly just show an on-screen message saying ""$5 access"" or something. The craziest one of these had a big pot leaf in the middle of the screen with text above it saying *YAY DRUGS!*, then the screen started rotating while the colours flashed between various negative image effects -- all the while it was raining AC-130 fire.
  
I know one thing that's worse than hackers though; *wannabe* hackers. Someone sent me a message saying, *'im gonna hack u'*. Surely sending the message in the first place just proves it's a lie?! This one's not related to hackers but is just as idiotic - I got a friend request that said, *'facking noob'* or something... WTF?  
  
Anyway, I guess this turned into a rant. I'm just gutted that MW2 is ending like this. I always imagined it would end because whatever controls the servers or whatever would stop (I have no idea about any of that technical stuff), not that the players would make the game completely unplayable. Still, I'm determined to go all the way, although I don't think I'll be purchasing any more *Call of Duty* titles until I have some sort of assurance that this shit won't be ignored in future.

It seems that people in forums like /r/mw2 spend their time bitching and moaning about unbalanced classes, etc, but I still haven't gotten bored with this game yet.  Sick of knifers?  Get a shotgun.  Change your game mode.  

Personally, I've gotten sick of the excessive taunting and celebrations in SnD.  Between Reach and PS3, the number of tards populating MW2 seems reduced, but every few games you'll find a kid who cracks his voice over ""camping"" or celebrating his rare victories with teabagging/magazine dumping/spinning/trash talking.  Instead of whining about it on /r/mw2, I started using claymores.

Playing [SnD Quarry](http://www.mw2blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Modern-Warfare-2-Multiplayer-Map-Quarry.jpg) yesterday, I had a game with a kid who spammed his mic with youth nonsense I no longer understand.  Every kill I got was ""camping"".  Every final kill he got involved 'bagging, spraying, jumping/spinning, and the screaming of ""F4GG0T"", and by every, I mean his only one.  

I was having a pretty good game, and had a spare UAV in the last round.  Out by ""Loading Bay"" I got the message that I was last alive, and I checked the score to see that I was going against 4, including the Little Shit.  I needed to clear out some before I could plant, but I had just over 1 minute on the clock.  I was already moving in on one by Back Road, so I got him from behind (sniping? really?) and used my UAV.  I had three other blips, one coming right at me from Offices' alleyway.  I met at the cargo container with a knife.  One more blip up by Garage, so I headed up Red Tanks and found him looking the wrong way on the rocks (sniping? again?).  After dropping him, the final blip (Little Shit) was far away enough that I ran down to plant at Offices, as the clock hit 10 seconds.  

I planted, dropped a claymore next to the bomb (in a rather obvious spot) and camped the desk corner.  Little Shit came by around 20 seconds on the bomb, and got lucky picking corners.  I got a hit marker on him, but his TAR beat my silenced M4.

Same with an emergency airdrop. Should you take one of the drops? Do you ask first?

I don't have any friends who play, so I'm often a lone wolf in a team game. Because of this, I often go Marathon, Cold-Blooded, Ninja with a Silenced UMP45. I struggle with the accuracy of the UMP often, anyone have tips to help with my gun control? Sometimes I feel not having Stopping Power puts me at a disadvantage, so I do roll other classes. Often Marathon/Scavenger/Sleight of Hand, Stopping Power, Ninja with Assault Rifles. I do find myself switching weapons a lot in order to complete challenges or because I hear X with Y attachment is better than what I'm using. I feel like I don't know what gun suits my style of play. Come to think of it, I don't know what my style of play is. I do like to help the team any way possible, so I find the behind enemy lines aspect of my stealth class if best suited to my play. But sometimes, I just like to shoot dudes. 

I also find myself coming out on the losing end of 1 on 1's. Should I employ a shoot first mentality? Whenever I see someone, just shoot unless I know it's a team mate? I don't play HC, so team damage isn't an issue. I did switch my controller set up so crouch is mapped to the right stick to make drop-shots easier. Have yet to take advantage of it on a regular basis. 

I'm by no means a terrible player (1.17 K/D, 4th Prestige), I just think I'm average and want to get better. I guess I'm just looking for methods that you guys employed to get better at the game, or other tips that you received that actually made a difference.

But with the blast shield not only do you have the 'con' of not getting an explosive/TI but on top of that you lose a lot of your vision and your mini-map. 

I wonder how many people would use it if it was passive protection (always 'on') and didn't change your screen/view at all.

It wasn't until somebody on my team got an AC-130 that I realised he was winning at 39-0 while the next best player was barely in the teens, and his name had no level or rank emblem next to it -- which is something I've seen a few times with hackers.  
  
Everything seemed normal up to then; until the AC-130 started raining infinite rockets, making the whole screen shaky for the entirety of its flight. Then the whole game suddenly went into fast-forward. Not just player movement, but the whole game -- sounds and everything -- and it was like 100x the speed. I couldn't even tell where I was going. I was in the snowmobile hut at B and by barely touching the stick I was at the greenhouses.  
  
The whole map was all dusty, like the aftermath of an explosion (or all the AC-130 fire) so I couldn't really see what I was doing anyway. He finally called his Nuke in which took about two seconds to hit and that was his only death.  
  
---  
  
**e:** Last night I found myself in another lobby with a hacker. But this time he kept turning different things on and off. For example, at first it was just him with an unlimited AC-130. He quickly got a Nuke which he then set the countdown at about 20 minutes. Up to now he was able to free-float through the air *and* through objects - like a ghost - but now he allowed everyone else to super-jump (both teams).  
  
His kills were into three figures with just one or two deaths but with all the super-jumping, it was almost impossible to hit anybody. Furthermore, our team had all the flags (Domination) and the other team didn't seem to be trying to get any so I ended up just standing on the highest ledge in Quarry (highest in the whole map that you can't usually get on) and just watching everything going on below. It was quite entertaining, LOL.  
  
The Nuke finally came down and my kills were barely into the teens. The hacker had about 600 to &lt;5 deaths.

Me and a friend/clanmate start out playing TDM and are both putting in work. I say ""Fuck it, I'll run some high killstreaks."" Pred missile, Harrier, AC130. I end up getting a 26 streak that game, so I ask him if he wants to try for a nuke in Dom. ""Sure."" He's a man of many words.

So we both set up some One Man Wonder kits (OMA with SP, CB, Hardline, Danger Close to put the game in Killstreak easy mode), and go into some Dom games. Took us maybe 2 games before we got a good lobby.

The match was on Estate, and our team was losing kinda hard the whole time because there were a lot of tubes and Commando kiddies going to town. I must have died like 8 times by the same MLC guy trying to get my streak. At this point I'm using Harrier, AC130, Nuke. My first Harrier doesn't do shit, and then of course gets shot down.

But then, the magic happened.

We spawn locked them at C (lower farm house) and I had just switched to my Hardline kit to get my AC. I pop a squat in the bushes and start going to town... but wait, I realize since they only have C, I'm right next to their only spawn. Oh God plleeeeeasse don't let them find me on that laptop. So now I'm racing to get the kills before the game ends, and trying to fend them off of me with the AC. They have about 180 pts then, so I'm hurrying. Of course they all spawn outside in a turn of luck, but my AC runs out of time right when I have like 21 kills (need 24 for nuke). I close the laptop, pull out my ACR, and turn around. They're all still spawning there. I'm maybe 20' away.

Fuck.

So, I spray some sniper with a Hardline ACR (herp derp weaksauce), start backpeddling shooting at people, get another guy, and then run out of ammo. Shhhhiiiiiiiit. Switch to the same kit with OMA while backing up... and here he comes. The Marathon Lightweight Commando all star of their team. NOOOOOOOO.

lol JK dropped a claymore, he gets hurt, I hipfire, get the nuke, teabag him while calling it in.

Feels good, man. Threw my controller in excitement and think I might've hurt it. So yeah. Nukes... not so hard on Dom. Definitely not as hard as I thought. Just gotta get the right lobby.

**tl;dr** cool story bro, OMA rape, first nuke, feels awesome, gonna try for some more.

**EDIT:** lol at everyone randomly downvoting. You stay classy, r/MW2.

**EDIT #2:** thanks for all the positive comments, guys (and gals if you're out there)! I tried for another last night, and *two games in a row* I got a 23 killstreak before we took the match. Gah! On the 2nd match I was shooting lucky #24 (remember, Hardline) when the match ended. I was maybe 2 bullets away from nuke #2.

A few night's ago, i was playing with maybe 1 or 2 other SyN guys, it is getting close to 4 a.m and i am starting to get exhausted. I never go for a nuke, to be honest; i have probably only gone for it twice. 

Well i had just finished the EMP challenge's and felt pretty good about myself. I changed up my kill streaks to 7(harrier) 11(chopper) and of course 25 (Nuke). 

Everything is going better then expected. We are playing Domination on Highrise. I get my harriers no problem, i get my chopper no problem. 

I mean these kids i played against were complete idiots, they didn't shoot down any of my air support. I am now up to 23 kills, just TWO more kills and i will be able to call in my first ever nuke.

I am in the building now where C dom is, i had just killed a guy at their spawn by the windows in the back. I needed a weapon bad, i had no more ammo, and i was not about to try and get my last two kills with a silenced USP. I grab his weapon, when i hear someone coming towards me. I crouch down and start to slowly move backwards in order to better position myself against him. As i am moving backwards, i move to far back and fall out the fucking window. 

My attempt at a Nuke was not thwarted by an enemy player, but because of my stupidity and not knowing exactly how close i was to the window; i cost my self a chance at gaining my first nuke.

I didn't throw a bitch fit, rage quit, or get super upset. The only thing i said into the mic was ""I fucking fail"". I have yet to try for another Nuke after that night, it's to soon. The wounds are still to fresh in my mind.

Here's my guess at why people are reluctant. So far we've been playing a lot of pub matches and it's fun because we don't take it seriously.


Competitive play means taking the game seriously, which might be a turn-off to casual players. Sometimes if I take a game seriously I get frustrated and do worse. Furthermore, since this is competitie, I'm guessing there will be try-outs, cuts, an A and B team, and some people won't make the cut. Right now we have an all-inclusive group. We usually have around 6-9 people together on a good day.


Competitive play also means playing the game differently than what most of us are used to. Banning perks and weapons means a new meta-game. Without the RPG you need a new way of efficiently clearing out large groups of people in one room. Without claymores (which are countered by SitRep+FMJ or flash/stun grenades) one needs a new way of guarding one's flank. I'd rather leave the game as the developers made it, but competitive play will come with changes to the actual gameplay.


Also, not everyone can commit their time to this game. Perhaps if enough people are free on Sundays and it becomes a regular playtime we can work something out. I'm idle so far this summer so I might as well take advantage of my free time rather than clicking away at the reddit frontpage for hours.


But in the end I like that rush of adrenaline that comes with high stakes and intense gameplay. Search and Destroy comes to mind - I've had moments where I was the last one left, and I've both pulled clutch plays and choked horribly. Either way it was intense but enjoyable.


I'd be willing to help organize [r/A*] if we have enough people interested. The PS3 folks (renamed [SyN]) managed to organize, so we should be able to as well. [SyN] might have to show us with the ropes, though :P

**TL;DR:** In response to previous threads, there are several reasons people might prefer casual to competitive play.

and in each game, people hated certain people that use certain weapons and certain tactics.

Lets take camping first, what the fuck is wrong with camping? it's not a endless map, it's not a huge world when one just sits and waits for the next noob to pass by just to get another frag.  I see camping as a legitimate way of playing, and especially in MW2, where running around the map like headless chicken will often get you killed, and fast. on top of that, EVERYBODY camps, [some people](http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c2v5l/confessions_of_a_camper/) do a it a lot more often, and sit at the same spot, some people (like I usually do), find a few nice spots on the map which I like, and stick to them, I may run around between them, I may just start running and looking for action if I'm bored, but if the tangos are coming in hot, I'll be sitting there like my ass was super glued, and hell, it's a nice spot, and I'm kicking some ass, what's wrong with that?

In CS and CS:S people really hated snipers, especially AWPers, now I can see why they hated them, it's annoying being shot by a weapon that is one-shot one-kill, but **that's in the game**, deal with it.  In MW2 it's the tubes, most call them noobtubes, most actually use them from time to time, and they are quite effective in the right hands, and quite useless in the hands of noobs, and if you think that it's that easy to *noobtube* the map, go ahead, and equip one. But usually those who shout at the tubers, are lamers who are annoyed at people who actually know how to use them, or am I wrong?

Oh yea, and don't forget about those who get annoyed if you're using a thermal scope, why the fuck are you annoyed? you want to play *pure*, go play with your clan, where you'll get banned if you use anything other than the iron sight, while you're playing at FFA or TDM, please, STFU or GTFO.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_c3ufq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c3ufq/ok_why_is_everybody_so_pissed_about_noobtubes_and/,

A little more communication between us would do wonders, and since Cystop has been kind enough to set all this up for us, it wouldn't even require that much work.

I know there was another thread similar to this, but this has the specifics and isn't so wishy-washy, Here's what I propose... 
  
**Loadout**  
  
* Riot Shield  
  
* RPGx2  
  
* C4  
  
* Stun Grenades *(Shield doesn't protect you from Flashes)*  
  
* Scavenger^PRO  
  
* Hardline^PRO *or* Danger Close^PRO  
  
* Last Stand^PRO  
  
* Martyrdom  
  
**Tactics**   

* Play TDM but only play maps with tight areas which are hard to infiltrate, such as Scrapyard (buildings); Favela (buildings); Derail (buildings); Highrise (tunnels); Karachi (alleys); etc.  
  
* Draw an enemy into an area with planted C4 and use Shield to protect yourself while blowing them up from just a few feet away.  
  
* Always save a Stun Grenade for when you go into Last Stand. Use it to kill yourself by dropping it near you. It should finish you off with a suicide -- thus, the opposing team gets no points.  
  
* The RPG is just for added lulz to use as you see fit -- Scavenger means you can go to town with it. Likewise, should Deathstreaks come into play, Martyrdom is the obvious troll-tastic choice but you could use Final Stand if you preferred.  
  
I haven't really thought about killstreaks, but some good choices could be Care Package and Emergency Airdrop to use as bait and catch enemies off guard (or to just spam the map with boxes). Alternatively, we could all use air support to get 14 kills (Hardline) with EMP equipped; depending on how good we are, we could potentially have the enemy looking at a fuzzy screen for most of the match. :)

Surely its not worth losing Ninja or SiteRep over?

Is it useful as a rush class for the pro benefit of delaying claymores?

* Set private match to minuscule health 
* 5 lives 
* forced respawn
* Killstreaks off
* and no perks (can elect for eveyone to use scavenger, stoping power, and ninja if you want, but we liked it more with no perks)


**CUSTOM CLASS**
* Any primary (smg if you're smart, but you wont use it in this game type) 
* Secondary has to be a pistol (we all used the magnum with FMJ)
* Equipment needs to be a throwing knife


**GAME RULES**
* No primary weapons
* You get one shot from your secondary weapon, If you miss you have to use your throwing knife or regular knife to get a kill
* Once you get a kill you get one more bullet
* Last persone alive wins, and gets to pick the next map

Its not perfect. You do have to use the honor system, but if you playing with your friends it shouldn't be that hard. We had a total blast last night and thought i should share it with you. Have fun!

Don't get me wrong, you should be rewarded for getting kill streaks, but not with somthing that guarantees you another 10+ kills. Maybe for each kill added to your streak, you gain more points. Say for example if you're on a 5 kill streak, every kill after that would be worth 200xp instead of 100xp, and so on.

I, personally, would rather kill streak rewards were completley removed from the game, that way the player with the most skill comes first, rather than losing to some campers with a CG in the air. (But as this will never happen, I'll just stick to Barebones.) If I was in a position to choose which streaks were in the game, I'd have UAV, C-UAV, Pred, Persicion Airstrike and Attack Heli.

The recoil makes it run away from you, and the red dot sight is awful.

I was firmly of this opinion, but knew I'd have to use it eventually, and dreaded that moment. I've been working on unlocking all attachments for all weapons (mastery challenge I think?) and the F2000 was the last AR that I was planning on using. Just to give you some insight into my preferences, I used the M4 pretty much exclusively for a long time, but when using the other weapons for challenges, I really liked the AK, and couldn't stand using the Scar or Tar, despite the fact that for some reason most people seem to use those.

So, I get to the F2000, and after unlocking the holo sight, I don't know what happened, but this thing is amazing, I love it. I feel like it's quick, picks up quick even without sleight of hand, and kills very quick at close range, and it's not too hard to burst fire at longer ranges.

I don't know what it is about it, but I think the F2000 has been seriously underrated, and if you always just wrote it off, I think it's worth it to give it a try. I've been doing so much better with it while trying to unlock all attachments than I did with the scar or tar.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_c2mwr,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/c2mwr/f2000_dont_knock_it_till_youve_tried_it/,

Akimbo Magnums should be equipped when using last stand or Riot Shield.  Last stand with the magnums gives you a massive amount of firepower in the blink of an eye.  Handguns are the only weapons you can use while in Last Stand, and the akimbo mag's are the best balance of firepower and recoil.  Also, in riot shield classes, you'll appreciate the fast switch times when your opponent hesitates or reloads.

Akimbo G18's are the best secondary in the game.  Some say it's cheating, but I play to win and the G18's are the best way to achieve that goal.

Counter UAV is the best killstreak reward.  There's really no better way to frustrate the entire team than with counter UAV.

When throwing a care package, I swear you're more likely to get a high killstreak by throwing the care package marker near enemy troops.  I can't source this, but over the last few weeks I've done everything I can to make sure this is accurate, and so far it's worked.  If you find a nice secluded corner away from everyone, you're going to end up with an ammo, uav, or airstike.  I know they say it's random, but give it a try.

Ammo care package and tactical insertion make great traps.  This goes along with using the care package around enemy troops.  If it turns out to be a dud (ammo, uav) you can leave it and pick the enemy off while they try and snag it.  I'll use a tactical insertion in the middle of a room and force the player to make a choice between camping it, finding me, or destroying the TI.  They'll usually hesitate long enough for an easy kill. 

Scavenger and Slight of Hand are your two most powerful 1st perks.

Cold Blooded and Stopping Power are my two most used 2nd perks.  (lightweight and hardline are cool, but I generally only equip them on my Riot class)

Ninja and Last Stand are my two most used 3rd perks

Stinger &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Javelin

M21 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every other sniper rifle

The downside is that only three or four of us play it, and we need some more people. It's great fun.

How to download AlterIW

*     Know how to use a BitTorrent client
*     Download [this](http://staff.alteriw.net/tracker/torrents/aIW-Client.torrent) (TORRENT LINK)
*     Unzip the file once downloaded
*     Run the 'alterIWnet_configure.exe' and enter a nick name
*     Run the ""iw4mp.exe' and you're done :)

We usually play in Domination and Arena servers.

NOTES: Steam not required, this doesn't have anything to do with Steam nor interferes with the Steam retail version of MW2PC. Also, both DLC packs are included in alterIWnet.

I know it's somewhat frowned upon, but I felt like rushing around the map taking people out ninja style for a change and I wanted to play with the P90 again -- it used to be my only weapon but before last night I hadn't used it since my second or third prestige. Both Nukes were in Demolition matches with the same loadout;  
  
* P90^Extended_Mags  
* Magnum^Tactical_Knife  
* Semtex  
* Stun Grenades  
* Marathon^Pro  
* Lightweight^Pro  
* Ninja^Pro  
  
* Harrier // Chopper Gunner // Nuke
  
The first one was extremely easy/quick but I reckon it was my best ever. Defence in Rundown; I sprinted straight over the South bridge and threw a stun ahead of me. Got a hit marker and knifed the guy coming through the Boat House then waited just by the doorway and knifed two or three more dudes coming the same way.  
  
Got my Harrier pretty quickly and by the time I had ran up inside the Drug Store and got a couple of long-range P90 kills, I had the Chopper. From then it was just a case of going prone amongst the Palms and let 'er rip. I'm usually rubbish with the CG/AC-130 and both of my previous Nukes have barely scraped the 25 mark, but this time, I got at least a good half a dozen extra after getting the Nuke.  
  
Called that baby in and BOOM! **CONNECTION TO SERVER TIMED OUT OR SOME SHIT**. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; Yeah, some prick dashboarded during the countdown. I wasn't too bothered though -- I called it in and that's all that mattered to me really.  
  
The other Nuke was in Invasion and was a *lot* more scrappy. Almost ran out of P90 ammo at one point and managed to kill one last guy and take his TAR-21. I had already used my Harrier and CG but I had no idea what my streak was up to so every kill was super tense, lol. The last one was actually extremely risky -- I was hovering around the Boutique and I knew there was a sniper camped up around the Convoy. I couldn't really see him but I ran out from cover and partially blind-fired at where I thought I last saw his UAV blip. I guess I got lucky. This was the second round so I kept the Nuke until the final 10 seconds of the last round -- the enemy team was pretty badly spawn trapped at the Gas Station/Parking Lot by this point so it was sweet. 
  
Funnily enough, I've gotten all my Nukes with the P90!

The killcams showed some 360 spinning sniper asshole just spinning in circles racking up the knife kills.  This happened about 3 times in a row before I left the game.  Now, the scroller at the bottom of my screen shows something about a ""sick hacked lobby"" and to visit some website to check out their hacks.  The name was something like ""dangerouz"" or ""dangerboyz"" or ""fucking asshole"", or something like that.

* The knife should be added as a secondary weapon. This means that a player will have to equip the knife before being able to use it. In COD BO campaign, the main character is running around with a knife in his hands. This is far better than allowing those who frantically mash their controllers/keyboards the ability to ""Panic Knife"" others. 

* All crutches should be taken out of the game. Painkiller, Last Stand, Second Chance, Martyrdom, Last Chance etc. People should not be awarded or saved because they were shot-up. They should learn not to die. End of story.

* Killstreaks should not count towards other killstreaks.

* Get rid of the ""dogs"" killstreak. If a player camps and earns himself the dogs, then there is very little that an enemy player can do, besides find a hiding spot. If you're in a FFA, the game is effectively over in most cases because you can't take out your missile and take them down. You can only wait until they finish tearing the other enemy players to pieces. Basically, all killstreak awards should be destructible (i.e. leading to the end of the killstreak).

* Equipment choices should be winded down. It's getting ridiculous at the moment. You have claymores, motion sensors, jammers and camera spikes etc. Take away sensors/monitors altogether and make players work for a UAV. The camera spike is nasty. The jammer is ok because it forces the player to come out of his/her shell. Claymores should ALWAYS have a delay before they explode, even if it's just a second.

* Overpowered shotgun primaries or underpowered shotgun secondaries.

* Less places to hide. Provide cover etc. Provide the odd room here and there, but don't do what Black Ops did and give the player hundreds of nooks and crannies to hide in. Make it straightforward - ""There are three buildings on this map. Two of them have a second floor."" That's it.

* No handicaps on sniper rifles, bar the exclusion of Sleight of Hand Pro.

* Killstreaks can only ""kill"" at 5+. No more RC Car bullshit.

All in all; the game should favor fast-paced/fun/flowing gameplay.

It's not just that the game has no boosters, or no oma+dangerclose+noobtubers, as the game has it's own problems (the f'ing frags). No, it's the whole feel of it. Blops is balanced, MW2 is fun &amp; awesome, but CoD4 is the core of what makes the CoD games what they are. I can't really describe it that well, but let's just take a quick story:

It's overgrown. It's dark times, our team is pinned down and the enemy is nearing our positions. I'm holding my trusty M40A3. We're at the barn, at the north of the map. I jump out at the right and quickly scan the area. It's suspiciously empty. I slowly move through the hayfield, keeping myself behind the haystacks. I can almost hear the enemies, their shots from afar. But it's not towards me. My team's getting hammered, and I want to help them. But I must move with caution. Going all Rambo in the middle of the map won't help anyone. I sprint towards the shed, and i spot two enemies. They're close, too close. I manage to jump down towards the grass, slowly sneaking around their position unnoticed. The grass cover and my ghillie suit are working in perfect harmony. Slow but sure i move unnoticed. I slowly turn around and raise my scope, they haven't seen me. I pull the trigger, and I laughed a bit, as the enemy teammate sees his teammate die before him. He's fucked, and he knows it. I let him turn around, and then I end his life. More enemies are moving forward, forward to an unseen doom. I once again take them out. It all went so quick that i didn't even notice any of the killstreaks beeping in. I dropped down to my hide, and reloaded. I'm breathing heavily, my hands are shaking and my heart is pounding, and this is where i realize why I love this game.

Well, what about you guys? I do realize time from time that CoD4 isn't a perfect game, and I do get the same moments in MW2. For some reason Black Ops hasn't been that exhilarating.

1285969267.0,11,self.MW2,dlolt,S&amp;D Tips,12,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dlolt/sd_tips/,"These are some tips for anyone just starting to play S&amp;D.

I'll start off with two basic things I have found to be very helpful when playing S&amp;D:

- A player is able to switch classes, assuming they have neither fired a bullet nor used any equipment, for the first 20 seconds of the round, (may be longer, not sure). If you are a player who, like me, seldom uses cold blooded on their usual S&amp;D class then make the most of this grace period and switch to a cold blooded class when opposing players call in kill streaks too soon. I find this to be highly beneficial and usually do it at least once a game. That said, you should still pay attention to the scoreboard at the end of each round to see if anyone may have obtained any kill streaks, enabling you to switch classes preemptively.

- The second general tip is that when crouched or ADS, you have silent footsteps. If you are using a class without ninja, knowing this is essential as it allows you to sneak up on players defending a planted bomb.

As for the best perks to use, I would highly recommend marathon for your blue spot. In S&amp;D, getting from place to place quickly is very important as you may find yourself having to run all the way across the map to pick up the bomb some asshole dropped trying to spawn tube. Also, it gives you the ability to show up in places quicker than the opposing players will expect you to be there, giving you the drop on them.

For the red perk I find hardline to be great, surprisingly. Kill streaks are very useful in S&amp;D and the ability to pile them up quickly is fantastic. A lot of players use stopping power instead of cold blooded so getting kills with them is fairly easy. They are also a very useful tool when defending a freshly planted bomb. As mentioned above, the ability to switch to a cold blooded class early in the round means you don't need to waste the spot on cold blooded.

As for the green perk, NINJA, without a doubt. Heartbeat sensors are all over the place in S&amp;D, and with only one life, you don't want to put yourself at any preventable disadvantage. Sit-rep is really the only other one you may want to consider as there are a lot of explosives used. I only use sit-rep if playing with a team in order to call out spots of claymores and C4 to whomever is rushing.

I won't really say anything about what guns to use, just go with what you are comfortable with on any particular level. I will however, say that silencers are not as necessary as you may think, although they are helpful. If not using one, realize that opposing players may flock to your location when you fire, use this to your advantage. Get a kill, run a decent bit away (thanks to marathon), look back and see if you can pick off some greedy bastard. Also use your fire as misdirection.  In a clutch situation, run to one bomb site, shoot a couple rounds, then take off to the other site, plant and set up camp.

As for equipment, I would highly recommend using claymores. As you do not respawn until the next round, your claymore stays active even after you die, enabling you to pick up kills even after you have died, thus helping the team.

Most players here really seem to be hung up on Domination and TDM, but I would really recommend S&amp;D. It has some great benefits, such as limited camping, the necessity to plant or defuse the bomb within the 2:30 time rounds really helps cut this down. I have also noticed that there tends to be less use of the noob-tube as the repeated firing gives away your position. All things considered it is a great game, good for playing with a friend switching off each round, as well as having great drinking game potential.

Feel free to add anything you have found to help you in your S&amp;D experience.  

Edit: I forgot to mention the infamous ninja defuse. Sometimes opposing players will hide near the bomb site utilizing the switch weapon double tap until you plant the bomb. As soon as the bomb is planted most players run away to a hiding spot, enabling the ninja defuser to sneak up and defuse before you know what happened. So be sure to look back immediately after planting to prevent this, and make the other player look like an ass in the process.

No-scope/quick scoping- pretty self-explanatory 

Michael Myers- Its basically tag. One person is ""Michael Myers,"" they run around with marathon/lightweight/commando (tactical knife is recommended) and tries to kill everyone else who is running around the map like crazy. Mike Myers is only allowed to kill by knifing or throwing knife. Once it is down to one on one, the other person is allowed to try to kill Michael but, again, they are only allowed to use knife or throwing knife.

Simon says is also a possibility. If you guys have any other suggestions for game types post them.

Send me a friend request, Dan_Gaysac.

EDIT: Ah yes thank you im_on_fire, i forgot about dodgeball on Favela. Everyone meets at the soccer field.

Every other player seems to complain about

- People not working as a team
- People not capturing enough objectives
- People quick-scoping
- People using grenade launchers
- People using One Man Army
- People trash talking
- People using commando
- People using UMP
- People hinding in rocks

What this essentially is, is a complaint that ""people won't play the game how I like to play it"" - which to me seems rather childish and takes me right back to the playground.

Whilst I can empathize with people if they truly feel their game is being ruined by these things,  the ability for individuals to have such diverse gameplay, weapon selection and tactics is what makes games like MW2 incredible compared to those of 1999.

If you don't like x,y &amp; z - then team up with a group of similar players and play with them, surely that is more proactive than constantly crying about nobody playing how you want to play.

There is always going to be elitism and disagreements in threads, if it offends you - I suggest you don't reply. You will only end up angering yourself.

1279044144.0,12,self.MW2,cp4xt,"Rambling thoughts on ""camping""",14,2,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/cp4xt/rambling_thoughts_on_camping/,"Camping has become the goto insult in MW2. If I get an AC130 I get called a camper. It has nothing to do with anything I actually did during the match; I didn't die and therefore I get called a camper.

I find this ridiculous but it doesn't really bug me. But now I am beginning to wonder what, exactly, camping *is* and why people find it so objectionable. The following are my two cents. I am not the expert and the floor is open for all discussions on the subject.

First and foremost: I do not think camping is cheating because it isn't. But I also do not consider it cheap. After giving [Sirlin's Playing to Win](http://www.sirlin.net/ptw) a read through I realized that camping is plenty of awful things but it is *not* cheap.

Secondly, I think camping is a poor strategy. It doesn't work. Most of the people that camp kill me have a negative kill-death spread. They are doing more harm to their TDM team than good.

Those points out of the way, what has camping actually become in MW2? People looking out of a window and waiting for someone to walk by? If this is true, *how do you know they are camping?* When I kill someone the killcam will probably show me standing still shooting. This is for a variety of reasons but most of it comes down to good strategy:

* I know you are there
* You don't know I am here
* If I wait five seconds I get a low-risk kill

This isn't camping.

Adding more specifics to the camping label doesn't help too much. If camping is ""staying in the same spot for half a minute"" there isn't much you can do to know that someone is a camper. You get to see the killcam. If, for some stupid reason, the same guy kills you from the same location than the odds of him being a camper are higher. But this still happens all the time for legitimate reasons.

I play mostly pickup games in Mercenary TDM. People there have no concept of teamwork. You will get completely abandoned by your team and end up in enemy territory surrounded by spawn after spawn.

* I know you are there
* You don't know I am here
* I am not going to run out of cover; I am going to kill you

After you realize I am there, logically I am going to:

* Find the best cover I can
* Wait for a chance to get the hell out of there
* Kill anyone who comes looking for me

I am not a camper because I get stuck in a room by myself and happen to outdraw five people in a row.

Likewise, if I kill you and you rage over to find me because you think I am camping:

* I know where you will be
* You don't know where I am because I moved
* I get a low-risk kill

All of this being said, I am not trying to convince myself that camping does not exist. Obviously, it does. But a strong majority of the time what looks like camping is being smart, being cautious, or being attentive. UAV, Heartbeat Sensors and SitRep Pro make it pretty easy to notice someone running down a hallway all by themselves.

But standing in the same spot for the entire match looking at the same tunnel from the same window is camping. Running all the way across the map to get to your spot and then waiting is camping. (Unless you are using a sniper rifle. Then it is sniping.)

The reason I am bringing this up is because the gut reaction ""CAMPER!"" will hurt your game. There may be a significantly more relevant reason you just died. Instead of turning off your brain and turning on the rage *learn* as much as you can about the situation.

In event that someone *is* camping, rage away and do whatever you must, but before that think *maybe* there is a reason behind the behavior. The hardest to detect non-campers are the ones that know where you are going because they have been fighting with you for the last seven games. They know your classes and they know where you like to move. They can accurately predict your movement and plan ahead so they are aiming a gun down the hallway that you just cornered.

The best players do this without having ever played against you. They can predict your movement based on the hundreds of games they have under their belt because, at the end of the day, humans follow patterns and there are only so many viable patterns on any given level.

When people blame me for camping I smile. It means that I am so much better than they are that my movements are magic to them and they cannot perceive the deeper strategy involved. And, honestly, I suck at the game so I have no idea why they haven't figured this out already.

TLDR: Good, solid gameplay may look like camping from the killcam. Maybe you just suck.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,False,,,True,t3_cp4xt,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/cp4xt/rambling_thoughts_on_camping/,

All they seem to do is chat shit, complain about and call anybody who stays in an area/room for more than 5 seconds, a ""fucking camper"", ""fucking noob"" and other variations, and generally just piss me off.

Nearly every game of SnD I get abuse, in the verbal form and through various messages.

Today in one game, two guys kept shouting I'm a camper, noob and all that because of a headshot on both; after hearing shots and seeing teammates fall, I camped it out and blasted both as they ran past with the spas-12. Does camping here make me a bad player? I don't think so, they should have been watching where they were going.

Sure I could mute them, but the messages kept coming. Even from one of my own teammates who said, ""fucking noob, even your own teammates hate you.""

So fuck it, I stuck with the lobby, being pretty skillful with the noobtube, decided to bring out the killer noobtube OMA/Danger close class in the hope of pure ownage. Derail = double kill spawntube, followed by 4in1 spawntube on Karachi, round won; they all left, and another player added me, congratulating me on tanking him and his team. 

Has anyone else experienced this with SnD or any other game mode for that matter? 

On a last note.. camping is legit, and if you hate campers, maybe take a look at your own playing style, and learn to counter them.

Scar with Noob-tube
Thumper
Stuns
C4
Sleight of Hand (gotta get the noob-tube grenades out FASTER)
Danger Close (BOOM)
Ninja Pro (silent footsteps)

I joined an FFA and spawned into a furious hellfire of Pavelow and Chopper Gunner in Skidrow courtesy of a guy named ""DazzNaztee"".   I watched my kill cam in HORROR as the guy had his THREE co-boosters running up underneath his chopper and LAYING DOWN so he could get a headshot with the chopper gunner.   Within twenty seconds of spawning, and running around looking for the guys while getting killed, the guy hit the nuke button.   

Game over.

We went back to the lobby and everyone spouted ""CHEATER FAGS!!!"" and left...but I stayed...

Next game was Invasion.   I knew just where they'd go.   I spawned and headed for the building with the sandbags near the gas station and waited for them to start running down the bridge where all the Humvees are.   Sure enough, they did.

THOONK!

Hit a hummer and killed two of them, but the other two were further back.   I hit the deck behind some sandbags by a tree-planter and chucked my C4 and shot off some rounds from the Scar to get their attention.   I took a peek-a-boo after a few seconds and saw a ghillie suit crouched behind the fence and blew the C4.  

You killed DazzNaztee. 

Insta-JUSTICE!!!

They all left simultaneously leaving me to continue on to a 9 kill streak for my Pavelow before getting knife-witched.

Do they not realize that other players take extra pleasure in killing them? Do they not realize that some players will target them specifically, just to hear them rant and rave over the headset?

I joined a FFA lobby today and one guy (who had won the previous game) had his microphone on. After I joined the lobby, I won 5 or 6 games in a row (primarily because nobody bothered to take down my air support). He wasn't happy. It all started when I killed him twice in the space of a few seconds in Terminal. After killing him the second time, he calmly stated: ""I hate you Wayne"". Later on in the same game, I killed him a few more times; and each time, he'd complain even more and shout out things such as ""Wayne!"" or ""Oh look. It's Wayne AGAIN."" It was when I put an end to one of his killstreaks (seen the buzzkill) that he became even more irritated and started with the name calling, saying stuff such as ""You fuckin' cunt Wayne"" and ""That fuckin' batty boy"". At this stage, I was taking great pleasure in killing him and listening to his outbursts. In Sub Base, he got so annoyed that he started accusing me of using an aimbot, saying things such as ""Wayne, you aimbotting twat!"", just because I was quicker with my aim. He even took to trying to use the RPG when going into one on ones against me. In Quarry, another random guy with his microphone on joined the lobby and the two of them started arguing with one another over nothing. This went on for a while until I bagged a double kill by spraying both of them: It was then that they both became the best of pals and united in their complaints about me. The other guy kept running a Lightweight, Marathon, Commando /Tac Knife class and I kept killing him before he'd get the chance to knife me. He too started swearing like a sailor . Before I was about to leave and power off my XBox, they started talking about me and ""my aimbot"" in the lobby, so I switched on my microphone and asked the guy to explain why he thought I was using one. His reply was ""Because you kept shooting me before I could shoot you."" Seriously?

I really don't get it. The reason I keep my microphone off during most games is because I don't want to let others hear me complain whenever something doesn't go my way. Yes, FFA can be one of the most frustrating game modes. The respawns are bad, it brings out the worst in players and sometimes a game can become too hectic.

I planted a claymore beside the bomb spot and then planted the bomb. However, after planting, that glitch where the bomb appears in your hands again happened as I was trying to scramble away and I ended up getting nailed by an LMG. The guy with the LMG knew I was the last guy left on my team, so he just started shooting the air, my dead body etc and spinning around. He even teabagged me. After all of his showing off, he decided that he'd defuse the bomb. He ran straight into my claymore (which was left by the bomb site) and nearly got blown back into the bunker. I laughed my ass off so hard at that point I nearly started crying. His other friend at this point was the last man left, so it was up to him to defuse the bomb. The funny thing was, he mustn't have known that I was the last guy left. He knew his friend had died so maybe that had him on edge, thinking someone was guarding that area.

We were losing pretty badly.   I was like, ""WTF?"" then I looked and saw that two of my team mates were on the opposite side of the map behind the gas station on Overgrown.   I went over there to find an enemy squatting in a corner with a tac insert under him and two of my team mates in opposite corners.   I killed the one enemy and called my guys over.   Some showed and then the booster enemy came back and I killed him again.

This is where it's different from other booster stories.   I squatted near some crates against the gas station building and the boosters on my team blocked me in!   I couldn't move!   I was stuck for the longest 15 seconds in my life.   At any moment, the enemy booster would show up and have an easy time killing me since I couldn't see shit with these two assholes in my way.   

Luck and fate was on the side of the righteous ones.   The enemy booster threw a grenade as he came out of the ditch and it stuck to the gas station pump which blew up as he ran towards it, killing him and his two buddies, but didn't touch me.

My mate says that it's easier to get the kills with stopping power so I was wondering what you thought. I probably won't change it back if you all disagree with me because it's working for me but I am curious if anybody else uses it.

The First Map will be:  **HIGHRISE**


**Please note from this point on you are responsible for your own team.  If you have players that do not show up to your practice or your game, that is on you.  I encourage you all to work together to make this work.**

1267496509.0,10,self.MW2,b810p,Advice from my COD4 days.,12,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/b810p/advice_from_my_cod4_days/,"The first shooter that I played, for any considerable amount of time, was Bond on the N64. That was about 13 years ago. I played damn near every shooter between that and COD4 that had a multiplayer, and some that didn't. I thought that I was king ding-a-ling because I was able to consistently beat all of my friends. I played Halo 1 online through private servers. I played Halo 2 and PDZ as well, but rarely ran into any real competition. My head continued to inflate as I destroyed just about everyone I went up against. To this day I haven't played any PC shooters and apparently this is where the competition was to be had. That was until I picked up COD4

I beat the solo campaign on the hardest difficulty in order to get the hang of it, with relative ease. I started up the multiplayer on FFA expecting it to be more difficult than the campaign, but I had no reason to think I would get smashed... thoroughly What I didn't expect was to have my shit pushed in. The guys on COD4 played on a level unlike any shooter previous. My ass was getting gift wrapped and handed back to me. 

For the longest time this trend of ass kickery continued. I made lots of friends, had a lot of fun, but failed to improve my game. I wasn't content with losing 1 or 2 of every 4 FFA matches, so I tried camping. I tried run and gun. I tried claymores, c4, 203, TDM, Domination, S&amp;D and everything else that I could think of. I was getting beat up like a redheaded step child, daily. 

Then one night I was playing FFA with a long time XBL friend named dcCharlie. Charlie was an old school gamer. My first system was the NES. Charlie first started playing on the Atari 2600. He had the voice of a late night Jazz radio host. You know the voice, like the guy had been smoking cigars for 50+ years. Scruffy and deep I guess you'd say. He was ghetto too. I mean fried chicken and collards ghetto. He wasn't at all disrespectful like you hear these kids today.  

Anyhow, I'm playing FFA one night with dcCharlie and he's owning everyone like only the best can do. I asked him what I could to improve my game. I told him everything I had done to change my situation. He then gave me three words of advice on how to change my strategy and has improved my game hundreds of times over. Here's what he said, ""I don't man, *Shoot fasta, nigga*

Shoot fasta, nigga. I don't know why I hadn't thought of that. In any case, I took his advice and ran with it. I didn't know it at the time, but reaction speed is a skill that can be practiced and improved upon over time. So that's what I did. I analyzed my game play and learned how to shoot fast which, of course, allows me to take targets down faster than they can take me down. Considering we meet up at high noon, hands on holstered six shooters. 

So, you want to improve your game? Work on your reaction time. I'm not surprised at the amount of people who don't consider this and only practice this skill subconsciously. Anything you can do to cut your reaction time down, makes it that much more difficult for your opponent to win the engagement. He are some things you can do. 

Learn to strafe around active corners while already aiming down your sights. As I'm sure you know, aiming down your sights makes you more accurate than firing from the hip. If you are able to do this while turning populated corners, especially where enemies are camping, you are more likely to get an accurate shot off. An example of this is near the C flag on terminal. If you are coming from the lobby, there is a good chance people will be camping around Burger town. If you're coming from the metal detectors, there is a good chance that the enemy will be camping at the top of the escalator. 

If you are the second person to make it to the engagement, as in the enemy is there before you, then you are likely to find the enemy posted up behind cover while aiming down their sights. Give yourself every opportunity to even the odds. You are already at a disadvantage. Oh, don't forget to throw those flash bangs and stun grenades! 

Next, when confronting an enemy while on the run, learn to pull your ""shoot trigger"" at the same time as your ""aim trigger"" Don't wait until you have your sights trained on the enemy before you pull the trigger. If you pull both at the same time, then you will cut the time it takes your bullets to reach them by as much as you possible can. (Considering you are accurate)

Make sure your gun is always between chest and head range when running around. If your gun is too far to the left, right, up, or down, it will take that much longer to get a lock on your target.

Slight of Hand Pro offers you the ability to ADS (aim down sights) quicker. So, play with that if you're not really needing the alternatives of the first perk. 

Remember Reaction Time is more skill than an inherent ability. With enough practice there won't be anyone you can't kill. 

TL;DR

**Pro Tip: ""Shoot fasta nigga!""**

after the game, i backed out and messaged him just to say that it was fucking hilarious, and he responded with some more butthurt saying he played to WIN (which we did win so idk why he said that) and he spent his money he'll play how he wants blah blah blah.

1308431806.0,9,self.MW2,i35rx,Good news everybody - the new Reddit gamertag/id site is now fully functional. It has also been given some new features.,17,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/i35rx/good_news_everybody_the_new_reddit_gamertagid/,"In relation to the [notice post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/hyk1j/rmw2_notice_gamertagsfinding_other_redditors_to/) that was posted a few days ago, concerning the app over at [RedditGaming.net](http://www.redditgaming.net). Basically, I've added a number of features and fixed a few bugs.

**Search Features**

When it was first launched, you could only search by Platform, Timezone and Microphone. Shortly after the site was launched, a bug in the advanced search feature had reared its ugly head and forced me to take the entire thing down. Basically, the search feature was showing duplicate results. Fortunately, I managed to pinpoint the problem and fix it. This means that you can now search by:

- Platform
- Timezone
- Microphone
- Preferred Games (MW2, Black Ops etc.)
- Preferred Game Modes (TDM, Dom, FFA etc.)

i.e. you can now narrow down results and find Redditors that compliment your own Call of Duty gaming habits.

**Hosting**

When the site was first launched, it was situated on a crappy free web host. This meant that the application was sometimes slow and unresponsive. In fact, a few hours after I announced the site, I was forced to rewrite certain pieces of code/database queries; just because the free host in question had crappy default settings that brought the site down. Thankfully, a fellow Redditor (Reddit user [jargoone](http://www.reddit.com/user/jargoone)) was more than willing to give us free space on his hosting plan. He also registered a domain name (http://redditgaming.net) for the site. This was all done out of his own pocket, so may he bask in a million upvotes!

**Profiles**

Everyone that has submitted their details now has a ""profile"" of sorts. This profile details all of the information that you have submitted to us. In the future, jargoone and I hope to scrape services such as XBox Live for information on recent played games etc. It is hoped that this ""profile"" will help Redditors make more informed decisions on who to add as friends on XBL, PSN, Steam etc

**Login**

You can now login (using the password you registered with) and update your preferences and details. Sick of Domination? Well now, you can login and delete it from your preferred game modes. Entered the wrong details? No problem. 

**CSS**

The app can now be used to generate CSS for Call of Duty subreddits. The feature is available to anyone who is logged in. This means that COD subreddits can now generate the CSS that shows gamertags beside Reddit usernames. I might also add in a feature that chooses people at random, so that the gamertag CSS on subreddits can be changed once at week (i.e. we can rotate who has their gamertags shown beside their usernames so that everyone gets a look-in).

It is hoped that this system can act as the hub for all Call of Duty subreddits.

1304000340.0,8,self.MW2,gzbfv,The definitive answer: Why the M16+Holo is superior to the FAMAS.,12,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/gzbfv/the_definitive_answer_why_the_m16holo_is_superior/,"There is a lot of misconceptions and straight up untruths, with the M16 and FAMAS. I've read a lot of false or misleading information from numerous websites. These include the common myth, that M16 fires faster bursts, but slower in between bursts. WRONG! This is BS, all burst guns have the same burst speed, ROF, and damage. Only difference is when damage drop occurs. This is why you can 1 burst someone from across the map with a Raffica (coincidentally, my favorite sidearm). 

However, in the VAST majority of situations, the M16+Holo is superior to the FAMAS + Any sight. Let me explain. Let's assume you're using a standard load for burst guns:

1. SoH Pro
2. SP Pro
3. Ninja Pro

SoH halves reload time, and makes ADS equal for all guns. However, there is still slight differences for them. The M16 has a faster switchout time, as well as noticeably faster reload time. Most importantly though, the M16 + Holo has less recoil than the FAMAS + RDS and a much tighter bullet spread. This leads to better accuracy. Just compare the recoil patterns:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DSvlq_sEf0

It's true that the FAMAS has better range, but the advantage is minimal. Consider [the ranges of the two guns](http://denkirson.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=613).

The FAMAS has ONLY a 10 meter advantage over the M16, unless the person your shooting happens to be in that range (between 47-57 meters), the M16 is superior. This means in the VAST majority of situations, especially the two extremes (CQC/medium-short, and long range), the M16 + Holo is a better choice than the FAMAS due to the reasons I gave above. 

Also another thing to consider, even though the FAMAS has better damage between 47 and 57 meters, the M16 has a tighter bullet spread. Considering both guns are either a 2-3 bullet kill, the next to no bullet spread of the M16 really helps it out and almost negates the damage advantage of the FAMAS as it will be a one burst kill anyways.

Just for the record, I have gold titles with both M16 and FAMAS, both gotten legitimately, so I've used both guns A LOT. Matter of fact, I got the gold title for the FAMAS before the M16. I wouldn't give up the much tighter bullet spread of the M16 Holo for a slight damage advantage IF AND ONLY IF the enemy is between a 10 meter window (47 to 57 meters). It's just not worth it. 

To summarize:
Between 0-47 meters: M16 + Holo &gt; FAMAS
Between 47-57 meters: FAMAS &gt; M16 + Holo
57 meters and further: M16 + Holo &gt; FAMAS

In 80%+ of the situations, the M16 Holo is a better choice than the FAMAS + Any sight.

EDIT: Wow, lots of helpful replies thanks!

To give you more background I am ultimately looking for a silenced gun to run with Cold Bloodied Pro. I love the ACR silenced, but without SP it loses to much and often the person being picked off can get to cover even if my aim stays locked on target tracing their path. The Scar-H is an awesome gun,  but the clip size is not so great for tastes. I do have extended mags unlocked on the Scar-H but that would mean no attachment slot for my silencer.

I think what I will do is try running with these two guns:

Tar-21 Silenced
| Slight of Hand Pro
|Cold  Bloodied Pro
|Ninja Pro

UMP
|Scavenger Pro
|Cold  Bloodied Pro
|Ninja Pro

I will use the UMP on near on all maps and use the Tar for the bigger maps such as wasteland and Afghan.",,False,,t5_2r3qb,True,,,True,t3_dqwcv,http://www.reddit.com/r/MW2/comments/dqwcv/so_which_silenced_guns_assault_and_sub_are_best/,
