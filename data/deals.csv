Credit goes to B0bert @ slickdeals

Hi! New here at /r/deals, but I am a constant lurker at slickdeals.net, and since I spend even more time here, I figured I would contribute deals that I think are worth a look. FYI, all of these deals are shamelessly ripped from slickdeals. I don't know if this subreddit subscribes to any abbreviations for common shopping terms, i.e.:

* YMMV - Your mileage may vary 
* OOS - Out of stock 
* S/H - Shipping and handling 
* MIR - Mail in rebate IR - Instant rebate 
* B&amp;M - Brick and mortar store (A physical retail store as opposed to an online merchant) 
* CPN - Coupon 
* FAR - Free After Rebate 
* GC - Gift certificate 
* PM - Price match

Go to http://www.artscow.com/free-mousepad • sign up • you will be given a code • in case you forget it: http://www.artscow.com/unique-code • browse to mousepads • select $5.99 large mousepad • customize it to your liking with your own picture • 'click' review and order • add to cart • now take that code you were given and post it here • someone will eventually use your code • it will give you $1.00 cash dollar • check here: https://www.artscow.com/Member/CreditDiscount.aspx (this will also have all the things that you'll be able to get for free as well)• now that someone has used your code, please delete your post (you can only get one per address so lets please make this work properly) • now look at all the other people asking you to use your code • select one and apply code during checkout • total cost will come to $0.99 • for payment, change cash dollar from $0.00 to $1.00 • 'click' spend cash (didn't work? try changing $1.00 to $0.99) • fill out shipping • you should now have successfully ordered a custom mousepad free of charge (including world-wide shipping!) • come back to here and tell the person you used their code so they can delete their post • cycle continues. You do NOT need a PayPal account or any type of credit/debit card to make a free purchase. Just follow the instructions. Also just FYI: After you place your order, they usually take 1 to 2 business days to confirm payment. After that, its about 5 days or so until they ship, and then its up to 2 weeks for delivery. Just to give you guys an idea on how long the wait is.


If you follow it right, you'll get a code like one of these:**Z099PLAY8JU3Q**
