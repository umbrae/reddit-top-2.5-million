But, in the classic beta style, he tried to be nice. He never hid his desire for romance and a relationship, but she never let him be any more than ""friends"".

Last night, he came around upset. He'd been out with her and some friends a couple of nights ago, and she'd gone home with ""some brainless idiot"". Gentle probing suggested that said idiot had far more muscles that my slender brother.

It had happened before, but what made him upset this time was the text conversation they'd had afterwards. He finally laid out that he wanted a relationship with her, and she replied that she didn't want to ruin their friendship.

We talked for a while, watched a brainless action flick, drank a few beers. I pointed out that she was probably just using him to raise her perceived score; that by him paying her attention in public, it made her seem more attractive to other guys. He grumbled a bit, and I was surprised when he didn't disagree. But as nice as it was to catch up with him, his woe-is-me attitude annoyed me.

His phone rang, and it was his 'friend'. She wanted to know why he hadn't come out with her and 'the girls', as they'd organized a while back. He replied that he didn't feel like it, and was hanging out with me.

Who'd have thought it, but half an hour later, who would be at my door?

She let my brother have it, for abandoning her, for trying to ruin their friendship, for his messages, everything. Fortunately, he actually stood up for himself, and told her flat out that he wanted to be more than friends.

She gave him a shocked look. ""But we've always been friends! I don't want to lose that!""

He looked about to break and apologize, so I told him to shut his mouth. I then turned to her.

I asked her when my brother's birthday was. She couldn't tell me. I asked her how old he was. She made a guess, but it was wrong. I asked her where he worked. She answered, but my brother piped in with ""That was three years ago!""

She couldn't answer anything about him. Not what his favorite books were, not what dvds he had, not what he liked to do when he wasn't hanging out with her. Nothing. She had no clue.

I stared at her, snorted and said, ""Wow.""

And with that one word, I swear, it was like a light came on behind my brother's eyes. I could actually *see* the instant he

Pursuing Masculinity for its own sake is a trap and here is why and how I finally realized it:

Iv been bodybuilding for about seven years now. In that time iv gained approximately 10 pounds a year and am starting to get bodybuilder proportions at 225 pounds at six ft. I lift weights for myself, I enjoy pushing myself and getting stronger, I see it as the ultimate hobby.

Anyway my family routinely shits on me for my bodybuilding:

Why do I need to do it? What am I trying to prove? Its a waste of time and money. Women are not attracted to muscular men, only gay men are.

At every point in this argument it is clear that the usefulness of something is based on the female opinion of it. Nobody cares that bodybuilding makes me happy, its not in the service of a woman, so its bad and a waste of time. My build is only seen as a plus when I go somewhere with my girlfriend at night.

When women have fun: go to clubs, buy stupid shit, discuss brain rot gossip mags, Glitter paint each nail individual, they get encouragement

However when men entertain themselves:watch porn, build models, restore cars, play video games they are immediately shat on.: Lol neck beard why do you stop doing X and get laid?

Don't define yourself by how useful you are to women, define yourself by how useful you are to yourself, how happy you make yourself.

1373229522.0,210,self.TheRedPill,1htjda,Last night I went undercover,308,98,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1htjda/last_night_i_went_undercover/,"**The skinny**: One of the girls I used to orbit back in high-school (5 years ago) texted me to set up a meet to ""catch up"". She will be referred as **A** from now on. Our relationship was textbook beta orbiter with some harmless sexual *incidents* (I was/am reasonably good looking).

At first I ignored it, having moved on - she's also become unattractive - pretty face, yet : short bleached hair, skinny torso with a gut (lol), bad posture, cankles, hipster with a arrogant attitude.

**So I had this idea. Go in as the guy she's expecting - hopeless blue piller, fall in the same familiar frame, get live feedback from blue pill interaction, see the hamster in a live performance and write a report. So this is how it went...**

I arrived at the time and place she chose. She was not yet there. She was 30 minutes late with no heads up.

 (*TRP advice: your time is valuable. There are legitimate reasons for being late, but the ones that respect you will text to give notice/apologise for being late. If its more than 20 minutes just leave*).

 She didn't even aknowledge the fact that she was late. Given my blue pill persona, I said nothing about it. 

(*TRP advice: even if she gives notice/apologises you should still playfully call her out, make her buy you a drink or something, bad behaviour should not be reinforced/ignored*)

The night began with some light supplicating in the normal blue pill fashion.Then :tryhard jokes, putting on a show, complimenting her looks, no touching, taking a lot and fast, with all the fixins (bad posture, no eye contact, excessive smiling, agreeing with everything she says etc). 

Even after all of that she still throws some shit tests my way. 

**Me**: People that read on the bus are just trying to show off (their tablet) and the ones with books are just trying to look smart. Posers

**A**: I read on the bus...

(**Op Comment: She's doesn't even take the bus, ever. Her folks are loaded, she drives a sports car or uses taxi. **)

**Me**: Yeah, me too, sometimes, but the people that I was talking about read crap like Twilight.

**A**: Twilight is not that bad.

**Me**: Yeah the movies are okay.

(*Op Comment: shit test failed as hard as possible: qualifying + explaining myself + backtracking*)

After more of the same she started taking about relationships.

**A**: I've been really bad.

**Me**: What do you mean?

**A**: I've sort of  cheated on my boyfriend.

(*Op Comment - this would be the third one she cheated on -  that I know of* )

**Me**: With whom? how did it happen ?

**A**: &lt;giggles&gt; with one of his friends, we were drunk. I felt really guilty ever since.

**Me**: So this happened just once ?

**A**: &lt;giggles&gt; Not really. 

**A**: We're not married or anything.. I just don't know what I want right now.

**Me**: Yeah I remember...

**A**: Come on ! &lt;smiles&gt; You know you were the special one.

(* Op Comment: I forgot how good of a manipulator she was* )

The discussion went in the same hamsterific direction, with her teeling me how all her friends think that she should't feel bad, that it's not her fault that her boyfriend doesn't know hot to keep her happy. She then proceeded to tell me intimate details about her sexlife with the bf, making sure to laugh in a crass disrespectful way every three sentences. Apparently when they first had sex this guy started thrusting in  really quick short bursts, so she *had to put her face into the pillow so he wouldn't see her laughing*. Charming.

Even with the determination test everything out, I've had enought after two hours. 

**Me**: Is it ok if we go ?

**A**: Sure.

**Me**: We can  continue some other time if you want to.

**A** : Can't you stay 10 more minutes ? I could drive you home, we could talk a bit in the car.

(*Op comment: Even after all this crap, a shit test - maybe a hook to get me back in orbit? )

**Me**: I could stay a little bit longer I guess....

So she drives me home (even though I lived 10 minutes on foot from the bar). The car is small (BMW Z4 - manual gearbox) I'm 6'2 and athletic. So every time she puts in 3rd gear she touches my leg, smirks afterwards, same thing at the end when she put it in reverse to park.

**Me**: So what did you want to talk about?

**A**: I wanted to ask If you wanted to come to my parents' lodge next weekend. 

**Me**: Oh? what did you have in mind ? 

**A**: &lt;touching my leg&gt; You'll have to come and find out. 

**Me**: Don't you have a boyfriend? (*Op comment: saying this one made me nauseous* )

**A**: Haha. It's a party, some friends are going to be there too. You should come. You can bring someone if you want to, maybe a girlfriend ?

**Me** Haha no, I don't have a girlfriend. But yeah sounds great.

**A**: I'll text you the details soon. Byee

**Me**: Bye.


So there it is. As blue pill as my stomach allowed me, yet she still used shit tests (I only wrote about two of them). She definitely wants to reel me back in orbit. I'm still not sure what exactly the party deal is about. Knowing her past exploits she's probably trying to spark some jealousy/competition - the girl likes her hypergamy live action.



I am considering going to the party and pulling a complete 180. I have no interest in A, but I know some of her friends, smokin hot design students + her (now) 21 y.o sister who was always into me. The outcome doesn't even matter. Worst case scenario I get to spend a weekend in a mountain resort.

I might edit this post with updates from her texts. I may write a field report on the party weekend if TRP is interested.


**UPDATE 1: After pestering her through texts like a good beta I found out her bf *can't come* and the guy she cheated with is coming, and bringing his girlfriend. My initial assumption about her planning jealousy mind games was spot on.**

[edit- thought he had two, was ""just"" one Nobel.]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eventually I told them that I was struck by something: ""I'm fairly intelligent,"" I said, ""but probably only about physics. But in that bar there are lots of intelligent guys ­­ oil guys, mineral guys, important businessmen, and so forth ­­ and all the time they're  buying the girls drinks, and they get nothin' for it!"" (By this time I had decided that  nobody else was getting anything out of all those drinks either.) ""How is it possible,"" I asked, ""that an 'intelligent' guy can be such a goddamn fool when he gets into a bar?"" The master said, ""This I know all about. I know exactly how it all works. I will  give you lessons, so that hereafter you can get something from a girl in a bar like this. But  before I give you the lessons, I must demonstrate that I really know what I'm talking  about. So to do that, Gloria will get a man to buy you a champagne cocktail.""

I say, ""OK,"" though I'm thinking, ""How the hell are they gonna do it?"" The master continued: ""Now you must do exactly as we tell you. Tomorrow night  you should sit some distance from Gloria in the bar, and when she gives you a sign, all  you have to do is walk by.""

""Yes,"" says Gloria. ""It'll be easy."" The next night I go to the bar and sit in the corner, where I can keep my eye on  Gloria from a distance. After a while, sure enough, there's some guy sitting with her, and  after a little while longer the guy's happy and Gloria gives me a wink. I get up and  nonchalantly saunter by. Just as I'm passing, Gloria turns around and says in a real 

friendly and bright voice, ""Oh, hi, Dick! When did you get back into town? Where have you been?"" At this moment the guy turns around to see who this ""Dick"" is, and I can see in  his eyes something I understand completely, since I have been in that position so often  myself.First look: ""Oh­oh, competition coming up. He's gonna take her away from me  after I bought her a drink! What's gonna happen?"" Next look: ""No, it's just a casual friend. They seem to know each other from some 

time back."" I could see all this. I could read it on his face. I knew exactly what he was going through. Gloria turns to him and says, ""Jim, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Dick Feynman."" Next look: ""I know what I'll do; I'll be kind to this guy so that she'll like me  more.""

Jim turns to me and says, ""Hi, Dick. How about a drink?""

""Fine!"" I say. ""What'll ya have?""

""Whatever she's having.""

""Bartender, another champagne cocktail, please.""  

So it was easy; there was nothing to it. That night after the bar closed I went again  over to the master and Gloria's motel. They were laughing and smiling, happy with how it  worked out. ""All right,"" I said, ""I'm absolutely convinced that you two know exactly what  you're talking about. Now, what about the lessons?""

""OK,"" he says. ""The whole principle is this: The guy wants to be a gentleman. He  doesn't want to be thought of as impolite, crude, or especially a cheapskate. As long as the girl knows the guy's motives so well, it's easy to steer him in the direction she wants him to go. ""Therefore,"" he continued, ""under no circumstances be a gentleman! You must disrespect the girls. Furthermore, the very first rule is, don't buy a girl anything ­­ not  even a package of cigarettes ­­ until you've asked her if she'll sleep with you, and you're  convinced that she will, and that she's not lying.""

""Uh. . . you mean. . . you don't. . . uh. . . you just ask them?""

""OK,"" he says, ""I know this is your first lesson, and it may be hard for you to be  so blunt. So you might buy her one thing ­­ just one little something ­­ before you ask. But on the other hand, it will only make it more difficult."" Well, someone only has to give me the principle, and I get the idea. All during the  next day I built up my psychology differently: I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and all they're in there for is to get you to  buy them a drink, and they're not going to give you a goddamn thing; I'm not going to be  a gentleman to such worthless bitches, and so on. I learned it till it was automatic. Then that night I was ready to try it out. 

I go into the bar as usual, and right away  my friend says, ""Hey, Dick! Wait'll you see the girl I got tonight! She had to go change  her clothes, but she's coming right back.""

""Yeah, yeah,"" I say, unimpressed, and I sit at another table to watch the show. My friend's girl comes in just as the show starts, and I'm thinking, ""I don't give a damn how pretty she is; all she's doing is getting him to buy her drinks, and she's going to give him  nothing!""After the first act my friend says, ""Hey, Dick! I want you to meet Ann. Ann, this is a good friend of mine, Dick Feynman.""

I say ""Hi"" and keep looking at the show. A few moments later Ann says to me, ""Why don't you come and sit at the table  here with us?""

I think to myself, ""Typical bitch: he's buying her drinks, and she's inviting  somebody else to the table."" I say, ""I can see fine from here."" A little while later a lieutenant from the military base nearby comes in, dressed in  a nice uniform. It isn't long, before we notice that Ann is sitting over on the other side of the bar with the lieutenant! Later that evening I'm sitting at the bar, Ann is dancing with the lieutenant, and  when the lieutenant's back is toward me and she's facing me, she smiles very pleasantly to me. I think again, ""Some bitch! Now she's doing this trick on the lieutenant even!"" Then I get a good idea: I don't look at her until the lieutenant can also see me, and then I smile back at her, so the lieutenant will know what's going on. So her trick didn't  work for long. 

A few minutes later she's not with the lieutenant any more, but asking the  bartender for her coat and handbag, saying in a loud, obvious voice, ""I'd like to go for a  walk. Does anybody want to go for a walk with me?""
I think to myself, ""You can keep saying no and pushing them off, but you can't do it permanently, or you won't get anywhere. There comes a time when you have to go  along."" So I say coolly, ""I'll walk with you."" So we go out. 

We walk down the street a few blocks and see a cafe, and she says, ""I've got an idea ­­ let's get some coffee and  sandwiches, and go over to my place and eat them."" The idea sounds pretty good, so we go into the cafe and she orders three coffees and three sandwiches and I pay for them. As we're going out of the cafe, I think to myself, ""Something's wrong: too many  sandwiches!"" 

On the way to her motel she says, ""You know, I won't have time to eat these  sandwiches with you, because a lieutenant is coming over. . .""

I think to myself, ""See, I flunked. The master gave me a lesson on what to do, and I flunked. I bought her $1.10 worth of sandwiches, and hadn't asked her anything, and  now I know I'm gonna get nothing! I have to recover, if only for the pride of my teacher.""

I stop suddenly and I say to her, ""You. . . are worse than a WHORE!""

""Whaddya mean?""

'""You got me to buy these sandwiches, and what am I going to get for it? Nothing!""

""Well, you cheapskate!"" she says. ""If that's the way you feel, I'll pay you back for the sandwiches!""

I called her bluff: ""Pay me back, then."" She was astonished. She reached into her pocketbook, took out the little bit of money that she had and gave it to me. I took my sandwich and coffee and went off. After I was through eating, I went back to the bar to report to the master. I explained everything, and told him I was sorry that I flunked, but I tried to recover. He said very calmly, ""It's OK, Dick; it's all right. Since you ended up not buying  her anything, she's gonna sleep with you tonight.""

""What?""

""That's right,"" he said confidently; ""she's gonna sleep with you. I know that.""

""But she isn't even here! She's at her place with the lieutenant.­""

""It's all right."" Two o'clock comes around, the bar closes, and Ann hasn't appeared. I ask the  master and his wife if I can come over to their place again. They say sure. Just as we're coming out of the bar, here comes Ann, unning across Route 66 toward me. She puts her arm in mine, and says, ""Come on, let's go over to my place."" The master was right. So the lesson was terrific! 

When I was back at Cornell in the fall, I was dancing with the sister of a grad  student, who was visiting from Virginia. She was very nice, and suddenly I got this idea:  ""Let's go to a bar and have a drink,"" I said. On the way to the bar I was working up nerve to try the master's lesson on an ordinary girl. After all, you don't feel so bad disrespecting a bar girl who's trying to get  you to buy her drinks ­­ but a nice, ordinary, Southern girl?  

We went into the bar, and before I sat down, I said, ""Listen, before I buy you a  drink, I want to know one thing: Will you sleep with me tonight?"" ""Yes."" So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson  was, I never really used it after that. I didn't enjoy doing it that way.

People asked about their problems and we answered ""according to Tarot"". Of course this is all bullshit, but the paid was decent and at least reading cards is not illegal in my country.

At the beginning it was very difficult, for the lack of experience. But with after a couple of weeks it was so easy I stopped using the cards. At the end of the day, they are useless: the customer ask you about a personal problem and you give a solution/prediction, that could be just common sense.

Obviously 95% of the customers were women. My first thought was ""only crazy women ask to Tarot cards"" but after a few months I started to change my mind. What if the average women is just like this?

I got to know a lot about women problems and from the answers (it was some kind of instant message system, and sometimes I told them I was another woman) you got details about their lives and the way they think that are simply scary.

A common story, because at the end all were similar, is about a married woman thinking that a workmate is interested in her. You just say generic stuff and she plainly tell the whole history. She is attracted to this guy just because he was interested in her. Nothing else, no attractive guy, no game, just beta neediness. She was happily married, but the relationship was boring and she ""missed"" something.

All the time the questions from her were the same. ""Is he looking for a relationship or just sex?"" I learned the right answer here was always ""he is only looking for sex at the begining, but he will have feelings soon"".

Just for fun, I tried different variations on the answers and always wanted to know how far they were in their plans of infidelity. Sometimes I told them the guy was very dominant and was used to all kind of dirtiness, and the cards were afraid she will not be prepared because she has a limited sex experience.

Women were never scared about this part, always interested in this kind of guy, no matter if I spoke about soft BDSM, anal new experiences or lack of sexual protection.

Other common story was about a married woman with an ""internet boyfriend"". Dozens of cases, all the time the same. They wanted to meet the guy, but they were afraid he only wanted sex. I confirmed their thoughts, but just told them he has other potential woman waiting. One minute later they wanted to be with this guy only interested on a dirty fuck. Their questions were always why this internet guy disappeared from their virtual lives (bored of their romantic internet chats). Not a minimum doubt about infidelity.

They always wanted to cheat their partners, just wanted to be sure the other guy was what they imagined and only wanted to leave the husband once they have the other guy confirmed (and fucked).

One of the scariest things were when they asked about the potential lover, usually a random guy full of empty promises, and I told them the guy will have sex with her on the first date and steal their panties after that (yes, you can tell this kind of stuff on Tarot and crazy people believe it). She is happy with the idea, and after that ask about one female friend from his husband. Is he chatting with her? Usually I worked on the husband's side, just telling they are just friends. But if I just mention he has some attraction because the girl is beautiful, but he will never do anything ever, as he is a faithful husband, the woman just got nuts: he was attracted to other women, what a miserable man. All this when you can see ""stolen panties"" or ""blowjob on your knees"" in the same screenshot.

I can tell a million histories about that period, when they repeated so often you realized they are far from unusual. They never felt guilty about what they did. A terrible new age adagio says something like ""if you follow your feelings, you are doing the right thing"". Those feelings were just a random guy interested in her, confirmed by psychic assistance he was only interested in hard sex. No remorse at all.

This is the way I took the red pill.

I would like to take this opportunity to explain to people why we are here in the first place. Are we right? Who's to say. But there are some common causes that caused people to say ""we need a change"".

There are a few key issues that pave the way to the Red Pill.  As humans are sexual beings, we focus more on that. There are MRA issues and whatnot, but there are subreddits to better observe those.

**1.  Many men have trouble finding physical and emotional intimacy**

* Men cannot obtain emotional support from each other as women do - society teaches us not to. We want a woman to open up to.

* Men cannot obtain sex as easily as women. Most guys like me consider some 90-95% of women their age to be attractive. But getting sex as a man requires much more work and effort (unless you're a model or Brad Pitt).

**2.  Men are given terrible advice to fix this**

* ""Just be yourself! Girls love that!"" Clearly this is wrong, as it is not already working.

* ""Treat every girl like she is special and she will reciprocate"" This abhorrent thought is imprinted on guys at a young age by society and their mothers, and is the cause of the 'nice guy' trope. These guys are doing what they thought is how to get someone to like you in return, and then they are villainized. 

Many men in similar situations have realized this.  Western women are now empowered with being the 'gatekeepers' to sex and relationships. If a woman wants sex, she can find a guy and have sex. If a man wants sex, he has to figure out how to become attractive and how to properly navigate these encounters.

# *This is why game exists. This is why men are taking the red pill.*

Why are we here?

* **We don't want to isolate ourselves from women(MGTOW), we want to understand women**

* **We want to have sex**

* **We want to understand why 'game' works in our society and discuss the ramifications of it**",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,endorsement,True,t3_1d325w,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1d325w/lets_talk_about_why_theredpill_exists_regardless/,

&gt; Good looking, physically fit man with a high power job and large income who treats women like candy and walks arund high on his own sense of entitlement? Feminists swoon over him, but never attack.

A few years from now you’re probably going to want to marry my son. Perhaps you already do; he’s kind of hot (if I’m allowed to notice) and his potential is quite obvious, if I do say so myself. He’s only twenty, handsome and well built, and when he lets is hair grow long it’s thick and wavy. He has his father’s beautiful eyes, and my dimples look much better on him than they ever looked on me. Also, he’s in the military; he has finished his deployment and doesn’t expect to go overseas again, so he’s now preparing to start earning college credits. I don’t hover so I’m not certain, but he’s probably going to major in engineering. Or possibly actuarial science. He surfs, rides a motorcycle and a mountain bike, and he maintains a classic car. He’s essentially a decent guy; pretty much everyone likes him or loves him, and respects him. Girls hit on him regularly.

I’ll be surprised if he ever marries though. You see, his plan is to wait until he’s at least thirty, and therefore he will spend the next decade meeting, dating, working with, and probably sleeping with, the product of sixty years of American feminism. I’m pretty sure he won’t find many women worth considering for marriage.

How about we look at it from his perspective, m’kay? Here’s what he sees:

Half of you have been raised without your fathers, yet only a few of your fathers deserved to be kicked out of your lives. You were raised by the women who kicked your fathers out, and perhaps by a string of step-dads and “uncles.” Those women, your mothers, taught you their values by example. Not an auspicious start. Most of the rest of you were raised by fathers who knew damn well that if they displeased your mothers, they too could be kicked out of your lives according to your mothers’ whims. They knew full well who had the real power in the family; they quietly accepted that “mother knows best.”

You were raised in a culture that permits, even encourages, women and girls to always push for more; not necessarily to do more or earn more, but to demand more and to expect more. You were punished far less severely for your transgressions than were your male peers. Indeed your female peers egged you on to be even naughtier, and to be defiant about it. It’s Grrrl Power, after all! The boys of your acquaintance were expected to give in to your shenanigans and your shit tests, and those who didn’t were labelled “problem children” and medicated. Usually, a boy’s best bet was to shut up and grovel, and maybe win your approval. They weren’t allowed to go around offending the Special Snowflakes, were they?

You were raised in a Disney Princess Culture, where every girl is entitled to her Prince Charming. And if she can’t find one, she has the Grrrl Power to kiss any old frog and transform him into a Prince. You were raised to be a slut, at least through your twenties. Go to college. Establish a career. Don’t get married until your late twenties or early thirties, but DO NOT under any circumstances, repress your sexuality. Your foremothers fought hard for your right to be promiscuous with no consequences; don’t you dare let their efforts go to waste.

And since you’re not looking for a husband, there’s no need to sleep with only “good” men, is there? Cuz badboyz r hawt! And nice guys are boring. And hell, you have plenty of time to ride the best cocks you can find – thanks to modern medicine, you can get pregnant after menopause if you want, so there’s no hurry. You are expected to waste your youth and your beauty on hot guys who treat you like shit, then give your leftovers to the guy you’ll promise to love, honor and cherish for the rest of your life. Wow! How lucky is he!

My son looks around and he sees bitchy, arrogant, malicious women. He sees spoiled greedy women. He sees financially irresponsible women. He sees lazy, undisciplined women. (Yes, even in the military; they had to lower the standards so more women could “serve.”) He sees overweight women wearing unflattering clothes that display muffin tops and rolls of fat, who drool over his biceps while telling him that “looks shouldn’t matter.”

He sees slutty women who dress to attract men, sleep with the hot ones, and denigrate the less attractive ones by calling them “creepy.”  He sees “competitive” professional women whose primary tools for getting ahead are affirmative action and the unspoken threat of sexual harassment lawsuits. He sees demanding women who expect men to bow and scrape for the privilege of a smile. He sees utterly irrational women whose “self esteem” is obscenely disproportionate to their proven worth. He sees entitled women who expect romantic dates and expensive gifts, yet have absolutely nothing of value to contribute to a relationship. He sees women who flirt with their hopeful, geeky JustFriends, juuuust barely enough to keep them on a string while simultaneously panting after Alpha Hotteies, then run crying back to those JustFriends after being pumped and dumped by said Hotties. “Oh, why can’t more men be nice like you?” (Answer: if they were, no woman would fuck them.)

Look around you, ladies. You see the very same women, don’t you? Many of you are these women. You think this is normal and acceptable because “everybody does it.” It’s not.

There’s something you should know about my son and his peers. They’re not gay, they’re not lazy, they’re not stupid, they’re not unambitious, and they’re not weak. They’ve merely figured you out. They know that you don’t give a rat’s ass about them, and that you see them as nothing but providers and fantasy sex objects. They are wise to the game and they’re done playing by your rules.

They have the same job titles as you and they take home the same pay, but they work longer hours and they do harder work; they know that their productivity is why employers can afford to hire you to sit a desk and shuffle papers. They know that if two drunk people have sex and both regret it the next morning, only one of them is a rapist. They know that “My Body/My Choice” actually means “My/Body/My Choice/Your Wallet.” They know that the minute they sign a marriage license, everything they own is yours, but nothing you own is theirs (except your debts) and you can walk away with cash and prizes, at any time, for any reason. Or for no reason at all.

They’re calling Bullshit.

A few years from now, you’ll begin asking yourself, “Where have all the good men gone?” You’ll look down your noses at all those guys playing video games and living like frat boys in cheap apartments, and you’ll just know that they could be “doing so much better for themselves,” if only they would “Man Up.” You’ll shake your heads in wonder at their “immaturity,” or their “wasted potential.”  Here’s a little secret. Yes, a few men are immature or weak; they’ve had the masculinity abused or medicated out of them, mostly by their single mothers and grandmothers. But most of them?

They no longer give a rat’s ass about you.

That’s right. They don’t need to work hard and earn a good living. They have no intention of fathering and supporting any children, and no desire whatsoever to earn your approval. You go buy your own four-bedroom colonial in just the right subdivision. That’s what your Grrrl Power is for, isn’t it? So you don’t need a man? Many of these men will even go so far as to quit their jobs as soon as they begin to “earn a good living.” They don’t want to make enough money to pay taxes. They don’t want to pay the salaries of millions of useless (and mostly female) government employees, and they don’t want to finance the personal choices of “Empowered Women.”

Those Empowered Women can buy their own damn birth control. These men refuse to feed your Beast. And you, and your government, and your church, can’t cajole them or shame them into giving a shit. Men are dropping out, ladies. Chivalry has died of blunt force trauma, in a beatdown administered by Grrrl Power. Your mothers, your grandmothers, your schools, your family courts, your sociology professors, have spent the last two generations telling men that the are unnecessary and unwelcome. And now they’re leaving. (Although they’ll be glad to fuck you while you’re young and hot, since you’re offering. Aaaaand then they’ll move on to younger and hotter sluts. Why the hell not? It’s free.)

This is the gift that feminism has given to you: Independence. Scary, lonely, bitter, potentially impoverished Independence. For yourselves and any children you may have. Most of you won’t blame feminism though; you’ll blame Male Privilege (which doesn’t exist.) You’ll blame The Patriarchy (which always gave women a better deal than it gave men.) You will stamp your feet, flip your hair, and blame anything except the single cultural force that has devoted itself to suppressing and controlling masculinity. And you’ll go home alone every night to your cats, your Facebook Friends, and your vibrators. I sure hope that’s what you want.

Sincerely,

A Mom.

Because feminists turn otherwise feminine women into bitter and aggressive pseudo-men. I'm an attractive masculine man so I have no interest in unattractive masculine women (feminists) and not a big fan of an institution that prides themselves on brainwashing women into professional victims.



From the sidebar: Here to troll?
Here's a Glossary of Shaming Tactics, try to be creative and avoid these. We know you won't. That's why you're easy to spot.

http://exposingfeminism.wordpress.com/shaming-tactics/

&gt;Why so much hate?

Charge of Irascibility (Code Red)

Discussion: The target is accused of having anger management issues.  Whatever negative emotions he has are assumed to be unjustifiable.  Examples:

“You’re bitter!”
“You need to get over your anger at women.”
“You are so negative!”
Response: Anger is a legitimate emotion in the face of injustice.   It is important to remember that passive acceptance of evil is not a virtue.

&gt;You need to get a hobby, or some friends or something.

Charge of Unattractiveness (Code Tan) – The Ugly Tan Charge

Discussion: The target is accused of having no romantic potential as far as women are concerned.  Examples:

“I bet you are fat and ugly.”
“You can’t get laid!”
“Creep!”
“Loser!”
“Have you thought about the problem being you?”
Response: This is another example of “circumstantial ad hominem.”  The target’s romantic potential ultimately does not reflect on the merit of his arguments.

&gt;I don't know why you feel so intimidated by strong women, I guess that's just one of your flaws.

Charge of Cowardice (Code Yellow)

Discussion: The target is accused of having an unjustifiable fear of interaction with women.  Examples:

“You need to get over your fear.”
“Step up and take a chance like a man!”
“You’re afraid of a strong woman!”
Response: It is important to remember that there is a difference between bravery and stupidity.  The only risks that reasonable people dare to take are calculated risks.  One weighs the likely costs and benefits of said risks.  As it is, some men are finding out that many women fail a cost-benefit analysis.

&gt;I feel really sorry for you, and hope you can one day become a better person.

Charge of Instability (Code White) – The White Padded Room Charge

Discussion: The target is accused of being emotionally or mentally unstable.  Examples:

“You’re unstable.”
“You have issues.”
“You need therapy.”
“Weirdo!”
Response: In response to this attack, one may point to peer-reviewed literature and then ask the accuser if the target’s mental and/or emotional condition can explain the existence of valid research on the matter.

Let's address the word object. Objects have no agency. They cannot act for themselves. They can only be acted upon. I pick up a coffee mug and put it in the dishwasher. It is an object and cannot put itself in the dishwasher.

Let's talk about agency, the opposite of being an object. This is important. I have agency. Tomorrow I can decide whether to go swimming, or read a book. It's my choice. I have an active role in my future. Nobody can tell me what I can and cannot do. I am an agent.

Feminists used to be pretty upset at the idea that anybody would objectify women. This was the concept that women have no agency, and instead do only what other people act upon them. If I want a woman in the kitchen cleaning my coffee mug, I put her there and she does it.

Well gosh that sounds terrible.

Feminism agrees! Women aren't objects. They should never be treated as such.

So feminism, I *have* to ask. **Why do you keep acting like women are objects and not agents?**

Feminists keep telling me I'm disgusting, that I'm wrong and evil.. because I *trick* women into sleeping with me.

But feminists- *you* were the one who told me women are people and make grown up decisions for themselves! Are you saying that women are incapable of saying no?

I just don't get it. I'm trying to understand. Why would you deny women agency? 

I have never had sex with somebody who didn't want to have sex with me. I respected their wishes because they are people. They're people with personalities and *agency*.

But you criticise them saying they are objects- that they have no agency! That they are tricked and manipulated, but have no active role in deciding who to have sex with. 

How could that possibly be? If I am handsome and they are attracted, is that a trick? Or do you think I lie and say I'm a doctor? Would that be enough to ""trick"" somebody into sex? What if I told you I was a millionaire and a doctor, and I help children? Are you ""tricked"" into sex with me yet?

You're skeptical. You don't think I'm a doctor and millionaire. I'm betting you just decided reading this letter that you don't think you'd have sex with me. But.. if you made that decision.. as an adult person with agency...

...*why would you deny other women the right to make the same decision?*

Do you think most women are incapable of critical thought? Do you truly believe that if I lie about being a doctor that somehow absolves a woman of her right to choose, and her responsibility to verify? I wouldn't lie about being a doctor, it doesn't even make sense! Women wouldn't have sex with me because I'm rich- they're just not that shallow. I don't  understand why you'd assume women are *so simple* that we can just use some magic cheat code on women and get them in the sack! They're **people!**

Feminists, I don't get why you objectify women. It just seems wrong. It's the 21st century, and I feel like you're behind the times. An adult woman can make decisions for herself, we don't need some big bad woman-group telling the little woman she can't make decisions. That **objectification** seems like something we should push against. We should start a group that represents the interest of women.

Because feminism, you objectify women, and they're people. *So stop.*

1372695646.0,136,self.TheRedPill,1hflxi,[Mod] A note about reddit and their policies. Please read.,168,32,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hflxi/mod_a_note_about_reddit_and_their_policies_please/,"I'm sure a lot of you all noticed this weekend that the admin of reddit went on a banning rampage, shadow banning tons of accounts and shutting down a huge number of subreddits related to the ""niggers"" subreddit.

I have contacted the reddit admin for clarification of what the rules moderators need to enforce to ensure we are in good standing. I'm sure nobody here is surprised when I say the admin were *not forthcoming* with any useful information, leaving a glaring loophole in their policies that allow a direct banhammer target on any group they dislike.

I messaged the admins:

&gt;Can you give me a definitive list of guidelines for moderating subs that can protect our users from potential shadowbans and protect us from possibly breaking the rules?

To which I got a curt and useless response: 

&gt;Don't break site rules. That's a pretty definitive list.

The site rules are here: http://www.reddit.com/rules/ 

A brief look over the rules are, don't spam, no personal information, no child porn, don't break the site.. and finally, this overly broad and impossible to understand rule:

* **Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation.**

I was, of course, looking for specifics on this, so I responded to the admin with follow up questions, which have been unanswered as of this posting.

The main problem here is how much room they leave open for interpretation. We do not ""manipulate"" votes, nor encourage vote brigading- which is why we have instituted the ""no participation"" rules. But there are problems:

* No-participation is entirely voluntary and was made-up by redditors, not officially endorsed by reddit admin.
* No-participation does not guarantee that admin will see our posts as non-brigading.
* The nature of reddit is participation across multiple subs. At what point does user participation across multiple subs become ""manipulation"" and how responsible will we be held for the individuals' actions?
* If individuals decide to vote or comment in threads *because* they're linked here- or *in spite of* the link here, will our sub be held accountable for their actions? 
* Can the admin actually discern between participation and brigading? Is there a discrete difference?

It is clear that if this behavior was not desired, the staff at reddit would put an official stance together and potentially program limitations into the software to stop brigading from happening. But they haven't. There is no way to tell if you're brigading or participating. There is literally no difference. And the admin know that. **This is how they maintain the prerogative to ban any sub they disagree with.** 

Making inconsistent rules that cannot be followed, or no rules at all, to ensure that everybody is breaking them but only the ones they hate will be removed.

If linking to other posts was discouraged, /r/bestof would be taken down.

If brigading other threads was discouraged, SRS network would be taken down.

If participation in other subs was discouraged, the software would not have vote and reply buttons.


There you have it folks, no guidelines, no rules, just a precarious line to walk of not breaking ""our rules."" *Whatever they may be*.

Of course the moderators of multiple subreddits have already taken action - including our sub- of making rules like ""you must use NP links"" or off-sub linking is entirely against the rules. These are desperate pleas to be seen in a good light by the admin, since they are there to appease them without any real knowledge if that's what they want, if that will help, or if the impending bans are coming no matter what we do. We are as mere mortals attempting to appease the gods.

It's obvious that moderators such as myself are set up for failure, how could I possibly enforce the rules of ""don't leave our sub and comment elsewhere"" when it is specifically *that* behavior we have no control over? To give us the requirement to enforce rules we cannot enforce is telling, sheds light on the clear practices of the admin on this site. Unless, of course, we don't have to enforce that. But you see, I have no goddamned clue.

To the reddit staff, if you manage to stumble across this post, I implore you to clarify. My guess is that you won't seeing as you've been largely silent up until now. At this point, we can only assume your tolerance of some subs and not of others shows your intention of controlling the message and is implicitly endorsing some views while attempting to silence others. If I'm wrong, please let me know.

In the mean time: my advice to the subscribers of /r/theredpill.

* Do not participate on any thread that is off our sub. Do not downvote, do not upvote. You will be shadowbanned, maybe. Get a new account for going elsewhere. 

We cannot enforce this, but as a tip, I recommend it. Become mere observers.

That job was being an escort. A job I held, loved and did well at for six-months. The final two of those six I started seeing someone and beta-zoned myself into collapsing it all. Figured I may as well list what I picked up on at the time compared to the theories we throw around here, (and also noticed upon reflection after the event). In some instances I can regret not having done what I should, but then I doubt I’d have sought out knowledge about *why* it all went tits-up if I had, add to that I’d have probably just elevated myself even more so that I had further to fall. Essentially, we fail to learn and this is my story.

To give a brief outline of me and how I got into it, mostly because it’s a lesson I learned about the importance of confidence and sexuality, it all started with an innocent lunch. I had lived with a girl for the first two years of university, let’s call her Bambi. She was a housemate, and although we kissed on many occasions, she had a BF (long-term, long-distance) and shut me down every time, but those are other stories. Bambi invited me to lunch a few months after I’d got a new place (already graduated by this point) and her new housemate was there, who we shall call Rose.

Now, I had been speaking to Bambi on Facebook to keep in touch, so I knew what Rose did for a living. I knew she was an escort, and I was really interested in knowing how she did so, and what it was that she did. Fortunately, 22 years prior to this point, the stars had aligned and my genetic code meant that I was growing into a very good-looking chap, and she was attracted to me. We got on well over lunch and then continued to talk on other occasions. We exchanged numbers so that on occasions I could pick her brain into getting me into her agency and what she did etc. She gave me one of the bosses’ numbers and said I needed to ring for an interview, which I did. Rose and I both went to meet the boss (Tiffany). Tiffany was an ex-escort and ran the agency with her partner (also an ex-escort), almost at 40 and looked great. She was forward, direct, and confident and it made me meek. Being with these two sexually charged, in-control, hyper-sluts about me made me rather nervous, but I got through it. Tiffany rounds up the interview by saying, and this is an actual quote, “so, Manhoro, I can see that you’re very attractive, Rose tells me you work out, which I can see, and you’re healthy, you’re educated, and can hold a great conversation so that’s all a pass. How is he in bed?” Not how *are* you, how *is* he, to Rose. Rose said she didn’t know because we hadn’t actually slept together, Tiffany said “find out”, all in a manner that suggested I wasn’t even present. I had to sleep with her as an interview process to get a job where I slept with other people. Never been more nervous; brain and penis were agitated.

It wasn’t a formal or clinical incident, we actually treated it a bit like a date, we had sex and it was great. On a side note, I honestly had no idea women could be that good in bed, it was a real japs-eye-opener for me. Now, I wasn’t normally like this, but at the time, and because she was so forward, I was able to have the balls to be forward back and more dominant with her. She enjoyed it, I got the job. She remains my good friend.

So, the first thing I took with me into my first few clients was that if I was having sex, I was going to go all out. There was no point in passion (or ‘love-making’) with these women, they either **have** that, or **had** that, so either way wanted something different. If you do what you always do (or what everyone else is doing) you will get what you have always got.

My work-phone blew up for the first few months due to being the new guy at the agency and (so I’ve been told 100+ times) for looking like Robert Pattinson. I was very busy and I saw a lot of women. I will talk about specifics in a FR sort of way (if there are questions), but this post is more about what I learned then that I would only realise once I came here.

* Be dominant in the bedroom. We men are solely responsible for this going either way. The woman you’re about to sleep with has probably had sex passionately, slowly and awfully before, so give her something different. Seek forgiveness, not permission – pull that hair, slap that ass, throw her on her back, get her legs up, etc.  You achieve more by doing what you want more than by waiting for it to be asked of you, always. (The very act of hiring an escort kind of suggests they’re prone to more outlandish acts, so it was easier for me to accept this as fact at the time and use as fuel).

* A lot of women weren’t bothered for the sex. We (the male escorts) were hired to perform, but more in terms of the **status** of our looks, youthfulness, and whatever concoctions the woman had run-up prior to us going to the event. (Women would get their groundwork set weeks or months before with out-calls so that it wasn’t weird for anyone to see them with a younger, attractive man; think *’Wedding Crashers’* where they plan who they are and how they know each other). In short; women dig status, and they will fabricate a part of that status if necessary to save face (is this hamstering? I think of it as unique to the situation/job). We were shown off, lusted after, and used to incite jealousy in the women and to make the men seem less-manly by proxy.

* As sex wasn’t the main goal most of the time (women can get sex anywhere) I did a lot of conversing, kino, escalation and flirting. Through this I discovered 90% of these women were career driven and career orientated, and very wealthy. Of those 90%, the majority were childless, and all of them were very used to getting what they wanted and being in-control. Typical strong business-orientated women, who had little time to forge (or maintain) proper relationships. A lot had husbands, and/or boyfriends, more were divorced. I scoped a lot of white lines where wedding rings should have been. I never asked, yet they often told. 

* Because they were rich, powerful, self-made, and independent they struggled finding anyone that would a) pass their shit tests and b) be more so than themselves – at the time I couldn’t understand why they wanted me when they were obviously used to going for whatever they wanted; something had knocked these women back. 

* This created extreme privilege (I actually have a story about the worst client ever that I may explain in the comments regarding this) that resulted in hyperinflation of their self-worth. They wanted to act, and be treated as men in a man’s world of business but found as they kept revolving around the sun, their self-worth was beginning to unravel and their power was diminishing compared to the men they worked with, whose value only went up. This bothered them; they had played the rules of feminism to a tee but were still losing in the end to men, despite their efforts. Many never linked their self-worth with their actual-value (SMV).

I'm about to finish work so I can't continue until this evening as I'm going out straight from here. I'm no longer an escort and haven't been for a number of years. Just to confirm why I left the agency (and prove that TRP is more fact than fiction), it was due to a relationship with a girl from the job I held previously. She was a waitress.

I saw her on a night out after having left my old job about three months prior (where I did nothing to act on her by the way). She could tell I was different, I felt brilliant at the time, like I could eat coal and shit diamond, and she sensed it. We fucked that night and I kept on fucking her, eventually succumbing to oneitis, and I got it hard. She knew what I did for a living at the time because I told everyone at my old job that I was leaving to do it. **She never once complained about it**, but I figured, due to chivalry an' shit, that I should quit and focus on a proper relationship. I did, and two to three weeks later she had dumped me. It hit me hard and took me years to be alright with women after that, and alright with myself - I really questioned my actions on every level. Everyone has a story of being the bluest blue, and this was mine. 

Now I can see that because I a) stopped earning money, b) self-harmed my SMV and c) did what I thought she wanted instead of what I *really* wanted, I was dumped. I blamed her for years due to her saying, and this is another direct quote, ""I don't know why, and I can't give you an answer you'll be happy with but I..."", well, you know the rest there. I stand by how TRP has been the picture I've used to create the puzzle from the bits I had left over. Any questions, and I'll do my best to answer later.

**This is the only place they can go to vent their built up frustrations.**

Women have lots of outlets to say pretty much anything they feel like. There are no repercussions for them when they say something outlandish, so they never feel forced by society into holding themselves back. Men on the otherhand, typically have no one that will listen to what they are going through. So when they finally find a place where they can vent their anger and have people listen and understand, rather than demonize them, they go way over board and dump this massive load of bitterness that has been saved up for years.

I’ve been reading posts here for a few weeks and wanted to introduce myself and start contributing. I’ve been with my wife for 10 years, and married for 7 of those. We have two small kids.

I took the red pill about 10 years ago. Just before I met my wife. But back then it wasn’t called the red pill (I didn’t exactly know what it was called). I just knew that I had enough of the bullshit.

I dated a lot before I met my wife. I read most of the PUA material (that was available at the time) but honestly I learned most of what I know from trial and error. Trust me, if there was a way to fuck up a relationship I’ve been there. I’ve dated at least 100 girls before I met my wife (a lot were just first dates) and had a few long term relationships. I was “in the field” quite a bit so to speak. I started very beta, and had to learn a lot over the last 20 years. (I’m 36 years old.)

By the time I met my wife I was angry. Angry at women and angry at the blue pill bullshit. (Although at the time there was no such term.) I had given up. I was done. And then an interesting thing happened: I met a woman who wasn’t a feminist. She even told me on our first date: “I’m not a feminist.”

I’ve had a great marriage and a great relationship for the last 10 years. No, it isn’t perfect. Women can be hard to live with. But I assure you that without “red pill” knowledge this relationship wouldn’t work. What I’m here to tell you is that all of you are on the right track. When I discovered the “red pill” community on the Internet, I was amazed. Here, in a concentrated format, you guys have access to all of this information that I had to learn the hard way. I’m sort of pissed about that. (Just kidding.) But seriously, this is some great information and you are on the right track.

However, what I do see is that a lot of this information is defensive in nature. Understandably so! The dating game is a piece of shit and I hated it (despite having a lot of experience and success). However, I also see from my perspective that being married isn’t always a bad thing, and I sometimes see posts from married guys or men thinking about getting married that get “shot down” by the general consensus. There isn’t really a lot of good information from married guys on this forum. I hope to give another perspective.

I do think that it is possible to take the red pill and still get married. It is challenging. And I’ll never say it is for everyone. But I think this forum could use a bit more advice from a man who has played the game a lot and has a relatively successful marriage. And yes, I have sex frequently with my wife. She is very submissive and “red pill” (or whatever you want to call it) is very helpful in this area. I prefer to think of it as being a dominate male. But, I do very much like the term “red pill” because it describes the process of seeing relationships between men and women as they really are. NOT the way women say they are. The worst advice on relationships you will ever get is from women; this is true whether they intend it or not.

Don’t worry: I hate feminists more than you do. My advice will not be “not all women are like that” bullshit or feminist garbage. I just want to genuinely help other married guys who might be taking the red pill for the first time. Or, maybe you are in a long term relationship with a great girl and this red pill business is scaring you shitless and you aren’t sure if you should ever get married. (Yes, it is scary.)

I have a lot of dating and marriage experience and I’ve screwed up a lot of things. The funny thing is that nobody I talk to ever cares. People are so comfortable with their “blue pill” world view that my advice always fell on deaf ears. So I stopped giving advice. But then I came across this awesome subreddit and I realized that I might just be able to help somebody.

I really enjoy reading most of your posts. Keep up the good work and don’t let the feminists get you down. Maybe NAWALT is bullshit, but I assure you that one thing is true: Not All Women Are Feminists. Yes, my wife is still full of shit sometimes, but at least she isn’t a feminist. And that is a very important distinction and a perspective I hope to bring to these discussions.

But most importantly: I agree with the charter of this subreddit. The goal is to help men get laid and have successful relationships. If anything I’ve learned over the last 10 years (being with my wife) or 15 years dating in general helps someone get laid then it was worth it. Because despite what feminists think: I actually like women.

1374184277.0,128,self.TheRedPill,1il86r,Why promiscuity devalues women and not men. Analysis of the double standard.,170,42,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1il86r/why_promiscuity_devalues_women_and_not_men/,"This seems to come up often enough around here for me to attempt to break this down.

First, let’s take out the weak/bullshit reasons about why it devalues women.  

Her being unable to “pair-bond” after “x” number of partners.   I don’t really buy into this, hard to prove, and hasn’t been my experience.


Her vagina getting stretched out.   Nonsense.  They are elastic.  My experience has not shown sluts to be any looser or tighter.

Men are afraid of being compared to past lovers.  This, of course, is women’s favorite assumption.  While some young men may feel this way, most men outgrow it or are confident enough in themselves sexually not to give a shit.  

Let’s get to the real reason:  Female promiscuity is associated with low value traits. Her inability to gain commitment from the men she slept with in her past sends a red flag to the rest of us that she is probably not someone worth keeping around.  Just how women take their cues from other women on which men to find attractive, men take cues from other men as well when it comes to assessing a woman's value.  If some bum down the block pumped and dumped her, she’s probably not worth much more to you.

Once a woman sleeps with a man, **the power shifts**, and it’s time for a woman to show her value to him in order for him to want to keep her.   He’s proven his value already, because if he hadn’t, she wouldn't be fucking with him in the first place.   [Superman analogy]( http://youtu.be/k5Xl8UCjMQI?t=1m50s).

High quality women are able to get commitment.  Men lock them down by marrying them and/or committing to them because they value what she brings to their life.   These women have a very low turnover rate because men keep them in LTR’s.  As a result, her number of sexual partners is low.
  
Women who have consistently failed to gain commitment from men they sleep with will be assessed as lower value, and their turnover rate and number of sexual partners will be much higher.  Few men want to keep them around, and usually for good reason.   These women display unattractive traits like clinginess, insecurity, low intelligence, laziness, unladylike behavior, etc.  They are seen as unworthy of commitment and subsequently used for sex until they are bored or pushed to commit and dump them.   

So we can conclude that a high number of partners for a woman is associated with low value traits.  One only needs to look at the revolving door of men in an overweight or homely woman’s life to see this pattern.

Now, to illustrate the point about association of low value:  Take a man who goes on dozens of job interviews, but can’t seem to get hired anywhere.  People will eventually start to assume **he** is the problem.  Exactly how many failed interviews he has to go on before people will start to think that is subjective, but eventually they will assume it is because he is lazy and un-hirable.

Men make this same subjective judgment based on a woman’s sexual past.  Everytime she slept with a man who didn’t end up committing, that was a failed interview.  That is why there is no set number determining when she’s crossed the line into unhirable status.  For every man, this number will be different.  

So, if female promiscuity is associated with low value women, why doesn’t it devalue men?

Because the man is the *employer* in the analogy.   Women assume a man who has rejected a high number of sexual partners (applicants), but hasn’t found anyone good enough to commit to, that he must be a high value mate, and to be hired by him will put her in a good position.

A high # of sexual partners for a man is associated with high value traits.  Women know this, which is why they don’t care how many partners a man has had.  Athletes, celebrities, wealthy men, etc. constantly have women fighting for their attention no matter how many women they have had in their life.  Promiscuity between the sexes is simply not comparable because they have opposite perceptive value.  

Tl;dr  Men are the gatekeepers to commitment, making our promiscuity irrelevant.  Women are the gatekeepers to sex, making their promiscuity an insightful tool in assessing their value.

I invite a girl over to my place 'to show me what she can do with her mouth' after I'm done at the gym. She knocks. I say 'come in' she basically pushes me on my bed and takes off her sundress, revealing lingerie underneath. She blows me (7/10, not bad, makes eye contact at climax). I say that was great. I chill with her for 10 - 15 minutes and say something like 'well, I really gotta do my laundry..."" and I walk toward the door. She knows this means 'get out'. She leaves and texts me naked pics. I ask her if she sends these to her boyfriend too or just me.

She lets it all out:

-Just you. He doesn't appreciate me like you do. (hilarious. I can't even contain my laughter)

-He thinks I'm fat (meaning she thinks he thinks she's fat, guy has never said it) - reality check, this girl could use like 200 less calories in her diet per day. Nothing drastic, she's still attractive, but a little diet would do her a lot of good.

-I don't turn him on (he has self control ... isn't governed by his hormones)

-He criticizes me sometimes!! (He tries to help her with constructive criticism and not kissing her ass)

This is typical woman behaviour. And most of you probably still think woman deserve to vote. They shouldn't. 

And this is enough for her to walk for half an hour to my place, blow me, and then walk back home shortly thereafter.

I remember feeling like the red pill was the hardest pill to swallow. Once you know how the hamster works though, you can really use it to your advantage. The pro side of hooking up with a taken chick is that you basically get the dirty sex she doesn't give to her provider and there is literally NO chance of having to commit. Free lunch.

Also, having this chick in the rotation is great because she requires the least amount of time, and produces the greatest output. In terms of efficiency, other peoples girlfriends are the best plates.

Niiiice. I send them to my friend, he sends me pics that girls are sending him. We laugh a bit. I get some more texts, one from a decent looking 19 year old girl telling me how much fun she had the other night and thanking me for taking her out. I get another text, its my woman saying she`s buying grocieries and making me something special for dinner tonight. She comes home and gets mad because she finds another womans sock somewhere and doesnt know whos it is. I laugh it off, I seriously dont know either.

I went to the gym, did some really heavy squats, some bench, etc... feelsgoodman. Went home, had the best dinner ever, girl is on her period so I accept a blowjob. I play some guitar and I sit down to write this article about it.

More reddit hate messages: Your whole subreddit is scumbags and you should all die. Youre probably some 14 year old virgin loser. You`re just an ugly lonely guy.

There is a beautiful woman who adores me sleeping in my bed right now. Ive never been in such good shape. 

Core redpill truths and their corollaries:

1. Women are attracted to confidence; No one is more confident than a narcissist.

2. Women are attracted to calm strength, not anxiety; No one is more calm than a sociopath.

3. Women are attracted to dominant men; Disagreeable, even violent men, are the most dominant.

4. Women are attracted to men who embrace risk; Dangerous men, and men in dangerous settings are the most comfortable embacring risk.

Dark triad traits make for the most attractive men. A high pitched voice and a soft weak body won`t do it. Sorry.

I fully acknowledge, and even embrace these core values, and it brings me great success in life, in love, with women, professionally... The only people who dont like me are the feminists and the manginas. Why dont they love me too? Why dont they love TheRedPill? Because its very existence, and the successful nature of the men who frequent this little corner of the internet is proof positive that they are full of shit.

It pains these people to think that some of us are hard working, fit, successful people who women find unbearably attractive in some way. They need to tell eachother that we arent real. Like kids who cant sleep at night and need their parents to tell them that there is no monster under their bed. Dont worry little mangina, just be yourself and the right woman will fall in love with you, shes not sending nude barely legal pics to zionController right now. Take your blue pill and go to sleep :)

Im only here to tell you the truth. Nothing more. I hope all you  become so great at life that your mere presence makes you hated by all those who dont have the balls to /r/becomeaman .   

I realize a lot of my posts piss people off. No one was madder about me saying women shouldnt vote than my own woman when I told her I would support taking her voting privilege away. She says Im a jerk. Shes right. I ask her if she still loves me. She says unfortunately. I say then it doesnt really matter that Im a jerk then, does it?

It doesnt really matter how much hate this sub gets, I get, you get, redpillschool gets... Its normal for the sheep to dislike the birds of prey. 

Keep lifting, eat healthy, spend your money wisely, pursue your dreams. Remember that women are children and that they shouldnt vote. Good women do dishes and dont withold sex from their spouses. Unmarried women over 30 are pathetic, and no one will ever care about your problems if you are a man. Lift heavy things, become a strong man, disregard females and be in a perpetual state of reading and learning. Its up to you to make your world into something you find desirable. Good luck and God bless.

Actually, there aren't a lot of alphas that exist in nature. Most people who you think are alpha are just ""fake alphas"". They are alphas only in a particular place or setting (e.g workplace) remove them from the setting and they are most likely beta. Fake alphas get away with being alpha by being loud and obnoxious or holding a rank in the pecking order. Just by being loud and commanding most men and women will consider them as alphas. Why? Because this is some left over monkey shit in our brain that wants to be led by people who are loud and assertive. I say, fuck these loud mouthed cocksuckers. Fuck em because I am an introvert and don’t want to waste my energy in a shouting match. At work if a loud gorilla outranks you, you can’t start a shouting, chest beating, ground thumping match every time he comes around. At bars or clubs you don’t want to compete with these banshees either. Just because they AMOG 99% of the guys out there, they think they can AMOG me. **Amusing**. So if you are an extrovert guy, stop reading here. This is for all you introverts; the reflecting types. 

* Frame Control

Frame is everything! Never enter into anyone’s frame. Think of frame like a bubble surrounding a guy. Never enter someone’s bubble! Establish your own frame and stick by it. People will test your frame continuously both men and women. Stay congruent with your voice and body language. E.g. When a loud gorilla motherfucker tries to start shouting and being hyper. Everyone else starts become hyper too. Girls will jump in their seats. Guys will stop what they are doing. The loud fucker got what he wanted. Attention. Now everyone is watching him and everyone has entered into his frame. Don't do that! Stay in your frame. Don't become hyper or excited. Let the fucker do his thing. Do yours.

* Manage time 

Most people are lazy and unambitious assholes. They engage in meaningless banter and small talk. Why? So they can avoid facing the drudgery of their pathetic existence. I see this in workplaces all the time. Co-workers talking absolute nonsense. Friends calling you because they need company to go somewhere. Guys talking about sports. Women gossiping. Stop that shit! This is not bonding. These people will drop you like a hat when you leave your job or change schools. You are not going to live forever motherfucker. Every second your life is ending. 

* Be decisive

No one knows what the fuck is going on this rock flying through space, no one knows whats going to happen tomorrow. The future is uncertain and uncertainty breeds fear. If anyone says they have a clue, they are full of shit. Shit and semen. Semen preferably. If you talk with decisiveness and in a manner as ""I know what the fuck I am doing"" people will start gravitating towards you. They will enter your frame.

* Be congruent

Be congruent in what you speak and do. Women especially look for cues to see if a man is congruent in his thought and action. Beware, they will shit test you. Men will also shit test you. That’s why its imperative to build a strong physique and master your internal state. This leads me to me next point.

* State control

Master your internal state. You master your state by knowing what you want and then going after it without hesitation. Most people are clueless of what they want in life. Don’t be that guy. Be what you want and where you want to be and go after it. Have a PURPOSE. Repeat after me. I will have a PURPOSE to my existence. 

* Be genuine

Be a genuine guy. Don't be a fake motherfucker. You become fake by caring what others think of you. Stop that shit right now. Don't care what people say or think. You are who you want to be. You are on a path to GREATNESS.

It's most apparent when I'm in my room but within earshot.

1) When they have a 1-on-1 hangout time with another girl, they will invariably talk extensively about men. This is obvious and isn't a novel observation. It just reminds me how little we men talk about specific women in detail, and how we mostly could care less about their career or friend circle. 

2) I didn't know the term for it before finding this sub, but they are obsessed with hypergamy. Constantly dividing men into ""ambitious"" and ""not-ambitious"". If a guy has ever stated his 10-year ambition to them, they will share it with their female friends, at sometimes comically irrelevant points in the conversation.

3) Even if a guy is way out of both of their leagues, aka the majority of men they talk about as they're probably only 7.5/10 if i'm blunt, they will analyze him on multiple levels, mostly revolving around his career, popularity, and anything nice he has ever done for them. If a guy has ever won an award, even in 2009, it will be brought up.

4) They never verbally acknowledge that a guy was just using them for sex, when it was obvious to me and everyone the whole time. 

5) If they focused on guys within their league, I feel like they wouldn't be so insecure. But it's just obvious that they are 24 and therefore are just trying to reach as high as they can.

Boy is your typical beta, based on some attitudes he holds.

He's genuinely the most polite, respectful guy I know, but with a heavy touch of naivety.

I see the girl today and ask her what's going on between the two of them. To which she replies, ""He's just a really nice guy, so I thought I'd give him a chance"".

To which I respond, ""Give him a chance? So you're saying he should feel special to be with *you*?""

She gets defensive, and to summarize, she rationalizes her choice  of words (because, ""it sounds really bad"") with, **""I just don't know how so many girls can turn him down - he's like the nicest guy ever! He's pretty much the perfect boyfriend! I just don't ...find him attractive. But I thought I'd give him a chance.""**

* ""As a woman..."" No one here gives a fuck. Your advice is terrible and it is one of the main reasons this community exists in the first place. This is one of those rare spaces where the fact you have a vagina will work against you, instead of for you. Our experience based theories rely heavily on what women respond to instead of what they *say* they respond to. This shouldn't come as a surprise but the two rarely line up. You might be sitting there all calm and collected while you utter some useless trope which sounds good, but the second some high value man makes your pussy tingle all that nonsense goes right out of the window. Please spare us your self-righteous indignation, or don't because seeing you blow up in modmail after we ban you can be entertaining. Women don't take rejection very well, weird. 

* Concern trolling. ""I feel this place is too bitter, inexperienced, &lt;insert worthless stereotype here&gt;"" If you have a valid concern use modmail, otherwise keep it to yourself. Instaban, no questions asked.  

* Link/Comment baiting. We realize you probably think you're pretty clever, but I can assure you there is nothing our moderators have not seen. We spend half our time on Reddit in your comment history deciding whether you're a troll or not, and throwaway accounts are almost universally banned at this point. If we see an abundance of RP buzz words in a situation that is too good to be true, it probably is, and you're probably banned.  

Now that the unpleasantness is out of the way. It is Friday so you better be heading towards a lifting PR, reading up on RP/Game theory, closing one of the numbers you've recently acquired, or rewarding a long week of work with some moderate self-indulgence - perhaps a new watch or sport coat. If you're not doing any of these types of things get the hell off the internet and increase your status. MAN UP.

Also, flair your threads appropriately.

1371735664.0,113,self.TheRedPill,1gq5d8,"TRP actually agrees with some of the core tenets of serious feminist philosophy: agency, autonomy, freedom to choose. THIS IS why it pissess off feminists so much.",148,35,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1gq5d8/trp_actually_agrees_with_some_of_the_core_tenets/,"If you read bit of serious feminism - so not the I-am-a-Disney-princess stuff but more like  /r/SRSDiscussions - you realize that one of the central ideas is respecting the autonomy, agency, basically freedom to choose of women. 

If you look at it this way, TRP does just that - while also encouraging you to be unafraid to express and use your own freedom to choose. 

TRP enrages feminists because basically it says **if you leave plenty of freedom-room to women, they will want to be willingly submissive.**

Let's see step by step:

1) In a pick-up, TRP recommends to be not needy, not clingy, don't hover, don't chase her, just value drop, tease, make yourself a high value target etc. and let her chase you. If you look at it this way, this actually respects womens freedom much more than the usual average, pushy, clingy type beta pickup attempts.

2) TRP says the best way to protect yourself from false rape accusations is to never get into a situation when a women regrets having sex with you, but wants it again and again. Looking at it this way, this is actually a profound respect for ""enthusiastic consent"" which is a key feminist term. What can be more enthusiastic than wanting a second and third time?

3) Regret after sex typically comes from drunken sex. We rarely talk about it but I think the general opinion is that bedding piss drunk girls is something any moderately OK looking beta without any game can do, I think there is a consensus that a Red Pill guy with good game can do much better than that, does not need to get her very drunk. There is a lot of talk about day game i.e. sober game, date game etc. etc. Again you can say that it is in a way a very deep respect for the ""ability to consent"", another key feminist term..

4) In a relationship, TRP recommends not to be clingy, needy, express that you have other options. This is nothing but being conscious and expressing your own freedom to choose.

5) In a relationship TRP recommends to be a aloof and distant. This actually leaves her plenty of breathing room - i. e. freedom.

6) This part can be misunderstandtable... TRP recommends that you don't tolerate certain behaviors in a relationship. But this does not mean you enforce them by aggression or push and force things on women they don't want. It just means you simply express that you don't want to have a relationship with cheaters or big toddlers throwing tantrums or women who are unable to show some basic respect, and leave her perfectly free to consent to your terms or end the relationship. It's a very libertarian thing. In any kind of voluntary agreement between parties both parties can have conditions and end the agreement when they are not met. Unconditional things are rarely truly voluntary.

7) It is true that TRP has general opinions that don't rhyme with the full freedom of women - it tends to look down on career women, sluts, fatties, and foreveryoung cougars, it tends to have a traditional view, i.e. that really good women marry young and virgins or almost virgins, are sweet and submissive, and become great wives and moms. But it's not about using authoritarian methods force and punish others into doing something that is not good for them. Rather, TRP plain simply says it does not make women happy in the long run so wise women should choose the traditional path, because if they don't, they are up for a nasty surprise at 35 when all the 35 - 45 years old men simply use their own freedom to choose to ignore her and chase younger tail, leaving both her sexual and romantic desires, and the nest-making and child-rearing desires that too tend to develop after 27 or so, unsatisfied. TRP does not limit anyone's autonomy. It simply says men have a longer shelf life, and have a freedom to choose too, so women, choose wisely. 

So actually it is very hard to find an angle of attack on TRP from the viewpoint of the feminist philosophy of agency, autonomy, freedom to choose. This is why they are mad! Because we prove that when women are free, they choose submission.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,True,t3_1gq5d8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1gq5d8/trp_actually_agrees_with_some_of_the_core_tenets/,

Frustrated he chooses to work a job he loves and play video games in his free time (when she's not around) instead.,140,30,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1djiuo/woman_wants_her_husband_to_make_more_money/,"[Linky](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dji43/my_32f_husband_28m_has_no_great_life_ambition_or/)

Let's analyze this potential hypergamy hamster.

&gt;We're both educated people. I have a degree in Engineering and he has a Masters in Linguistics. When we first got married (I was 28 and he was 24), we lived in a crappy one bedroom apartment and we had started our first jobs. Four years later and we're both doing better; we have a three bedroom apartment downtown, lots of friends and so forth... but the problem is that my husband seems to think that he's done with it. He just wants to maintain our current lifestyle. 

So they've moved up to a very comfortable life and he's happy with that. She's not. Solution? Work harder at her job and maybe pitch in more and take more financial responsibility? 

&gt;We started fighting when I asked him to change his career. 

Nope. He needs to do that. 

&gt;To be honest, it's hard to tell people what my husband does because he's been doing the same thing since he graduated. 

Must be complicated and rather academicish. I hate when I can't explain my job to people...

&gt; He works at an agency teaching foreign immigrants English and gets about 40k per year. 

Oh. Well that wasn't so hard to explain. What is hard to explain is his paycheck.

&gt;I thought it was fine when he was 24 and just graduated, but now he's so comfortable there and have no desire to move up. 

AKA: He's happy at the expense of my happiness of neverending consumerism.

&gt;Most people his age (with his education) make more money than that, and by the time their my age they should be making over 60k (which is what I make). At his job, there is no room for advancement really. 

But MARY'S HUSBAND MAKES MORE THAN YOU!!!!

&gt;We argued more when I discovered that I wasn't around (our work hours don't exactly overlap), he was playing a lot of video games.

Keep in mind, SHE'S NOT AROUND. It's not like he's ignoring her while she's there. THe man isn't even allowed to enjoy his own free time if cupcake doesn't have a house in the burbs.

&gt;I think it's a colossal waste of time, and if you have that much free time to spare that you can be doing something so useless, then you have enough time to get a second job or take a course or something.

PULL MORE, WORKHORSE! 

&gt; kind of feel like people are laughing at us as title and salary wise, the gap between us is so big and growing.

Dat hypergamy feels....

&gt;When I confront him about this... he just says that it isn't a big deal, work isn't everything, who cares what people think etc... and I kind of agree, but at the same time when people get into a rut it's ugly.

AKA: Work isn't everything unless you're the guy. Hamster wheel should be powering a city by now...

&gt; I'm considering getting counselling or pushing him to get counselling to break his addiction... I don't know. Doing 20-30 hours of something like video games seems so counterintuitive to me. 

Now it's an **addiction**. Dat hamster gonna hamst. What the fuck does miss perfect do in her free time? Notice how she fails to mention that.

&gt;I did ask friends about this and people have told me I'm being to high strung and that he does enough and to leave him alone. He is really good about doing all the housework and house related and stuff seeing as how I work 10-12 hours a day and he works 6-8.

So he seems to be pulling in his share (work + housework) despite his rabid ADDICTION. In fact, it looks like he's doing more if he really is doing ""all"" the housework. But we all know that doesn't count for a hamster.

&gt;tl;dr My husband isn't living up to his full potential. I want him to do more with his **wife**[sic].

At the time of this post, she wrote wife instead of life. Feudian slip? It's not like ""w"" and ""l"" are near each other on the keyboard.

So what we have here is a decently successful woman married to a man that makes less than her, works less than her (yet does ""all"" the housework according to her), choose to enjoy his alone time with video games instead of frantically studying to get a better job (who has time to relax? You're a guy). Guys, if despite all the warnings you choose to marry, make sure you pull in more income. Hypergamy will get the best of your woman.

Every post where a male finds out his female whatever is cheating by reading email/checking texts/facebook/okcupid or any other way besides actually stumbling on them fucking, is met first and foremost with the mother of all argumentative fallacies. 

Most upvoted comment is always something like ""Reading her email/texts/facebook/okcupid is really sketchy...and a bit controlling"" / ""You snooped through her things? that's wrong"" 

=&gt; **What the actual fuck, how is that relevent at that point?**   - So his paranoia was justified after all ? *asshole*

If you bother to check the replies to the upvoted comment, holy crap. You will eventually find some variation of : ""Maybe she cheated because YOU [insert holier than thou justification]"".


**example**: ""Maybe she cheated on you because you are controlling and don't trust her"" - this is the *""Maybe if you weren't so obnoxius, Hitler wouldn't have gassed you""* argument. Top notch logic. (&lt;-a fallacy I used for humor only)

The brainwashing is so gut-wrenching, reading these posts makes me belive that being a woman in the western world (as a result of 40 years of feminist propaganda) you are perceived by **default** as the innocent, morally responsable one, and an *angel* until proven *of some doubt*. The western woman falls automatically in the victim category, no questions asked. 

Bill Burr had a segment like this, saying that it's now wrong to even consider any other posibility than ""woman not guilty"" scenario. Bill Maher said it has got the point where is considered anti-woman to even talk about women in any negative fashion. 

Sometimes I think that there is no amount of evidence that could change the views of the large part of western society which militantly approves and defends a woman's morally bankrupt bevaviour (or in the instances that is especially difficult, spins it so that somehow the woman is a *unlucky bistander* ) effectively telling them there are no repercussions to bad behaviour and no need to take responsability for their actions.

There is a vague idea of what a man is physically, and some are better than others aesthetically speaking, but the purely physical appearance of a man is almost inconsequential unless he is horribly ugly or outrageously attractive.

Women are attracted to status, money, how much a man smiles and laughs, how many friends and resources a man has, how full a man's life is--how many ""cool,"" ""exciting"" and prestigious things he is doing or connected to.

They are interested in how other people view him--how many people want to be around him, how other people interact with him and whether their interactions convey that he is special and amazing. They want him to be extremely outgoing and aggressive; they want him to demonstrate his status over other people by dominating them in various non-violent ways.

A woman's attraction to a man is a function of her jealousy at the thought of another woman having that man. She doesn't care who he actually is or EXACTLY what he looks like physically, she only cares about the VALUE of the life he has constructed around himself.

These thoughts may be a bit disjointed, but I wanted to put it in a visible place.

-----

**Quality of Posts**

Since our subscribership has increased as much as it has, there's been a latent fear that our quality will drop. 

This was something the mod team and I were aware may happen, and we've taken steps to subvert it. For instance, we've categorized each post (yes, we spend a lot of time doing that when you don't), so you can easily click those little links at the top and get straight to the content you want to see. That means there's no reason to complain if there's a certain level of posts that you don't like. Want more red pill theory discussion? Literally just have to click ""red pill theory."" It's that simple.

We've moved ASKTRP to it's own sub to remove newbie questions. If you're new, go there.

**My assessment**

I regularly read through the threads on here, and much to the opposite of what some might complain about, the comments here are largely on-topic and insightful. This is a well spoken group, for the most part. Sure there are trolls here and there, but it's one *report* click away from being taken care of. I highly enjoy the discourse here, as much as day one, if not moreso.

The only thing that actually lowers the quality of posts is people complaining about low quality of posts. I have always treated it as concern trolling, and will continue to do so. 

There are people who claim that we've changed direction, or the red pill doesn't mean what it used to. Those people have literally no idea what they're talking about - and clearly are unaware of what TRP started as. They are adding noise. Don't like something? Add more of the content you want to see. It's that simple. Bitching about it is annoying.

---------------
**Field Reports**

It has come to my attention that field reports are becoming a little overwhelming. It's good to report back about your experiences, that's a core part of our sub. What I'm going to request is that you refrain from posting field reports during the week, and we'll have a super-mega-field report thread each monday. If you don't see a super-mega-field report post and it's monday, feel free to start it yourself.

--------
**Videos**

Our general rule we've been using is no video links without a self-post with your analysis. We try to remove them when it happens, but sometimes we don't get there until it's 30 comments in. At that point, the discussion is already there, and so we don't remove it.

I have decided we're going to get more strict on this rule. If a moderator sees a direct video link, it will be deleted, period. With or without comments. If you want to post a video, make a self-post and add it to your analysis.

------------
**Self-Post Links**

I've seen people adding self-posts with nothing in them but a single link. Don't do this. They will be removed on-sight.

------------
**No Participation**

**Doxxing**

Recently we've had a few events with various users attempting or allegedly doxxing eachother or attemping to call out *real life rapists (tm)*. It's drama I don't care for. I forward anything I see to the admin, delete that shit, and move on with my day. Your privacy is your job. If you don't have a throwaway for TRP, you should. A lot of people think simply being here is a sign you will go out and rape people. It's friggin ridiculous, but some people used to lynch black people too, so at this point just assume people will be idiots and think it's their job to deliver justice. Use a throwaway, do not post personally identifying information, and for christ's sake, when you get shadowbanned after being doxxed, it's for your own stupid protection, not a punishment. Take it in stride, make a new account, never speak of the event again, or they will link your new account to your old one. You know who you are, I've deleted all your posts. Take a hint.

**A note on Endorsed Contributors**

Everybody has a different opinion, not everybody is the same. When the moderators see somebody who has solid red pill understanding, we give them the flair. This wasn't their choice, and they're not expected to toe any line. We judge them based on their contributions up until that point. Sometimes they'll say something somewhat ridiculous- but as an exception, not a rule. For the most part, they're solid thinkers and we want to be able to distinguish good solid theory from the noise. 

That's the reason they exist. Just wanted you all to know. It's one more method to help keep the signal high, and the noise low.

You all probably already noticed by now, but we've done a redesign of all the red pill related subs to give them some consistency, and make them a little cleaner. I like them. They look like candy.

I'm sick of hearing people say that sex in real life isn't like porn sex and that we shouldn't watch porn because it gives us unrealistic expectations for our sex lives. What a load of shit, pretty much all my sex has been porn sex; if it isn't then I don't sleep with that girl again.

Is this just another lie fabricated by feminists to absolve them from having to perform in the bedroom? Do blue-pill betas rock gently back and forth in the missionary position thinking they're sexually satisfying both themselves and their partner?

Once you get a couple months in and the novelty wears off, women will begin moulding you into the man they think they want.

**Don't listen to a word of it!**

Once a woman is secure in a relationship she will begin to yearn for beta security over alpha novelty. She will tell you she thinks you should quit staying out drinking with your buddies, stop going to strip clubs, quit being so darn mean to her. It's ok, she will like you more for it, promise!

The problem is that while she may indeed want these things from an economic [**'Marriage 2.0'** perspective](http://www.mgtowforums.com/forums/marriage-sucks/17123-marriage-2-0-clarification.html) as an intellectual being... As an emotional being she will still be driven by the same attractions she had when she met you. And if you no longer attract her... better have another girl lined up.

...

I've been with the same girl for about 4 months now, exclusive for 2, and the changes are starting to set in.  I am doing my best to not merely ignore her terrible suggestions, but show them to her in the hopes of increasing self-awareness.

A great example of this inability/unwillingness to see emotional desire comes from how she perceives *what she thinks now* versus *what she felt with me before*. Every day I tease her ruthlessly. She drops her jaw, gives me a light smack. Invariably she says ""Why are you extra mean today!"" or ""You're never this mean, what's wrong with you?"".

Even though this happens on a daily basis, she remembers the past *experience*, the *emotion* of teasing from my (attempted) alpha-ness. And she remembers that tingly feeling as 'nice'. But in the here-and-now, it is 'mean'.

There are tons of other examples of this I see with her, and I've started pointing them out in the hopes that she will grok it one day.

If you keep doing things in your relationship that demonstrate you have the higher SMV and are the one able to walk away easier - teasing, ignoring her if she's getting annoying, scolding her for tantrums, etc. - maintaining attraction won't be a problem.

I think there is good reason to this.

The answer lies in solipsism: **personal validation**

Imagine two guys interacting with a girl.  One is a gentleman, always nice. His personality is thus separate from the girl, independent. And whatever the girl does the guy continues being nice. His niceness is not a condition of enjoying being with the girl, it is simply part of who he is.

Now the other guy is an asshole. And yet sometimes when the girl is nice (or perhaps even just randomly) this guy lets some niceness shine through. All of a sudden this is a reward for the girl. She earned this, it is because of her that this guy is giving her this rare goodness. She wants to do whatever she can to have this repeated.


Right now one of the girls I'm seeing is also telling me about other guys that hit on her on campus. They are all nice to her and she texts them a bit and then comes to me, tells me she hates them, and yet at the same time calls me an asshole while I make fun of her. And then every 100 statements or so, I say something nice to her and she falls head over heels for me.

Being sarcastic and a bit insulting (even sincerely without jest) establishes a frame where **you are genuine and honest and your praise is something to be earned**, not merely an empty compliment thrown her way like another white knight.

1374892943.0,101,self.TheRedPill,1j511z,Shall we make a list of RP lifehack items/enhancements?,124,23,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1j511z/shall_we_make_a_list_of_rp_lifehack/,"I recently had a girl over the other night who was a bit more uppity than usual. In short, she noticed quite a few of my ""seduction"" items I have around my house. Of course, it was a series of shit tests that I pretty much ignored or agreed &amp; amplified. 

But it got me thinking. So I came here start a ""Red Pill lifehack"" thread where we can list some items we have that make our sexual escapades easier or more efficient. 

I can list a few of my strictly home items:

* I have wet wipes, makeup remover, and a tub full of disposable toothbrushes in the bathroom. I live in Korea and most Korean girls absolutely *insist* on showering up and brushing their teeth before sex *every time*. I have come to appreciate this actually. I get asked sometimes why I have them in there (like I said above) but I just say shit like ""to make it easier for you~ Now it's time to pay me back hehe"".

* Candles and tissues on my bedstand.

* Another ""because I live in Korea"" thing; I have tons of facial/body lotions I have accumulated (and don't really use) since they are given as gifts very often here (even to guys as Kguys use cosmetics). Most girls use these when they get out of the shower. I've gotten compliments that it was cool I had them there to use.

* I have a giant mirror headboard almost exactly like [this](http://www.chariotrv.com/media/images/photogallery/IMG_0247.jpg). This gets tons of shit test-like comments from girls, but in the end they absolutely love it~ Doggy style where I force them to look in the mirror is *quite* satisfying and gets them really turned on. You can get cheap ones from Home Depot I would imagine. I got mine from a moving sale for like 15 bucks. Highly recommend! 

* Bottle of cheap vodka, ice, and tonic water ready in the fridge. Always good to fix a drink when you get to your place. Breaks the ice and gives the illusion of you as the ""master of your domain"".

* Best for last: I have this [exact school girl costume](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/602820568/Free-Shipping-Sexy-3Pcs-Cosplay-Girl-School-Uniform-Adult-Costume-Set-Wholesale-Retail-Min-order-ISet.jpg) that I bought like 4 years ago for an ex-fwb. She always left it at my place so I ended up keeping it. I also kept the packaging, so when the next girl came along, I put it back in the package and presented it to her too; it worked, and I have ended up using it for the past 4 years with each new fwb or gf. I tell them I got it especially for them and it makes them horny as hell (and it's fun for me too). I have had girls seriously lose all self-control and beg me to let them wear the costume because they get so horny and they really lose themselves in the fantasy (pretty much almost every girl I have slept with has had a cosplay fantasy actually). I highly recommend investing in one and keeping it at your place in the original packaging (just say you bought it for them but don't present it as a gift, so you can keep it at your place). The one I bought was from [Gmarket](http://www.gmarket.co.kr) in Korea for only $25. I wash it and iron it before repackaging it each time~

Other than that, I usually queue up iTunes on my computer before I go out so I can immediately put on some music when we get home. Other than that, I don't have anything special for when I hit the bars. I know some card/magic tricks but I would never bring a deck along with me to a bar as I think it looks really douchebaggy...

What are some other RPhacks guys?

I'm a 40ish dad 3 kids, remarried, 2 with 1st wife and 1 with 2nd.  

I recently read your slave labor ""rant"" and I felt the need to tell you how insulted I was reading it and that the overwhelming situational result of divorce ends in financial difficulty for dad.  

I'm no deadbeat, my ex has benefited 100s of thousands of dollars in total from the divorce settlement and resulting support of which I am current.  When my initial separation was forced upon me with a perjured restraining order, I spent nearly 18 months basically homeless, living off the charity of family members because of crushing support obligations.  

It has taken me 7 years to return to financial normalcy bearing the financial encumbrance.  I lost everything in the divorce and had to rebuild from more than $50K in the hole.

I had to work day and night for years while also attending college.  It was excruciatingly difficult.  Not once did anyone ever feel sorry for me.  It was by sheer force of some sort of otherworldly will I can't believe I managed to possess, that I emerged from the hole dug for me. I can definitely understand how some fathers fail in meeting obligations and I take your characterization of your ex with a grain of salt.  As a matter of fact, I just naturally assume you are actively slandering him in hopes this blog nets you a windfall. 

The thing is...  My ex said many of the things you say about your ex.  She claimed I was a drug addict, never-do-well, loser and constantly put me down to anyone within earshot - including our kids.  IT WAS ALL BULLSHIT.  The truth of it was we were two people very unhappy with the marriage, both very sad and disenchanted with unmet expectations.  The difference was - I was duty bound to the children to try and make it work and she was not.

She opportunistically used my guilt and sadness against me to crush me in the divorce and leave me in abject poverty.  Then with the struggles that I faced afterwards, she used as proof to her claims.

In the end, the children did not benefit.  They suffered.  When you step on your ex's head to lift yourself up, you take a bad situation and turn it into a nightmare.  There is no possible way to completely hide the tension and the children are definitely hurt and confused in the aftermath.  

Ex-husband fathers are not an automatic means for a financial perpetuity you can manipulate for the sole sake of financial gain.  The kids need us.  You destroying us out of greed and a need for revenge destroys them.  You're negative blogging about your ex hurts the kids.  It's completely immoral and selfish of you.  Shame on you. Even if the things you say are true, you owe your kids to put their father in the most positive light possible.

You think divorce is easy on us men?  For us it is life changing in a profoundly negative way.  The worst part of it all is, there are 100 or even 1000 guys like me, who have suffered as I have - who has seen his children suffer as I have - for every every woman who has to deal with an actual so-called ""deadbeat"".  The whole notion of the poor-single mom is a farce and a horrible injustice.  Not only do you have an income source from the ex in addition to making your own salary, you are now free to seek out an additional income source from another hubby if you were so inclined.

If we don't pay, our credit is destroyed, our driver's license is revoked and we are jailed.

Every single thing you have whined, cried and sought sympathy for on this blog, I have faced and overcame ten times worse.  You would not have made it.

1373727873.0,96,self.TheRedPill,1i7x2w,How feminists fail to understand masculinity,130,34,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i7x2w/how_feminists_fail_to_understand_masculinity/,"I am posting a comment I made on a blog. It was made in regards to some comments about masculinity made by one of the feminists over at thegoodmenproject.com that supposedly cares about mens issues:

In another thread she called conventional masculinity ass hatery. Going into detail she mentioned things such as being competetive, stoic, dominant, aggressive and strong as toxic masculinity and ass-hatery or something like that. The problem is all those are normal traits in a person with failry high testosterone levels. I am like that to a large degree although I have other traits as well. She and most feminist completely fail to understand such traits in a reasonable way.

Aggressive drive is interperated as anger motivated or ill intent. Which it most certainly is not. I use aggressive drive when I want to achieve something and when I focus. I use it when I spar in martial arts. And when I use it like that trying to knock out a friend I am sparing with I have no ill feelings towards him I only wish him well. This aggressive drive, if you see it as immoral, gets not turned of but turned inward where it becomes depression and self loathing and anger towards oneself. It tends to reassert itself as passive aggressiveness and I belive is largely responsible for the snarkiness of feminist men. Once it does boil over and start turning itself outward again THEN it has ill intent.

Being stoic is also a positive masculine trait. Feminists think this means repressing emotions but it does not. It means being able to remain calm and composed AT THE SAME TIME as you are experiencing strong emotion. It means having a still center within a storm. It is related to the quality of an impartial observer that you develop through Buddhist meditation. It is about having equanimity. For me that is quite natural and to me it seems obvious when observing men that this is a strong tendency in most and more prevalent the more masculine they are in general. Women on the other hand (and more feminine men) tend more towards experiencing emotion in a way where they are fully outwardly embodying and expressing the emotion and sort of get caught in the emotion (being caught in the emotion is not meant by me as negative). When they look at masculine men (and more masculine women) they interperate what they see as repressing emotions because the men don`t get caught in the emotion like they do. They seem far to still and unexpressive. So something must be wrong. Because if a highly feminine person was still and unexpressive like that it would mean they held emotions in and tightened themselves up to remain composed because they are not able to do that any other way. So the misinterperation of male stoicism that feminism has and has spread to the rest of society stems from the projection of the experience of feminist women (and some feminine men) onto men.

The result of such projection of course is to try to feminize men as the logical conclusion is that these men holding back emotion must start to display evidence of processing emotion in a way these people find believable for them to be healthy. Which is precisely what feminism has done and what feminists continuosly do and what I constantly see in feminist men and it is exactly what happened to me. The result of a man that is naturally masculine trying to process emotion in a feminine way is that he becomes dysfunctional and weak. Actually becoming like a feminine person and living that successfully does not work. I tried for years and it only made me miserable.

Being competetive is not a negative trait either. It is a drive to achieve that has been responsible for much (most?) of human acomplishment. It is also fundamentally misunderstood by feminists. When men compete directly it is combined with a form of respect for the competitor and deference to whoever wins out at any given time that makes the competition also into a form of cooperation. All male groups form dominance hierarchies and these are based on respect for the skills that are deemed relevant and the personal strength (dominance) and leadership abilities of the men involved. Men constantly compete in these but they constantly form hierarchies based on the competition that leads to highly efficient cooperation. The competition drives the effort which in turn powers the effectiveness of the cooperation of the hierarchy.

Women struggle to undestand these dynamics because they themselves feel much more threatened by clear hierarchies and direct competition in their female groups. Both those lead to hostility and the break down of cooperation in all woman groups. Women don`t understand how content men can be with a position that is not “equal” and they don`t understand the willingess of men to seamlessly (mostly) swap position and status and to seemingly fight the other in competition without it being seen as hostile but just a “part of the game”, as men do. Female groups cooperate overtly and punish outright direct competition and challenges but are full of indirect competition and challenges and have very clear hierarchies that are covered up and not made explicit or clear. So when feminists want cooperation what they want is feminine cooperation. That in turn means more feminisng of men and more shaping society in a one sided way to suit women, hence more matriarchy. It means EXTINGUISHING maleness. It is a form of psychological castration. And when they attack male competitiveness they are doing the same thing and are in fact showing that they do in fact find what men naturally are to be inherently evil and trying to extinguish it. Once again it is all about projection. The more I see feminism for what it is the more narcicism becomes the accurate diagnosis. How self absorped do you have to be to see the world in this manner and set out to extinguish what men naturally are.

Dominance is not evil either. It basically means vying for leadership and authority and power. WHAT you do with that dominance is what makes it moral or immoral. You can combine the will to dominance with the intention of shaping that which you have dominion over for good for those close to you as well as your self, you can include the wider society or the world or you can just aim for selfish gain. The will to excert power over the world and the people in it is a necessary drive that has benefited women indirectly, and which has been encouraged by women indirectly, since the begining of time. And nothing fires up a mans energy, willpower and drive and willingness to sacrifice like when his quest for dominance is motivated by a higher purpose such as his women and children or a wider group of people or a divine power. The quest for dominance flows nicely with the competetive drive it is a brother of within the male hierarchical competetive cooperation structure.

HeaterN and most feminists probably don`t even understand how integrity and principle, higher purpose and truth are essential masculine virtues and connected to all of the other things. Has any feminist theorist of note, except Paglia of course, celebrated or pointed out ANY masculine virtues?

for the past 3 and a half years, I've been dating a woman.

started off pretty much like everything I've read here so far. lots of sex in the beginning, even willing to try kinkier things to try to keep me interested. decided to extend my Trial into a Subscription (lol World of Warcraft reference, +1 for you if you got it) and things immediately changed.

* started spending long hours hanging out with ""friends"" online in second life
* Started keeping her computer locked, being secretive
* Stopped talking to me for the most part
* Sex slowed to once or twice every 6 months, plain vanilla ""chore"" sex

Well, on Wednesday she dumped me because she ""wasn't happy"" and ""couldn't live like this"" anymore (she let herself go completely, did no cooking, cleaning, helping around the house, nothing. sat at her computer sun up to sun down, playing second life, streaming movies, etc.) and that somehow they way she was living was my fault. i told her ""if that's what you want, fine."" and that was that.

But apparently, for her, it wasn't. she apparently thought that saying ""I'm leaving you, I'm moving out"" was just a really good test, or thing to say to guilt me into going all beta for her. but that wasn't happening.

so last night i went out, found a cute little thing, and had some of the best sex of my life. 4 hours later i staggered into my apartment to her screaming and threatening and otherwise having a complete psychotic break.

didn't let it phase me at all. ignored it, had a smoke, washed up, went to bed.

she dumped me, and is mad that I'm moving on? really? okay. you go ahead and be angry. but thing is, you left ME. I'm just getting on with my life. sorry that bothers you.

I tried to make it work over 3 years. she didn't want to change, didn't want to improve herself any. just wanted a walking wallet with personality. well i hope she finds what she wants with some little beta somewhere. that's not me anymore.",Rant/Venting,False,,t5_2ve1u,1371872161.0,rant,,True,t3_1gsx9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1gsx9g/for_my_cake_day_ended_my_3_year_blue_pill/,

Women don`t understand how content men can be with a position that is not “equal” and they don`t understand the willingess of men to seamlessly (mostly) swap position and status and to seemingly fight the other in competition without it being seen as hostile but just a “part of the game” as men do. Womens groups cooperate overtly and punish outright direct competition and challenges but are full of indirect competition and challenges and have very clear hierarchies that are covered up and not made explicit or clear. So when feminists want cooperation what they want is feminine cooperation. That in turn means more feminisng of men and more shaping society ina one sided way to suit women, hence more matriarchy. It means EXTINGUISHING maleness. It is a form of psychological castration. And when they attack male competetiveness they are doing the same thing and are in fact showing that they do in fact find what men naturally are to be inherently evil and trying to extinguish it. Once again it is all about projection. The more I see feminism for what it is the more narcicism becomes the acurate diagnosis. How self absorped do you have to be to see the world in this manner and set out to extinguish what men naturally are.

Dominance is not evil either. It basically means vying for leadership and authority and power. WHAT you do with that dominance is what makes it moral or immoral. You can combine the will to dominance as with and intention of shaping that which you have dominion over for good for those close to you as well as your self, you can include the wider society or the world or you can just aim for selfish gain. The will to excert power over the world and the people in it is a necessary drive that has benefited women indirectly, and which has been encouraged by women indirectly, since the begining of time. And nothing fires up a mans energy, willpower and drive and willingness to sacrifice if his quest for dominance is motivated by a higher purpose such as his women and children or a wider group of people or a divine power. The quest for dominance flows nicely with the competetive drive it is a brother of within the male hierarchical competetive cooperation structure.

HeaterN and most feminists probably don`t even understand how integrity and principle, higher purpose and truth are essential masculine virtues and connected to all of the other things. Has any feminist theorist of note, except Paglia of course, celebrated or pointed out ANY masculine virtues?

Welcome to 10,000 folks! Here’s to 10,000 more!

What is the Puerarchy you ask? Let’s look to Ian Ironwood for the answer:

&gt;The Puerarchy, for those who are new to the term, is a Manosphere term-of-art used to describe the phenomenon most recently called out as “ExtendedAdolescence” (as this harsh assessment of the group by the Guardian Angels, of all people, points out): the tendency for young men to spend a decade or so getting drunk, high, laid, and wiped out from video game exhaustion and porn marathons instead of applying nose to grindstone, getting a college education that will allow them to support their future ex-wives.  It’s perplexing for feminists because it means the pool of “acceptable” men for marriage and procreation (and productive tax-paying to support the welfare state) is drying up.  It’s perplexing for conservatives in the Manosphere because the Puerarchy seems to be thumbing its nose as traditional Conservative values of hard work and ambition, and succumbing to the pleasures of the flesh and the decadence of the West they shun.

Some points she tries to make: 

1) Looks have no effect on a woman   
2) Changes her mind and says yes looks do matter if you are hitting on a woman, but that's impossible anyway unless you are a model   
3) Hitting on women out of the blue is a bad strategy and doomed for failure. This includes bars.  
4) women don't like being hit on  
5)  ""Hi my name is ____"" is the WORST pickup line in the book   
6) The only way you can have any type of relationship is by befriending a woman first and then developing feelings for each other.   
7) the key to winning a woman's heart is speaking to a woman on a woman's terms. It's so simple!

Well gentlemen, I don't know what to tell you.What's more boggling? The fact that she even believes this to be a set of hard and fast rules or that men actually believe this nonsense to be true.

1374606600.0,88,self.TheRedPill,1iwigd,The 21 Year Old Hostess,133,45,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1iwigd/the_21_year_old_hostess/,"This is my first field report. I learned a lot from this experience, some of you might find it valuable. It's aimed mostly at older guys, but there are lessons for everyone.

FYI: I'm 33.

Last Wednesday night I was out with a friend, let's call him Bill. We started on a rooftop patio. It was fairly dead. There were 2 separate pairs of girls, 1 pair was young (early 20s), the other was older (early 30s). We targeted the young girls. Bill waves one of the girls over to sit at our table. She does. I move to their table to ""keep the other girl company."" The girl is a 5, but she's Asian, which to me is an automatic +1. We chat. She doesn't seem too interested. I get her number anyway. The girls leave. We switch our attention to the older girls. They are remarkably receptive. They watched us hit on the young girls, they watched me get a number, they loved our attention. They were both 6-7 (but too old for my tastes). Turns out they aren't from my city, but from a super conservative town south. A town you would never live in unless you were super conservative. We bail.

We switch venues to another patio bar. While walking Bill gets a text from a girl he's working hard to sleep with. He invites her to join us. At this time I get a text from some other friends looking to go out, I invite them to join us since Bill is going to be distracted. The 5 of us get to the bar around the same time.

After a few drinks I realize there are no girls to hit on, other than the staff. So, I decide to hit on the hostess. She was sitting by herself looking bored. My opener: ""You look bored, a hostess should always be smiling, let me see you smile."" She smiles. I flirt for awhile, my regular push-pull. She eats it up. After 5 minutes her boss comes over and gives her shit and tells her to get back to work. I laugh at her and go back to my friends.

20 minutes later, she's standing by herself again. I go over. ""Let me make it up to you for getting you in trouble."" I hand her my phone with a blank contact screen open. She puts in her number and her full name. I say, ""I'm going to text you naughty things."" I text her ""Naughty Things."" (I stole this from seddit, it works a treat) She laughed.

15 minutes later I'm back with my friends. We're talking about a local beach volleyball tournament. I make a joke about looking for my speedo. I get a text ""I'd like to see you in a speedo."" BOOM! It's on!

As we leave, I go up to the Hostess and tell her to meet me when she gets off. She replies, ""maybe.""

My friends all work the next morning so they bail. I have no problem rolling solo, so I head to another bar. The Hostess texts me (no longer than 5 minutes after I leave) that she's getting off and wants to meet. I tell her where. After a few texts back and forth she changes her mind and flakes. I carry on with my night solo.

The next afternoon the Hostess texts, ""How was the XXXX bar."" I respond, ""no small talk over text, I'm go to XXX coffee shop to read the paper and sit in the sun, join me."" ""I'm running errands, give me an hour?"" 

She's good to her word and meets me in an hour. During our conversation I use my Sherlock Holmesesque deductive abilities to figure out she's 21. 

My initial thoughts went something like, ""Oh shit this girl is young, she's not going to be into a guy 12 years older than her."" 

What I say is, ""woah woah woah, that means you're 21? Holy fuck you're young.""

Her: Um yeah, it that a problem?

me: I don't know, would you say you're mature for your age?

Her: Yes!

Me: I'll be the judge of that, carry on with your story.

For the rest of the conversation I maintained the frame that she was too young for me, and that she'd have to prove herself worthy of my time. I walked her home and kissed her.

We made plans to get together after she was done work that night (read: late night). She flakes. I scolded her and told her flaking was unacceptable. She asked how she can make it up to me. I gave her 3 options:

1. Come over now

2. Never flake again

3. Send sexy pics

She chose number 2.

Friday night I went to a local sports event. She texts and asks to get together. I tell her I'm at the game and that I'll text her later. 

Brief aside: I use Friday and Saturday nights to develop new plates. Sunday-Thursday is for harem girls. The Hostess didn't really qualify as either, so I decided to just put her off and hit on new women.

The weather was shit. No one was out. So I decided to change my mind and contacted the Hostess. She's excited to hear from me. Tells me she'll come meet me. 20 minutes later she flakes.

This has been 3 flakes (2 too many). I write her off. She completely fell out of my interest. 

Saturday she texts me: I know how to make it up to you.

BOOM! Nude pic!

Suddenly I'm interested again.

I respond: Not bad, you still have a lot of work to do.

I'll fast forward a bit (this is already too long). We set up a time to meet Sunday evening. 

She comes over. I pour her some wine. She gets a bit tipsy. She then starts talking about all the sex she's had in the past. I quickly interrupt her and tell her I wasn't interested in the sex she's had in the past, only in the sex she'd have that night. ""That's not going to happen! We're not having sex tonight!"" For those still new to this, when a girl says you are not going to have sex, what she means is you are going to have sex. Sure enough, within a few hours we're having sex. At one point she actually stops and says:

""Not bad for a 21 year old hey?""

Later, after we had had sex twice more, she told me she didn't want to have sex so soon. She had hoped to make me wait. I asked her, ""Why should I have to pay a higher price than the guys before me?"" After some hamstering she comes right out and says, ""now you wont chase me, because you've already had me.""

**The Lessons**

Approaching the girls at the first place warmed me up, even though nothing came from that.

Having another girl at my table likely worked as pre-selection

Young girls are attracted to an older guys experience. She ""bragged"" about past sex as a way to show that she too has experience. She just wasn't smart enough to understand experience isn't attractive to men.

Perceived disadvantages can be turned into advantages. Instead of thinking I was too old for her, I changed it to she's too young for me. The fact i enjoy reading the paper exaggerated our age difference, and added to my perceived experience. With enough frame control anything can be a strength.

Girls like to be chased. When they flake it could be because they want you to work harder. When she realized I wasn't interested in playing that game, she sent me a nude pic to try to re-hook me.

Young girls are very fun to sleep with.

Bonus tip: When getting a girls number always hand her your phone with a blank contact screen. If she enters her full name she's interested. If she only enters her first name you haven't developed enough attraction/rapport.

Since we've grown from 0 to 12,600 in about half a year, I think it's time we do a little organization.

A new trend I'm seeing is a lot of newbies here are wondering if they're applying the red pill properly in their lives. 

Now, this is a good question.. but with such an influx of new subscribers, it tends to drown out other red pill discussion.

Introducing /r/askTRP 

We are leaving the ask trp flair here because there will still be relevant questions to ask our main sub, such as:

* What do you think of this theory?
* Has anybody else noticed this trend?
* What's TRP's position on this or that?

However personalized questions will now be directed towards /r/askTRP such as:

* I had an argument last night with GF, did I handle this well?
* My GF is giving me trouble, don't know what to do..?
* I ran into a weird shit test, what's your opinion?

As always, my main direction in moderating and directing this subreddit and it's network has been ensuring that all members have the ability to express themselves, their anger, frustration, and other emotions. While most places try to temper the message by ensuring it's politically correct, we have no such compulsion.

So instead of removing personal questions, we're just moving them over.

**Older Members**, I invite you to pop over to /r/asktrp every so often, try to lend a hand where you can.

I don't usually do this but I'm going to break this shit down because of how much it pissed me off. 

First: the title.

&gt;Why are guys so bitter about dating?

Starts out with shaming language right out of the gate. 

Second: The OP goes to askwomen instead of askmen. Arrogantly assuming that either women know what's going on in men's heads better than men themselves, or that men's opinions don't matter.

And what does the top post in the thread say?

&gt;Guys don't seem to have this. You can read on the ask men or the posts her about being a virgin. One really common phrase I've seen is feeling like a loser, along with self disparaging comments. **For guys, having a girlfriend, especially a hot girlfriend, is a status symbol. It is a marker of success, and an important one at that. Having casual sex gets them a social status in many male social circles, and failing to do so can be stigmatized, but that's another discussion I don't want to go into. When they can't get a girlfriend, they feel like they've failed majorly in a important social status way.**

That's right, getting a girlfriend isn't about intimacy or sex. It's about improving your social status. This was rage inducing on two levels. 

First: It shows women's downright refusal to empathize with (or even listen to) men.

Second: It shows the way women think about men. Women love to assume that men think the way they do. It's why feminists think that rape isn't about sex; it's about power (because women use sex to control men.) It's why feminists believe in rape culture (at least half of women have rape fantasies and assume men fantasize about raping women as much as women fantasize about being raped.) And it's the reason women accuse men of misogyny (because they think men hate women as much as women hate men.) and entitlement (while at the same time expecting special treatment because they're women)

That's right. To the denizens of askwomen, men are a fashion accessory. A way to leverage social status and look good in front of their friends.

I told myself two things A.) Alpha up, and B.) Remember ""the comment"" (Recently someone on here in a thread made a comment that had a profound impact on my mindset with how I approach women.

My reply to the flirty text was a short ""Send me some dirty snap chats sometime"" 

I've always been a major nice guy and have NEVER just outright said something like that. Never asked for pics or anything before this. I didn't ask, I told her to do it. I think she was caught off guard because she didn't see that coming from nerdy old me, and it worked.

Gee, somebody really should let the cat out of the bag with this ""confidence works, motherfucker"" secret!

So I've probably read through this book about 20 times now. (It's that good) but anyway after being hooked on theredpill for some time I'm starting to see some connections between lessons in it and Game that might be helpful for you guys. 

All of you know what the [Rationalization Hamster](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/17xmry/acronym_and_glossary_thread/) is and how often women use it. Well what I'm really seeing here is a connection to women attempting to be ""noble."" As Dale Carnegie says in his book ""*The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.*"" So what I'm going to try to do here is redefine the hamster in a way that makes it more understandable and allow you to use it to your advantage when picking up women. 

The idea for this hit me when I was reading [a post by zioncontroller about 5 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1h7hrn/seducing_a_woman_with_a_bf_quick_pointers/carmoj5?context=3) and I had a viola! moment after hearing a TED talk I made a post about earlier today. This is something that zioncontroller (advanced PUA) has been using to his advantage already, and probably learned from experience vs. reading material. 

So here it goes. The link at the top is a summary of chapter 10 of Carengie's book, and the lesson is **""Appeal to the Nobler Motives.""** He goes into detail about how to use it in business and with your kids, but it can also be used in game - and it will allow you to use the rationalization hamster in your favor.

To understand this, let me expand on the hamster. For the most part I see most men on here explaining it as a Logic Wheel that spits out random cognitive dissonance to solve mental conflicts. Well, it's actually not very random at all. All of the things that the hamster wheel spits out is based on what good ole Dale said about people: ""*all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.*"" This means that you can predict all of the possible outcomes of hamstering unless the woman is clinically insane (in which case, dodge a bullet and run away). This is possible because in fact because EVERYONE is at least a little selfish, but almost nobody(especially women) want to appear that way. 

This is advanced game. To use this you need to be able to size up the circumstances you are in, recognize shit-tests, and have a pretty high confidence level. There are many ways to use this to your advantage, so let me give you a few examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1) Zioncontroller's field report is a great example of it. (see the link above)

A girl with a boyfriend texts zioncontroller giving him a clear IOI. She then goes into talking about relationship problems. 
**At this point the hamster wheel is already spinning, she is looking for an excuse to cheat/break off from her boyfriend.**
So what does zioncontroller do? He uses that to his advantage by appealing to her nobler motive and giving her a valid excuse to come sleep with him.

&gt;Me: Is he with another woman? Maybe you just need to releive your frustrations on someone

The move was flawless really. In one sentence he fed her hamster a logical motive (my boyfriend might already be cheating on me so why can't I do the same?) and got her thinking about sex as a revenge tactic rather than the dirty shameless cheating that it really is. 

---------------------------------------------------------
Example 2) [RSD Julien on making women fall psychotically in love with you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFuMi36mg2k)

This scrawny guy has some serious game, and he uses the hamster to his advantage in almost every scenario - especially this video. He talks about girls that confront him after seeing he's a professional PUA online:

&gt;*She'll come up to me and be like ""I can't believe you fucking pulled that shit on me, you know what we're over!""*

His response:

&gt;*You know what, I said that just for the seminar (my job), you know with you it's even more different! (you're special).* 

What he does is guide the hamster's output. Instead of it putting the blame on him, it puts the blame on her for being mad at him. Hamster says: ""After all, he's just doing this for his job. And he said I'm a great gal that is special and PUA wouldn't work on! How can I be mad at him? He must be a really great guy to realize how special I am.""

----------------------------------------------------------
Example 3) [Scottishredpill with women getting mad about him not buying drinks](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1cf803/asshole_nice_guy_in_disguise/)

&gt;After a beer and a smoke, I open the 2-set, blonde called Jane, and a brunette called Sara sat at the bar next to me. I had seen them close down 3 approaches and decided to practice getting closed down.

I'll get to why the above part is important in a second. Here's the story summarized:

So two girls start racking up a tab and then get furious when he doesn't pay for their drinks (that they ordered on their own tab). SRP does the sensible thing and walks away from the hysterical women. About 30 minutes later the calmer (who is wearing a large wedding ring) of the two runs into him while out for a smoke and asks for him to sit next to her. They talk for a bit and then here's where he drops the Nobler Motive bomb:

&gt;She (Sara, wedding ring) informs me that I messed up and could have gotten with Jane, I reply that Jane isn't my type. We make eye contact, smile, I change the subject and then her hamster goes into overdrive.
&gt;She (Sara, wedding ring) drags me back inside, makes Jane apologize, and we continue like nothing happened. Oh, except Sara will not let go of my hand.

You can see her hamster spinning here. At this point she saw SRP's value and wanted him herself, but she's a married woman and is trying to do the nobler thing by setting her single friend Jane up and getting her friend Jane laid with a quality guy. Note that she had already denied men earlier in the night. Anyhow. SRP uses tact to influence the hamster output here. Her nobler motive was to get her friend laid, but that is now off the table. And, by giving her eye contact and a smilet, it let her hamster come to that actualization she was his type. Leap for joy, she was his type.  From there the hamster told her that she should totally fuck him since her friend isn't going to get it anyway, and after all, according to him she is better than her single friend so she must be a good person if he likes her.

The end result:

&gt;After the club I walk her back to her hotel and give into her seductive ways.

------------------------------------------------------

There you have it. The hamster is really just her internal conscious looking for a noble motive to get down and dirty. I especially like RSD Julien's motive ""this is my chance to live the fantasy fairy tale! I have to go for it."" And in that TED talk earlier today: ""Why don't women leave abusive mates before things get really bad?"" A: Because they think they can help them (Which is a nobler motive generated by the hamster, the truth being sexual attraction because abusive mates tend to also be alphas).

*Disclaimer: As mentioned this is advanced game. It will require a lot of confidence to use this without coming off as a beta.*

When I get back to town I will be in a new tax bracket which means new toys, and new women. Basically, I've been letting my plates spin down and crash, but decided to spin one more up for the summer. The fact that I recently spent some time visiting my Aunt for the 4th and she shamed my strategy of pursuing younger women may or may not have something to do with that. To be fair my Aunt is fairly RP and feminine, but a bad divorce combined with having two daughters means the feminine imperative will always rear its ugly head.

**Aunt**: How are things? You seeing anyone? Blahblahblah (My Aunt is best friends with my ex-girlfriend's Aunt so she knows some of my dating history, and our families have been friends for decades. There's no incest, we think.)

**SH**: Good good, just been dating a little here and there.  

**Aunt**: Any of them going to make the cut? You ever going to start a family?

**SH**: No Aunt Name, I will not be having any children, or getting married. The social climate has changed drastically and I cannot have what Grandpa had.  

**Aunt**: That's too bad honey, you have to so much to offer as a father.  

**SH**: I know, but it is just not a risk I am willing to take. Women and children are legal liabilities these days.  

**Aunt**: What are you going to do?  

**SH**: Casually date 18-23 year olds for the rest of my life.  

**Aunt**: That's disgusting.  

**SH**: Why?  

**Aunt**: Because I have daughters.  

**SH**: I'm not dating your daughters.  

**Aunt**: But you're dating somebody's daughter.  

**SH**: I'm always dating somebody's daughter. &lt;sly grin&gt;  

**Aunt**: Don't you want someone closer to your age? That way you have more to talk about.  

**SH**: Not really. You know I've tried dating women my age and it just isn't worth it. They've been through it all and the baggage shows with every year closer to 30. I don't really need to have deep conversations about geopolitics with her. My priorities are how attractive she is and how pleasant she is to be around, everything else is irrelevant.  

**Aunt**: I guess, but that's still gross. You better not bring her around here! &lt;laughs&gt; She won't be much older than your *little* cousins!  

**SH**: I'm not real concerned with the family's approval. These women aren't going to be around long enough regardless.  

**Aunt**: &lt;Shakes head and smiles&gt; Alright honey.

Fast forward to last night and I head out to watch the fights (R.I.P. Silva) at one of my local watering holes and a very bubbly, feminine, and attractive blonde takes care of me.  

**Plate**: Hi how are ya? Can I get you started with a drink?  

**SH**: Iced tea and keep'em coming, and I think I am going to eat.

**Plate**: Need a menu?  

**SH**: Nope, Shepherd's pie.  

**Plate**: Alright I'll put that right in.  

Smiles and steady eye contact right from the get go. I know I am going to be here for several hours as it is around 7PM and the main event isn't going to be until midnight so I take it *real* slow. For the rest of the night my Iced Tea rarely even hits halfway and we banter back and forth about the other patrons. One of her tables has a bunch of HOO-RAH Marines who are randomly barking and just being obnoxious. One of them ends up puking so she stops by and we bullshit some about that. She sits down at one point and we talk about the fights as I had mentioned that's the main reason I was here, and had her change the channel to the preliminaries on the TV closest to me.  

**SH**: Big fight tonight. I'm pumped for Silva.  

**Plate**: My ex-boyfriend did that whole cage fighting thing, so I actually know who Silva is!!  

**SH**: Well, you should cheer for him because I am.  

**Plate**: Definitely!!





A few hours go by of more back and forth and she sits down to chat yet again. This is where it gets interesting. A very *nice* fella sits down next to her, introduces himself, offers a handshake and does the ""I have your hand so now you have to talk to me"" routine. She immediately goes into full rejection mode.

**Beta**: I'd love to take you out some time, yadda yadda, dinner, movie, etc.  

**Plate**: I have a boyfriend.  

**Beta**: Damage control, etc.  

**Plate**: I have been cheated on by all of my boyfriends so I'm not ok with going out with other guys.  

**Beta**: Ok  

He leaves, she sits there and gives me the ""OMG"" look and I start laughing.  

**SH**: Well, he gets an E for effort.  

**Plate**: Yeah, E for effort is right.  

**SH**: Well, at least he tried right?  

**Plate**: Yeah... I guess.  

We both laugh and she heads out again. I could just imagine that ""nice guy"" being me a decade earlier and if I was a nice person I may have actually felt something watching him crash and burn. Based on our conversation earlier I am fairly positive she does not, in fact, have a boyfriend. Not that it would really matter anyway, but that is one less shit test to crush. Fights end, I'm pissed, so even though I do not normally drink I order one anyway to mourn the end of Silva's dynasty. Plate sits down again to chat.  

**SH**: So I'm betting you don't actually have a boyfriend.  

**Plate**: Nope.  

**SH**: &lt;Laughs&gt; That felt like ""I don't really have a boyfriend, but you're not going to be my boyfriend, so I am going to tell you I have a boyfriend.""  

**Plate**: Exactly. My ex cheated on me and we broke up a while back and just recently stopped talking so I am really just interested in focusing on me, some self-improvement is in order.

**SH**: I get it. I am kind of in a similar place because my ex was quite high maintenance and couldn't deal with a man who actually has spine.


Shared sob stories and just a *tiny* bit of beta to establish rapport. Woe is us, our exes are evil. We banter a little bit more and she heads off to eat a salad. Good girl. Half hour or so goes by and I am ready to head out, so I decide to close it.  

&lt;Hands Plate my phone&gt;  

**SH**: Put your number in here. I know you said earlier you were in a weird space but I'm not really the kind of guy to buy you flowers and take you out to dinner, but you seem cool and I like cool people.  

By displaying that I have more options than the ""nice guy"" who hit on her just 30 minutes earlier I have instantly piqued her interest, the hamster does the rest.

**Plate**: &lt;Enters number in phone&gt; You do seem cool and you're really easy to talk to.  

I pay my tab, wish her well, and head on home.  

About an hour or so later I send her a text.

**SH**: Plate, SH here. Figured I would shoot you a text so when you get a phone call this week it isn't just some random number.  

This is what is known as a ""confirmation text"" and it is very important to avoid the reset. If you're not familiar with a reset it boils down to this. Women, *especially* attractive women get so much attention your head would explode. After a decade+ of dating them I've seen it all. From the dozens of messages they get daily on social media, texting, and in real life from orbiters and men hitting on them constantly. My theory is that the reset is a coping mechanism. These broads are getting sensory overload with all this attention, so their attention spans are very short and they tend to ""reset"" on what seems like a daily basis. Anything that happened in the past is nearly forgotten and they tend to only live in the moment. By sending the confirmation text I carve out a little bit of territory in her brain, set the expectation for my next escalation, and avoid the reset. Now, I'm in my early 30's and have some ""old school"" strategies that work for me. I despise using strictly text to communicate with women because my sense of humor is extremely deadpan, sarcastic, and uses a lot of subtlety which doesn't always translate well via text. I prefer phone calls, but do whatever works for you. Basically, that will be the last text I send her until absolutely necessary for logistics.

Just got a reply a few hours ago.

**Plate**: Mkay. Lol your added SH! (:  

A ""Lol"", the incorrect usage of *you're*, and a smilie. I &lt;3 twenty year olds. Although, I really wish she didn't have a bunch of visible tattoos. When are these dames going to learn you don't put bumper stickers on a Ferrari? Ahh well, what are ya gonna do?


**Conclusion**: It doesn't matter if she has a boyfriend, tells some other guy she has a boyfriend, or is actually married. If she is attracted enough to you she will do whatever you want. Raise your SMV, learn to hold your space well and pace conversations. Escalate properly and never listen to what a woman says, *watch* how she says it. She even caught me starting at her tits a few times and I would just make eye contact and smile. None of it matters, none of it. Your attraction level dictates the vast majority of how any encounter plays out and it is your job to steer it in the desired direction. Non-verbal cues are *huge* and I could tell based on her randomly checking me out, constantly sitting down to chat, and general friendly attitude that she was interested.

I was watching some reality TV since nothing else was on at like 11pm before going to bed, and this show called Millionaire Matchmaker came on. 

Basically its a show where millionaires pay a woman to hook them up with a future LTR. After an episode or two I started to notice some things. Most of the guys were mid 30s early 40s millionaires looking for someone to marry. That's great, but the women they were getting set up were all late 20s 30s hitting the wall. One guy even asked the host woman for younger women and she refused saying it was ""creepy"" (may I also add that this woman is also hitting the wall, probably early 30s). 

Then the thing that made me say holy shit this red pill stuff is everywhere is when one of the millionaire guys said that on first dates he would take his mini-van with kids car seats in it and never disclosed his finances to them, so to weed out the women who just wanted him for his money. The host was pretty perturbed by that (probably because it gave the man more power/control) and the hamster started spinning. She refused to hook him up with dates if he didn't take his expensive Ferrari, saying the test was ""immature and wierd"". 

Thats all, i just wanted to say after swallowing this info you start to see this shit everywhere.

**The Dating Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Emerging Science of Human Courtship**

**Abstract:** 

&gt; In the years following its [The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists (2006)] release, the Community has rapidly garnered mainstream media attention[...]Many of its [PUA community's] most prominent authorities claim to use insights and information gleaned both through first-hand experience as well as empirical research in evolutionary psychology[...]The following review argues that many of these claims are in fact grounded in solid empirical findings from social, physiological and evolutionary psychology.

**Introduction:** 

&gt; The primary conceptual domains[...]promulgated to represent the various phases of human courtship include Attraction, building mutual Comfort and Trust, and Seduction[...]However, despite the growing success of this industry, few psychologists and social scientists have taken a critical look as to whether or not the various concepts and teachings promoted by this Community can be substantiated by empirical psychological research.

**Community Literature on Human Courtship Strategies**: 

Introduces background info on *The Mystery Method* and *The Game* for readers who are uninitiated. 

&gt; Markovik situates his teachings within a Darwinian framework, arguing his “science of social dynamics” is firmly grounded in evolutionary psychology research[...] [He] ostensibly draws from Darwinian theory with the declaration, “Nature will unapologetically weed your genes out of existence if you don't take action and learn how to attract women now” [and] highlights the adaptive discrepancy between the modern environment and the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990) noting that, “while unimaginably sophisticated and complicated, [we] are nonetheless an out-of-date model. Put simply, nature has not designed [us] for the world in which [we] live.

**Parental Investment Theory and Conflict between the Sexes**

Basically, the PUA community aligns with the well known study by Trivers’ (1972) that the ""the sex with higher parental investment (i.e., time and energy spent in gestation and rearing offspring) will be choosier with respect to mate selection."" Therefore, women are much ""choosier"" than men when it comes to mating and sex. 

Here's the most important part of the paper:

&gt;In the absence of a clear understanding of the biological bases of such differences, the courtship process and ensuing relationship dynamics can often appear confusing, frustrating and even debilitating. Such conflicts of interest in men and women’s sexual strategies (Buss and Schmitt, 1993), often coined “the war of the sexes”, can be a significant cause of conflict and ultimately failure to find and maintain a lasting long-term relationship. However, as we will argue, this conflict is not inevitable. The knowledge of our evolved sexual strategies gives us significant capability to improve interactions between the sexes by choosing appropriate actions and deactivating others – ultimately reducing conflict between men and women. In this respect, we argue that when properly and ethically understood, the dating and seduction industry, despite its provocative label and origins outside of academia, is founded on solid empirical research as well as first-hand courtship and relationship experience.

**The Three Phases of Human Courtship: Attraction, Comfort and Trust, and Seduction**

The paper then goes on to discuss these three parts of sexual strategy. For attraction, the paper discusses whether direct and indirect ""openers"" have any support in empirical research.

&gt;A typical example of [a direct type] of opener might be: *Hi, I saw you standing there, thought you looked attractive, and wanted to say hello*[...]Research has shown that expressions of social dominance (Sadalla et al.1987), social risk-taking (Wilke, Hutchinson, Todd, and Kruger, 2006), and courageousness (Farthing, 2005; Kelly and Dunbar, 2001) are often attractive to women (as such an approach would clearly seem to demonstrate).

&gt;Indirect openers often include apparently random queries such as, *Excuse me- a friend and I were debating something. Could I have a female opinion on how a man should treat a lady on a first date?*[...]once a conversation is underway, enthusiasts of indirect openers will often casually move into more intentional conversational material specifically designed to display attractive cues [DHVs] to a prospective romantic interest[...]indeed, psychological research has shown that many of these qualities, when well-presented, can often be quite attractive...

This section is very long, but it goes on to list numerous research that supports that women ""rate charming social skills, wittiness, and a good sense of humor as among the most desirable"". Research has also shown that humor is VERY important and universally appealing. In fact:

&gt;Humor has been further argued to be an honest signal of other cognitive abilities, such as intelligence (Howrigan and MacDonald, 2008) and therefore an indicator of higher mate value (Greengross and Miller, 2008; Kaufman, Kozbelt, Bromley, and Miller, 2007)[...]Bale, Morrison, and Caryl (2006) has further shown that “pick up” lines that demonstrate qualities such as helpfulness, generosity, cosmopolitanism and wealth are significantly more attractive than straightforward propositions for sexual activity.

The paper next discusses ""pre-selection"" (social proof, pre-approval by other females) and how established this is in psychological &amp; evolutionary biology research. [See bottom of page 4].

&gt;The phenomenon where females will copy or imitate the preferences of other females for a particular male mate has been documented in a wide variety of species, and is commonly referred to by evolutionary biologists as mate choice copying (Bennett, Lim and Gilbert, 2008; Dugatkin, 1992; Freed-Brown and White, 2009).[...]Place et al. (2010) found an increase in male attractiveness among women who observed mutually interested romantic couples, while Jones, DeBruine, Little, Burriss, and Feinberg (2007) found a similar effect if other women were observed smiling at male faces; a reverse effect was found for unsmiling faces (Jones et al. 2007) or uninterested romantic couples (Place et al., 2007).

For Comfort &amp; Trust:

Lots of research listed in the text...

&gt;Indeed, psychological research has shown that many particular moral virtues are not only sexually attractive, but also relationship-stabilizing (see Miller 2007, for a review)[...]From a study of courtship behavior in singles’ bars, Moore (1985) found that incidental touching, prolonged eye contact, swaying the upper body towards a prospective romantic interest while talking, and a number of other tactical devices designed to attract attention were frequently implemented.

For Seduction:

This part isn't as interesting but it basically discusses how all humans inherently seek closeness, intimacy, connection, etc...and then states that the PUA philosophy recognizes this and tailors itself to satisfy this need in females.

TL;DR This is a very recent and current study that seriously takes a look at seduction strategy and whether or not it is anecdotal or backed up by real research/empirical data. Blue pillers can say NAWALT as much as they want, but research bears out what we already know. It's nice to see a Review that organizes lots of this research into one source.

Problem is, I just don't know much about it. I am beginning my process of acquiring a massive amount of knowledge on the subject by posting here. I will eventually follow up with a megathread once I am well versed on the subject of testosterone.

The purpose of this thread is to start a discussion on a subject that I deem extremely important to everyone within this community.

Disclaimer: *By no means is anything in this post fact. Below I have compiled tidbits that I have picked up from various unscientific blogs &amp; posts (however often citing scientific articles themselves) that I have compiled in order to facilitate discussion within this subject.*

**Lets start by discussing the basics**

* Testosterone is produced during sleep
* Testosterone levels of the present day are due to your behavior and consumption patterns of the previous day and prior
* Increased testosterone levels ellevates mood/energy levels and eliminates mental fog
* It has been considered that if you are not achieving morning wood you may have sub-optimal testosterone levels
* Consumption of specific items contain estrogen derivates and will have negative effects on your testosterone levels
* Cortisol levels negatively affect testosterone levels. Manage stress through any method that works for you. Consider meditation.

**Simple methods of increasing testosterone**

* 8-9+ hours of sleep a night to produce the next day's necessary testosterone levels
* Sex, often. Little to no masturbation.
* Diet: Increased fats &amp; cholesterol intake has been shown to raise testosterone levels
* Avoid pesticides as they contain estrogen derivates. Eat organic. Wash fruits/vegetables thoroughly.
* Fitness: Lift. Consider short &amp;amp; heavy sets. Sprints. Intensity.
* Supplements; **Core**: Vitamin D3, Fish Oil, Whey Protein. **Consider**: ZMA (Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin B6), Vitamin C, Creatine. **Debatable**: Testosterone supplement/steroid use are largely up for debate. Consider making a large lifestyle change prior to evaluating alternative help or shortcuts.
* Limit alcohol intake. Specifically, the hops in beer.

**Lets squash some misconceptions and answer some questions**

* What exactly is testosterone?
* Why is testosterone so important for us?
* Is melatonin use a testosterone inhibitor?
* Does extensive caffeine use affect testosterone levels?
* Zinc? Creatine? Other natural supplements? Do these help?
* Does refraining from masturbation and/or porn use have initial positive effects but result in a flatlining testosterone level going forward?
* Does enhanced testosterone alleviate erectile disfunction?
* Are unnatural supplements/[steroid use for increasing testosterone levels that bad](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ftlrc/testosterone_is_the_red_pill_how_steroids_changed/)? Have you used them?
* What exactly can a doctor do for you that you are unable to simply do on your own?
* What exactly is a solid level of testosterone to achieve? How is it measured?
* [How does one get tested? Should you](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1eqeec/day_1_a_practical_mans_journal_of_the_effects_of/)? How accurate are the tests? Have you been tested?

While they were completely unsuccessful, the rhetoric managed to work its way into the minds of my teachers and my parents, who did everything in their power to protect me. Very few things compare to the high of successfully navigating around web filters with a proxy and downloading tens of floppy disks worth of porn for later viewing.

**Violent Video Games:** The same people that attacked porn also attacked video games. Yes I agree video games are a huge time suck. However im glad I wasted my formative years liberating occupied Europe from Nazis rather than watching women castrate men on television. Some  games helped me develop critical thinking and planing skills specifically Starcraft and Sim City. Its funny how many people cant make and execute a plan, due to our broken education system.

**Combat Sports:** I wrestled and boxed in high school. Fighting in controlled environment, gave me the will power to pursue difficult tasks, taught me not to back down and that if I perused a stronger opponent with enough ferocity I could win. Feminists hate all fighting sports as they constitute toxic masculinity. Feminists prefer rape defense classes where they pump improperly made [fists](http://cache.lifehacker.com/assets/images/17/2011/11/cfb4904a82b14086e27bd1d945d88076.jpg) in the air and blow whistles.

**Firearms:** Show me a feminist and ill show you a person who cant comprehend the second amendment. Because women know  that they are not accountable for their actions, they want the government to keep guns away from them so they wont do anything stupid. Target shooting is a skill with a steep learning curve. Shooting taught me patience and the responsibility necessary to handle a dangerous tool.

**Testosterone Replacement Therapy:** Feminists hate testosterone because they think it causes people to be violent, a belief that has been scientifically dis-proven. In my experience testosterone aids in wakefulness, appetite, confidence and muscular recovery. It makes sense that feminists would demonize the one thing that can improve your well-being so much.

The rapid growth of our corner of the Internet has brought in many people who are eager to debate the meaning of ""alpha"". 

Ex:

* That's not what a *True Alpha* does!
* I don't listen to my mom, I'm so alpha!
* I think Alpha is [blah]!
* Your idea is Alpha is dependent on women, and therefore not Alpha!
* That might be attractive, but sex with women doesn't mean Alpha!
* Lol, u like pasta, that's beta as fuk.

To all of you with your own special idea of what alpha means to you:

STFU and read the sidebar.

It says right there under ""Welcome to The Red Pill"":

&gt; The Red Pill: Discussion of **sexual strategy** in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.

Next, under [Glossary of Terms and Acronyms](http://c.feministvictims.com/g):

&gt; Alpha – Leader. Somebody who displays high value, or **traits that are valued by women.** Alpha can refer to a man who exhibits alpha behaviors (more alpha tendancies than beta), but usually used to describe individual behaviors themselves. 

&gt; Beta – Follower. Sombody who validates others, men &amp; women alike. **Beta traits display low value to women**. Beta can also be used to describe individual behaviors.

In otherwords:

* Alpha = makes vaginas tingle*
* Beta = does not make vaginas tingle

\* I do not say ""Makes women want to fuck you"" because these days, women may want to fuck you for reasons that have nothing to do with your sexual worth and everything to do with the current legal/cultural climate or just plain old manipulation.

How are we going to have a productive discussion on **sexual strategy** if everyone keeps bringing in their own pretty definitions of what alpha and beta are? It only serves to confuse and distract. You wouldn't go into an discussion of military tactics while saying, ""Well you know, 'victory', to me, means keeping my morals and abstaining from war all together!""

Criminals and generals alike can be alpha.

My girlfriend was complaining to me about how controlling Skater boy was and how he insisted on reading her texts. She then nervously asked if I would ever do that. I said no I would never **ask** to read your messages. She was happy and the conversation ended with her telling me how she was so happy that our relationship is built on trust.

You see I would never ask to see those messages because given enough notice she would just delete whatever is incriminating. Anyway, a woman's friends are a reflection of herself; that's when I took the hint and began reading her shit.

I think of attention as a form of currency - something to be distributed for gain or when merited. Betas devalue their own currency by constantly printing more whenever the demand arises. Alpha currency, on the other hand, is finite and often unavailable. 

When a female demands attention from the beta, the beta produces it in the quantity demanded without expecting anything in return for it. The alpha however, requres something in exchange for the currency, thus giving the currency *value*. This is why a woman will pursue validation from an alpha because their attention has value and isnt mass produced.

When a woman seeks attention and goes to a beta she may gain temporary satisfaction, but the value of the attention is low because she didnt have to earn it. This is why some women will have a harem of betas - she needs a constant stream of attention from multiple sources. When a woman finds an alpha, she begins trying to earn the attention because she is aware that it has value and when the attention is given, it is much more satisfying than when a beta provides the same amount of attention.

A ""not bad"" and a thumbs-up from an alpha has far greater value than all the flowers and gifts from a beta could ever have. This is why when a woman finds an alpha, she stops seeking validation from her beta orbiters.

**BRIFFAULT’S LAW:**

The female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family. Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place.

There are a few corollaries I would add:

* Past benefit provided by the male does not provide for continued or future association.

* Any agreement where the male provides a current benefit in return for a promise of future association is null and void as soon as the male has provided the benefit (see corollary 1)

* A promise of future benefit has limited influence on current/future association, with the influence inversely proportionate to the length of time until the benefit will be given and directly proportionate to the degree to which the female trusts the male (which is not bloody likely).

http://www.city-data.com/forum/relationships/1923926-do-i-tell-him-do-i.html 

Essentially, this woman lied to her fiance about her sexual history because ""that's what he wanted to hear.""  She had a FWB relationship with her fiance's friend Sam and many other men.  She told her fiance she did not have sex outside of relationships, and made her fiance wait to have sex with her.  Sam told her fiance about his sexcapades with the OP (which included things she won't do with her fiance).  Her fiance reacts to this news by telling her he was thinking of making Sam his best man - to give her the opportunity to fess up.  She does not.  Her fiance then confronts her about her compound lies a few days later.

Some of the responses are fantastic too - blaming the fiance for ""trapping her"" and lying to her about what he knew, shaming him for being immature for caring about her sexual history, etc. 

It's just really disconcerting to realize the level of manipulation  and awareness this woman had in terms of telling her fiance what she figured he wanted to hear about her sexual history.

In it, he has 3 lists of dating parameters:

&gt;These are my Hard (Objective) Dating Parameters which are NOT Flexible:
&gt;(this means I am only willing to pay for introductions if ALL these criteria are met)
&gt;(if you want to set me up w someone missing 1 of these criteria, I may accept, but will not pay for that)

&gt;* Age 27-35 (ideally 28-34)
&gt;* No kids, wants kids in the next 1-2 years
&gt;* College graduate, doesn’t have to be a great school, but needs to have finished the degree
&gt;* Skinny (i.e. dress size 0-2, if you don’t know what that means (many men don’t) it means very skinny)
&gt;* Caucasian (not black, not Hispanic, not Asian)
&gt;* Healthy lifestyle (defined as no smoking, no drugs, good diet, no hard drinking,

&gt;These are things that I would ideally prefer, but don’t require (i.e. I am flexible about these criteria)

&gt;* Christian (any denomination is fine, I’m Catholic but not very religious, prefer any religion over none, must be religiously tolerant, will not be compatible with someone who thinks everyone else is damned)
&gt;* Graduate degree or very good undergraduate school (more compatible since I went to 3 Ivy League schools i.e. Dartmouth, Columbia &amp; Harvard, as well as Emory and my MBA from NYU)
&gt;* Spent significant time in another country other than the US (either born somewhere else or lived out of the US for a total of a 6 months or more, not on a vacation, doing something like school or work)
&gt;* Spent significant time (&gt;1 yr) living in a city of 1 million or more (so can live in NYC if moves here)
&gt;* Likes animals and pets, particularly dogs (because I plan to have a dog for the rest of my life)

&gt;These are the Soft (Objective) Criteria I require, but are difficult to match (because they’re qualitative)

&gt;* Attractive (like an 8 out of the 1-10 scale, 9-10 is actually bad as it comes with a lot of downside)
&gt;* Nice, normal, sweet, kind, altruistic, selfless, not entitled, bitchy, materialistic, selfish, self-centered
&gt;* Stylish, fashionable, polished, confident but not vain, superficial, overly concerned about looks
&gt;* Hard-working, real career, full-time job (unless in graduate school), achievement-oriented
&gt;* Highly functional Type B (not a Type A because too similar, not a Type B who can’t get stuff done)
&gt;* Easy-going, sense of humor, doesn’t take life or things too seriously, gets along well with everyone
&gt;* Good person, follows the Golden Rule, nice and kind to others, never does bad things because of values
&gt;* Good family, good role models, ideally good nuclear family so can emulate good patterns of behavior

While I wouldn't get specific enough to have dress sizes, I think the criteria are solid gold. He specifically rules out 9's and 10's because they're too much trouble. CLASSIC. And if this guy's as important as he claims, he's in a position to make demands. Despite that, there's a whole lotta hamstering going on. The title of the article describes him as ""delusional,"" and the requirements as ""outrageous."" It gets even better in the comments, calling the guy pathetic, a loser, not a real man, etc and making fun of him being Asian. Hamster of the year award goes to ""Not Asian, but a size 0-2? Not possible."" To be fair, there are several commenters - mostly men, of course - who point out that laundry lists are standard operating procedure for women in online dating and that everyone's got their standards/preferences.

How I got AMOGed...,93,19,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hdkiz/happy_38th_how_i_got_amoged/,"Visited a regular cocktail bar (I think I spent too much time in bars!) and had an interesting evening being AMOGed that I thought I would share.  Yes, it's another ""how I failed"" FR, but let's be honest, they are the most interesting.

I grab my usual cocktail, and head out to the smoking area.  There is a red jacket on seat near a few women, so pick up the jacket, and turn to the girl on my left (blonde, 7 face, 9 body, Pam) and ask if it is her.  She seems... a little drunk.  She shakes her head and says no.  I turn to the girl on my right (black hair, 8), ask her and she responds no.  I put the jacket to the side and ask the girl on my right if she has a light.  She hands me a cheap bic lighter in a Stoli case, and I tease her about where she got it from, and accuse her of stealing it while putting it into my pocket.

We chat for a little while, turns out she is a Brazilian tourist visiting Scotland and friends for a few weeks.  During our chat she realizes I have stolen her lighter, which I deny.  We mock fight over it, and I eventually let her go into my jeans pocket to get it, telling not to cop a feel, which she does anyway.  She heads in, saying she was hanging out with 2 friends, and I should join them.  I tell her I might later.

During my conversation with the Brazilian, a tall, older blonde has sat on my left joining the other blonde.  When she has sat, I asked if the red jacket belonged to her.  She said it was, and I reply:

""That's a shame, I was going to steal it and sell it on eBay for a fiver""

She laughs and informs me it's worth more than a fiver, and shows me the label.  I tell her the only thing I know about women clothes is how to take them off, she slaps my thigh and calls me cheeky.

When the Brazilian leaves, and reopen the two blondes, who have been joined by three other women, two blondes and brunette.  I can tell that the brunette is a lesbian from her hair style, clothes and posture, and dating one of the blondes.

I find out the two original blondes are out celebrating Pam's birthday.  When I ask how old she is, she replies that I should guess.  Usually when they reply with that I ask to see their hands, but this time I just reply 45.

Everyone is clearly shocked, and Pam stands, turns her back to me and leans against a table that is in the center of the smoking area.  One of the blondes from the other group comforts her, while the three other women give me into trouble for guess so bad.  I tell them I am terrible at guessing peoples age.  They tell me I should apologize and I agree that I probably should, and change the subject.

I find out the lesbian is from a city I stayed in for 7 years, so I move to sit next to them, which puts me next to where Pam was sitting and I chat to her and her lover. I find out that my read of her was correct, she is gay, and the blonde is her lover, and that they are out having a drink because she starts her chemo the following Monday.  She is pretty good natured about it, and we tell terrible cancer jokes.

During this, I keep catching Pam looking round and staring at me.  When I do, I stick my tongue out at her, she does the same and also gives me the middle finger.

I'm bantering with the lesbian about where I am from (Mars) what I do for living (wash ducks).

""I bet your single""

""It's complicated""

""Ha, I bet you are, but through choice""

""I meet this crazy 18 year old here the other night, told me a great line 'Single but never alone'""

""scottishredpill, you didn't take an 18 year old home did you?""

""Don't be nosy""

At this point Pam interrupts

""I'm 38 today""

""That's nice, happy birthday""

I turn to the lesbian and try to continue chatting.

""Why did you say 45?""

""Because that's the age I thought you were""

Her pal ""scottishredpill, stop being mean!""

""I'm not being mean, I'm being honest""

Pam ""Buy me a drink""

""No""

""But it's my birthday!""

""I know, and you can cry if you want to, but I'm still not buying you a drink""

""You're an asshole""

""We just meet, and it feels like you know me so well, we should date""

She gives me the finger and starts staggering around the table, and I start talking to her pal.  Next thing I know, she is on our side of the table again, and she is falling into me.  I put my hands up to catch her, and she falls onto my lap and badly kisses me.  When we stop kissing:

""Well that's the least smoothest way someone has kissed me, if you wanted a birthday kiss, you just had to ask""

""Shut up, what would you have said?""

""No""

""You're an asshole""

""So you have said""

""Buy me a drink""

""No""

""Fuck you""

""Ha, you wish you could, don't pout, it makes you look fat""

I push her off my lap, and she takes the seat next to me and proceeds to snuggle.  I give her the occasional kiss while talking shit with the lesbians.  At one point Pam looks me in the eye and thanks me for the birthday kisses.

I managed to make a deal with her and her pal about drinks, they would buy me one each, and then I would get them one (My mother told me to never buy a girl a drink until she bought me one).  I managed to get two, expensive bourbon cocktails out of them.

After about an hour, two built guys come out to the smoking area, and start AMOGing me.

When introducing themselves to me, I reach to shake one of their hands, and he moves it, saying ""Too slow"" I laugh and reply ""Nice, I haven't had that done to me since I was 12"".

He then proceeds to say ""I like your style"" I thank him, and he offers to shake my hand, and of course he moves it again.  I look him in the eye and say ""Look man, first time was funny, now you're just being a fucking childish asshole""  He looks shocked, and apologizes and shakes my hand properly.

They start running some game, bigging each other up, dropping snide remarks my way. ""I don't trust that guy"", ""He isn't your boyfriend, your boyfriend is a fire fighter?  Who is he then?  Oh, a birthday snog, him?!  He said you looked 45!  What an asshole, you look 25!  You go to the gym, wow, you have a great body""  They end up buying them 2 cocktails and a bottle of champagne, Pam insists I get a glass and enjoy two drinks on them.

We have now been chatting with the two AMOGs for about an hour.  Her pal has taken a liking to one of them, so I can tell time is limited, so I quietly #-close Pam (too old, but you know, gotta keep the stats up), and head into the bar.

I head into the bar, find the Brazilian and her friends and chat to them for 20 mins. This goes fairly well, and I arrange to hit a night club with them.  I then head back out have a smoke.

Pam is sitting with one of them, clearly getting birthday kisses from him now.  The lesbian spots me coming in and says:

""Pam broke out her smooth move and fell onto him""

""She really needs to work on that, she is getting old, might break a hip""

The AMOG chatting to her pal calls me a few names.  And I sit between him and the lesbians.

I chat to them all for awhile, while Pam snogs one of the AMOGs.  I make sure to shake the hand of the one next to me and tell him ""Well played, you did your mate proud"", he looked a little confused and replied ""Yea, well, I'm taking him under my wing""

20 minutes pass, and Pam and her pal get up and leave.  I give them both a bug good bye, they both inform me once again I am an asshole and leave.

Once they have left the smoking area, the AMOG that played the hand shaking game turns to me:

""Ha, we stole your girl.  You with your fancy jacket and smooth chat, no fucking for you.  That's how you do it, teaching my mate how to pull the ladies like a man""

""That is true, chief, but let's be honest, she was fucking wrecked, there was no chance her mate was going to let her leave with anyone; she isn't from here.  Your mate and I gave her some birthday kisses.  But, lets look at it this way; I got them to buy me two cocktails and refused to get them any.  You got them 4 cocktails, that's about £30-40, and the champagne, the cheapest bottle in here is £50.  Hell man, I had two glasses of champagne you paid for.""

1372636150.0,75,self.TheRedPill,1he5ww,How women Stifle/Censor Intellectual discourse,130,55,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1he5ww/how_women_stiflecensor_intellectual_discourse/,"A couple years back I  visited Russia. I was at a dinner party and the conversation soon turned to politics a Russian national pastime. As soon as it did all of the women shut up and let the men speak. When one of the American women tried to offer her opinion she was shamed into silence by the men and some of the women. I asked later why women were culturaly disallowed from speaking with men on politics at the dinner table. The response I got was 'In Russia women don't speak while men are discussing politics."" 

Back then I thought this was backward and misogynistic. But ten years of talking with women later iv come around and thing this is a wonderful cultural norm.

With regard to abstract, deep or philosophical discussion women vary rarely have anything to offer. Women are emotional creatures so the result of her participation will always be a decline in the intellectuality of discourse. Here is how and why they will ruin your conversation:

* Women are not abstract thinkers. You know the logic question where you have to rotate the letter L in a three dimensional space? Women suck at that shit. So when an argument is very abstract a women will **always** make the conversation about her. Once the conversation is about her favorite subject she will speech vomit about herself drowning out anything interesting you or your friends have to say.

* Women are emotional thinkers. Given enough time in a conversation a women will always use an emotional appeal, an Ad Hominem attack, shaming guilting or any list of logical fallacies. Have you ever watched The View or The Talk? How long can these bitches go logically addressing the issue before the feels take over? Answer: not very long.

* Women are protected by betas and white knights. Women have no problem throwing insults at you when the argument gets a little complex or doesn't have enough feels to understand. But iif you throw some shit back at her. The white knight will start valienly defending and all intellectualism will be torpedoed. What you will be left with is retarded baboon yelling which is not that enjoyable.

* It is very difficult for a women to understand the distinction between a heated political discussion and personal argument. Now my friends and I can argue all day about any host of issues and we often disagree. But in the end we will be friends and we'll  grill some steaks together. For a women this distinction is impossible to make. If two of her friends are having heated discourse she will break up the argument. Its kind of what little dogs do when people have loud discussions they start barking because the feel excitement in the air. Shell say cant we all just get along? Or politics is dreadful businesses we should talk about something else. Tadaa!, your heated intellectually stimulation conversation was just ruined by a woman.

Bonus: One of the reasons why America has become for less intellectual in the past 60 years is because women began being included in all sorts of things. Thus destroying all available space for intellectual discourse.

**TLDR** Intellectual discourse lacks the feels that women understand, so they torpedo it at every given opportunity. ",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,1372636331.0,theory,endorsement,True,t3_1he5ww,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1he5ww/how_women_stiflecensor_intellectual_discourse/,

The only thing anyone in the world is entitled to is losing and death.  

Time and again, I will go out and push my boundaries and approach approach approach, but somewhere in the back of my head, the excuse factor creeps out.  I learned that when I sit around and entertain this excuse factor, I start to get angry and wonder why things aren't easier.  This makes for a pitiful night and ends up with me jerking off to porn.  I sat around and allowed the default conclusion to take place.  Losing.

In my progression, I noticed that when I don't listen to this excuse factor and force myself to swim upriver and approach, I get un-stifled and literally stop giving a fuck.  I start winning.  Many times, I will get blown out in front of several people and they will laugh at me for my failed attempt, but since I have pushed past the excuse factor by constantly approaching and thoroughly enjoying myself, I am able to withstand their attempt to degrade my social status.  Many times, I will literally stay my ground, make direct eye contact with the girl, make a big smile, and NOT MOVE. This works wonders.  Instead of giving them the satisfaction of a short lived victory, I stood my ground and didn't move.  The worst thing for anyone trying to degrade someones progress is the realization that your opponent is never going to stop no matter how hard you stomp on their skull.  I felt like an oil fire.  No matter how much water you pour on it, the fire keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Its demoralizing for the people laughing at me.  I have effectively crushed their attempt to degrade me by showing no negative reaction.  Most of the time, this show of force turns them around and makes them intrigued in me.  The set continues.  I chose not to be a victim.  

Everything women do in the western world is in one way or another tied in with victim mentality and resource extraction.  They will ALWAYS be a victim.  School teacher fucks an 8 year old boy and gets pregnant? SHE WAS COERCED.  You find out your not the father?  SHE WAS RAPED/COERCED/CONDOM BROKE/DENIAL/DENIAL.  

Shit like this is no longer a shock to me.  It actually bothers me when people post articles on this sub about crazy shit some woman did.  ""GIRL DOES SOME GIRLY SHIT AND RUINS A MANS LIFE.""  Seriously, whats new?  Women are immature and should never be taken for as a stable force of nature.  They're mind revolves around avoiding responsibility when things go bad and embracing the praises when things go their way.  Through gaming, my definition of women changed from being 'someone with a vagina' to 'resource wasting, shit throwing, insecure creature that will take as much as you let them, and will only fuck people that don't put up with their shit.'  Yes, some are cool, nice, and feminine, but at the end of the day they are GIRLS. They want your resources and your value and will go as low as they need to extract what they can from you.  

Embrace your faults and stop living the victims life.  That's literally what a woman does her whole life.

I kind of don't know where I was going with this, but I felt like I needed to tell a little bit of my story out before heading to bed.  I don't apologize for my rant.

Are we on to something new?,90,22,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1guduw/in_yesterdays_posts_the_whole_thing_just_clicked/,"Up to yesterday, having read the usual blogs etc. for some months, I though TRP is based on three key concepts, men and women having different definitions for SMV, signalled and perceived SMVs as a marketplace, and the hypergamous tendency towards soft harems and bitter lonely betas. But yesterday I understood something else:

Women are gatekeepers of sex, men are gatekeepers of emotional commitment. Women sell sex for emotions, men sell emotions for sex. Women who sell sex for cheap emotions are sluts, men who sell emotions for cheap or no sex are betas / niceguys / whiteknights. Women train and punish men by withholding sex, although usually not admit it and rationalize it away, i.e. ""not in the mood today"". Men train and punish women by withholding emotions, some do it consciously, most will similarly not admit it and rationalize it away ""tired today, not in the mood to talk, will be out in the garage"".

So for example hover beta friend behavior is not simply signalling low own SMV vs. signalling that you consider hers high, as before. It also means emotional sluthood: paying with emotions without having received sex.

The reason women shame sluts is that they reduce the price of sex: they do not ask emotional commitment for it. Thus it is much harder for normal women to ask it.

Similarly betas make ""I love you"" and ""you are so wonderful"" cheap. She doesn't even fuck them and yet they say things a normal man would only say after the tenth time of having sex in an LTR. Or wedding night or whatever. They make romantic emotions cheap. They make women think they don't have to earn romantic commitment. With sex of course. 

This means it is not good for you if 90% of men are beta. They are selling romantic commitment and emotions all too cheap. This makes it harder for you to demand lots of good sex for it. It's the same problem as decent women have with sluts, they want to sell sex expensive and the lower bidders take all the deals.

This also means, especially in an LTR/Marriage that it is entirely possible to be ""too alpha""! We have never addressed this. Usually it is the opposite problem: beta men pay with emotions too lavishly, that makes women think they are low value, and move on. But if alpha men don't pay emotions for a long time, that too could make women think they are simply not getting a fair deal and move on.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,1371881468.0,theory,,True,t3_1guduw,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1guduw/in_yesterdays_posts_the_whole_thing_just_clicked/,

Basically a guy marries a girl who already has 2 kids, doesn't work but goes to school yet she has him do her school work.

- Her kids are from 2 different daddies (no child support).
- He admits that she had a slutty past.
- He is a computer programmer.
- He had known her for 5 years before actually being successful with her (post kids).
- He displays a sense of blue pill pride in raising someone else's kids.

He answers the teacher's question by differentiating between women and bitches.  ""A man can see that's a woman and that's a bitch and he can make his choice. There's more bitches than there is women.  If I don't say nothing, I cant protect them. I can't help them.""

* They're walking around naked, while all the guys are clothed. The way they're filmed, lighted and staged, is done so with the﻿ sole purpose of objectifying them, so that men will think they're hot. If that's your aspiration as a woman (I'm not saying it is for you!), you're very shallow and probably has daddy issues.  And I'm a guy, btw.


* What has this world come to? Exploiting women for a music video? NO this is wrong﻿ wrong wrong

* Wow. This is so stupid. As a feminist, this makes all women look﻿ like mindless sluts. If I'm going to have to see boobs and vagina, I think it's only fair that I see dick. The men should be naked too. Equality.

For all the ridiculous comments that ask why there is no dick in the video....It's because women aren't turned on by nudity, you fucking smurfs.  They'd rather see men in suits.

The moderators here started this project as an experiment for feminists, we wanted to see just how far-gone men really are in today's culture. Boy were we not prepared to see just how much all men are misogynists! No wonder women don't like you!

Honest confession time: I am not a red pill man. I'm not even a man at all. I'm a 42 year old woman and a staunch feminist. You've all been tricked.

It's crazy that you guys actually believe there's a shortcut, some sort of magic spell you can put on women to get them to like you. Have you tried just being yourself? You guys are all so clueless.

Try a compliment now and again. Hold the door for women. Be a good guy. And for christ's sake, stop thinking that being nice entitles you to sex!

Anyway, you've all been duped. I hope you've learned something from this experience. Looks like one woman was smarter than all of you. Might have to rethink your entire lives now.

Hi, I'm red pill school, and I have never raped anybody. Not even spousal rape-- despite the myth which continues to persist that because we disagree with the term, we're actually out there raping our wives.

I've been labeled a rapist by feminists and a large majority of reddit who have heard of me, but haven't taken the time to read much of what I've written, or read what was pasted out of context.

Now, I'm not saying anybody needs to take sides. But let's face it: how much honor does somebody have to mislabel me a rapist when there are real rape victims that *really* exist.

This guy is classic blue piller. 

&gt;I'm not gonna give you my life story with her, but lets just say the relationship isn't exactly fair.

That's a bad start...

&gt;She likes me to stop talking to a lot of girls, not keep in contact with my ex, etc, which I'm fine with, but she doesn't want to do the same. She wants to do what she wants to do, and if im going to stop her, shes going to resent me for it. As far as that goes, **I honestly don't mind too much, but it's definitely created some problems.**

Emphasis mine. Yeah, no shit. Allowing her to control you without even the idea of her reciprocating isn't a warning sign? It doesn't BOTHER YOU? How desperate are you for that pussy, man?

&gt;Anyways, getting into the main point, about 2 weeks ago, her ex boyfriend who was at the time in jail called her, saying he needed a place to stay for a night and that he had no where to go until he went to rehab for his drug use.

Incoming alpha, incoming alpha! 

&gt;She had been with this guy for 2 years, had been really in love with him, thought she was going to marry him, and he broke her heart because he kept doing drugs and screwing up their lives and eventually stole from her just to continue to do drugs. They went on and off for a year or so, he went to jail, and then I came into her life. 

Good lord, she's an alpha widow. 

&gt;Our relationship has had it's ups and downs, but when we are together and not fighting or angry, we are very happy, and it's a great relationship.

In other words, when he lets her win the fight she rewards him with non-bitchiness and treat-sex, I imagine.

&gt;I treat her extremely well, she says to people I treat her like a queen, and that I must be truly in love with her, which I am. 

Beta bluepiller flag...

&gt;She's an extremely great person when she's not upset, or at least I thought so until about 3 days ago.

Keep her happy, provider, and she'll keep the mask on...

&gt;So it hit the night that her ex (let's just call him N) got out of jail. She picked him up, brought him to her house, they talked for a while, and in the morning, dropped him off somewhere because he was supposed to have a place to stay. But he didn't, and N came back to her house to stay the night again. It's now Saturday, and he'll be staying the night tonight as well as tomorrow night too.

Dat alpha cock...

&gt;Thing is, if she really showed me she cared about me and wanted to be with me, then I wouldn't really have a problem with N staying over for that long. **But when N came over, she cleaned up her room, cleaned up her bathroom, and worst of all, hid pictures of us from N, because she ""didn't want to hurt him, and she would want him to do the same"".**

Wow. Not only does she disrespect the relationship by hiding fucking PICTURES of him, she shows her complete lack of respect for him by telling him about it with some bullshit excuse! I guess getting banged doggie style just the way you like it would suck if you are staring at your beta b/f's face on the night table. 
 
&gt;On Thursday, she told me she thinks it'd be a good idea to give her a day or two to think about things, essentially taking a break.

(Translation: Ride the alpha cock a little bit longer guilt-free this time)

I really feel for this guy. I do. I was there (maybe not to this extreme, thankfully, but I put up with some stupid hypocritical shit in my time for what I learned later was mediocre sex). 

It really goes to show that the bluepiller thoughts of ""treating your girl like a Queen"" and letting her get away with double-standards shit does NOT get you respect in return. But what are we taught all our lives? This very thing. 

I guess he had it coming. We can all sit back and think about what we would do in that situation. The truth is if you keep your frame, it would never even come to this.

Since discovering TRP I have had countless experiences that would serve as good examples here, so I’m going to start with one and if you guys like it I may post more.  This is an insanely long report as it is about 2 nights. Also, you asked for field reports so don’t complain. English is not my first language, please forgive any fuckups.

The following story contains several examples of sexual strategy, but I’m not going to analyse them as it is already a long post. If you would like me to explain, I will gladly do so in the comments.

Short background: I am 34, tall, decent looking and well built (started lifting about 8 months ago). I have good social skills and a good career. I just never used to get the girls I wanted due to giving too many fucks, putting them on pedestals and taking their irrational shit seriously. I had 2 (very) long term relationships previously, got fucked over on both of them. My fault. More details on request.

So here is the story of my cousins wedding weekend in the UK (I live in a different European country).

Thursday night: Dinner with the whole family after which I decide to have a pint on my lonesome in a pub before heading back to the hotel. It’s nearly closing time, place is empty, I walk up to the bar and say ‘Hello?’ 

Cute barmaid peeks her head out from behind the drinks shelf thingy in the middle of the bar. I ask her jokingly if she is trying to hide from me and she says she is closing in 5, but what could she get me. I order a pint and ask if I can take it outside to have a ciggie. She says yes and I tell her to join me. She’s a posh girl, 21, not been in the city that long. We chat for a bit I’m joking around eventually I say ‘Jenny, you are my one and only friend in this city, Come with me to the centre, I want to see if this bar is still there that I went to last time’. She says she is going to the centre anyways, some mates are coming to pick her up in a minute, I should come along.

Her friends show up and I chill with them while she goes to get changed. Most of them work in the same pub. I get on with them immediately, one young lad, let’s call him Carlos takes a special interest in me and I can tell that he is head over heels for Jenny, won’t shut up about her. He’s not sure what I’m doing there and is worried because I am the centre of attention at this point.

On the way to the club I am chatting with everyone, now and then a few words with jenny, I talk to her less than the others, but create a situation in which it seems like we go way back and have our own world, separately from the group, even though I’ve only known her 15 minutes longer. I tease her, steal a ciggie from her mouth, give her a piggy back ride at one point. I Alternate between focusing on her intensely and then not at all, talking to her friends.

In the queue to the club some gel-haired suit starts chatting up Jenny, doing quite a good job, eye contact, escalating quite early and whatnot. I start talking to the Italian girls in front of us (I can hold a conversation in Italian), I make funny mistakes on purpose and have them all in stitches. They find it endearing.

In the club, gel-hair starts fucking up, immediately buying a drink for Jenny, staying beside her at the bar, paying her full attention, while I’m dancing with her mates and the Italian girls. I’m talking to everyone, meeting everyone in the club, including bar staff. Carlos is my biggest fan and follows me like a puppy.  I can see Jenny constantly peeking over at me, bored with gel-hair talking at her. Now and then I grin or wink at her.

 Around 3am I figure I’m ready to leave. I go over to the bar, look at gel-hair and say ‘excuse me mate’, I pick up Jenny, and walk out of the club with her over my shoulder. Probably one of the coolest things I have ever done. We take a cab back to hers and bang until about 6am.

Friday: Wedding rehearsal in the afternoon. After the rehearsal, it is announced that the entire extended family is going to the pub. Guess which pub. As soon as I walk in, I am getting high fives from the bar staff who all saw me do my epic move the night before. They love me. My family keeps asking me where I know these people from. My dad actually says ‘That blonde barmaid is really pretty, you should go talk to her’. Lol. One step ahead of you dad… Most of my cousins are trying to flirt with her after a few drinks. She is gagging for my attention all night and giving me free drinks. One cousin asks me about it and I say we met last night. ‘really? Did you try to get with her?’ heh.

Bar gets packed as it’s Friday. There is a group of girls there, 2 of them ugly and obnoxious, one of them just obnoxious and one of them quite cute and more shy, kind of classy. I am at the bar next to the group. I turn to the one next to me (ugly one), catch her looking at me and do a sort of surprised looking away - looking back - looking at the ceiling - purposefully awkward thing with wide eyes, then crack up and give her a high five.

They ask me where I’m from, we chat bla bla. The cute one is at the far end. I wait until she says something and pretend I can’t hear her so I can go over to her. She is real cute, tall, massive eyes, nice dimples, 25, let’s call her Amanda. She’s the designated driver, so isn’t drinking. I talk to her, escalate a bit, she comes outside with me when I go smoke, even though she doesn’t. As soon as we get outside, I spin her around and kiss her she kisses me back. She’s shocked, I carry on the conversation as if nothing happened.

Back inside her friends are blatantly jealous and start making fun of me, trying to embarrass me, even make a song about me which they sing loudly in the bar. I just grin, applaud, bow and keep talking to Amanda. Jenny is giving me the evils at this point and even refuses to serve me. I get Amanda to buy me a drink. The girls want to go clubbing, but I really don’t want a hangover for the wedding. They manage to convince me, but I say that at exactly 2:30 I’m leaving.

They actually take me to a casino type place. It’s members only and the bouncer is refusing to let me in. They beg and plead with him. I tell the girls to calm down. I look at the bouncer, pull out a 20 and say ‘how about I pay the usual entrance fee’. He looks over at the other bouncer, who waives me through. He doesn’t take the 20 pounds. I have done this before, it’s just to show them that I am ready to spend money. Inside I Isolate Amanda in a couch area and we make out. She says it’s such a shame that I don’t live there and have to leave so early, ‘stay longer, we can go back to mine after’. She asks me when was the last time I got laid. ‘Yesterday’. ‘Oh. Wait, it was that barmaid from the bar wasn’t it?’ ‘Yup’ I can see her spirit sink. ‘Ohh nooooo’ she says and looks at me like I just farted in her handbag. ‘She was so hooooooot!’ Insecurities… I just grin and say nothing. She is now going crazy over me. She keeps trying to convince me to stay, but at precisely 2:30 I say my goodbyes and leave. 

She texted me for days after this and I know I can call her next time I’m in her city for a hookup.

Oh also, in the cab, 3 of the girls were purposefully putting on lipstick and kissing my neck and cheek to give me kiss shapes. I showed up to breakfast in the morning with the entire extended family sitting there. I hadn’t looked in the mirror. I had 3 different shades of lipstick all over my shirt collar and neck. Needless to say I now have a bit of a reputation with the family. My feminist Aunts hate me.

I seem to repeatedly hear this line when I call women on their bad behaviour. I find it funny because *who they are today* is an unrespectable woman who is no longer worthy of comittment in the tradtional sense. Furthermore, whether they did X, Y, Z or not, they would *still* be someone today, albeit they would be more respectable. I think it would make more sense for a woman to say ""I'm glad I didn't fuck more guys that are on the average football team in the last two years. Its what made me who I am today. A woman, not a flesh-pin-cushion""

Here are some choice quotes:

&gt;""The bottom line is this: Anything pickup artists say about women is not true for all women.”

&gt;“If you’re looking for any formula that will work on all women, you’re doing it wrong, because you’re treating women as vending machines that will dispense sex if you put in the right input.”

In other words, ""NAWALT! NAWALT! NAWALT!"".

&gt;Friedman suggests — wait for it — listening to her. ”Listen more than you talk! Want to let a woman know you’re into her? Pay attention to what she’s saying and doing,” she writes in an email. “Respond genuinely. This may mean you have to pay attention to the fact that she doesn’t want to talk with you, or you’re making her uncomfortable!

Where have I seen this before? Ah yes, the ""rape manual"":

""As a man, it is your job to lead every interaction with a woman. You want to find something you can both speak passionately about it and run with it. Find commonalities. Ask questions. Get her opinion on all sorts of things.""

&gt;Thorn says her chief complaint with the PUA community is that it often frames women as the enemy. “The way we frame our relationships helps us decide which tools to use: If you feel like your partners are enemies, then you are likely to use social tactics that hurt them,” 

**Above the Game Part 9**
""This abundance mindset is what allows you to give without presumption, without expectation of getting something in return. You enrich the lives of those around you and the world repays you for it. Think about the difference in mindset... You're taking a girl you met on an amazing date, not because you hope to sleep with her (even though you do), but because you're amazing to be around and you only get to spend your valuable time with a select group of people. You're enriching her life by being in it, staying positive, and taking her on adventures together.""

What a *monster*.

&gt;Much of the PUA canon focuses on feigning confidence — by taking up space and seeming unavailable. It’s true, confidence is wildly attractive — but instead of attempting to trick a woman into thinking that you’re a secure human being with a lot going for you, be one. 

In other words, ""Instead of trying to practice confidence, you should just BE confident."" 

Instead of practicing drumming, you should just BE good at drumming. Instead of practicing baseball, you should just BE a good player. Instead of practicing comedy, you should just BE funny. Makes perfect sense.

&gt;Too often it involves trying to deceive women about who you really are

Makeup, push up bras, high heels, and hair extensions would like a word with you.

I have known him for about 8.  During this time, I have never known him to have even kissed a girl.

As you can imagine, he hates going out with me because I am determined to get him laid.  I have had him out, sitting in the middle of a group of girls on numerous occasions, and he will refuses to engage with them beyond speaking when spoken to and gives me daggers when I try and include him in a group banter.  He also gives me an earful the next day for putting him into that position.  Over the past 2 years I have been feeding him some seduction things.  No routines, just the basics: say hi, make eye contact, be sure to touch, ask her out.  No interest, at all.  He knows what I am like, and insists it is manipulative... I explain the concept of teasing (he picks up on it straight away as ""negging"") and while he understands it is joking around, he still refuses to listen.  I also explained some RP to him, but, you know: NAWALT (""you just pick the easy girls, scottishredpill"").  I shared Rollo's Year One post with him, but ""it seems cultish and too much to read"".  **sigh**

So I suggest a hobby, and he takes up rock climbing.  He has gotten into it completely and this is awesome.  Still not asked any girl out.

He invites a mutual girl friend (Jill), and they start to go regularly together, and then start hanging out a little outside it.  I learn about this through another mutual girl friend that she likes him, and won't say no if he made a move.  The exact phrase was ""She tired of guys like her ex (lesser alpha) and wants a nice guy"" 

Awesome(ish, she settling for a beta provider, will probably break his heart, but he needs it!) :D

I subtle quiz him about her, and it turns out he feels the same.  A few drinks and he spills his guts and tells me he is crazy about her.

""Dude, make a move, just kiss her""

""No""

""She won't say no, she likes you too""

""No""

""Ok, then tell her""

""No, I value her friendship too much, I don't want to ruin that""

""Man, you won't. You'll kiss, she'll kiss you back.  It will be amazing, trust me""

""No""

""If you don't, she will cut you off""

""No she won't""

""Yes she will.  I promise you, if you don't make a move she will move on""

He refuses, so I hatch a plan.  I arrange for us to go out for dinner.  I'm not allowed to bring ""strange girls"" to social things with a number of my friends, so I bring along another male friend.  Dinner, bar, club or casino, what could go wrong.

We hit a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner, the all you can eat, staff bring massive chucks of meat to your table, etc.  They sit next to each other, and we start to eat.

Straight away he starts rolling out the beta game, cuts off meat for her, pours her water and wine, gives me into trouble every times I tease her (I know I probably shouldn't, but it's so ingrained I do it naturally).  Aaaand she starts doing it to me, ""scottishredpill, you have to try this"" sticking her fork in my face, checking I had plenty of wine.  So, not going according to plan.

Our waitress is a petite Brazilian girl, and seems to take a shine to me, and starts hanging around our table more than the rest (she gets told off by the hostess at one point) so I banter with her.  (Get a cocktail at one point, tell her it was great and she tells me ""It was made with love"" while making that stupid heart hand thing).  This seems to annoy Jill, and she starts flirting more, stealing food off my plate, trying to grab my hand, staring.  When the waitress leaves us at one point, she snaps ""Try not to fuck her in the toilet""  During all of this, my BP friend is telling Jill how atrocious my behavior.

We leave the restaurant (I got a pleasant surprise when the bill came and discovered the waitress has ""forgotten"" to add a few of my drinks, she had said she would get me a discount when I #-closed her), and head to a bar.  On the way, I suggest to my friend to be a gentlemen and offer her his arm.  We had shared 4 bottle of wine, she was wearing high heels and the we were walking up a fairly steep hill.  He of course said no, and said don't be an asshole and offer to do it.

We grab a table in the bar, I sit across from my friend, leaving the seat next to him free, and she sits next to me.  &gt;.&lt;  First topic of conversation, how one of our other friends told them I was a filthy bastard in bed.  Cue 30 mins of being quizzed about my sex life, during which I have to move her hand off my thigh, and my friend looks more and more uncomfortable.  I try to bail everytime I see some cute girls, but she either stops me (""They look like tarts"" ""Well, duh"") or follows me.

We head to the casino, on the way, Jill puts her arms in ours, walking between us.  I give my friend a ""I told you so look"" and he shrugs.

On arriving to the casino, I head to the toilet, and when I return, I see them playing blackjack together, so I decide to join a different table.  A few hours later my friend turns up at my table, sans Jill.  Turns out she left, and he didn't go with her, or even walked her out the place. **faceplam**

A month later I caught up with him:

""So, how's things with Jill?""

""Well, she was going to come round for dinner a week after we went out""

""Oh yea?""

""But she cancelled...""

""That sucks, wh-""

""But she turned up at my door at 2am, which was strange, she stayed for 20mins then left""

""I see, and have you spoken to her much?""

""No, she never responds to me anymore""

See i trust pros far more then i trust most women, not that i've used them yet but i've often been tempted. I find women don't like it because guys realize its far easier to get what they want from a hooker, so they don't have to put up with all her bullshit just so they can get sex.

Another similar thread: In this one they claim its okay to date a whore... because shes just doing her job, but its wrong to pay for it.

That being a weak man isn't only OK, but almost something to revel in. You aren't like those other jerks!! I really wish I could find a nice guy just like you!! (but not you, b/c you don't turn me on)...every time I turned to a woman for advice on why I wasn't getting dates or having any success at all as far as dating goes they basically told me to do more of the same...be nice, don't act like those jerks that are getting laid! 

Fuck at least guys are honest about what they want for the most part, THAT is what i would have liked to see from woman too b/c then maybe I wouldn't have wasted so much time. Some blunt honesty would have been nice at times when I was younger, so I could have gone down the right path earlier. Or at least hint at it b/c I know not everyone takes criticism well.

My father is classic blue pill and my mom is very smothering.  They don't know any better, and their support has helped alot with my issues in the past when I was dealing with more serious depression and legendary social awkwardness. But I still would have liked more masculine role models growing up. Someone to tell me to get off my fucking ass and be a man before my mid twenties.

I'm not claiming to be anywhere close to the most Alpha dude out there. I'm quite eccentric (I was diagnosed with Asperger's at one point though it was never made official), and I'm not super masculine (I have a very high voice). That said, I've chosen to embrace the way I am rather than fight it, and now I wouldn't change a thing.
Also, I've been chilling in this Sub for a while, but I'm still not entirely sure what flair to use. So let me know if I need to change it.

Anyhow, I used to be blue pill all the way. I was definitely a Beta orbiter for more than a few girls in high school. It didn't entirely prevent me from getting laid, but I had to deal with a lot of shit. That pretty much continued up into college until my latest relationship. She was a feminist who really exemplified all of the worst traits of that ideology. She constantly told me that she was the best thing that would ever happen to me, and always tried to belittle and emasculate me in public. She told me to my face that she was going to 'train me to do what she wanted.' And I took it for a while. We broke up a few times, but I always caved and came running back to her. Then last summer, she finally broke up with me. We promised to stay friends (bad idea) and for a while we did. It became a true 'Alpha pays, Beta plays' scenario where she was with a few guys while I still gave her rides and helped her with school and all sorts of shit. What was I thinking?

Then after she'd had her fun, she asked me to get back together, I almost said yes, but my mother of all people was the one who told me that I deserved more respect than I'd ever get from a girl like her. So I said no and my ex flipped a shit. I promptly responded by asking one of her friends on a date, which was successful. I told my ex that I was entirely done with her. A few months later she started hitting me up again and going to the same parties as me, and I would act condescending and aloof towards her. At the end of last semester, she asked me for help the night before a final. I countered with the suggestion that she should come over and have sex with me instead. **And she fucking did.** 

I didn't understand what the fuck had happened at first. But it's all here. I demonstrated I had other options. I stopped putting her on a pedestal. I found my confidence and self-respect. Oh, and we're not back together. I told her 'Hell No' and now she's dating a Beta who is quite literally her bitch, while I revel in the bachelor lifestyle. She contacted me over Facebook not too long ago telling me that she still has feelings for me and she'll never be faithful to her boyfriend until she's over me. She wanted us to meet up (which would have inevitably ended with her in my bed) and I declined. I guess I'm still sort of a softie on the inside. I couldn't do that to her boyfriend, as much as the poor bastard probably deserves it. Also, I just don't need the hassle.

So that's where I'm at. My game is not the greatest in the world, but I'm just really confident about being myself and I don't give a fuck. Life's too short, you know? Looking forward to self-improvement and adopting more of the RedPill lifestyle.

TL;DR - Finally on my RedPill journey, and it's about damn time. I still have a long way to go, but I've never felt better about myself.

Here we have a soldier who received Australia's highest military honor for bravery in combat. Not only that, he's also genetically Alpha as Phuck. So what do these women do? Question his intelligence and sexual ability. I'm pretty sure all of them would jump at the opportunity to sleep with him. So why do they ridicule him instead?

When women see a man that they perceive as too far above their own SMV, they desperately want to sleep with him, but they also worry about being rejected. This is one reason why they attack him with anything their tiny minds can come up with.

To many feminist women, it would be anathema to admit even to herself that she wants a man, maybe a lot more than he wants her. The hamster kicks in, to lower his value in her conscious mind while her subconscious is making her dizzy and wet with desire. This is why you see lots of fat ugly feminists poke fun at muscular men. It's just sour grapes.

The first one happened last night and it was the first time I've done something like this and it felt great, I've wanted to do it countless times before. I was supposed to go out with a girl after a 7pm class so I texted her when class was finished and I was on my way. It was a 20 minute drive so I figured she'd have enough time to be ready by then since all of this was planned in advance anyway. I get there and text her I'm outside her house. Of course she's not ready and texts me ""ok 5 minutes"" several minutes after getting there. After more than 10 minutes of waiting like a schmuck I just realized this is bullshit and I'm tired of this happening so often with women, so I texted her that I'm leaving and bounced. Sure enough, I get a string of frantic texts from her (""wow you actually left + come back"") and then later apologizing. 

The other story is me going on a 3rd date with a woman I met online. We got along great since the 1st date, and on the 3rd date we hung out during the day because I had plans in the evening. Towards the end of the date we had sex. I stayed longer than I should have and was going to be late for my next thing so after we finished I said I really had to get going, and she asked, 

""Why? Do you have another date or something?"" 

In my redpill mindset I simply replied, ""Yep.""  

Her reaction? ""Wow...that just makes you more hotter."" Unbelievable.

Teachers endlessly repeat the mantra that they are preparing students to be active learners. The reality is much different though, our entire educational system is built around accepting and memorizing facts and then regurgitating them a month later during a test. At no point are you ever taught to question the text itself.

One exception is the Law School Aptitude Test, 75% of which consists of reading a paragraph and identifying a flaw in the author's logic. Because of the severe time constraint, the only way to succeed is to practice so much that identifying these flaws becomes automatic.

When you finally do make this process automatic, you quickly realize how flawed all female logic is. It basically becomes impossible to listen to hamstering, or  feminism for any length of time. You quickly learn that any logic a woman uses to justify anything is somehow flawd. Just like the LSAT if you agree with a author's logic, you probably missed the flaw. Here is a quick list of (LSAT) logical fallacy to watch out for:


1. False Cause (Correlation / Causation)
-presuming that a real or perceived relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other



2. Appeal to Emotion
-attempting to manipulate an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument



3. The Fallacy Fallacy
-presuming that because a claim has been poorly argued, or a fallacy has been made, that it is necessarily wrong


4. Ad Hominem (Personal Attack)
-attacking the opponent's character or personal traits instead of engaging with their argument

5. Burden of Proof
-saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove


6. Ambiguity (Equivocation)
-using a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth


7. The Gambler's Fallacy
-assuming that ""runs"" occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins


8. Bandwagon
-appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation


9. Appeal to Authority
-using the opinion or position of an authority figure, or institution of authority, in place of an actual argument

10. Composition Division (Part-to-Whole)
-assuming that one part of something has to be applied to all, or other, parts of it

11. Genetic
-judging something as either good or bad on the basis of where it comes from, or from whom it came

12. Black or White (False Binary/Dilemma)
-presenting two alternative states as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist

13. Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning)
-presenting a circular argument in which the conclusion was included in the premise


14. Middle Ground
-claiming that a compromise, or middle point, between two extremes must be the truth

15. The Slippery Slope
- suggesting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will eventually happen too, therefore A should not happen

16. Straw Man
-misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack

17. Tu quoque
-avoiding engagement with criticism by turning it back on the accuser - answering criticism with criticism.

18. Personal Incredulity
-assuming that because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, it's probably not true

19. Special Pleading
-moving the goalposts or making up an exception when a claim is shown to be false

20. Loaded Question
-asking a question that had an assumption built into it so that it couldn't be answered without appearing a particular way

21. No True Scotsman
-appealing to purity as a way to dismiss relevant criticisms or flaws of an argument

22. Appeal to Nature
-arguing that because something is 'natural' it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, or ideal

23. Anecdotal
-using a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence

Because I find that my hobbies and physical fitness pursuits are much more rewarding uses of my time. (Which is sad). But I meet plenty through my hobbies and social life and they have been asking me out for a change. 

I got asked to go out with a 9 the other day. So I set up plans to go out dancing with her last night. We meet up, everything is cool. We walk to the bar, the conversation is flowing not too bad. She seems like a chill girl. Of course I know better than to believe that any girl is different from all the rest by now. It was proven to me yet again about a half hour later. 

We get into the bar and run into her friend who is a cocktail waitress there. Also my friend, a mutual friend. Which is how I met this girl. Her friend looks jealous and asks if we are on a date (I had been on a date with her friend back in April, but didn't go on another one due to rampant smartphone use. It irritates me on some base level). 

We both reply no, the girl I was with tells me shes seeing someone. Of course, I hint that I am too. 

We go inside to dance, she meets her promoter friend and a couple other people so I introduce myself and make small talk. She Bounces to the bathroom. I disappear so I'm not waiting for her when she gets back. 

When I show back up she's talking to her promoter friend again. Engrossed in his smartphone. On facebook. Not even thirty minutes after we had the in depth conversation about how she was quitting facebook. Like any girl can quit a nonstop source of validation. Ha! So I grab her arm and tell her let's go dance. 

She tells me no, wait, he's showing me something it's important. Then boxes me out of the set. Shits going way south.

I hesitate for two seconds. Then I picked up my sack, took a page out of RooshVs playbook turned around and walked the fuck out of the bar. I'm hanging out with another girl I met on Facebook on Monday. I'm not interested in putting up with that nonsense. 

Took her about ten minutes before I get a text asking if I was still there. 

I replied no. 

The I got this gem:
""How old are you!? I hadn't seen him in a while and he was showing me something important. I don't deserve to be left like that. Take care.""

I did not reply. I went home, deleted her #, and went to bed.

(For those of you who haven't seen the movie, suffice to say, it is about a man who relives the same day over and over again. Ohh and beware, spoilers ahead.)

When the movie starts Phil is toxicly arrogant, treats people around him like shit and is genuinely unsatisfied. 

Then he starts to repeat Groundhog Day and the first thing he does is to go on a quest of wish fulfillment (seducing Nancy, robbing the bank). 

Then he gets bored of that and starts to try and seduce Rita (whom he fell in love with at the start of the movie), but when he tries to get to know her and create ""the perfect date"" things never work out and soon he becomes so jaded and disillusioned with the whole exercise and starts getting worse and worse results. 

This is where he becomes depressed and suicidal, yet try as he might he can't die. He hits rock bottom and has a heart to heart with Rita and reveals to her his situation and is genuinely honest with her (and him self). 

After this Phil starts to try and be a better person (tries save the life of the old hobo, catches the kid falling from the tree, saves a man from choking to death) and starts to better him self (learns to play the piano, takes up ice sculpting, starts to educate him self).

For this he is rewarded with the admiration of those around him. And is bought by Rita at a bachelors auction. On the following date he is much different from the man that was trying to seduce Rita and so in the end he gets the girl of his dreams. (It's a 90's movie so of course it's got true love in it)

******
To me the film can be viewed as an allegory for the transformation many RP men have gone trough. We are weak and have less than stellar personalities. We do what doesn't work and become frustrated and jaded by it. Take the red pill/hit rock bottom and start to focus on things that matter to us. This change in behavior changes how we perceive our selfs and so how others do as well. Witch in turn changes the quality of our lives and our relationships with people.

5 1/2 years ago I met a very attractive woman on the internet. We video chatted for a while and talked on the phone. Sometimes her mom would get on the phone and ask me for relationship advice, which I thought was odd, and she always seems a little nuts. Eventually I got around to driving the 8 hour drive to met her in person to see if we hit it off and we did. After meeting her mom I could really tell she was missing a few bolts, but her daughter (the one I was hooking up with) seemed perfectly normal. We ended up dating for a while and then living together for about 6 months before getting married. I was in the military at the time so we moved around quite a bit. After a while she started hinting that she wanted me to get out of the military once my contract was up. I really didn't want to do this, but she kept going on and on about it more and more over time. When the time came I said screw it and got out to make her happy. I got a civilian job and worked there for about a year and 1/2. Our relationship was still great at this point even though I gave up my career for her. I quit my civilian job because she wanted to get some experience in the degree she was working on getting. She found a job paying decent money in that field and I quit my job to stay at home with our child. 

A few months go by and I think it hit her that she didn't really want any of this life that she had. Something happened that sucked the maturity out of her and she decided it was party time. For about 2 months she was going to clubs and house parties 2-3 times per week and sometimes wouldn't come home for a day or two. I begged and pleaded for this nonsense to stop and explained that it was ruining our marriage and family. After 2 months I finally convinced her to stop, but she never really apologized. To this day she still says that she's not sorry for any of it because she enjoyed herself. 

Sadly, all of that had caused us to grow apart mainly because I couldn't trust her anymore and she realized she could have more fun without me. About 6 months ago her mother convinced her that she needed to leave me, quit her job, and move back in with her a few states away. She tried to talk me into it, but I refused to give up a stable income, home, food, etc for our family just so she could go live with mommy. Fast forward to 1 1/2 months ago my wife comes home with a box of things saying that she just quit her job and is taking our child and dog and leaving in two days. I was speechless. I literally had no words because just not long before she swore up and down if she left she wouldn't screw me over. 

I was so busy trying to figure out what to do that I didn't notice until after she was gone that she had drained the bank account (right after we had gotten our tax return) and taken almost anything in the house worth selling. She even took many of my things that I had long before I even knew her. 

After she left I have the Sheriff beating on my door delivering protection orders claiming that I'm armed, dangerous, and suicidal. In these orders is about a page long of small print of some of the most insane things you will ever read. Sadly I had absolutely no way to get 2 states away to attend the court hearing so it was all granted and I am now only allowed to talk to my 3 year old daughter for 30 minutes per week.

Bring on the lashings. I deserve them. I will even swallow my pride and say she has slapped me around numerous times because she was mad at me for trying to stop her from doing whatever she wanted even though it was ruining our family. I was a pussy. Never again.

TL;DR Don't marry young girls with crazy moms. No matter what people say women DO turn out like their mothers sooner or later.

French men often circumvent these laws by sending samples of DNA to foreign laboratories, but risk prosecution if caught. The maximum penalty for carrying out secret paternity testing is one year in prison and a 15,000-Euro fine.[10][11]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternal_testing#France

&gt;If those samples were found in the post by officials on their way to foreign laboratories, the French men who sent them could theoretically face a **year in prison and a 15,000 Euro fine**. This year the ban was challenged but the French Government decided to uphold and maintain the anti-paternity testing law.

The reasons for which the Government said the ban should remain were related to the preservation of peace within French families. According to some online articles, Germany, has also banned (or plans to ban) paternity testing for similar reasons. French psychologists suggest that fatherhood is determined by society not by biology.

&gt; I attended college from 2005-2009, and I wanted a relationship but usually settled for hooking up. Having a real relationship after years of hooking up was quite difficult for me. I had no concept of compromise - I was accustomed to hooking up with anyone I found attractive who found me attractive, and felt entitled to do so, even after I was in a committed relationship. It's also hard to focus on one person after you've gone through so much effort to make sexual partners disposable. Hook ups also teach you little about patience and delayed gratification and, in my case, programmed me to think that a new partner was the most exciting sexual thing. Hook ups did the opposite of prepare me for the emotional part of a relationship. They made it difficult to adjust to a serious relationship.

It was one of their birthdays and her father had put £400 behind the bar. Thought I would write up some of the interesting things that came out of their mouths.

On mobile, so feel free to tag this as you see fit.  I'm also a little drunk, so this might be a little disjointed.  Will correct in the morning.

Three of the girls were out in the smoking area, one of which said hi when I grabbed a seat away from them, putting a pillar between us. I'm out to have a quiet drink and head home, no plans to game.

One of them comments to the other two that its awkward to talk to me with the pillar in the way and that they should sit next to me.  One girl moves to sit on me right, another to my left and the third stands in front of me. 

First few minutes is the usual lame girl game, name and what do you do. I tell them my name, deflect the question of what I do by asking why they were out on a school night. Learn about their situation: birthday, money behind the bar.

After deflecting these, the one to my left asks for a smoke. 

""No, I just meet you"" this visibly shocks her, eyes wide, mouth hanging open.

I turn to the girl on my right

""So your going to xxx uni, what are you doing?""

She deflects it with ""how old are you?""

I reply ""that's a personal question, why don't you guess""

""Hmm, 21"" which is 10 years younger than I am.

""Haha, that's how you get in my good books, so are you doing anything interesting at uni?""

Turns out she's doing Russian philosophy, I laugh and tear her and she quickly informs me she also works in events management, and starts talking about working at an event that Prince William and Kate Middleton attended. I wind her up about name dropping and she changes to subject:

""Are you single?""

""Hmm, kinda, it's complicated""

""I broke up with my boyfriend 2 weeks ago, I'm not single but never alone, that's my new motto""

""Haha, that's a good motto to live by""

""Your hot, how many girls do you have on the go?""

""Ha. That's another personal question, I've just meet you, what is this, the Spanish Inquisition?""

""Haha, I've got a queue of guys to pick from. I was out with a guy last night for pizza. He's not my boyfriend, after being with the same guy for 7 months I'm done with boyfriends""

""Ha, I'm the same with girlfriends. You guys are a pain after a fuck""

""Hey, I'm not high maintenance!""

""Any one that utters that sentence clearly is""

""Haha, fuck you, what do you do?""

""I clean ducks""

She persists with trying to find out and I continue to deflect, I eventually end up being invited to join them out.

I eventually tell them my real age, 31, and they pretend to be shocked.  One of them says: ""well, your 20s are for having fun, and you settle down in your 30 or 40, I'm going to settle down and have kids in my 40s like my mum.  I guess it's different for guys""

Oh dear, the rest of the banter is terrible.  They continuously talk about guys they have pulled, trying to pull or guys that are creeps.

The highlight was a stunning blonde talking to a fatty:

""I got with xxx on the dance floor, then I seen him chatting with someone else, so I got with xxx to make him jealous, but that didn't work, so I got with xxx too. He vanished, and I later bumped into him.  Turned out he got a BJ from xxx in the toilet. God, she's such a slut. He needs to grow up too, stop acting like a child""

Fatty: ""Why do you keep ending up with him?""

""I dunno, I just really like him. She's just a slut, when we were leaving, I seen her with some other guys pinning her against the wall. Did I tell you about xxx that I got with on Wednesday?""

""No""

""Yea, we went home together, and I forget what he looked like.  Came up to me and started flirting a few days later, I thought he was a creep until xxx reminded I pulled him already""

Aaand that was generally how most of the conversations went. 18 is way below my cut off age, so I just let them drag me along, buy drinks and listened to them talk shit. There is more, and will share if anyone wants me to.

That weight is a woman in a relationship, and they are little more than a parasite sucking you dry and giving very little in return. 

When they are done leaching off you, they leave and find another host to drain. Why they hell it makes us feel so shitty when one of these hangers on leaves is beyond me. As if I want to do twice or three times as much work just to keep her happy so she wont leave. Fuck that shit.

You can say I am bitter, hateful, or misogynist. Sure, somewhat I am. The reality of that is those words are little more than shame tactics used to keep me a slave to someone who feels entitled to everything I have earned because she has a vagina. When I have a woman in my life I am limited in what I can do, where I can go, and with whom I can interact. When I am unattached I can do as I please, spend my money or save it as I wish, and I have far more time for following my passions and achieving my goals.

I have things to do, and placating a female so she will stay and use me and soak up the resources I have busted my ass to earn is not one of them. I have owned cars more faithful and reliable, and far cheaper than any woman I have known, and I drive very old cars that need lots of work.

The nice thing about owning a GTO or a Trans Am is I can use it to get laid. I can keep the car, I don't need to keep the woman. Yeah, I want cars, dogs, a house, time and money to travel, and some pussy every once in a while. 

Years ago I wanted someone to share memories of our travels, now I realize the only memories I give a shit about are mine. I will go see the world, drive my muscle cars, build the house and shop the way I want it to be built, and enjoy the rest of my life. I sacrificed my physical and mental health to earn what I have now, there is no way in hell I will share it with someone who has not also earned where she is in life.

The adage of instead of getting married you should buy a woman you don't like a house is absolutely true. Women have earned the loneliness they endure, they can have it because I am not lonely.

The key idea that seems to have come from that thread has been ""why should he stay after you've had sex with him"" and this has stemmed from me asking that question from my own perspective. 

I'm actually drawing a blank. I can't think of any aspect of my life that would be improved by having a female partner around. I don't want children and I'm definitely not looking to get married and I don't give a fuck about being seen to ""bag an attractive wife"" as one of my mates put it.

I've improved my game as far as pulling, and I'm now pretty damn successful, but I think TRP philosophy is deeper than this and I've got to the ""well what now"" stage. Everything I've improved has made me more self sufficient, I'm fitter, in a better mental place and am much more able to go for what I want, which is a low stress life and financial success. Short of having better sex through getting to know what one particular woman likes, I don't see any advantage of sticking around. 

Thoughts? I'd be interested to hear what conclusions you all came to after getting past the immediate game hurdle.

I thought I'd share a one-line from my boss that seemed to fit in to the line of thinking around here. I stumble across this to find thousands of men who think like me, and I like them.

So I'm a veterinarian working in an eight doctor practice. For those of you who aren't intimately familiar with the history of the veterinary profession, it used to be almost exclusively male. But it underwent a shift in the 1970's and 1980's to an 80% female profession. What does that mean? That the new school thinkers are mostly female, the old schoolers are guys. The old schoolers are way more fun to work with. While my seven veterinarian colleagues are female (and, I should add, range from good to excellent doctors), my boss is an ancient practitioner of the old ways and a genuine badass.


I read an article in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA) that studied the impact of male or female doctors on male and female clients. The article had some interesting findings. Certain positives for male and female practitioners with male and female clients. But the discussion section of this ""scientific"" paper exclusively discussed the female positives and the male negatives and made no apologies or explanation for doing so. It was laughable how one-sided the article was. Glanced back at the authors, lo' and behold! Five women wrote the article. Go fucking figure.

My boss walked in as I was reading it. I asked if he'd seen it and said no. I described the study and the findings and the discussion. He laughed when I joked, ""So you're not going to read it?""

Here are some choice quotes by Florence herself on the nature of women:

&gt;I have read half your book thro', and am immensely charmed by it. But some things I disagree with and more I do not understand. This does not apply to the characters, but your conclusions, e.g. you say ""women are more sympathetic than men"".

&gt;**Now if I were to write a book out of my experience, I should begin *Women have no sympathy*. Yours is the tradition. Mine is the conviction of experience.**

&gt;Now look at my experience of men. A statesman, past middle age, absorbed in politics for a quarter of a century, out of sympathy with me, remodels his whole life and policy - learns a science the driest, the most technical, the most difficult, that of administration, as far as it concerns the lives of men - not, as I learnt it, in the field from stirring experience, but by writing dry regulations in a London room by my sofa with me. **This is what I call real sympathy.**

&gt;Another (Alexander, whom I made Director-General) does very nearly the same thing. He is dead too. Clough, a poet born if ever there was one, takes to nursing administration in the same way, for me.

&gt;I only mention three whose whole lives were remodeled by sympathy for me. But I could mention very many others...

&gt;**I have never found one woman who altered her life by one iota for me or my opinions.**

&gt;Now just look at the degree in which women have sympathy - as far as my experience is concerned. And my experience of women is almost as large as Europe. And it is so intimate too. I have lived and slept in the same bed with English Countesses and Prussian Bauerinnen. No [other woman] has ever had charge of women of the different creeds that I have had. No woman has excited ""passions"" among women more than I have. Yet I leave no school behind me. **My doctrines have taken no hold among women...and I attribute this to a want of sympathy.**

&gt;It makes me mad, the Women's Rights talk about ""the want of a field"" for them - when I know that I would gladly give £500 a year for a Woman Secretary. And two English Lady Superintendents have told me the same. And we can't get *one* ... they don't know the names of the Cabinet Ministers. They don't know the offices at the Horse Guards...Now I'm sure I did not know these things. When I went to the Crimea I did not know a Colonel from a Corporal. But there are such things as Army Lists and Almanacs. Yet I never could find a woman who, out of sympathy, would consult one for my work.

&gt;I do believe I am ""like a man,"" as Parthe says. But how? ***In having sympathy***.

&gt;**Women crave *for being loved*, not for loving.** They scream out at you for sympathy all day long, they are incapable of giving any in return, for they cannot remember your affairs long enough to do so...They cannot state a fact accurately to another, nor can that other attend to it accurately enough for it to become information. Now is not all this the result of want of sympathy?

&gt;I am sick with indignation at what wives and mothers will do of the most egregious selfishness. And people call it all maternal or conjugal affection, and think it pretty to say so. No, no, let each person tell the truth from his own experience.""

It's traditionally been expected for women to seek out men who are successful, but not ones for just being attractive. This shows they'll say that earning power matters a lot and looks don't matter as much, but in actuality they do value looks a whole lot more than they say, and earning power less than they say.

To truly swallow TRP is to accept the reality the women innately desire the most aesthetic alpha cock they can acquire. Not even wealth can trump this hypergamous drive.

Always the nice guy.  As the nice guy, I end up in LTRs where the demands are endless and the sex goes to near nothing.  Oh yes, the sex starts out top notch...just to lure you into the abyss, as you all know.

  My last relationship was 4 years with a struggling single mother. It was porno sex for the first 3 months. Because of that,  I thought it would be a great idea for us to move in together.  I could help out with the child, bills, her mental stability.  And Hey, I was getting paid in great sex.  I bet you will be shocked to find out that after we moved in together the sex went to nothing and the demands stayed.

  A couple years in she decided that she needed other male attention and 'wasn't sure about our relationship'...we still lived together.  And I STAYED while dudes were coming over.  I slept in the fucking living room. 
 
   I finally moved out after a year.  When I stood up for myself and said 'I'm out of here' guess what... complete 180...she says 'I'm so sorry, I will change, I won't talk to any of these guys anymore'.  Translation 'You are Mr beta reliable and pay all the bills and most of the mortgage and I fucked it up, please don't go'  I pulled together the last bit of dignity I had and moved out.

   This was a couple years ago.  Now I live in an OK apartment in a great area of 20 and 30 somethings.  Great looking women everywhere.  Chat with some, get a couple numbers, send a text a few days later to get together and...nothing...nothing...no response.  I see them again out and around somewhere and I get a half assed greeting.

   I've been reading The Red Pill sub for a couple weeks now, and read some posts that say how difficult it is to swallow the pill.  It is.  I hate it.  I don't feel liberated and excited.  I feel more pissed off and depressed.  Just this morning I got another cold shoulder from a girl I know and happened to see out walking her dog this morning.

 Nice guys.  Fuck nice guys.  I'm going to beat the nice guy out of me.  I've been nice for 34 years and have paid a TON of time and money to get laid, AND women have walked all over me...and continue to do so.  God-fuckin'-dammit, I hate it. 

TL DR: I am 34, been with 8 women.  The red pill is a bitch to swallow, but I am going to do it.

I am reading the books listed by many of you, starting with 'No more mr nice guy'.  
  I have to say, I read 90+ responses to my post and the next day while taking my morning walk I ran into the girl who had given me a cold shoulder.

Came across it being a bored semi-beta at work surfing Reddit hitting the random button just hoping to come across a truly interesting sub-reddit. Low &amp; behold I have hit the jack pot with TheRedPill. I used to have this mentality many years ago and slowly turned beta over the years due to pot, lack of exercise, social views/society.....

I have only been reading this for a week, but on day 1 it clicked for me knowing/remembering how to TRULY be Alpha again. Listening to my gut instincts, REALLY being myself, and not giving a shit what other people think. It has been a great feeling from day 1.

Nothing to big to report yet as I'm only getting started but I went out for the first time in a while last Friday to the local bar with my buddy and had a great night. Usually, I'm somewhat uncomfortable at a bar not knowing what to do, who to talk to, what girl should I try to hit on? Oh she gave me a look, now what....?

I went out with the attitude of ""I'm just gonna have fun tonight, you in?"" 

Worked like a charm, already feeling super confident about my revelation just a few days ago about everything I had been doing wrong, I went into the bar feeling great without a care in the world, after all I'm just here to enjoy myself right? So long story short, again nothing amazing happened but it was a nice effortless night for me.

A cute blonde that I had been talking to throughout the night came up to me when I was talking/flirting with her friend and said, ""Well here's my number since you never asked! You should come across the street with us, we're leaving.""

*Looking back at that moment I should have left with them to go party, I thought they were going to another bar across the street but they were going back to their room....(I was pretty tipsy at this point and heard bar, but my buddy was like ""No dude, she was asking you back to her room!"")

facepalm.jpg

Anyways, I enjoyed myself and the flirting/convos with the women just seemed to flow very easily without much effort. I realize now I had been over-thinking everything when talking to girls. Less = More and they always want more, especially when you don't give it to them easily.

Sorry for the rant - just wanted to say thanks! Just gotta get my roomate out of his semi-beta mindset so I can have the ultimate wingman and we can go out and just start killing it in all aspects of life. He's ready - I know it!

One article and you're unplugged just like that? I spent an entire day reading about being a man and I feel like for the first time in my life I have entire control. 

It's been a few days since I found this subreddit and I already find myself doing a 180 on my life view. Believe it or not I have had the first lucid dreams in 3 years for a few days running which, and it's only conjecture, I contribute to crippling depression.

I feel like a 80 lbs. weight has been taken off my chest since I finally discovered this. I have heard every single version of ""What is wrong with todays generation?"" By my effortlessly alpha male older relatives, and I couldn't answer. But, in my own head, I think I found the answer.

No one in my life has ever bothered to tell me how to be a man. It's something you are expected to absorb and you take in and learn over time. And I realize this is true to a point, but when everything you are absorbing from the media, and society as a whole, is so blatantly against what actually makes a man... how can you blame a generation for not realizing what it takes? 

I grew up with little to no regular contact with alpha males. All of my conscious thoughts have been shaped by what the media/movies portray as the ""ideal"" man and trying to mould myself into that image. The only success (I feel) I have had in my life has been through substance abuse. And by what I mean by that, is that I honestly and truly feel that the only time I have ever had success in any sort of relationship is when my inhibitions were lowered/non-existent and I honestly acted how I felt deep down inside.

Reflecting on that is pretty eye opening. The only time I feel like I have been successful in my life was through a means I didn't control internally. When I just followed my natural instincts through substance abuse I always improved my personal situation; until following the obvious conclusion of repeating my behavior of what was rewarding, abusing it, taking it to more and more of an extreme, and bringing it all crashing down on my head. 

All of this feels like it's connected to me because of this: Sober, young, impressionable me tries to form himself to everything absorbed through all sources that naturally get absorbed (i.e. media, movies, and women's advice) and fucking. hates. myself.
Substance abusing me lowers my inhibitions and makes it easier to follow instincts, is immediately awarded on every front of my life. As in, makes me confident, risk taking ( obviously the higher I get the worse this behavior gets ), doing whatever I feel like doing and seeing immediate effects. Translating into an immediate rise in my social position, literally more vag and sexual opportunities than I knew what to do with (not for lack of trying), deeper bonds with everyone I met, and just a general increase in feeling of self worth. This is just my personal experience and is obviously possibly skewed by said substances.

This thread and all of the reading material I have absorbed the last few days, has opened my eyes in a way I couldn't even imagine before. I feel like my struggles with depression, motivation, sense of self worth, and just general self worth are curable. I think they are directly attributable to my quest of self actualization, by which I mean thinking that I can become the man I want to be by following everything I have absorbed consciously and subconsciously through whatever means by a feminist society. 

I have come to the realization (thanks to this community) that I have been struggling and fighting myself into the deepest, darkest hole in my mind, by consciously going against my instincts. That what I have been striving and maintaining as my goal in life has been fundamentally the wrong thing. That struggling and fighting to have the perfect life portrayed by a feminist society just isn't, hasn't, and never will work for me. Instead this community has opened my eyes to the fact that the only way for me to realize self actualization as a man, is to make myself into the man I want to be. I've always believed that hard work, perseverance, and educating myself will get me the life I want. I have only just come to the conclusion that I have been aiming for the wrong thing my entire life.

Thank you to the people selfless enough to spend a portion of your time in the world trying to educate other people.

It was a good question that was answered well (""No, not really."")

The question is fallacious, though well-intentioned.

The mistake is assuming there's an authoritative body that decides such things.  TRP is a *loose alliance of like-minded independents*, not a *movement*.  As such, there is no ""orthodoxy.""  There are a bunch of different flavors out there if you look---dalrock for the Christians, Capt Capitalism for those more interested in the economics, CH/Rollo for general redpill stuff, Occidental Traditionalist if you're into white nationalism, danny504 if you don't like capitalization, tons tons tons more.  There is even a two-blog Mormon section (Me and GoodStrongMan).

(**THIS is what diversity looks like**, not the forcibly homogenized monoculture we have today)

In truth I have some misgivings about /r/theredpill\* --- not the red pill part, but the /r/ part.  Most of Reddit has the idea that /r/theredpill is ""a warren of hateful misogynists.""  They're wrong about the ""misogynists"" part, but they are also wrong about the ""warren"" part.  The Manosphere is not centered on /r/theredpill, *because it is not centered anywhere*. It is powerful *because* it is decentralized and amorphous.

**Don't make the mistake of thinking anything is going to happen as a result of guys writing on the Internet.**  There is no unified redpill movement, because such a movement would be co-opted or crushed or commercialized were it to show its face and gain steam.  Instead, change will come from application of red pill principles *in your own life*.  And eventually, I suspect, from [things like this](http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2013/01/from-patriots-to-traitors/).

So you want to divide between dark/light redpill stuff?  Fine!  Start a blog and tell everyone about it.  You don't need the permission of anyone here.  Maybe it will catch on, maybe it won't.

I hated my life and who I was, but even worse, I didn't love women. 

I thought I did. But I had a conception of what a woman was that was that simply was not true. When I looked around I didn't see what everyone (women included) kept telling me a woman should be, and all that came out of it was bitterness. I thought, ""I'm not trying to destroy their self esteem at every turn, I'm not trying to sexually assault them, why don't they like me?"" I was hardcore Blue Pill

After a bout of destructive drinking and looking too longingly at my 1911 I knew the way I lived wasn't right, and I sought a new way. I decided that I would use Reddit as a tool to this end, and immediately adjusted all my subreddits and found TRP through /r/seduction. After a couple weeks of reading materials my mind still held back a little. It's very hard to fight indoctrination. 

So last night my friend, who has some game and does love women, told me to come out and hang with him. I walked out the door dedicated to see this world with the eyes I've never used before. 

He had an old childhood friend with him, she was about an HB7. I didn't treat her like a pretty fairy princess but like any other person. As the night went on I realized I can say and do what was fun to me and not have to worry. I slowly became outcome independent. At one point I stopped and slid my hand around a girl who was leaning back on a railing by herself. I doubt she even heard what I said before she took my hand off her hip. I gave her a pat on the shoulder saying ""fair enough"" and moved on. 

So we get back to my buddies place and the childhood friend decides she wants to go skinny dipping, trying to convince us by putting her feet in the water and taking down her shoulder straps. We brush the idea off and head to his door, leaving her there in the pool wondering if we're gonna change our minds. We don't. We get into his house and she follows, half the undressing already done. She finishes undressing once we get in there and I find out how nice her breasts are before I leave. 

This morning, while I was going over everything in the shower it all clicked. I had fun last night. I talked to women, shared their space, made them feel wanted, and was wanted myself. I've finally stopped hating women for not being what I was told they were, and started loving them for what they are. I think this is likely the most important thing about becoming a man. You won't become outcome independent and fun loving until you stop seeing woman as an enigma and start seeing them for what they are: Fun loving, sensual, **and happy to follow our lead.**

You could read TRP and seduction materials all day, but until you go out and see this world as it is, you will never gain a true appreciation for it. 

For any lurker out there wondering, like I was: Get out, see what we're talking about, engage with women.  When you see the truth with the eyes you've never used before then you will truly become unplugged. Then you can do anything. 

This may go without saying cause of the giant wall of text, but I want to thank /r/TheRedPill and its users and dedicated mods. It can be hard to see a truth no one will tell you or admit to. You magnificent sons of bitches plucked me from the depths with the Nebuchadnezzar and showed me the truth. 

Edit: it's-&gt;its  

In response to /u/michaelkcollins: This post was made after the morning shower, and comes from my reflection upon the prior night. It lacks the details to be a field report (I think, that why I tagged it Meta). I had several positive interactions with women that night, but I left them out and included the rejection because my target audience (you know, the one I mentioned in the title?) usually has an issue with such things, I know I have. I wanted to allay the fears of someone who is where I was before going out. And if I don't feel like swimming at 4:30 in the goddamn morning why the fuck should I?

In my mind, I think of her as my Morpheus girl, because what I learned about her forced me to reach a fork in the road and make a choice. I chose the Red Pill. I thought it might be good for me to get it off my chest and hopefully someone who is still trying to decide will glimpse something familiar in this thread and feel more emboldened to take life by the horns and swallow the Red Pill.

Her name was Diana. We were in college together. We dated sophomore year for eight months, and then broke up. She dumped me, and it was harsh. Did she have a specific reason? No, she had seven. At the time I was listening to a lot of Postal Service and there's a line in one of the songs that reminded me of that dumping: ""I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear, I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave."" I was possessive, I was controlling, I had anger problems, I didn't appreciate her, I was commit-a-phobic (commit-a-phobic and possessive, that should have tipped me off that something was up), it was all my problems, flaws, my fault. And man, I took that to heart and kept trying to get back together with her. 

Now... now I know she was hamstering. Because I found out two years ago that she had actually been cheating on me towards the end. She slept with three other guys - one of whom was actually my ""friend"" - before breaking it off with me, and I was clueless about it until more recently. She came up with a million reasons why I was the problem in our relationship, but really, she was twenty and wanted cock. 

Once I realized that this girl, who I thought was the perfect embodiment of womanhood, was actually devious, deceptive, and cruel, I began to wonder about other girls I dated. The more I dug around, the more I realized that I'd never been in a relationship where I truly knew the other person. I never realized how women's minds work and every time I thought I was dating my ""best friend"", I was being played a fool. It was hard, but it made me stronger. I began working out, eating better, taking care of *myself* for *myself* instead of sitting around waiting for some woman to come into my life.

By the way, I bring this all up because the grapevine told me Diana got engaged last week, at the age of 25. My buddy told me as if he thought I'd be upset, but I just laughed. The idea of that slut wearing white on her wedding day is just too funny.

I was expecting long philosophical discussions on morality, or abortion instead 1/3 of the lecture time was spent on [Affirmed Consent](http://dos.uiowa.edu/policy-list/affirmative-consent-2/). 

Now being a philosophy class I assumed that any topic was up for debate. I asked pragmatic questions on the practical implication of Informed Consent: How long do you think this Informed Consent process would take 30-45 minutes? How is a male supposed to maintain an erection during this time? I was immediately shamed for using the word erection during a conversation on sex. Wouldn't this destroy the spontaneity of the sex act crushing its enjoyability and therefore its purpose?

No one gave a fuck or even answered my questions. Women agreed that they should be treated like magic princesses. Betas kept quiet because if they upset the women to much they wouldn't have sex.

It all started when I first saw Patrice O'Neal's ""Elephant in the Room"", and listened to his bit about women raping men's time. It made me realize something that Patrice and many men on this sub know: In the world of sexual relations, women value men's time/emotional connection, and men value women's pussies. 

This then got me thinking about harems and beta orbiters. Men are basically farming pussy for themselves without giving away too much of their time to one women (crass and simple, but anyone on here should know the more intricate details of maintaining a harem). Women do the same thing with beta orbiters. They are ""farming"" men's time and emotional connection (and attention!) without giving away their pussies. They're doing the same thing. Basically, they're living their version of a redpill life (aka a blue pill life). 

This of course lead to a third realization for me: I shouldn't be ANGRY about how blue pill the world is. If I was a woman, I'd LOVE to have 3 guys telling me how awesome I am while I get gorilla fucked by their alpha friend. So I stopped being angry. I used to be so frustrated that women are the way they are and that men are the way women want them to be. I used to rage when I saw the blue pill in action. But not anymore. I can't reasonably be mad at women when they are just living life how they want to live it (which is exactly what TRP is about). 

So I've stopped focusing my attention on the women. It isn't their thought processes that should be changed. I'm focusing my attention on the men on the verge of going redpill. Those guys are the ones we want to put energy into.

Now, due to the sheer accuracy of its teachings, which have been confirmed to me many times through first and second hand encounters, I no longer have any doubt about its validity.

My confusion is where do I go from here? What do I do with this knowledge? Because right now, all I am doing with the knowledge is feeling the bitter aftertaste of the pill.

I see this as a spectrum. On one end you have totally blue pill guys who are blissfully ignorant, but nonetheless blissful. Because they're blind to the fact that they're being manipulated and cheated, they're able to get into relationships, and when faced with the evidence or consequences of her true ways, can incredibly fool themselves into thinking it was his fault or that she didn't actually do anything wrong or that they're still better off with her. Just read /r/relationships for non-stop examples of this. These guys, in some ways, are lucky.

On the other end of the spectrum are totally red pill guys, who not only understand what's going on but have **accepted** it. The ones whose pickup skills are also good enough that they become the minority of guys who get the majority of girls. Guys who can say things like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxWuREjuLAE and be comfortable with it. The guys who don't care about the cock carousel because they *are the carousel*. The guys who don't get emotionally attached too quickly, or at all, to girls. The ones who don't get fooled into thinking that this girl is different. The ones with the skill to get enough sex that they don't get dependent on one, and can drop her once she stops adding value to his life. These guys are the most lucky. They see reality, and they use it to their advantage.

And in the middle of the spectrum is limbo, where I find myself. In that unfortunate zone, you understand and have verified red pill enough that there's no going back to the blissful ignorance of blue pill, even if you wanted to (which you never will). But you haven't really *accepted* it. And you continue making the mistake of thinking 'this girl is different' when you go on a date with a girl who has the innocent face and says exactly what she thinks you want to hear. (Every time, I've been proven wrong to get swept up in the good girl show they put on for me.) And you don't have the skill and confidence to seduce enough women. So in this limbo, neither do you get blissful ignorance nor do you get to be the beneficiary of reality which includes, among many other things, her propensity to cheat. Hence the bitter aftertaste of the red pill.

Since there's no possibility (or desire) of going back to blue pill thinking, what can I do to escape limbo and get out the other end, in true red pill land and make it my playground?

Ella had just finished up a date, who she met online.  They'd spent 4 hours together and had several drinks and a bit of food.

She first described her date as a bit awkward at first, but she reassured us that he was very **nice**!

So nice in fact, that she brought it up at least 10 more times through the night, always as if to justify that she had not just wasted four hours of her life:

- We talked about this, and that too much, but **he was nice**.
- He works at X. Yeah, **he was nice**. We had good conversation.
- I went to the bathroom, and when I came back he had already paid! **So nice** of him!

Too bad for him, that while in the bathroom, she had texted a guy who she had been out with on a date earlier in the week.  One who actually makes her bits tingle.

So an hour later, the 2nd dude shows up.  Confident in his own skin, put together, not-cocky, not gamey, engaged all of us.  Pretty cool guy. Enjoyed talking to him.  Rest of us took off leaving them to their own in the wee hours.

They had been drinking for awhile before I had gotten there, and for some reason had ""I love spice girls"" written on their arms.

We had a couple of drinks and bounced venue. When we served at the new venue, we grab some drinks and find a booth.  We luckily managed to get one at the back of the bar, overlooking the whole room and stairs leading upstairs and the toilets.

I quickly find out what the point of the writing was. They had lost a bet another barman and had to see who was the first to get someone to kiss it. Amateur hour, but I decide to join in. I quickly write it across my arm and try make a cash bet with them. Steve bites and the game is on.

First set is 2 girls and 2 guys, guy and girls sitting across from each other, with a space at the one end of the table. I approach from an angle that I'm standing at the head of their table.  I nod at the guys, giving them a quick hi and lock eyes with girl on my left. This doesn't go well, as it turns out one of the guys may have been dating her, and was fairly annoyed.

I return to my table, receive some ribbing from Frank and Steve. This doesn't last long as I spot a 2 set approaching the bar, so I open them.

I go straight to asking for her to kiss my arm, and after a minute of banter she does and I win the bet.

Steve starts asking about what I said, so I give him a quick run down. I explain to him I will probably be chatting to everyone in the bar at some point, and if he wanted to join in, we can wing each other.

He agrees, I give him a quick rundown on:

- why rejection doesn't matter
- the importance of outcome independence
- the concept of situational openers
- not being the first to buy a drink
- if he doesn't open, I always will

He seemed to get most of it, so I have a look at the bar. I spot a group, with a lovely blonde, a touch taller then me, skin tight white jumper with black short shorts on, standing with a fairly overweight guy.

I suggest them, and give him some potential openers and following ups. He doesn't, so I open them.

I come in at a slightly bad angle, and the guy ends up standing on my foot as I open them, I have an injury on that foot from a recent festival.

""Ouch man"" grabbing both their arms as they turn towards me ""You just stood on my foot!""

The girl laughs and the guy begins to apologies. The girl turns round fully and is now facing me, they guy is to my right.

""It's cool man, I've got a cut from when I feel last weekend.

Girl: ""Oh, what did you do?""

""Haha, I was at a festival, has a river running through it, slipped when skinny dipping, I may have been a little pissed""

""Haha, were you at &lt;festival name&gt;?"" Strong eye contact

""Yea, where you?"" Place my hands on her hip, turning to the guy. ""How about you, pal, where you?""

Girl ""No, but I know a few people that did and they said it was good""

Guy ""No, I didn't go either.  What's you name?""

""Guys, you missed an amazing weekend, weather was amazing!""

Girls ""You do have a really good tan"" touching my arm, I notice she has a tongue pierced, I still have my left hand on her left hip.

""Aw thanks, how do you know each other?""

The girl begins to answer, but I interrupt her ""do you have your tongue pierced?""

""Yes"" she giggles and looks down and to her left.

""Let me see it, stick your tongue out""

She giggles, kinda hops on one leg and sticks her it out

""Haha, amazing, that's cool, touch your nose, let me see the bottom""

""I lost the ball earlier to day, almost swallowed it!"" She says and sticks her tongue back out and tries to touch her nose.

""Can I touch it?""

She giggles, nods and leans towards me. I move the bar up and down and laugh ""haha, that's cool, the only time I get to play around with a tongue piercing is when I'm kissing someone""

During this exchange, her guy pal had been trying to interrupt. Without breaking eye contact, I turn my body to him, and hold my hand out.

""My names Scottishredpill, what's your name?""

I break eye contact when he takes my hand, and give him a two handed handshake. He introduces the girl, Linda, and I give her the same handshake, but holding it a little longer and make strong eye contact, and a cheeky smile.

I find out how they know each other, and exit, getting a hug and an ass squeeze from Linda.

When I return to out booth, I find Frank and Steve talking to someone.

Frank ""scottishredpill, this guy wants to join out booth""

""No, fuck off"" I reply, with a big smile. I turn to the guy and slap his shoulder, he looks a little surprised. ""Haha, I'm joking, well, kinda. I'm not giving my seat up, so there isn't really any space""

Guy ""I have 3 girls with me""

""That's nice, but I'm still not giving my seat up""  I point to a booth across the room. ""There is one over there that is empty"".

He laughs and leaves, taking the 3 girls with him, all looking a little surprised.

Steve is laughing, and quickly give him a run down of how things went with the set.

We spot a 2 set, and Steve agrees to open them. I give him some opener suggestions, suggest he approaches from the left side and that when he feels like he should buy them a drink,  probably after 4-5 mins, exit and return. He listens to me and then leaves the booth.

He walks over, moves to their left to side and freezes. He seems to make a move to open them, then turns to the bar. 30 seconds pass, I'm sure he is about to bail and return when he seems to catch is never and opens them.

It looks like it is going well, the girls move early in the interaction to both face him better. After a few minutes, Steve starts to reach into his back pocket, slowly lifting his wallet out.

I get up from the booth and approach. As I do, I use my left hand to reach behind Steve, pushing his hand down, and turning to the girls

""Hi guys, how are you?""

""scottishredpill!"" exclaims one of the girls, I have no idea who is

""Eeer, hello?""

""It's me, Jill, I had dark hair last time we seen each other""

""Ahhh,"" I finally realize who it is. ""It's been too long""  We hug, while we do so, I turn her round so her back is towards her and my friend.

We chat for a few minutes, catching up as I hadn't seen her for a few months. Out the corner of my eye, I spot a waitress from a bar I often have lunch at, but haven't seen to in awhile, and whose name I don't know""

""Jill, it was great seeing you"" I say, giving her a hug ""I'll catch up with you soon.""

I turn to the bar maid ""Hey pal! Isn't this a surprise!""

She stops, spots me and smiles ""Hey, scottishredpill, it's been too long!"" she says, stepping towards me.

I stop towards her and we hug.  When we break, she keeps her hands on my hips, so I do the same, she doesn't break eye contact.

""How have you been?"" I ask

""Good, I've missed you, it's good to see you!""

""Aw, aren't you a charmer, what are you doing here?""

""I live round the corner, just out for a few drinks""

""Well, isn't that handy""

Giggles ""It's really good to see you""

We hug again and this time we kiss.

""Well, it is really good to see you""

She giggles, looks away and back ""I've got to go to the toilet""

""Ok, I'll see you later""

We kiss again and she leaves.

I turn back to my friend, who is still chatting to the girl is opened, and I spot Jill, who is now talking to some guy. I return to out booth and resume drinking, Frank has vanished.

I look over at the booth the guy I told to get lost, I can see two of the girls, who are looking very bored. I am about to go open them when I see Linda walking across the room, probably on her way to the toilet.

I yell her name, and she looks over and smiles. I smile back, pat the seat next to me, and she actually skips over, smile getting bigger as she approaches.  She hops onto the seat next to me, puts her legs over mine and snuggles into me. I put my hand under her chin, and kiss her.

After we kiss, I lean forward to talk into her ear ""Come home with me""

She giggles ""Maybe""

""Come home with me""  I repeat, looking her in the eye

""Ok, but later, &lt;pals name&gt; will get upset, he would be annoyed if he seen this"" she says, looking back at here she came from.

""Ok, go, meet me outside, down the street outside &lt;bar name&gt;""

""Ok"", she says, smiling. We kiss and she leaves to the toilet.

Steve returns, and fills me in on how he got on.  He fills me in on how he got on, while he did end up buy her a drink.  We head outside for a smoke, I share some more theory with him while we open random set. Steve has work in the morning, so he leaves and I head back into the bar. Frank is at our booth, talking to two guys. Turns out they are brothers, and are here on holiday. I leave him to it and open the group I had earlier told to fuck off.

The guy of the group tries to give me shit about telling them to fuck off, but I quickly get him on my side and we all chat. I stick with them until just before the bar shuts, after which I leave and head to where I said I would meet Linda. She isn't there, but there is a 4 set of 2 girls and 2 guys sitting on a wall. I open them, and manage to k-close one of the girls after finding out she has hairy legs. After that look up and spot Linda watching, shaking her head so I get up and go meet her

She laughs ""Your terrible, I seen that, and the girl in the bar""

I simply smile at her, take her hand and turn to walk down the street.  She resists at first, I turn slightly raise an eyebrow and tug, she laughs and starts walking.  I flag down a cab and we head to my place ",Field Report,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,fr,endorsement,True,t3_1ic2yf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ic2yf/an_evening_with_a_willing_wingman/,

He basically says that women desperately try to prevent men from discovering their true sexual market value in order to manipulate, control, and tie them down when they're young.  If a man hasn't fallen for these tricks, has his life together, and understands his true SMV he is both attractive and scary.  

I'm 30 and the girls I date are usually around 22 or 23.  On several occasions when other women became aware of this they didn't hesitate to tell me it was disgusting and that a 22 year old is essentially a child.  Despite their bluntness it was obvious they were holding back even more rage under the surface.

It's something I have always done and it is an inherent trait of the industry I work in.  Things are constantly changing and what was best one day can easily be the worst or less productive the next.

When sharing Red Pill knowledge, the most common response is disbelief, the majority of it from one sex: males.

The vast majority of women I have discussed this with will agree with most of it.  When they feel it describes them, or get personal, then they will stop agreeing.  However, reword the statement to make it less personal, and they will start agreeing again.  With feminists, keep the MR bullshit out of it and they will nod agreement too.

One of the arguments I get against some of the things I share, and I'm sure  some of you get it too, is that Not All Women Are Like That, exclusively from men.  To some degree I do understand that view point, not everyone is the same.  However, in my experience, they are the exception, not the rule.

Recently, when discussing things with a friend, we decided to do some very rough maths. Very rough.  

I have a number of different social circles in three of my countries biggest cities.  The majority of which are 80% female, ranging from the ages of 19-mid 40s; students, career women, house wives, moms, married, single.  The contexts we hangout in also varied; grimy dive bars, expensive cocktail bars, casinos, dub step clubs, their bedrooms.  Let's say in those social circles there are around 200 women in total, most of whom I've been intimate to some degree with. 

I go out at least 4 nights a week, mostly solo, and make a point of approaching 5 sets before going home.  So 4x5x52, that's at least 1000 women a year, most sets are 2+.  I've been doing this for 2.5 years, and been red pill aware for about 6 months.

I've meet at least 2000 new women, that's been fun.  I dunno if that's a high number to other people, but it is to me compared to my twenties...

I spent my early teens to my late twenties in numerous 4yrs+ relationships and was once married. I know how long term relationships can deteriorate and fail. Luckily, I still talk to the majority of my exs and do enjoy continued close friendships with some when they are single, or bored.

While this is not representative of every city or country in the world, it's more than enough for me to make responsible assumptions about the type of women and actions I deal with and meet in my country.  That's good enough for me, and Red Pill theory is consistently proven true.

As posted a few days ago, the Red Pill is not a movement, nor is it a cult.  It's a group of people that are experiencing the same things and coming to an agreement what might be the cause.

Is it 100% correct?  Maybe, maybe not. But it currently fits the hole, and until something proves otherwise, it's the best model for me.  Prove me wrong consistently and I am open to changing my mind.

Insult, mock, troll, call us the the worst subreddit. Don't believe me. I don't care.

While you are here taking the time to poke fun, I am out meeting your friends, your girlfriends, your wives, your sisters.  I'm saying hello, I'm getting their numbers and I'm fucking them while you're calling me a sexually frustrated neck beard. That's cool though, this shit is crazy, I barely believe it happens and I'm experiencing it!

It comes from his latest novel, which, together with his previous novel ""SNUFF"" are incredibly anti-feminist. I am quite sure that they, unlike his earlier novels, will never be published in the Anglo-speaking world and if they will, the shitstorm is going to be tremendous.

It devalues the usefulness of the term.  Here's primer for those new here.

Hamster is short for the term rationalization hamster which is a tool used by both men and women to rectify cognitive dissonance.  Cognitive dissonance occurs when you have two conflicting perceptions, desires, beliefs held in your mind.  So to hamster is find a rationale that resolves the conflict in your mind.  

**PG Example of hamstering**

Here is a simple example of cognitive dissonance taken from an [old story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes): ""A fox sees some high-hanging grapes and wishes to eat them. When the fox is unable to think of a way to reach them, he decides that the grapes are probably not worth eating, with the justification the grapes probably are not ripe or that they are sour.""

There are a number of ways that this applies to TRP.  I'll throw out a couple of the big ones.

**Hamstering to resolve subconscious desires and higher-conscious needs**

One is that women have two modes of thinking when it comes sex and their attraction to men. At the subconscious layer, women are generally attracted to men displaying alpha characteristics - assertiveness, strength, confidence, dark triad, etc.  At their high conscious layer, women are attracted to the things that you generally hear them talk about - kindness, stability, etc.

When traits in a given male do not satisfy both her subconscious and conscious layers, she will need to hamster to resolve the conflict.  If she is with a beta provider, she will find some way to rationalize that he is a the right one for her despite the fact that he doesn't make her wet.  If she is with a alpha-ish douchebag, she will find a way to rationalize that he is good for her.

**Hamstering to resolve slutty behavior**

Another TRP application is that Western women (and those slut-shaming cultures) will also hamster to rationalize their slutty behavior.  A common example is the mental hoops a woman will jump through when you invite her back to your place at the end of the night.  Her subconscious is totally DTF at this point.  Her high conscious is telling her that it's a bad idea though.  Her subconscious is going to usually win out, and her higher conscious will have to resolve the conflict.  ""Well, I haven't seen that movie yet actually.""  ""It's too late and too far to my house.""

**On Nice Guys**

A common trope I continuously hear is that nice guys aren't really nice, or that they pretend to be nice to score. Or that their niceness is contrived. This attempts to reframe the argument that nice-guys aren't really nice therefore rejecting them is rational, female egos be preserved.

Niceness need not be contrived to fail. I was a genuinely nice guy, I just did stuff for everybody that asked. I figured, people like nice. I like to be liked. Therefore I'll be nice.

And I let people take advantage of me. But this wasn't contrived niceness. It was naivety. I was taught from an early age, share, be nice, respect people and they'll respect you. What really happened was nobody respected me and everybody took advantage of me.

And I think that's why I dislike the recent reframe of the nice-guy problem. They're not typically disingenuous. They're simply misinformed. They can be as genuinely nice as anybody can be.

**On Confidence/Assholes**

I keep seeing here on the red pill this common trope. **""You don't have to be an asshole, just confident...""**

So the argument is that you don't have to be an asshole to be confident. I disagree. Part of having good game (for men) is conveying (not explicitly) that you have options. The only way to do that is to send signals that you have options. These signals must act counter to what would be expected from somebody following the ""rules"" of our society. In other words, in order to convey value implicitly, I must appear to be unintentionally breaking societal rules. To do this, I must make offenses, albeit small enough ones to maintain attraction. 

Some examples:

* You text me, sometimes I don't text back.

* I cancel dates 1/3 of the time.

* I make plans with multiple people and only go to the one that I'm most interested in that day.

* I won't buy you a birthday gift.

* I won't buy you drinks.

* You'll try to get me to open up, and I'm not going to.

These are all not just confidence traits, but decidedly anti-social traits that we learn from youth are what ""assholes"" do.

And it drives women wild.

Enlightened women mention they like the combo of asshole and gentleman. I agree that's the most attractive way to go about life for a man. But don't forget, to be both, you have to be an asshole at least some of the time.

It's not enough to be confident. You must convey your value by showing you have options, and you cannot do so explicitly. ",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,True,t3_1c7khz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1c7khz/on_confidence_vs_asshole_and_on_nice_guys/,

You all know this, hear this, but here's my real, personal encounter. Warning..long post, the whole cheating story...so you may get it how this works, how the girls get comfortable with the cheating act, even if they feel guilty at first, eventually they won't care anymore.

I was in my 2nd year of college, awesome year, lots of great times. I used to go to clubs 3 times a week(normal dance/house music clubs), I liked that...getting drunk, hitting on girls, all that shit.

I got used to hit on girls all night, sometimes I get them to my dorm or my friend's place for a nice good time, but very few, 1-2/month...I got more pussy after 2nd- 3rd dates. I did ok, better than many of my male friends, and was not about the look, I'm 5'8 tall, a bit skinny looking with small frame...but I didn't give a shit about anyone. I would get in a fight with 6'2"" guys even if I knew I would get my ass kicked(and I did, twice). 

Ok, so one night I spotted a cute girl entering the club with a chubby gf and stopped at a table full of betas. She had an innocent look, slim body, big breasts...a good 7.5(others said was &gt;8). I decided to go for her.

I approached few girls before so I was in my state..I waited a few minutes to settle on the table and went after her, just after she got up to get a drink. I don't remember quite a lot about that night, but I know that she was surprised when I hit on her. I gave her a good time, convinced her to dance, all that shit...and tried for the close with no luck. All that time she mentioned she has a 2 years boyfriend who loves, and I just said ""let's have a good time, feel the moment, it's your night"" and stuff like this. When dancing and things got a bit hotter, I tried kissing her few times, but nothing. However, I managed to get her number.

A few days later I texted her something like ""I had a good time"", can't remeber well. She responded positively. I ran some attraction routines, push&amp;pull, C&amp;F and she got hooked. Finally I said something: ""Maybe I'll run into you in the mall"" (she said she has some stuff to do there). She replied ""maybe, but you know, I have a bf"".

I knew when she would be there so I got there and texted her ""Where you are"". She responded...few minutes later, we met. Her eyes were glancing and acted shy. I could easily tell how attracted she was(and YET she had a boyfriend she ""loves"").

We talked about half an hour than we went outside the mall and went to a little park. Initially she said she needs to go home(only her rational thoughts), but I convinced her to stay few more minutes(not too much convincing work though). 

I made some cold reading, played some mind games...she was so excited. I started light kino from the beginning(very important) and escalating. She was more and more comfortable with me, not mentioning about her bf at all. about 30mins-1hour later, I played my usual kiss close routine and even if she lightly resisted first time, second time she couldn't, she wanted it. The reaction was unexpected, her legs were shaking and she starred into my eyes saying 2 times ""why did you that? You shouldn't have done that!"" . I stayed few minutes with her, not talking much, she was weird, and I went home. The girl had such an innocent look and great body, that I couldn't let her go.

The next 2-3 days I had no contact with her, when suddenly I got a text mess from an unknown number. It was her...she just bought a new sim card for her cell, just to text me(so the bf can't find out). She was telling me she feels guilty and we shouldn't see each other again, but she also told that she never felt so much attraction for someone.That was her telling ""don't let me stop you"" ... Of course, we met again. We made out pretty heavily. She got so horny when we made out that she was moaning...

On the 3rd date she was accepting the affair, she knew it's wrong but it felt so fucking good to her. However, I acted like a don't give a shit, I had a fuck buddy I was banging pretty often and occasional sex with my ex...so for me it was just interesting, nothing emotional. Finally, she allowed me to put my hand in her pants and rub her pussy, after initial resistance and about 30 mins of make out...she was so wet. We were in a public place, on another park, at 10-12pm, but in a quiet place. My first thought was to fuck her there, but I didn't want to ruin everything. However, I started fingering her and she started moan loudly....suddenly she said to me ""Let's go to my place"". She wanted it so bad.

We took a cab and got to her apartment. Her room mate was not home. On the whole drive to her place I maintain the sexual state, kissing her, bitting her neck stuff like that...I didn't wanted to fuck everything up because of LMR(last minute resistance).
On her place, we kept kissing, she was horny like hell(I've seen only 1 girl so horny, my that time ex, after a break of 2 months). I started undress her roughly, remove her bra with no resistance and the last resistance was her panties. However, the panties were all wet, she was moaning and still hold her hands on them, so I won't take off... Well, I turned her with ass up and put my condom while kissing her on the back. I didn't bothered to take the panties off, I just put my cock inside her. Fuck, in 2 minutes, she was moaning like hell. I started fucking her rougher, pull hair on doggy style she started screaming...she puts one hand on her mouth to not be so loud. I think she came 2 times.

After we finished, her face was gold. She was so fucking surprised, felt guilty but so satisfied in the same time. She repeatedly ""What I have done, What i have done"" almost crying. ""This was the one and only time"" and things like that. Guess what? 2 days after, she initiated the conversation again...my reply was ""Did you room-mate get back from home""..""no"", ""ok, i'm at you in 20 mins""...""Hmm...ok"". What's next you can figure yourself...lots of animal sex, cum in her mouth(she didn't make her bf a bj so far because she thought is disgusting....WTF? and she gets my cum all over her mouth saying that it tastes good...and women tell you should listen their words). After sex she admitted she was the best sex ever she had...I loved when she screams and uncontrollably shake his body when I fucked her hard.

After about 10 fucks I dumped her because I started to feel a bit attached and I didn't want that with a girl that cheated her bf in such way, a cheater always a cheater.

She was crying, got in a fight with his bf just to not feel so guilty about that, she wanted to dump him and so on. I made her realize it was just and ""escapade"" an adventure and she don't have to take it seriously. For a month I kept getting messages from her to come over, to meet, how much she thinks about me and so on. I never replied but she kept sending all those messages.

Another reason I was making this post is because I met up with her accidentally 2 weeks ago and we kept in contact a bit which made me remember all this. She was the same girl. She was still very attracted to me, she said how much I hurt her, how much she thought on me...just last year finally got over me. She also said how boring the sex was with her bf after me. For no surprise, she wanted to feel that fling again and started to flirt with me. However, I played beta(consciously), I said her I'm a good guy, that I don't appreciate what I did to her, basically I played the beta male game the 2 times we saw each other and talked.

Guess what? Her attraction got away...she even told me that: ""well, you're too nice and polite to me...like my bf"" (same bf, will get married next year) and since then, I haven't hard anything from her. 

The moral here: Even the most innocent looking, good girls, with few boyfriends and few sexual experiences which everyone thinks ""such a good girl, she's a keeper"" can surprise you pulling stuff like this. Begging me to fuck her hard, making bj and tasting my semen when she thought was disgusting and never done in her life (21 years old) even with her 2 years bf.......makes me think a lot about how women really are.

There are times, in fact, when you can take things that women say to mean exactly the opposite of what they’re saying and use it as a map to figure out your next move.

This isn’t to say you should never listen to a woman’s words. If she tells you to stop, of course you stop. But often her demeanor and body language say the exact opposite of the words coming out of her mouth. Being able to tell the difference is one of the best skills you can learn.

A few months ago, I started dating a girl I call paint-by-numbers girl because the words of protest that came out of her mouth gave me a guide for exactly what to do with her.

On our first date, I was aloof and dismissive, giving her very little eye contact. I would find out later that after the date, she told her friends, “**Me and him hate each other**.” Perfect.

I sent her a text the next day, which she responded to. And we met for a second date almost a week later. 

“Why did you meet me for a second date if you hated me on the first?” I would later ask her.

“You were charming over text,” she rationalized.

On the second date I was more interactive with her, turning the conversation very sexual. After two drinks in the bar, I decided to bounce her to another bar before heading to my place with her.

“C’mon,” I said in the middle of conversation. “I’m taking you to a bar that has pinball.” 

As we’re walking down the street, arm-in-arm toward the second bar, she blurts out, “**You’re not taking me back to your place, are you?**”

She could not have thrown up a bigger sign telling me exactly what to do. 

“Would I do a thing like that?” I said. Of course, I skipped the second bar and took her directly to my place.

When we got there, she said, “**I feel like you tricked me. I can’t trust you.**” 

“Good. You shouldn’t trust me,” I said as I started to make out with her. We would have had sex that night if she weren’t on her period.

On our next date, we’re in a bar. She tells me her plan. “**We’re not sleeping together tonight.**” I knew when she said that that we would sleep together that night.

It wasn’t long into the second drink that she asked me where my place was in relation to the bar. I didn’t even finish my drink before asking for the check.

Half an hour later, we’re naked in my bed getting hot and heavy. 

“**I’m a germaphobe so you’re not sticking that thing inside me**,” she says. 

As if commanded, I stand up, walk over to the dresser and grab a condom.

After sex she tells me, “All five of my friends bet that I would sleep with you tonight.” 

I laugh. “Your friends know you well.”

About a half hour later, we’re lying in bed and I stand up to go to the bathroom.

“**Are you kicking me out now?**” she asks. 

“Yes!” I say, smacking her on the ass.

This girl practically got me into bed by telling me the opposite of what she really wanted, every step of the way.

To be clear, she was not consciously gaming me. In fact, she found [my website](http://approachanxiety.com/) a week or two later and freaked out about it. Of course, that didn’t stop her from dating me or even having a casual relationship with me.

One of the important things she said early on was, “**I don’t do casual relationships.**”

At first, I kind of believed her, simply because she came on so strong emotionally. But I did what I normally do, which is maintain a casual relationship for the first few weeks, and she eventually fell into line with it, as most women do, even though most claim they do the opposite.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,True,t3_1hixdt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hixdt/seduction_tactics_women_saying_the_exact_opposite/,

When I asked why? she didn't really give an answer, contributing it to the speaker's mannerisms and comedic style (isn't to everyones liking but I personally enjoyed it).
I didn't think it constituted ""hate"" though. 

I pushed it further and brought up if it was because he was making women out to seem foolish and illogical, playing games to test men. I know for a fact that she has demonstrated this behavior before with her previous boyfriends and male friends (in reality majority of women do). She was hesitant to agree but she reworded it and ended up confirming. 

She ended up saying, ""A guy shouldn't know this much about women, it's wrong."" 

Me: ""But don't you always say how you want men to understand and ""just get it?""

She simply said it was ""still weird"".

In my opinion these videos make women uncomfortable as it reveals to the WIDER population of men the mind games and shit tests women use to somewhat manipulate men. The more guys know about these tests and how women think, the more women lose power in relationships.

Women want that romantic fantasy, where the guy will do anything for her, going to all lengths to be with her. It shouts entitlement and leaves the majority of men confused and scratching their heads when their gf is angry at them for seemingly no logical reason. Stuff like:
Saying she's ""done/over with the relationship"" after a fight. Then getting angry when the guy takes her words at face value and doesn't fight tooth and nail to be with her.

Thought it was all very interesting hearing a woman's reaction to the video. Points and perspectives I wouldn't have realized had I not recently started reading TheRedPill.

I like promoted Medium articles in general, but this is piss poor. Strong on metaphor, poor on real data (probably because there isn't any):

&gt; Let’s say that all the jobs in tech are in a room on the second floor of a building. There are a limited number of people that can fit in that room, so only the people who get there the fastest can have the jobs (in the metaphor “fast” subs for “most skilled”).

&gt; In order to get to the second floor, there are a set of escalators, one that goes up and one that goes down. The escalator moving up is full of men. There is no room for women on this escalator. Many women see this challenge as insurmountable and go home.

&gt; Some deeply committed and resourceful women revert to using the escalator moving down. These women have to haul ass up the escalator just to make any progress.

Today I discovered just how much they will edit your point to serve feminisms purpose.

I wish I could say I had a recording of the original interview, however through skype and sound recorder I managed to screw up the actual ""what you hear"" recording.

Here's a copy of my notes from the interview that I prepared/edited/used during the interview.

----------
Let's accept the premise that there is a level of crudeness in the tech industry, why would only women have the right to be offended? Would men not also find crude material offensive and find equal struggle? I grew up in a christian home, I am just as offended as any woman would be at crude jokes. If feminists believe in equality, I have the same right to be offended that they do. Why aren't we seeing an equal number of men avoiding the tech industry?

***

First of all, it's important to make a distinction. Not everything that offends women is misogynistic. It's an over-used term and misses the point entirely.  So let's just get this out of the way. A lot of people in the tech industry love women. A lot are married. A lot are dating. There's no reason to believe there's a systematic hatred of women in tech. 


**

Well let's ask the real questions, 

1. Do women feel unwelcome in the tech fields?
2. Are men purposefully causing women to feel unwelcome?

I think I'd like to address the second question first.

Let's say a woman decides to work in a coal mine. The first day she arrives she finds men in dirty clothes with dirty faces going down into the pits and 

doing hard strenuous labor. She may not prefer to get dirty- she might find that she can't wear her shoes of choice. She might hear men making jokes she 

finds offensive. She might find herself physically incapable of even completing the work.

But this isn't uniquely a female problem is it? I grew up in a christian home, I can find offcolor jokes offensive. If I'm weak, I may find myself unable to 

perform the duties required. If I don't like getting dirty, I'm out of luck.

So do I feel welcome? Well maybe I don't. But does that mean they're discriminating against me? Does that mean they should change how they work?

There's this myth going around that nobody should feel uncomfortable at work. I disagree. First day on the job, you should be nervous. Worried about deadlines or not being able to accomplish the task? That should make you very uncomfortable.

Obviously a good employer should ensure that employees are not mistreating other employees, and sexual harrassment is one such mistreatment. But when you have people complaining that it doesn't ""feel"" welcoming- well that's subjective and changing that is an unattainable goal with moving goalposts.

I think one issue is that women over-estimate how comfortable men typically feel in new environments.

Whether it's a new job, the army,  or gym class in grade school, for men it can be extremely uncomfortable until they are able to prove themselves to the group and make themselves a place. It can be daunting, and down right difficult. Often times I feel discouraged in my endeavors, like I should quit.. but I push on anyway- despite not necessarily feeling welcome.

And I think therein lies the problem. Women are offended because when they break into a primarily male group, they assume they're being treated harshly because they're women. But in reality they're being treated the same way these men would treat other men. Is that discrimination? I think that's the opposite! If they want equality, they have to want what it feels like.

That's how you become successful. It's not a boys club.

Then I discovered this subreddit recently and it has been an eye opener, I really believe I understand women and myself much better now.

I couldn't understand how women could just stop loving men, I got dumped three times by women I loved dearly, all of them promised me to never leave me and I fell for it everytime. I became resentful and bitter and even downright hateful, as I slowly realised what I now know as Briffault’s Law. It was pure torture for me everytime I got dumped, I nearly killed myself the third time it happened, couldn't cope as reality became hell for me.

Luckily I no longer believe that I'll ever find the right one, but if I were to be in a relationship again, I'd know that she'll only stick around for as long as she benefits from it. Before I ate the red pill, I accepted the buddhist view that attachement leads to suffering, so this red pill philosophy only reaffirms it for me. I don't hate women anymore because I don't need them (or one woman) to be happy anymore. I define my own worth and what is important to me, sure it's lonely but with time it's surprisingly easy to cope with. I've come to accept that I'll be lonely for the rest of my life, it doesn't scare me anymore as I feel that I'm in charge of my life, with a mindset that nobody else can dictate. I don't hate women anymore because I do understand them better, there's no need to hate reality and how it all fits together, it's a sad waste of life if one chooses to react negatively to what you can't change. Women are gonna women, deal with it.

At my first venue of choice I’m enjoying a drink and watching soccer when someone sits down next to me. As a pretty heavy introvert I’ve been attempting the habit of talking to as many people as possible, even if the intent isn’t to pick up (most solo guides I’ve read have recommended this). The person to take a seat next to me is a woman roughly ten years my senior and not much to look at but I strike up a conversation because why the hell not. About five minutes into the conversation she begins to lay some heavy shit testing on me, constantly calling me smug, pretentious and a horrible actor (on account of the way I carry myself more so than the things I had said up to that point). Throughout the entire bombardment I held my ground very casually, even comfortably agreeing and escalating her accusations even more.

Her: I can tell by your eyebrows that you’re really pretentious.

Me: Blame my genetics, not me.

I’ve been shit tested before, but never to this extent so it was a great scenario to test my limits even if I had no intent on gaining her primal interest. When all was said and done we were both laughing, had come up with nicknames for each other and were continuing our general conversation as we did initially before I paid my tab and took off to the next bar. 

The Lesson for fellow beginners:

No matter how heavy a woman lays shaming/shit-testing on you, stand your ground confidently (even if it seems you’re being absurd and inflating your ego too much). Even if it’s with someone you have no interest in banging you’ll earn their respect for being someone who’s really comfortable with himself.

I have some fantastic little nuggets you usually never hear from women, as you always get told the bullshit, and the same old rubbish you read in Vogue on ""tips to keep guy happy"" and all that jazz.

I decided to meet up with 3 seperate women (1 on 1), who I know have a strong thing for me, and I told them all about the red pill. I told them what sort of man I am, how I dont tolerate bullshit, and how I go for what I want. They all incredibly came out with some interesting points individually on what keeps them hooked;

1. ""You're arrogance is just sooo, ahhhh, it turns me on"" - Strange really, Im assertive, and cocky, but she interprets it as arrogance. How many times are the beta's told ""I hate arrogance"" by women? So they introvert and try and be shy guys?

2. ""You just don't care"" - Carefree right? Ofcourse Im human, I WILL have emotions, but I don't care. I'm of the attitude that I will walk away and say goodbye right there and then, I feel no remorse. I've walked away a dozen times and kept my dignity. Not actually caring if I ""fail"" or succeed with any woman, is what keeps this lot at bay.

3. ""You make me laugh like nobody else"" - Probably because I speak my mind. I will ridicule her, and myself if need be. Not in a clownish sort of way. But its better to laugh, then to sit there and talk about problems?

4. ""You always have an answer,"" - No hun, I'm just logical.

5. ""I love it so so much when you talk dirty to me"" - A necessity. Roosh said ""If you aren't being creepy, it means you aren't trying hard enough.""

I suppose draw from it what you will, but its great to actually get feedback that is the truth, and isn't sugar coated or worse covered in fairy dust and shat out of the arse of the 30 year old cunt who sits drinking frappuccinos all day in her office in Vogue in the ""problem section.""

Just another minor note, I would also advise to stick away from crazy. At all costs. I certainly did. She agreed to have casual sex, and then said ""but I dont want casual I want friendship, but sex but nothing"" swear that was her text. She also said how ""I get asked out all the time, when I left you last week, a guy in car pulled over, smiled and drove away, I am hot!""

Our mission is to get the Media to finally take responsibility for our feelings and our self-worth.

We must protect women from any negative messages in the Media because we will naturally adopt them as our own beliefs — immediately, and without question.

When we are bombarded with images of women who are prettier than us, thinner than us, and sexier than us, it makes us feel as though there are women in the world who are prettier than us, thinner than us, and sexier than us.

The Media needs to change it's message, so that when it tells what to believe, our new beliefs will make us feel good.

The Media needs to tell us that self-esteem can come from things other than beauty, and it needs to do so by using ugly women that make us feel beautiful by comparison.

The Media needs to start telling *all* women that they are beautiful, so that women can finally stop conflating beauty with self-worth.

The Media needs to grow up, and finally take responsibility for how we feel about ourselves. 

The Media has abdicated this responsibility to us for far too long. 

It's time for the Media to take responsibility for what we believe, and start telling us exactly what we want to hear.

---

As a member of GiveMeSelfEsteem™, I often ask myself: How long must I wait for the Media to step up?

How many more years do I have to keep on living with no self-esteem and no self-worth before the media will finally let me have some?

Why must the Media continually insist on perpetuating the illusion that there are women in the world who are thinner, prettier, and sexier than I am? 

How am I supposed to feel validated if men don't pay attention to me?

How will men pay attention to me if the media does not stop showing them women who are sexier than I am?

How am I supposed to feel pretty if there other women out there who feel prettier?

How am I supposed to feel thin when there are women in the world who are so much smaller than me?

How am I supposed to feel sexy if the Media doesn't tell me I am sexy?

---

Let me be clear, Media. *You* are responsible for how I feel about myself. Not me, not my partner, not my friends, not my family — YOU! 

That's why I'm so upset about the things you make me think, feel, and believe. And that's why you need to change in order for me to feel better about myself!

Only you have the power to decide what I believe.

What do you expect me to do? Just decide willy-nilly to believe something other than what you tell me? To all the sudden just choose to believe the opposite? Who do you think I am?

I don't decide what I believe, that's *your* job!

---

I am upset because I wanted to be healthy, but you told me to develop an eating disorder. And what other choice did I have?

I am upset because I wanted to be happy, but you told me to be depressed. And what other choice did I have?

I am upset because I wanted to have self-esteem in spite of my body, but you still haven't given me any.

I am upset because I wanted to have self-worth in spite of my looks, but you still haven't given me any.

I am upset because you are responsible for what I believe, and I don't believe I am beautiful.

It's not my favorite, but it happens, and it's expected. Some leave sooner rather than later, but eventually the feminine imperative forces it's ugly head into all interactions and reminds women ever-so-subtly that I am not giving them ultimately what they desire (or think they desire) which is monogamy.

Funnily enough, if I ever did cave to their desires, I don't think they'd like what they ended up with. It's a pull and it gets into everybody's mind at some point. Why have fun? You need to either lock this down or walk away.

Relationship strategy isn't discussed enough on here, so I thought I'd write a little bit about my relationship strategy. Somewhere around here you'll hear from Softharem who advertises a similar approach.

**The Rotating Soft Harem**

I have ditched monogamy as an effective mating tool. As per Rollo's advice, I have decided the *only* weapon in my belt is spinning multiple plates.

The dating market is stacked seriously against men, it's difficult to have any sort of value at all. If we left women to their devices, they would see to it that men have no value in the dating market so they could be free of the shackles of liking any of them. (though they would express extreme concern because they want *good men*).

The only rebuttal that I see fit is to keep a rotating harem of around three women at a time. It satisfies the plate spinning requirement, enables self-actualization of value in the market, and keeps you from giving away the only item that gives you value in the market- your commitment.

I have learned through trial and error that what we understand as monogamy is only to benefit women. They would like the security and validation that you are a one-gal-man. They, however, will never stop shopping. Hypergamy will insist that they continue fitness testing you as a mate, as well as analyzing all other potential mates. It's only a matter of time before another more apt branch is found.

To take your commitment from you, they minimize your options and strategy, and maximize their own.

So we introduce the rotating soft harem.

**My Approach**

First of all, I am up front with the fact that I will not be exclusive.

You don't start off on that note, however. Most women will date for a month or two before having ""the talk."" It's programmed into them, they *need* to know. They'll have the talk when they're sufficiently in love with you.

I approach it very simply: ""I'm sorry, but I'm really just not in a place in my life where I'm ready to enter into a relationship. I really like you and love spending time with you. I would like to keep seeing you, but I understand if you don't.""

Some decide it's worth it. Others don't.

I don't talk to them about other harem members, but it becomes implied by the lack of exclusivity. 

I attempt to keep around 2 - 3 at a time, replenishing when one drops out.

Most girls seem to do alright in it for about 3 - 4 months after ""the talk."" I've had a few last over a year.

**But .. monogamy!**

After learning what happens to me with extreme oneitis, after understanding that without fail- these women will swing to another branch, I have learned that this is the new mating strategy demanded by women. Monogamy is dead. 

It's tough, because the imperative becomes very convincing, and at times I lose sight of my goals and why I set them. The demand for commitment and monogamy can be strong and seemingly innocuous. *Maybe* this one's different.

Do not surrender that freedom, it is the only bargaining chip you've got. Once you surrender it you will find yourself at the mercy of the woman who is most certainly *not* in it for you.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,True,t3_1fpxfo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1fpxfo/the_rotating_soft_harem_this_one_goes_out_to_all/,

&gt; Jayne Dallas, a senior studying advertising who was seated across the table, grumbled that the population of male undergraduates was even smaller when you looked at it as a dating pool. “Out of that 40 percent, there are maybe 20 percent that we would consider, and out of those 20, 10 have girlfriends, so all the girls are fighting over that other 10 percent,” she said. 


There you have it, straight from the horse's mouth. All the single women on campus are chasing the top 10% of men.

(The bolded parts are verbatim; as soon as I had heard these words, I wrote them down so I could share it here.  The rest is summarized/rephrased.)

I work with all women.  100%.  They are all relatively young (20s-30s), married, white, upper-middle-class, all health care professionals with good degrees from good schools making probably $30-$40/hour with full benefits.  They all have at least one kid, most of them have two.

Their husbands range widely in all those demographics (except race; they're all white).  Some are, relative to me, balling out of control, making upwards of $100,000/year.  Some are working-class stiffs making $15-$25/hr at blue collar jobs with no post-secondary degrees.  Some are comfortable small business owners living from boom to bust with enough extra to be able to take their broods out to Red Lobster each Friday night and still pay the monthly mortgage bill.

One is unemployed.  This is his story.

This guy found out he had a congential defect (not sure what exactly) and has to have a heart transplant and has already undergone several surgeries. He is pretty much bed-ridden until that happens.  So his wife has been coming to work completely exhausted from taking care of the kids and house by herself AND working 40+ to pay for their daycare bills, private school tuition bills, and THREE, YES, COUNT 'EM, THREE mortgages.   At first I felt sorry for her.  Then this conversation took place today where they were bashing the shit out of him for being a lazy father snd husband and that his wife deserves better.

Now I'm comfortable enough with these women that I felt safe stepping in to come to a brother's defense.  I said, ""Cmon, don't be so hard on him; the guy has a heart defect, there's not much he can do.""  They didn't attack me. They did something worse. 

They metaphorically left him to die, when one of them justified their criticism with this gem: **""Well, I mean, he needed to have saved more for emergencies or whatever, 'cause, like, if you're a mom, you need to be able to not work whenever you want.**

As their dumb-ass heads all noddded in assent I died a little.

So that is that.  If you fail, you die.  That's what being a man is all about.

And you're wife will shit on your corpse at work with her friends.

OP is a guy sick of women only being turned on once he tells them he's a surgeon.

Top comment (above link) is a rationalization - saying she likes doctors because he helps others.  Then the next sentence lists their perceived 'alpha' qualities and compares them to LAWYERS.  Now, nothing against lawyers, but you would have a hard time arguing a lawyer is out there saving lives.  Doctors and lawyers have in common: High pay, education, and stressful, time-consuming work. Sound familiar?

On that same note - I'm a scientist.  I work with advancing cures for breast cancer and heart disease.  When I tell a woman this I get a blank stare. I have as much education as a doctor (plus I continually further my education) and a highly demanding job.  But although I could argue what I do helps more people than a surgeon helping one person at a time, my pay is an order of magnitude lower than a surgeon. That's the biggest difference between a scientist and a surgeon.

The concept of romanticism has been corrupted into the polar opposite of it's original definition and it's pretty fucking ridiculous.  Romanticism is a concept that was rooted in masculine thinking.  To romanticize something is to take something with little or no context and breathing your own context into it through allegory and philosophy to make others understand your state of mind and emotions.  I know just saying 'emotions' here can cause a big stir, but emotions are a good thing.  It's more than crying, shouting, and being tricked into irrationality.  Emotions fuel competitiveness, pride, reflection, domination, and many other masculine traits.

Seeing a man hunt down an animal, or slay an enemy, or build something from scratch can be turned into romantic allegories of conquest with a deeper philosophical meaning (creation, dominion, rivalry) than the raw act with no context.

That's all romanticism is, and I'll say it again; taking something with little context and giving it your own context to portray your point of view to others.

This is originally why women were attracted to romanticism in the first place.  It took the tales of common man and turned them into tales of good vs. evil, conquest, sentimentality, and strife.  

Somewhere along the line 'romantic' went from allegory to simply appeasing women.  Things that are 'romantic' in modern convention are exclusively female things, and the act of a man being romantic is nothing more than a man humiliating himself or portraying weakness with an end result of giving some harpy that satisfaction that she has power over you in some way.  It's ri-fucking-diculous.

Is anyone else bothered by this?  I think being romantic is awesome.  I like taking all the cool shit that happens to me day-to-day and then retelling it to a group of people in a way that makes them fully understand.  Through allegory, example, timed dialogue, the 'big picture'.  People never forget who you are.

Yet some bitter hags have the nerve to tell me I'm 'not romantic'.  Wine, chocolates, hearts, and all that shit isn't romantic.  It has a clear context; ""obey the pussy"".  The cliche 'romantic' acts and gifts and dates have no metaphor or thought behind them BECAUSE they are CLICHES.  Anytime a chick brags to another chick ""Look what (insert nancy-boy here) did/bought me! Isn't that ROMANTIC?"" translates to ""Look at all the hoops this kid jumps through to appease me!"".

In fact, I prefer it, but I don't tell the younglings that, because it would DHV them too much and make them realize what I truly value them for: looks; non-beef flaps pussy; compliance.

I was out with a girl I used to bang when she was 19. She always comes to visit when she's in town. She's been travelling, working on her floundering career and trying to whore it up. Everytime I see her, she gets a little older and a little less attractice. She dropped a bomb on me the other day. ""So I'm thinking about settling down and getting married. Are you seeing anyone?"" I say yeah, actually, I'm dating a few girls. All in the 18, 19, 20 range. She gives me an incredulous look. ""You really shouldn't be dating girls that young! Remember when you were that young?? You weren't ready for a relationship back then! You should be dating women your own age"". She then goes on to tell me about the guys who have fucked and chucked her in the last year. Always with a ""but we knew it wouldn't work out, so we mutually ended it...""

- stayed in a hotel, banged the guy a few doors down for months out of convenience

- banged a co worker for a while on a temporary assignment

- banged an army officer who was touring her area

And now she's ready for my providence [and is visibly upset that she's not getting it](http://imgur.com/lThMjUP,Ea7GTKi,twoKsG0,qg2cypg#0)

Fact is, 8 years ago, when she was 19, I was laying the D on her. It was great, she was fresh and I was okay with being there for her, but she wanted to ""experience things"". I'm now 8 years older, and still layin pipe on 19 year olds. This is how the world actually works. I don't mind talking to hot hot young things and listening to them talking about bubble gum and shopping in between fucks. It sure as hell beats being the last one on some older broads carousel ride, and listening to them talk about their liberal dreamworld. Normally I still bang this chick when she's around, but last night, I knew there was no way I was even gonna get it up if she came over. Her vag is now a prolapsed outtie. She's fucked any manner of cock all over the place in the name of equality and empowerment. Her looks have all but faded :( really tragic because she used to be so nubile... and here I am, entering SMV prime, with plenty of options that are hot as hell, and a little bit nervous about getting it on because of inexperience. This is the market I go for.

The future looks really bleak for the aging carousel rider. [I see it with my own eyes](http://imgur.com/lThMjUP,Ea7GTKi,twoKsG0,qg2cypg#2) and I have been de-sensitized to all manner of feeling sorry for them.

I have game, money, fitness. Things that men acquire with age that make them irresistable. They have a squandered youth, alpha widow memories, and the strongest sense of entitlement imaginable. 

""Buy this broken, used lamp at twice the price of a brand new lamp! You should really man up and stop using those new lamps... HEY MAN UP, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME!""

It's one thing to discuss the principles of SMV on this forum. Its another matter entirely to see how the mighty have fallen. All of her best eggs have been bled out. Unlike us men, who generate new sperm every day of life, these women have a fixed amount of eggs, and the older the eggs get, the more likely they are to produce unhealthy babies.

We all know the reason why brothers and sisters shouldn't procreate right? The genes are much more likely to produce birth defects. When eggs get older, they are also much more likely to produce borth defects. The reality is, when a woman passes the 32 year mark, she has the same chance of producing an autist or a downs baby as a healthy 18 year old would if she reproduced with her blood brother. Its not the vaccines that cause autism, ladies, its your aging eggs.

As always, do your squats and deadlifts, find some meaningful work and keep improving your SMV. The hot chicks I score now are infinitely better than when I was their age because of sexual economics. Its hard to believe, I know I wouldn't have when I was younger, but seriously... becoming a man and embracing the masculine qualities that make one changes the whole dynamic. I read an article on the front page of Macleans while I was at the dentist which read ""Women, man up- the way to having a powerful career is to act like men"". This shit gets published and sold to women... unbelievable.

So often in your life, you're told what a ""good man"" is, about being a nice guy, endlessly sacrificing your needs for others, not objectifying people or making anyone feel uncomfortable etc.

Then you actually start reading about some of the men most idolized by our society (rock stars and other musicians), and shit starts to break down. Jazz great Miles Davis, cynically used women, beat them, and pimped them out to support his drug habits...still a hero to millions. R Kelly? The Rolling Stones? Not endorsing these particular behaviors, just pointing out that, next time someone attempts to shame you, they've got some rock star they look up to  that doesn't get judged, because....well they're a rock star.

In my book, if society accepts a behavior from a musican, they can damn well accept it from me.

Thus was born The Musical Standard. **I refuse to be held to any standard that society won't hold a musician to.** Next time someone is judging you for dating a woman half your age, remember that the same woman that is critiquing you worships some musician doing the same damn thing - she just thinks YOU deserve less respect.

I thought about replying in the comments, but then figured I'd make a whole post about it. More readers, more comments, and.. more sympathy? :p

I swallowed the _bitter_ red pill about women in late 2009, at the age of 32.5, and I've been trying to cope with it ever since. But see, here's the _special_ part: I never had a girlfriend before that year. 

Some time earlier, I had decided that since there were no ""natural circumstances"" (school etc) for me to meet women anymore, I'd just have to talk to them _somewhere_. Like, in public places.

So, one day, I spent like 30 minutes mustering up the courage to ask out a HB9 working at a shoe shop. She reacted in a very positive way, which made me think I could do it again too. Some time later, in early 2009, I asked out a HB9 hairdresser and actually managed to date her for a while. She was 30 and looking for a provider though, so I didn't have to have any idea what I was doing.

But yeah. I can't help but be angry and bitter about having been without a woman all my life, just because of the bullshit brainwashing we all receive while growing up. I was always a genuinely nice guy, and _seriously_ puzzled by what the _fuck_ I was doing wrong on dates and so on, because I just couldn't get anywhere with women.

The idea of women wanting a kind, gentle, smart and funny guy really does make (common) sense. That's why it's so fucking confounding when you don't get anywhere even though _you should_.

Sooo.. How to cope with Reality? That is the question. It's not only Women either, but for example.. Human Nature, Economy, Islam, Governments, and so on. The world we all grow up to believe in is _such_ a fucking _scam_.

RE: 

http://www.rooshv.com/the-manosphere-is-lost#comments

Roosh is being uncharitable to his fellow men here. He is essentially saying that the only opposition to feminism he cares for is that from those men who ""game"" endlessly. Let's be honest here, though. ""Game"" and ""PUA"" is stuff that is significantly easier to pull off if you already find it easy to pull off a charismatic personality or have been blessed with good looks. A lot of men who are aware of the manosphere do not have these qualities. They are, in fact, bitter sexual losers as a consequence of the sexual revolution allowing desirable men to hoard female erotic capital.

The Mark Minter story is, really, not very surprising when you think about it. At the end of the day, no matter how much you rail against the marriage racket and how men are screwed by it, there remains the fact that men yearn for the sexual companionship and company of women. For Minter, the price of maintaining the consistency that Roosh demands would have been loneliness, which ultimately proved unbearable for Minter, as it would, really, for any human being.

Yes, Roosh, the manosphere is full of a lot of sexual losers. They are the consequence of men like you who jump from woman to woman, or date multiple women simultaneously. This is, in fact, a zero-sum game. Your win is their loss. Conservative societies, by encouraging women to be modest and to save themselves for the man they marry, were nudging their societies towards a form of sexual socialism where every man finds a partner. Roosh -- the freedom YOU enjoy to easily sleep with multiple women ALSO means the freedom of women to reject, in their most beautiful years, a great deal of men in preference to dating a subset of men. 

OF COURSE the manosophere has in part significantly been driven by ""loser"" men. I'd argue that so has the entire PUA industry in fact (the gurus, of which Roosh is one, merely take advantage of these guys.) 

Who the hell do you think is buying your books Roosh? It isn't guys who find it easy to get laid. It isn't guys who are in love with your prose. It's losers who can't get laid vicariously living through you.

You should be free as a bird, flapping around, singing, full of joy with life. Women want to ****** the bird and throw it in a cage (cage = committment).

When birds try to fly into the cage, wouldn't you think something is wrong with that bird? After all, who wants a bird that WANTS to be in the cage? No, women want the birds that are FREE, WILD, and BEAUTIFUL. They want A GOOD CATCH. Good Catches do not fly into cages. Only wounded or needy birds do.

Women aren't complicated, our feelings just get in the way of what we WANT to do rather then what we SHOULD do. We want to rub their feet and build statues of them. We should demand respect and reward them only for good behavior.

True passion can only be achieved when the man is willing to walk away at a moment's notice. After all, if you say ""I love you!"" after a coffee date, then the passion is gone because you have shown that you will not walk away.

Flowers and gifts should be used as a REWARD, not as an item to BUY her affections.

[Long story. Really need some hardline perspective on GF cheating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ik1x5/long_story_really_need_some_hardline_perspective/)



Here's what I came up with:


* We know that female nature is essentially solipsistic.

* That means they're mostly concerned with how things and people affect them, be it physically or emotionally.

* In other words, their worlds begin and end with themselves.

* Since they have relied upon men for survival throughout the eons, women have a natural tendency to externalize responsibility for the things that affect their lives.

* Thus, they tend to place that responsibility upon the shoulders of men.

* Ideally, if one has responsibility, one should have power.

* Therefore, if you give in to a woman's frame, you become a tool for her to use. She has power, but not responsibility, while the opposite is true for you.

* The key then, when it comes to having women in your life, is to make them submit to your frame.

* I'd like to think about it as creating a sphere in which you, the man, is the master. This is an analogy for maintaining a dominant frame.

* You allow the woman and her little sphere into your larger sphere. Putting it another way, she latches onto you.

* While her sphere is part of your sphere, her actions affect you, ie the larger sphere which she is now part of. Thus, her actions rebound on herself, since she is essentially part of you.

* Therefore, if she does stupid things to you, they'll affect her in a negative way. If she does good things for you, they'll affect her in a positive way.

* Thus, she will adapt her behavior to serve you and your interests, since she doesn't want to ruin things for herself.

* Essentially, your perspective becomes her perspective.

* By working for yourself, you also work for her, since she is part of your sphere.

* Remember though, that power should be paired with responsibility. Since she is part of your sphere, you are also responsible for her.

* As long as the terms of the symbiosis are upheld, a good relationship is likely to ensue.

I don't want the burden of being too muscular, so I choose the only possible alternative:this small frail frame"".

I know its a self delusion. I know they don't honestly think they'll get to be Mr. Universe from going to the gym once and a while. I'm fully aware of it, so I won't spend a lot of time going into detail about how some chin ups and and squats and some bench won't actually turn you from Bruce Banner into the Hulk right away. What I will discuss though, is the fact that by *not* lifting *at all* you completely forego the possibility of getting *a little bigger*, *kinda big*, *not skinny anymore*, *growing into your body and bone structure*, *noticeably larger*, *sexually attractive*. There are so many small increases you can make, and you can stop your intense growth program and 4000 calorie a day diet whenever you are comfortable. Unless you make a professional career out of it, no one is going to get ""too big"". However, without putting in any work, all you can ever be is ""too small"" or skinny, or skinny fat.

It is one of man's great joys in life to lift heavy objects. It is a role you were born into. Short? Great! You will fill out quickly. A little muscle will look great. Tall? Great! Fill out your shoulders and get a strong back / legs. You'll glow.

The excuse ""I don't want to get too big"" is a humblebrag of sorts. Its like saying 'yeah, I *could* go to the gym once and a while, but the downside is that, haha, I'd look like Arnold Schwarzennegar afterward, and uhh, that could be inconvenient for me sometimes"". It sounds funny. It sounds like a cheap line that no rational person would use. But people actually look at me in the eye sometimes and say it. As a guy who has spent years in the gym and am comfortably fit, I just cannot contain the face palm.

Any skinny or skinny fat guys who don't want to lift should just say ""I'm okay with being a puny pussy boy"" and save the false bravado of ""I don't wanna get too big"". 

For anyone looking at getting into lifting, download Mark Rippertoe's Starting Strength program. He basically shows you the proper form of a great lifting program and then critiques a bunch of people on multiple sets of each excercise. This way you learn the common mistakes people make when they start lifting. You'll be able to step into a squat rack and know what you're doing and also what you're not supposed to do.

Lifting has a lot of health benefits. It will release dopamine into your body, which is the chemical that makes you happy. You literally will not have a say in the matter, your body will *make* you feel better. Drag your ass to the gym and you'll feel happier when you're done. Get your squat up. Do more on bench. You'll feel accomplishes. Internal happiness comes from accomplishment, and your acheivment in the gym is accomplishing something, and you get to wear your trophy on your chest and shoulders and arms and legs everyday. Its also a hell of a lot cheaper than any other hobby. It will also make you learn to eat healthier, cook a certain type of food and get better at time management. It is also great for pushing out bad habits. Smoke? You won't want to after a set of heavy squats. Drink? It'll affect your gains. Cut back. Have trouble with women? You will have a much easier time when you squeeze into a tshirt that used to be baggy on you.

1364919069.0,44,self.TheRedPill,1bit0x,"The Crunch - First post, it's pretty damn long, been lurking a while, if you fancy an uplifting read then have a look.",59,15,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1bit0x/the_crunch_first_post_its_pretty_damn_long_been/,"You guys have probably heard plenty of stories about Betas saying 'fuck this' and changing themselves to become Alphas. Well here's another one. Deal.

I had recently asked a girl I liked out. She was sweet, smart, funny and kind. All that good shit. I thought she'd been giving me vibes so eventually I plucked up some courage and went to ask her out. I see now this was my first mistake. I asked for her permission to have a relationship with her. I placed her value above my own and for this reason she shot me down and friend zoned me.

I was pretty cut up. The pattern had repeated itself again. This is generally how I had tried to manage my relationships until that point. I would fall for a girl, build her up in my mind, ask her out, get shot down. Ad infinitum. I spoke to my Dad about this. He said I shouldn't lose faith but instead wait for the right person and not get too cut up over individual failures. I still don't know what to make of this.

What made this example worse was the fact that I worked with two of her friends. Clearly they had been filled in on the situation. One of them asked me 'So you like to be dominated then?' I said nothing at the time but really I wanted to backhand her and violently penetrate her with a fucking corkscrew. She was soon promoted by my female boss. I'll come to the repercussions of this later. The second friend started to use me. Constantly making demands, piling work on me, making bitchy comments, grassing me in at every opportunity and generally trying to make my life difficult. My devastation deepened and I worried that I was going to lose it.

I had two jobs at this point, was working 60+ hours a week standard, felt seriously socially isolated, my confidence had gone negative and was troubled at my inability to find a girl to love. In short I was a mess, I considered myself a nice guy and couldn't understand why nothing was working out for me whilst other people were given everything they wanted without showing any visible effort or desire. Now I see this was depression, jealousy and blaming other people for my own faults and pussification. I was burning out because I was saying 'yes' to every demand made of me. I seriously considered suicide but realised that I couldn't hurt my family in that way.

Then strangely things started to fall together. I started to read Strontium Dog and began to identify with Jonny Alpha. A friend recommended reddit and I stumbled across TRP. My name is John so my mantra soon became 'I am Jonny Alpha'. I started doing weights, light toning stuff before moving on to body weight training. I began swimming, rock climbing and doing yoga. I stopped masturbating. I stopped smoking, cigarettes and weed. I stopped drinking. I stopped asking permission. I stopped apologising. I looked people in the eye when I spoke to them. I didn't lean into conversations. I asserted myself and stopped backing down at the first sign of trouble. I stopped fiddling with things and broadcasting my insecurities. I began using three phrases a lot; 'stand for what you stand for', 'call 'em like you see 'em' and 'hold 'em tightly, lose 'em lightly'.

Not that this was easy. I was pretty well conditioned. I was disgusted about what I was reading. I thought this was the most vile form of mysogyny imaginable. That you guys treated women like dogs, robotic dogs, robotic sex dogs. I was no feminist apologiser but until this point I had viewed men and women as roughly equal. I hadn't really considered the issue but decided to persevere and continue with an open mind. I still don't agree with everything I read on this subreddit, but then why should I. Every ideology is flawed and has exceptions. I began observing the world around me and soon found countless parallels that tied into TRP ideology.

Some examples I hear you cry... OK but only because I want to provide them.

1) One of the waitresses at work was leading on a chef, let's call him Tony. Really good fella in most respects but total beta otherwise. He gave her lifts to work, gave her preferential treatment, he was pretty much a puppy. At a staff do she got off with the head chef, another chef and the manager. They all found this out later. Tony continued giving her lifts and all that shit. She turned up at work a few days later with bites all over her neck. Nobody knew where they had come from. Tony allowed himself to be convinced that he had done them. He went from angry to supplicant in about two minutes. I wanted to go over and slap him but that would only have further lowered his standing. I might send him a link to TRP now thinking about it. He might just read this and see the parallels. Other girls when they hear about this say that she is 'liberated'. I thought there might be some slut shaming at least. But no, they think this is an OK way to act.

2) Another girl I know has kept a fella infatuated with her for years. It's sad to see now, like an addicted rat constantly pressing a lever, hoping for intermittent reinforcement. I confronted her and said 'You're never going to get with this guy because he makes it too easy. You treat him like a slave. Maybe you feel affection for him but at the end of the day you know what he wants. Why do you lead him on like this?' She smiled and asked where I'd suddenly got balls from. I told her to go fuck herself. She's been pestering me for a while now. I can't be arsed with her and that makes her want me even more. Kind of a role reversal.

3) A girl who I used to fancy years ago. I asked her out. She said she wasn't looking for a boyfriend. Within a week she was going out with an arrogant tosser. Ended up miserable because he treated her like shit and physically abused her. Did she actually enjoy being treated like this and just used me to vent the negative aspects? Who knows? Who cares?

4) Guys in LTRs becoming miserable because they acquiesced to their GFs who invariably betafied them, tied them down with babies, cheated on them with tossers. Too many examples here. Sex being used as a weapon to keep men in line. If a guy loses his job he generally loses his girl.

5) Hell even the language of sex. 'Grow some balls', 'Man up', 'Sexual conquest', 'Pulling birds' etc. Who fucks who? Guys fuck girls. Girls get fucked by guys.

6) Shit tests are everywhere. Don't back down from them. Be funny, slightly mocking and don't let them bite.

7) Just thought of another one. A girl I used to work with told me she had rape fantasies, was into BDSM and clearly had severe Daddy issues. Instead of pushing her against a wall, kissing her hard then fucking her with all my vigour I decided to respect her and try and build her confidence because I thought that's what a nice guy was supposed to do. Needless to say she soon lost all respect for me, started calling me 'pussy' and 'stupid' to my face, bad mouthed me to other members of staff and eventually started going out with a 35 year old guy who 'reminds me of my dad'. In the end I preferred the company of her dog to her. If only I knew then what I know now. She was pretty fucked up though. The dog's cool though. We still hang out. That was always because I wanted to though. 

So what is the point of this diatribe? Basically TRP community I want to say thanks for opening my eyes. It was difficult and it has taken a good three months to get through the denial parts of this. I know I have a lot more to develop, shit loads to learn but I feel happy. I've taken control of my life. I'm never going to fall for a girl before I know more about her, before I've kissed her, slept with her, met her family, seen how she lives and tested her to see if she is to my satisfaction.

If anybody has any questions or needs clarification don't hesitate to ask. I'm still not entirely there but every day I grow and strengthen. Now I am like steel; every challenge tempers me and makes me stronger. My biggest source of confidence is that I did this myself. Nobody helped me. I took advice from online but in my own life nobody was willing to lend a hand. I'm pissed at my Dad to be honest because he never took the time to explain these things to me. Perhaps he doesn't know. I don't know. Perhaps he can't articulate his own thoughts and behaviours in the manner that I'm attempting to here. There are issues between us that need to be resolved.

Oh yeah the repercussions of that bitch getting a promotion. The same day I quit my job. I did it in a calm and controlled manner. My bosses asked me to stay. They offered me a pay rise to stay, which has never happened before. Fuck it I was worth more than working for those gobshites. I've now completed a TEFL course. Going to Asia for the summer. I've got all my shit together for it. South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia or Malaysia wherever I get a solid offer and a contract first. Hell wherever I choose to go. I have interviews tomorrow. This is something I've always wanted to do. So now I have the confidence to just go and do it. I'm 25 this month. I regret that I hadn't taken TRP sooner. I would have been happier earlier in my life. But I'm still young and have plenty of time to practise before I hit my prime. 

Cheers guys.

Moved in with 2 male blue pill best friends and a HB7.8 who we kind of knew. 

The girl we lived with wanted a relationship with me but I didnt want to. I can do better for a relationship and would have no space if I was living with her, plus she is a far too promiscuous for my mid-to-long term relationship tastes. Cant really spin plates as im living with her. We have many mutual friends from college.

Heard/sort-of-saw her sleeping with a good friend of mine. Didnt care too much but she saw it as stopping us from being together, so needed me to believe it didnt happen. I pretended to not know for a while, but eventually she got me to say what I saw, as she knew i knew.

I did not know what getting gaslighted was. I thought such a concept was exclusive to horror films. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighted

The extent to which I had it was: she convinced me I had psychosis and had had multiple hallucinations. She convinced my closest friends and then growing circles of mutual friends that I was hallucinating. I went from a dominant of a large group to the butt of jokes. 

Thing is, it wasn't impossible that I had hallucinated the first time - I had been slightly stoned. I was 99.9% sure it didnt happen. That 0.1% was used against me.

Your brain cant put something behind you if you arent sure if it was a hallucination or not - your brain kind of has-to-know whats real in order to move on. I stayed strong (believing what i saw was real) for a month before I gave up and believed everyone. My sleep was fucked, I had nightmares, anxiety, and then after about 3 weeks started to get paranoia ('she must be a psychopath! look at all these things she is doing!'). Nearly lost my job. Bear in mind i had quit the weed the first sign of trouble so it wasnt that. Had to take a week off work to confront the fact it might not have been real. 

She did lots of little things, all the time. Everything here, no exceptions, was used:  http://www.rickross.com/reference/brainwashing/brainwashing11.html .

I really did suffer - I believed I was mentally ill after enough people told me I was for enough time. When people started making fun of me for it for their own relative status boost it was more hurtful than I want to admit, it was a personal experience like nothing else. You cant agree and amplify something like that (i now do though, after a leprachaun told me to). All my problems in life before I had overcome or simply moved on from, but you cant leave your own head.

Anyway it all fell apart when one of the later hallucinations had a second witness, and she moved out (still denies it, does not answer 'what about the second witness' - just creates more persuaive arguements that ignore it). 

Now NAWALT. But I generally learnt about the bad side of all people, and you guys seem like the right audience for some lessons I have unsubstantiated belief in.

------

**Lessons learnt:**

- A very good way to model people is to know about their upbringing. The girl's dad is the biggest loser (hate to say it...) i have ever met. Mother treated him like shit in front of us when we met them briefly. Her opinion of men growing up must have been that they are inferior... She has an older sister who looks nothing like her at all but they are supposedly related. My housemates were both completely blind to the most obvious lies and social cues, and i believe that might be something to do with them each being an only child. I would want to marry a woman with a strong father figure if I marry.

- Majority of men are truly oblivious to most obvious things, like how much attention people are paying to each other. Whereas to women is so very clear if you give 55% to her friend and 45% to her. And they all talk about this stuff to each other, but will lie about it to you, even if you demonstrate total understanding...

- My mother said: 'There are two types of liars in the world. Those who cant look you in the eye when they do it, and those who fully stand completely facing you, with wide open eyes, who confidently tell a lie'. This generalisation ignores many of the self-cognitive-dissonance methods, but for a massive cant-even-fool-yourself-into-justifying-it lie i think she is correct on there being two main types. The second one is lethal when used right! Even when warned of it it feels like your belief alters a little nudge.

- When somebody is trying to alter your memory they will get you to think back, and then will say 'are you sure that XXX didnt happen?' to which you answer 'im not sure' - and then suddenly before you know it the past is being altered. When you imagine seeing something differently enough times your memory of it gets altered each time. If you are sure you saw something and a suspicious person tries to make you recall a memory you can pretend to remember back by looking up and to the left, and then see what they try to do. 

- Look out for people making their ideas sound like they are your ideas.

- Dont trust anyone if they tell you 'you cant trust your eyes and your ears', no matter who they are, unless they are a medical professional. One of my best friends did this, a good honest man, but he ultimately was self-interested and fooling himself along with me.

- Blue pills will always side with an attractive woman in some way. Abundance mentality is needed not just for seduction.

- Your mother is a woman and she also will 'hamster' to protect her baby. Understand her incentives.

- When somebody says 'Are you calling me a liar?' when you happen to point out a logical inconsistency, they are (always?) lying.

- Do not always be rational. If you are 99.9% sure something is not a hallucination then say 100%, or else the person lying about 100% will come out on top.

- Learn to keep your mouth shut about subtle signals and lies you pick up, use them for your own judgement but dont tell other people. They will explain it away. When talking to other people only bother with the big heavyweight facts.

- When it comes to people treating you well / helping you out in a real time of need, nothing matters but increasing your value to them. The girl was attractive and I had become needy / needing people to believe in me, so i was much lower value, so they believed her as they didnt care about what really happened. If you become weak then they will leap at the chance to get above you, no matter what you have done for them in the past. Old friends with nothing to gain, strong good men, and some good caring women tend to be the exceptions. The people who still help you when you are weak and low value are your real friends, its worth faking low value once in a while to find out who stabs you in the back. 

- If you get ostracised it doesnt matter. Depression and anxiety were probably survival responses to stop our ancestors from being ostracised from their tribe, as it would have meant death, but in a modern city it doesnt matter.

A common complaint 'round these parts is that there are far too many Blue and far too few Red Pill Example posts. I wondered for a minute why this would be.

Then it dawned on me that subreddits such as /r/relationships, /r/AskMen, /r/AskWomen, etc. attract the lost and confused, those who have blundered and failed. We do not see more Red Pill Example posts prescicely because the people having Red Pill experiences are not confused and do not need the input of anonymous strangers. Their tales, our tales, go largely unreported. And as far as I know there is no /r/LetMeTootMyOwnHorn.

Furthermore, I'd wager that many of our reddest of red pill moments are rather mundane occurrences that we may feel aren't worthy of chronicling in a field report.

I, like /u/married_red, have lost an outlet to talk to people about TRP topics since getting married.  I have a lot of wisdom on the subject, and a passion for it.  I do not believe that marriage and TRP are mutually exclusive.  If anything, the mindset and techniques taught here can create a happy, lasting marriage.

I'm unsure if TRP can really save a husband who has been lost in beta-land for years, but I'd love to try to help someone through it.  I digress...

Here's a little about me:  I'm in my early 30s, have been married 4 years, and have no kids yet, but will be jumping off the kid cliff within the next couple of years.  I discovered TRP-esque techniques about 10 years ago, 4 years before I started dating my future wife.  When I met her, I was thoroughly finished with my transformation, so she knows nothing of the old me.  She was an overlord bitch in her previous dating life because she dated beta douchebags.  The power vacuum of a beta doormat boyfriend will always be filled by the woman.  ...and it's not pretty.  Ever since she started dating her first alpha (me), she's become submissive, and she highly respects me.

My married life is as kick-ass as married life could possibly be.  There is no fighting.  Her shit-tests are basically non-existant.  We have sex when I want to, and that includes doing it in all kinds of ridiculous places (does the walkway up to the Bellagio, while people are walking by count?).  Here's an anecdote I like to use:  Every recently married man finds out that older married men love to start up conversations with, ""So how's married life?""  I look them squarely in the eye and respond truthfully with, ""exactly the same as before we got married.""  That usually gets me incredulous looks from the old, broken down, beta married men.  ...but it's the truth.  She's still madly in love, and I'm still the hero.

It is indeed possible to get married, still retain your alpha status, not put up with any bullshit, and have an awesome time doing it.  It's hard for me to quantify just how much I play the game, because it's who I am now.  The insecure dumbass that I used to be is so long gone, and the person that busts women's chops and steals thunder is just who I am now.

I've discovered that women will live out a fantasy WAY longer than it's even remotely rational to do so.  For example, early on in our dating, I continually accused my future wife of stalking me.  She got into that fantasy so much that when we went to my 10-year high school reunion (she's nearly 5 years younger than me, so she stuck out like a sore thumb), she introduced herself as my stalker, not even saying her name.  People would ask her what she did for work and she would reply with, ""I stalk alpha_husband.""

Years and years later, when she does nice things for me, Instead of kissing her, I give her shit and accuse her of stalking me, and you can see it in her eyes.  She's still just as infatuated with me as she was so many years ago.

I don't think I'll ever get tired of flipping those switches inside her head and playing her like a fiddle.  She is still very concerned with her weight and looks (she hasn't gotten fat like the millions of wives who've left the dating market and let themselves go).  My wife feels like she needs to keep trying to be good enough for me.  This is EXACTLY where she should be.

For the past two months, I have gone out and gamed Thursday through Saturday for 5 hours minimum and let me say....the results have been astounding.  I have gotten more make outs from cold approach in two months than I did with my ex girlfriend that I dated for 8 months.  Pathetic, I know.  I have gotten a blitzkrieg of phone numbers and I am having a hard time managing them.  Sometimes I get the girls confused.  No lays yet.  I am still learning.

On top of gaming regularly, I have hit the weights like never before and the rush I get from it is unbelievably wakening.  I am more aware of my surroundings, the social dynamics of conversations, and I feel okay with telling people that I am busy and can't talk.  My boundaries are finally showing up and people are starting to take notice.  Last Saturday, I  met this beautiful girl at a club and we hit it off nicely, until she started with the shit tests, which was to be expected.  I was having none of it.  

* Her ""Your really cocky, I don't like cocky guys.""
* Me ""Have you ever been to Chicago?""
* Her ""What?""
* Me ""Pizza""
* Her ""Your not making sense...""
* Me ""Come here...just come..here.. *makeout.""


I am being more direct and TAKING what I want, and more people around me are starting to notice.  I am starting to cut the negative influences out of my life such as people, bad foods, the fucking tv, my wii, and alcohol.  My friend of 4 years is a negative shithead and I never had the balls to tell him off because he was the only friend I had and without him, I felt like I had no one to hang out with.  Not anymore.  I threw out the crappy foods in my house, unplugged the tv and sold my wii (Ill miss you brawl..).  

I am taking control and have fully taken the redpill.  This is something extremely hard to do, but I did it and I am starting to see the rewards.  

I will never resort to being a bluepill faggot anymore.  I am no longer passive aggressive.  I am active aggressive.

A lot has happened during the last month. Quite a bit.

We've started making some sizable waves. We're getting a lot more attention. I've been on international radio! We've been in the news! 

There's something I've noticed that's inescapable: we're doing something *right.*

There have been loud calls to censor us. There have been many tries. It's a common mantra- the one I hear over and over. ""You guys are disgusting women haters."" If we were simply the *joke* dissenters say we are... why are they paying so much attention to us?

It gives me great pleasure to know that those who disagree with us are going to great lengths to try to censor us. The forum trolling, the news articles, even the half-assed conversation on AskMen. It all points to one thing: Nobody has a rebuttal for TheRedPill. They have no tool in their arsenal but insults and shame. Because at the end of the day, people hate our ideas, but *can't quite pinpoint why.*

They'll squirm, they'll twist and turn, they'll feel deep anger and do everything to shut you up. But they have no real retort. They have no argument. All they can muster is to try to shame us into submission. *Not gonna work, ladies.*

-----

I'm happy that we've been able to grow, that so many other men have seen this and now have a welcome place to share ideas. I'm also happy to provide a place to be angry, a place to discuss ideas that might not be popular, a place where you won't face the standard shaming technique of feminists.

I had a few relationships but they were mainly centered around pleasing a woman as much as possible with gifts in exchange for sex. I saw nothing wrong with feminism in its current form. I also tried very hard to make people like me, at the cost of not being true to myself. If someone didn't like me I would try explain my actions to them and try to meet them halfway. If someone was offended by my actions I would apologize and then tip toe around that person. 

One day I got a huge bonus at work. For a while I was thinking about going on a trip or spending it on my girlfriend. But in the end I spent most of it on gear; Dbol and Test-E. My rational was I was always tired at work and test would help me be more energetic. Also it would help me push past my platues.

**Gear ended up changing my Personality**

There is a lot of talk about what it means to be an alpha male or a high test male. And you think you know what it means. However the only way to realy know is to add test into your system.

The first thing I noticed is I had more energy. I was more awake. A fog was lifted.
I needed less sleep to feel rested. I had a bigger appetite. I moved more quickly and with purpose. And with all that extra energy I felt like I could accomplish much more.

However there was a problem. I was energetic and more productive. But everyone still moved at their old slow pace. I wanted to do things I wanted to try things, I was more prone to taking risks and being impulsive. But everyone else was still their old slow selves: Hesitant, risk-averse, boring. I wanted to have deep conversations, question common wisdom. No one wanted to have a conversation if it wasn't 100% politically correct.  I grew bored with talking to most people. Those conversations felt boring and scripted.

My sense of self worth grew. I felt like a god. I saw myself as truly better than the slow masses, who were to afraid of new experiences. My relationship with my girlfriend changed. I wouldn't argue with her anymore. If she didn't like something about my personality than she could leave because there was a line of sluts waiting for me.

Women picked up on my confidence. I no longer had approach anxiety. I would walk up to girls because I was bored and I saw them as a source of entertainment. I would start stupid conversations with women just to be entertained by their reactions: 

Hey are you the girl from Craigs list?* NO!* I was supposed to meet a girl who looks just like you, 50 dollars right?
*Ew No do I look like a prostitute men are such pigs! Fuck You!* Oh im sory I was trying to buy a textbook and the girl said she was blond at about your height. Girl feels terrible starts apologizing. I get infinite lols maybe a phone number.

When I came of my cycle. I no longer had the same feeling of superiority. However the behavior patterns that I developed while being a high test stayed with me. Being an Alpha felt realy good, and there is no way I was willing to ever go back.

She said and I paraphrase, ""I don't mind if a man shows emotion. I just don't want to be with a man that is emotional. I think most guys agree they wouldn't want to be with an emotional girl.""

I've read this many times before and always nodded and moved along. However when I read it today it really bothered me because the majority of women are emotional. I agree a men shouldn't be blubbering all the time, but for some reason this rationale for why women don't normally except men's emotions really bothered me today.

Unless it can be verified from reuteurs, do not believe a single word. Because they are shit testing, or basically they are trying to make their lives more exciting.

Another example was, a girl I was seeing got bored at a party, and made up some shit that she was forced into a relationship with me and told all my friends and made a very awkward scene.

I took her outside and she told me she lied and said ""i was bored, so I created drama""

We are now making this mandatory. From this point forward, any link to another sub that doesn't include the np. subdomain will be removed immediately.

**What is no participation?**

No participation is a passive way of telling the sub you're visiting that you will respect their wishes not to participate. It disables voting, and often disables comments- if the sub has no-participation rules turned on.

**But what if I'm a member of that community?**

I assume if you're a member you can comment and vote, but that's up to the admins of reddit- who honestly haven't given moderators *any clear rules whatsoever*. We're basically just bumping around in the dark waiting for them to get angry and go on a banning rampage again. 

**How do I use it?**

Just add np (in place of www) to the beginning of your url.

This is the second time I've had this telling off by a friends girlfriend recently, has this happened to anyone else? It's usually after their boyfriend has shared something I might have been up to.

However, her body language was the most interesting part of the conversation.

I've been busting my ass to be as red pill as possible and just received a text that convinced me to share my experiences so far.

She was in a 5-month relationship with a beta guy (begging and pleading for her to stay).  She was still in this relationship when she went on OK Cupid and met me.  After I spend a week treating her like shit and constantly teasing her, she confesses this 'friend' is really her BF she's known for 2 years and dated for almost half a year. Proceeds to *CALL HIM WHILE I'M WATCHING ON SKYPE AND BREAK UP WITH HIM*.  I heard him begging and crying for this girl.

Fast forward a couple dates of me continuing to do my best RP game on her, and she decides she wants to give me her sweet 18-year-old virginity. So yesterday I take her back to my place and fuck her like crazy.  Hymen blood everywhere. It was glorious. She's still telling me how sore she is.

Although I haven't even had a date with another girl for a couple weeks, I haven't let her know this.  I remain aloof and seem occupied - she's constantly accusing me of sleeping with other girls, asking if I'm a player, etc.

So this morning she brings up the ""R"" word in her morning clingy texts.

&gt;You know I'd like a stable relationship at some point, right?

I burst out laughing. This girl has been lying to me since day 1. She even lied to me YESTERDAY about picking her up from her parents in a way that could have ended with police being called if I hadn't been so lucky.

I don't want to tell her I'm anti-relationship, I want to frame it around her many shortcomings with me.  I throw her lies back in her face. Her response verbatim?

&gt;I wouldn't lie if we were in a relationship.  I didn't tell you about (bf) because I was scared.  I feel like you weren't honest with me so I wasn't honest with you.  I needed to feel it. From now on I'll tell you the truth about everything you want to know.

Something that I constantly tell her - I never lie.  Ever.  That is the truth. I may exaggerate or be sarcastic, or withhold complete information, but I have never told her anything that was untrue.  She just wants to think that because that is her only justification for what she has done.

I'm currently trying to transition to getting her to provide more on our dates. Meanwhile she continues to beg for my dick and my commitment.

The author is of the previous generation of Afrikaners that tend to be religious and conservative. 

Translation:

While writing this letter, I, as a mother, need to hold back my anger. I see my daughter – a successful young woman – beautiful, soft, following God, yet still unmarried, just like many of her female friends.

I also see large groups of men, single, following God, successful. What I don’t see is young men taking young women out on coffee dates to get to know each other better. I only see large groups socialising together. I see men in their comfort zones – the choice is his to ask a girl out or not. In the mean-time the girls are waiting, uncomfortable, because after all it is the roll of the man to take charge, isn’t it?

I see young men, early in their thirties, that are flatmates, who sit on their porch in the evenings drinking wine [note: Afrikaans culture is big on wine so it’s perfectly acceptable for two masculine heterosexual male flatmates to sit on their porch drinking wine], and I ask myself “where is the women in their lives? Why sit on the porch with your flatmate and at this age still make no attempt to find the woman of your dreams?”

I see young women becoming increasingly independent. WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD MEN GONE?

I see women struggling to carry heavy shopping bags; I see women washing cars; I see women going to dangerous places to make a difference in the lives of others, and I ask myself: “Where is the men in these women’s lives? Where is the men that make women feel they are valuable? Where is the men that make women feel safe; where is the men that will jump at the opportunity to wash a female friend’s car?”
Did the word “expectations” become too taboo? Nobody wants to go on one-on-one coffee dates because “what if…”

What if an “expectation” is created? What if it doesn’t work out and it means the end of a friendship? They would rather socialise in a group where everybody is comfortable, where everyone can laugh and talk together about everybody getting older, just to go home again alone. Alone.

Did the successful, independent women become too intimidating to men? What happened to courage? What happened to men that want to ensure someone else doesn’t steal the girl of his dreams from him? What happened to moving on if something doesn’t work out? That’s life. I’m not saying break hearts everywhere you go, I’m just saying take a chance. What if the feeling is mutual and something beautiful emerges from an innocent coffee date?

What if…

Just as I manage to get the word ""two"" out of my mouth, some drunk douchebag gets between me and the girl I'm with, physically bumps me out of the way, and interjects, ""Make that four on this guy.""

I manage to keep my calm and think about the situation for a split second. I realize immediately that this guy is trying to interrupt my frame.

I know that, much as I'd like to, punching douchebag right in his bitch mouth is only going to A: actualize his attempt at devaluing me (""what kind of insecure wimp can't take a joke?"") and B: land me in jail on assault charges.

Fine, I have to beat douchebag at his own game.

The vendor looks at me sort of puzzled (it was really busy and he was the only guy working the stand), and I play along. ""Alright, make it four.""

Douchebag, still in between me and the girl *I'm* there with, ""loves"" me at this point. So he tells her, anyway.

A few more seconds go by, and our food is ready. I calmly pick all four sausages up in one hand for myself, grab my lady friend by arm, and tell douchebag through my shit-eating grin to ""have a nice evening"" in the most ""Fuck. You."" way I can just before I walk away, pulling said lady along with me.

Not sure what was better, the look on douchebag's face when he realized he wasn't getting two free sausages off of some loser as I walked away with his target in tow, or the look on the girl's face as we're walking away. She thought it was hysterical.

Lessons learned:

1. Be prepared to maintain frame in the face of adversity, be it other women, her friends, or some cocksucker.
2. Getting angry and violent when unnecessary will single you out as insecure and a try-hard beta.
3. Women are attracted to new experiences, and value you more if you can manage to show them something they've never seen before.
4. Always stay calm. 
5. The best condiment for any food is spite. Those sausages were fucking awesome.

I hope she f*cks someone there!,58,12,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1gcl0s/effort_your_girlfriend_lied_to_you_about_her/,"A beta dude posts two submissions in /r/relationships. The increasingly absurd replies (and voting patterns) were _astounding_, and are what eventually lead me here.

First submission: [**My \[20M\] Girlfriend's [19F] dance class is making me paranoid.**](http://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fb9x3/my_20m_girlfriends_19f_dance_class_is_making_me/)

Summary:

&gt; OP's girlfriend of two years told him she wanted to start taking a dance class for 15+ hours every week. A friend warned him that most of the men in that class were known to be there to pick up women.

&gt; OP told his girlfriend he wasn't comfortable with her dancing with men like that for 15+ hours every week, especially considering she'd be around them *far* more than she'd be around him. She said she understood, and if the class were full of guys, she wouldn't attend a second class.

&gt; She attended the first class, and told him there weren't any men in it. Months later, he learns that not only was she lying to him, but she has been dancing with the same two dudes (and one other woman) for months, while she spent almost no time with OP.

&gt; He felt betrayed, but he was (of course) passive about it. He went to Reddit to vent.

He was barraged with responses questioning why he _dared_ to try to ""control"" her in the first place. He was told that he needs to suck up his insecurities and let his girlfriend enjoy her new hobby. The responses were equivocating and ridiculous.

(+26) [I am normally extremely anti-lying. But not in this case. Because it was a white lie. Why? Because, once again, it was a dance class, of course there were guys in it.](http://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fb9x3/my_20m_girlfriends_19f_dance_class_is_making(_me/ca8kzn3)

Summary:

&gt; OP complained to /r/relationships about their double standard regarding jealousy and honesty. If males get jealous, they are told to suck it up; if females get jealous, they are told that their boyfriends/husbands are demeaning, inconsiderate, and aren't worth their time.

&gt; If males lie to their girlfriends/wives, they're cowardly and cruel; if females lie to the boyfriends/husbands, they're giving those controlling men a taste of their own medicine.

&gt; OP concluded by saying he and his girlfriend agreed that she would drop the class.

This time, the responses were even more outlandish. And the equivocation was _amazing_.

Now labeled a misogynist/racist and fallen from favor, his writings are red pill through and through. A must read for any true red piller. 

*In Defense of Women* has red pill ideas popping out of every paragraph. A couple of excerpts:

&gt;  “The woman who is not pursued sets up the doctrine that pursuit is offensive to her sex, and wants to make it a felony. No genuinely attractive woman has any such desire. She likes masculine admiration, however violently expressed, and is quite able to take care of herself. More, she is well aware that very few men are bold enough to offer it without a plain invitation, and this awareness makes her extremely cynical of all women who complain of being harassed, beset, storied, and seduced. All the more intelligent women that I know, indeed, are unanimously of the opinion that no girl in her right senses has ever been actually seduced since the world began;” 

&gt; “Years ago I predicted that these suffragettes, tried out by victory, would turn out to be idiots. They are now hard at work proving it. Half of them devote themselves to advocating reforms, chiefly of a sexual character, so utterly preposterous that even male politicians and newspaper editors laugh at them; the other half succumb absurdly to the blandishments of the old-time male politicians, and so enroll themselves in the great political parties. A woman who joins one of these parties simply becomes an imitation man, which is to say, a donkey.”

Before my ex I had two sexual encounters so I was relatively inexperienced when it came to women. I had only come out of my shell when I was 24.

So back to my ex. I was attracted to my ex for her physical qualities as well as her personality traits. Being raised by a single mother I didn't really like weak women. Oh how I was a fool. I assumed the beta role perfectly and my ex loved it. She had a man slave to do anything she wanted and who wanted to do anything to make her happy. I was also a giving lover, priding myself on giving her multiple orgasms but I never initiated since I believed this to be rude. I was under the delusion that a woman should offer me her body rather than me asking for sex.

She broke up with me and I was devestated. Then she found out she was pregnant and I moved in with her. She maintained that we werent in a relationship, not that she ever had any other guys over. She used me for sex on a few occasions but not often. She played me like a fool knowing that I was trying to earn her love. She kicked me out and never told me when she gave birth to my daughter.

When I found out that she had given birth I contacted her and asked to come see my little girl. She then professed her love for me. She maintained that lie for a few months with me happily paying child support and seeing my daughter for a few hours a week. 

By this stage my sexual experience had increased. I had been with far more women and had found that legs spread quicker when I showed Alpha qualities. I am 1.95m tall so when I hid my natural beta behaviour behind a confident Alpha mask I found that women submitted to me. Single women, married women, young, older, it didn't matter. I had married women begging me to come over while husband was at work. They wanted to be dominated by an Alpha. I will be honest, this both frightened me as well as excited me. I was, and still am, drunk on this power.

My ex had grown more distant at this point but I think she could smell the Alpha at this point and one day asked me if I wanted an NSA relationship. I rejected her offer, my heart is still very much in love with her. The next week there was another guy there. I was angry but this is where /r/TheRedPill comes in to open my eyes and show me the truth.

The new guy in her life has more money than me and owns a house in a very nice neighbourhood but he is obese, dimwitted and his behaviour screams beta. After reading The Schedules of Mating I realised that as beta and as much of a nice guy I was in many ways I am the good genes guy (she abandoned me - proactive cheating) and he is just the good guy. He is supporting her but her tubes are tied so no more kids and she has expressed that she never wants more kids. So he will invest all his time and effort into a woman that cannot and will not bear him any children and that keeps him round just to support her (she also has no job).

I am still internalising many of the materials on this subreddit. My sexual encounters are increasing in number because of the Alpha tactics I use. I am a writer so I find that texting is a serious weapon for me. I can get inside their minds, play out their sexual fantasies to the point that they tell me to be at their place in 5 minutes... 
This is not to say I don't want a LTR but I want one on my terms, what those terms are exactly I have yet to decide but I will never again get into a relationship and be the lap dog beta who gets to lick a clit because a woman decides that if she doesn't let me I might go sniffing around elsewhere.",Field Report,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,fr,,True,t3_1cbglh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1cbglh/thank_you_theredpill_my_eyes_are_open_and_i_will/,

1369224044.0,43,self.TheRedPill,1etuue,"Deconstructing sluts or why the ""promiscuous women simply like sex"" mantra is bullshit.",82,39,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1etuue/deconstructing_sluts_or_why_the_promiscuous_women/,"Have you noticed how every time the topic of ""slut-shaming"" or women's sexual history is discussed on reddit, there are always those highly upvoted comments saying ""What's wrong with liking sex?"" or ""Sex is amazing, I don't see why enjoying it would be shameful.""?

Yeah, cool, but my question is: What is actually a better strategy for a woman who really likes sex: having it on regular basis with a carefully selected, high-quality partner who knows her preferences and cares if she comes or not, or, sloppy, drunken copulation with the first passable male who comes along?

As always, it is important to notice the sexual dysmorphism and the ""sperm is cheap, eggs are not"" rule here: it is a man's sexual imperative to have sex with as much women as possible, that's why we get it up and finish with ease, no such thing with women though. It is beneficial for them both from the biological as well as social perspective to have sex within longer-term relationships.

Why don't they then? There are a few key reasons I can think of:

* Crippled self esteem and the need for validation  

That one is self-explanatory, ""How can I be worthless if I made so many cool guys cum"" is not a healthy line of thinking, but hey, whatever gets you through the night.

* The need for novelty

That's probably the healthiest incentive of them all. We all like the thrill of the unexpected and wonder what else is out there, but it's easy to see why dissatisfaction with the present becoming a pattern does not bode well for future relationships.

* The lack of control over primal urges

A simple irresitible need to fuck right there and then when a suitable opportunity presents itself. The crowning attribute of ""cheating whores"". I don't have to explain why you don't want a girl who has no control over her animal brain.

* The inability to commit

Again, pretty self-explanatory. Attachement and emotional intimacy issues preventing her from forming a meaningful bond. And again, not a trait to wear as a badge of honor. 

And the most common one:

* The quality gap between men willing to have no strings attached sex and those willing to commit.

A phenomenon well-described in the red pill writings. Inflating her ego with vanishing alpha cock can really send her perception of her Sexual Market Value and standards to the Neverland. The oh so sweet sperm of a drunk, much higher quality male going through a dry spell is a powerful drug indeed. There are less extreme forms of this mechanism, but they all result in severe dissatisfaction with the males her real value allows her to attract and keep leading to more indulgence in the pump-and-dump carnival until she crashes into the wall and begrudingly lets some despicable beta pick her up. And it's all misery from there.

Now that we've established what pushes women into promiscuity, I hope that none of you will buy into the load of shit that there is a sizeable group of high value, emotionally stable women who are good relationship material, who accumulated a massive number of sexual partners simply because they ""like sex"". Red pill wouldn't be worth shit if it didn't reflect life, so: do you know any? Because the mythical creature that is a woman who gets labeled as a slut while being a paragon of virtue and her only sin is being ""sex positive"", is something that I yet have to see. And even if I ever do, seeing the number of drunken, characterologically repulsive, entitled and delusional skanks I've come across, it's not likely to change my general views.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,1369228419.0,theory,,True,t3_1etuue,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1etuue/deconstructing_sluts_or_why_the_promiscuous_women/,

One Tuesday night about a month ago I dropped by a usual cocktail bar.  I know a lot of the staff, and they one of my favourite  beers on offer, cheapest offer in a pricey location in a pricey city. Fairly quiet, only real option was a 2-set with a group nearby watching them.  I sit next to them and catch up with some of the staff.

After a beer and a smoke, I open the 2-set, blonde called Jane, and a brunette called Sara sat at the bar next to me.  I had seen them close down 3 approaches and decided to practice getting closed down.  

Sara was next to me, moaning she didn't like her cocktail.  I offered to try it and agreed with Jane it wasn't that bad.   I motioned for one of the better mixologists, who is also a very good friend, to come over and shared her plight with him and ask him to make them something awesome. I also ordered a cocktail, which I tried to get the two ladies to pay for, but was turned down.  I had my drink added to my tab, and made sure their drinks went on their tab.

We chat, during which they both moved their chairs to face me, and were initiating most of the kino.  I discover they are here two days for Jane's birthday, they are both 34 and work together.  Their boss was paying for the whole thing.  Who I was told was a lovely, sweet guy but a little weird.

Jane was single, and Sara has been married for 10 years. Both are age adjusted 9s.  Both are in good shape, hit the gym, and sounded like they ate well.  Jane is the life of the party, but hasn't aged as well as Sara. They had spent the day at a spa, their make up was either very light or natural, nothing over the top.

Jane clearly knew the game; constant escalating kino, eye contact, flicking the hair.  Sara was less high energy, but she initiated kino and flirted, but it was far more subtle and restrained.  During our chat, Sara sat directly next to me with Jane to her left, opposite me.  Jane spent a lot of time leaning over Sarah to interact with me.

After an hour or so, I heard Jane ask for the tab.  I had a good feeling they wouldn't be happy I didn't pay for their £20 cocktails, but I was wrong.

They were furious, especially Jane.

The slew of profanities I was called was astounding.  I feigned innocence, ""I never said I would pay, I merely got the bartender to serve you something fun. I even tried to get you guys to pay for mine!"".  They are now making a drama about the whole thing, other people are watching as Jane argues with bartender.  My pal suggests I hide and let him take care of it, so I grab my coat and head to the other side of the bar.

After 30 minutes or so I head for a smoke and bump into Sara.  She calls me an asshole and asks me to sit next to her.   I tell her I forgive her for making a silly assumption like i would buy strangers a drink and causing a scene.  She calls me a cheeky bastard and apologises for the drama. We discuss why I'm an asshole when I'm actually a nice guy, why I'm single and love it, her wedding rings (3 rings, lotta diamonds), how many kids I want, why she has none, her travels around the world.

She informs me that I messed up and could have gotten with Jane, I reply that Jane isn't my type.   We make eye contact, smile, I change the subject and then her hamster goes into overdrive.

She drags me back inside, makes Jane apologise, and we continue like nothing happened.  Oh, except Sara will not let go of my hand.

She insists up buying me drinks for the rest of the night (""are you trying to get me drunk?"") and covers the door charge for a club.  All while dragging me by my hand, doing 80% of the talking while I occasionally reply to deflect a shit test or remind her she is married and I don't kiss on school nights.  She is endlessly qualifying herself and scolding me for being hot and single, oh, and an asshole.

She tries to k-close 4 times and I turn her down; remind her she is married, try to leave as she can't behave, dragged back each time. She tells me to go dance with a group of girls, so I head over and in the time it takes me to spin and hug two, she is dragging me away.

She demands my number, but I never give mine out and I wasn't taking hers, no matter how much she fumed.  She laughs when I call her a spoiled child, and calls me more names.

And girls want to fuck alpha males. Let it piss you off as much as you want, but you know it's completely true. That girl you like who is kinda cute in a weird way, but is totally sweet and you have the biggest crush on? The one who keeps going back to guys who treat her wrong for reasons you don't understand? The one who calls you up at 1 am to cry about how her boyfriend hasn't called her in 3 days, and no matter how long you listen to her, she'll never think of you as anything other than asexual? The one who will curl up next to you on the couch, hug you close, kiss you on the cheek, and never let you fucking touch her beyond that?
Yeah, I'm fucking her.
The hot girl who won't even look at you when you nod at them and smile? The one who laughs when you trip in the hallway and drop your stuff? The one who comes up and coyly aks for your help with her homework, and then pretends you don't exist once you finish?
Yeah, I'm fucking her too, even harder.  
The geeky girl you think might be enough like you that you have a chance with her? She plays warcraft on your server, and watches anime, and reads comics? She's so incredible and you just love her so much but you still haven't worked up the courage to tell her how you feel about her?
Guess who just sucked me off and told me they'll always love me?

And what's more? I laugh at guys like you. When you cry about how much girls treat you bad, and wonder why they can't just see that you're a nice guy who would always treat them right? I nod and tell you to hang in there, you'll find someone right for you someday, don't give up hope man. But inside? I'm laughing my ass off at you you pathetic fuck. Every girl you set your sights on, who isn't a disgusting pig-monster, I'm going to fuck 6 ways from sunday before you even tell her you think she's cute. I won't bother trying when you finally settle for that 350 pound girl who works at hardees, you can have that. Anything else I'm going to cum on her face before you get those lips near it.  
And the biggest reason I laugh? It's not me doing all this. It's the girls. When you cry about how lonely you are? Or talk about how you just want to curl up and disappear, and all that emo bullshit? You're triggering her ""Don't Fuck"" instinct something feirce. You're a miserable weak coward, why would she want your genes? Feel free to buy her a new computer and help her decorate her apartment, you're great for that. But her baby-maker is barking orders at her, telling her to wrap her legs around me and hold on for as long as she can. She needs it, on a primal level you'll never get to see first hand, even if you do get a chance to fuck her. Sooner or later one of them will lay back and spread their legs, but you won't see any hunger in their eyes. They won't beg you to love them forever and make them yours. You won't know what it's like to see her animal side needing you as much as she needs to eat and breath.

And she's cheating on you, I promise that. When she sits around quiet and uncomfortable, acting irritable and irrational towards you, wanting you to just back away and leave her alone, it's not her period. It's because I haven't called her for a day or two and her instincts are telling her to go find me. The primitive section of her brain doesn't want to risk smelling like another man when she gives herself to me, she wants me to know she's completely mine. We do things together she tells you she never would. Her pooper? Mine. I want to give her a facial? of course. I want her to suck the cum out of my dick, even though I just finished pumping away at her ass? she's never going to tell me no. She doesn't WANT to tell me no. She wants me to know she'll do anything it takes to keep me. She'll rim my ass while she's down there sucking me off if it means pleasing me. She'll drink my cum from a shotglass. She'll wear a buttplug when we go out to dinner. She'll sleep handcuffed to my headboard. Anything.
And then she'll go home to you and tell you she's not in the mood today.  
I'd say you should become an hero, but you being around makes her want a real man all the more, so keep fagging it up emo bitches, I'll keep that pussy warm while you're crying in the corner.""  

If that doesn't make one want to go red pill, I don't know what does.

After all, I have a mother who I love very much, and she's pretty mature.  Maybe I am biased.

She is a higher-level person, with a lot of experience as a ""designer"".  To be honest, I've seen WAY better work from other people in my experience, but anyways.

She was going through a user experience/design review of her work on a re-do of an existing old application.  Just one example, she has the user taking unnecessary steps to accomplish a simple goal of the application.  UX design 101.  A couple people speak up especially one senior guy. 

Oh my lord.  How dare he question her design.  Instead of taking their advice, which was right by the way, she fought and fought, crying about how much work she put into it.  Not literally crying but you know what I am getting at.

There were several other points that had the same outcome.

After the meeting, the senior guy was still trying to make his case in a very diplomatic way.  She wanted none of it.

She usually works until 5 or 6pm, but stormed out of work as soon as she was done with the meeting.

Goes to show, even the older women, most of them at least, still feel entitled like children, and powt and fight when they don't get their way.  

I wonder how things would have gone if it was another woman who challenged her instead of a man.  If it was me, I would take the input, especially if it was THE WHOLE TEAM saying it.

&gt; Why on earth would you want her to do those with you now? If she doesn't want to, for whatever reason, you pushing the matter will be pressuring her into something she does not want to do.

&gt; You can't 'change' it at all. The best you can hope for is that she will eventually trust you enough to want to either try new things with you, or retry old things that she didn't dislike. But at this point you sound like an entitled, disrespectful brat so I wouldn't really bank on that happening without a major attitude shift.

Looking through her posting history, she posts a lot of comments on /r/ladyboners in response to hot muscular guys that post their picture. Some of her responses:

&gt; I'd suicide bomb for 60 virgins like this guy. (Or however many the reward is!)

&gt; You have fantastic facial hair. Nice coverage, good length.. and those abs..

&gt; You are stunning. Please stay.

&gt; I would like to dress you back down.

Now, the comment that I linked to was posted in a /r/sex, in a thread about a guy that says this: ""I will and have done anything for her. I have changed my life greatly since meeting her simply for her. I'll do anything she asks and I will break my back just to please her."". His words. He has a problem. He wants kinkier sex, and his gf won't do kinkier sex with. The same kinky sex that she did with her alpha fwb. 

You just have to read /u/grittex's comment and understand it; she lays it out pretty easy to digest.

Don't beg, you fucking whining beta. She doesn't want your beta cock. Get over it.

If not, I'll give a quick TL;DR.  Benjamin Franklin once competed with a man for office, and tensions ran high.  Franklin wanted to make a friend of the guy, so he sent a letter requesting a book from him.  This act led to them becoming friends.

Why did this happen?  Because most people have horrible misconceptions of how people build opinions of each other.

Most people think that ""you do nice things for the people you like and bad things to the people you hate.""  Well, in reality the opposite is true: ""you grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate people you harm.""

Why does this happen?  Because our brains don't like dissonance.  We like to form a solid image of our own persona that is consistent.  Often, our actions are not reasonable (starting to sound familiar?  hamstering!) and we rationalize our character (malleable) to match our actions (unchangeable).

So, now that we've established this, how can we use it?  Do what Benjamin Franklin did: ask favors of people.

Instead of taking a woman out on a nice dinner (typical nice guy behavior), try asking her to bake cookies for you.

You're the only people worth recounting this tale to, and the only ones with an opinion I would hear. [long] [shitty writing]",62,23,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ijqk4/this_is_my_beta_story_i_would_have_never_told_it/,"I have almost always been an insecure, introverted, emotional mess, from elementary school through high school. I was also terrified of approaching women, and only did so once, in 8th grade, which ended in crushing rejection.


Shortly after graduating high school, I was introduced to this nice girl who was maybe a 4. I'll call her Becky. She was living with a male roommate, but the roommate was seeing other girls, so I kind of figured in my mind that she was available. Becky and her roommate had a brief sexual history, but it had long since stagnated into a borderline Stockholm syndrome hostage situation with her roommate just using her for damn near everything from money to beer and cigarettes.


I thought about her a lot. She talked to me, was polite to me, and gave the impression to me that she was single. I immediately began a routine of being super nice to her back. I always texted her back, listened to all her problems, gave logical advice to all of them. I bought her stuff for her birthdays like vodka and other small items that I knew would be useful to her. This went on for a long time.


**A _long_ time, as in like more than three years.** In that entire time, I didn't have the balls to outright tell her that I wanted to sleep with/date her. She wasn't even seeing anyone else this entire time. I friendzoned myself so fucking hard it hurts to think about. I didn't know what a shit test was back then, but I'm just now realizing that I was probably failing them at a record pace.


**SO**, Becky had moved away from her shitty roommate, and one day I am feeling particularly gutsy when she brings up the topic of ""standards,"" and what hers were, and asking what mine were. I took this opening and told her outright that I really liked her and wanted to take her out sometime. She flat out refuses to answer me. I let it go and return home.


The next day, she agrees to get dinner with me. She insisted on paying. For take out. We cuddle up and watch TV and movies at her place, but that was it. The next night, similar story. She would *only* lay with me on the couch, nothing more, for over a month. Eventually, we made it into her bedroom, where *nothing changed.* She would have no touching of private parts or kissing or anything. I pretended to be super okay with ""taking things slow."" Eventually, after over six weeks of the worse cock teasing you could imagine, she decided to give me a **handjob** - two nights in a row, actually. This was my first sexual encounter of any kind, well into my 20's.


A couple days later, she texts me and tells me she just wants to be friends. I was crushed. This single event crushed my self-esteem and my spirit like nothing else before. I ask her why, and get what I considered to be bullshit answers that dodged the question. Now, you have to realize that I had spent my entire adult life pining after this damaged girl, hoping to be nice enough to her that she would decide to sleep with me regularly. Clearly, this plan did not work, and I was frustrated, angry, sad, and depressed about it.


This story isn't over.


After agreeing to give each other a little time/space and being a miserable shitbag for a week or so, I made a very out of character decision to ask out a girl that I barely knew, via IM no less. I'll call her **Candy**. I didn't realize why I did it at the time. Looking back, I think it was a ""rebound"" effect, looking for validation anywhere I could find it.


When I met Candy, I realized I could be whatever I want that night. She didn't know me very well, so I could tell her my collection of funny anecdotes and witty remarks. We hit it off perfectly. **After years of hovering around Becky, I had moved to a girl who was younger, hotter [7+], and smarter, by a _lot_.** She took my virginity, and we started having sex regularly.


Something had clicked in my mind. I was now aware that it was in fact possible to talk to a girl and get them to sleep with me. I was just as fucking shocked as anyone else who knew me that I had scored.


I then learned that Becky was **extremely** distraught over these events. She didn't have the nerve to tell me directly, but I heard the same story through all of our mutual friends; that she had made a mistake, she regretted calling it off, ect ect. I wasn't sure how to feel about it.


I developed... feelings... for Candy, and we agreed to be in a relationship. I thought a light had clicked on in my head, but it hadn't really. I knew that I couldn't treat her the same way I treated Becky, because the Becky game plan didn't fucking work. I had to do something else. I decided the best way was to be freely honest about everything and not worry or give a shit about anything. I was me, for better, and certainly for worse.


**This worked for a few months until she broke up with me for ""no reason.""** I took this event a little better than I took Becky's rejection. Either I was just getting numb to rejection, or I didn't have the same emotional investment in Candy that I did in Becky.


A week later, just like the girl before her, Candy comes back to me. I had learned. I knew now that ""no"" didn't always mean *no*, that ""over"" didn't always mean *over*, that doubletalk and newspeak weren't shit when compared to the unchartable tangle of dialogue that is woman.


I had learned through my robust network of broformants that Candy had spent the last couple days fucking another guy. She did not mention this to me. I thought about it, and decided to bring it up to her. She immediately went into apology mode.


I mean, she didn't technically ""cheat"" on me, but even my bluepilled ass knew this wasn't how to treat a boyfriend. I had absolutely no idea how to react. I wondered how I could trust her in the future. Where do I draw the line and turn my back on amazing pussy? Plus, we got along so well.


This is where something *actually* clicked in my head, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was. I told her that I was still attracted to her, which was the honest truth, but I had reservations about being her ""boyfriend.""

At this point we had sex. Some sort of underlying anger must have seeped out during this event, causing me to be unusually rough. Slapping her ass was the first act of physical violence that I had performed on another human, in any context, in almost a **DECADE**. It was pretty awesome sex though.

Following this, I saw her differently. I really, really wanted to forgive her for what she did, and perhaps I have. But I did not forget. I cannot readily describe the latent feelings of... *something*. Resentment maybe? Mistrust? Those feelings still don't make sense though because I really think I love this girl. She's perfect.

I didn't immediately notice, but I began to treat her slightly differently. Sometimes I would straight up talk to her like she was a dude, even a drinking buddy. Sometimes I would buy her stuff, sometimes I would refuse. Sometimes I would ask her to do stuff **for me**, and she would actually do it. Often I would do stuff for her, sometimes I wouldn't.

I still cannot accurately describe why and how I was treating Candy differently, but it had an effect on her behavior. She talked to me more. It seemed like she was trying harder to get my attention. She began to volunteer information like where she was going, what she was doing, who she was with, shit like that.

Becky and I still talk as friends. It's *really* strange for me to know that I could just go back to her, and likely get her to put out quickly. But I won't do that, not after what she did to me. I don't know what it's called, but Becky fucked with me pretty badly on a level I wasn't prepared to deal with.

Candy and I are still going out. We interact a little differently now, but carry on as if nothing happened. Maybe I am a sucker for letting her back. Maybe it was a good test to see if the relationship could last. If you've read this far and have an opinion I would love to hear it.

Long story short it never worked out, no matter how much I wanted it to happen. She did however give me the dreaded, ""if we turn 30 we are marrying each other,"" line.

Neither of us stayed close with many people from highschool, but we have always stayed close to one another. After years of missing the opportunity, I finally nutted up and told her how I have felt. (This was preceded by texts from her saying ""sure feels close to thirty"" and ""throwawayromanc, I'm lonely lonely girl now that my friends have moved away, If you want to make me feel better about myself you can ask me to do things with you, or for you"" which I didn't see how I could misconstrue as anything but greenlights)

So after a lovely dinner I took her back to my place and told her how I felt and kissed her. After a couple of minutes of kissing she starts crying and gives me the good ole ""I just don't want to lose you as a friend or get hurt by you or hurt you"" yada yada yada thing. I tell her the truth, which is that hurting her is the last thing that I would ever want to do. She says we should take it slow and not label it. Whatever

So we go back to her place (we both live with parents, hers were away) and start to get hot and heavy on her bed. She is considerably drunker than myself, and straight up begs for the dick. While we are making out she moans ""I'm a slut."" I find this disconcerting and leave.

Anyway, BA hooked up with my wife's friend (Who will be known as MT) a few years ago. MT was in the grips of a thyroid condition (an actual one, not a made up one) and really she defaulted to what a lot of ill women do. She switched to ""Beta seeking mode"" and ended up fucking BA, who had been in her orbit for a number of years.

So BA has a woman who is the throes of [1] Hashimotos disease Some of the symptoms of which are wild mood swings, wild libido changes, and weight gain.

So you can imagine what living with her was like. Even despite the condition she still followed the standard pattern, which was intense sex for the first 6 - 8 months, but the difference is it kind of waxed and waned depending on her level of health.

She lost her job, and was too sick to work, but despite this she insisted on moving in with BA, who paid all her bills and looked after her while she took on work when she could. To be fair she was pretty sick by this point, with really awful fatigue.

Anyway, at this point in the story I need to mention that BA HATES me, mainly because I flew MT down for a long weekend with my wife. They have been friends since they were both 14, and I really wanted to surprise my wife. I was in a completely different country when they had the weekend, but BA loathed what I did. BA was (and still is) of the opinion that I was trying to steal his gf, despite the fact I was in a long term relationship, and I am now married.

Perhaps it was because I represent what he wished he had. I will admit I have a hot wife, and BA and I work in the IT sector. Difference is, I got the balls up to leave my home country and go where the good work was, while BA constantly talked about moving to the UK and earning the big IT bucks there.

I would politely remind him (via MT) that unless he had a UK passport (he didn't) the ability to get one easily (he didn't) The UK was a fucking stupid idea, because he'd never get a sponsorship visa with his lowly skillset. I know guys with more skills and pieces of paper than me who have tried, and they came back broke. He lacked the contacts and skill set to go and work on the mines, so he stayed in his crap ass town, and earned crap ass money.

At this point I managed to convince MT to get a proper thyroid function test set done, because she ticked every box for having Hashimoto's and low and fucking behold she DID have it. So as soon as they got her onto the right dose of Thyroxin, she got a whole heap better and her libido came back.... just not for BA. As soon as her libido came back she went straight onto places like fetlife and started chatting up random guys there. I think this was partly because she realized how beta BA was, but also that any time she approached him for sex and initiated, he'd turn her down because he found sexually aggressive women a turn off.

So with no outlet, She has cheated on him multiple times (he doesn't know), but she still kept living with him because she needed someone to pay her bills while she found new work. Instead of looking for work, she decided to go back to Uni and study law. (lol)

So anyway, BA starts chatting with his ex on facebook again. His ex is white Trash, with four kids (she is 26) and living with a meathead in an Open relationship. The Ex says she misses him and starts doing classy stuff like sending him pics of her deep throating bottles with ""with you were here""

Anyway, MT finds these messages when BA leaves his facebook logged in and understandingly gets upset. Problem is she has no new branch to swing to now... so they have a big fight, where nothing gets resolved.

BA then suggests ""not tells"" MT that maybe she should move back home until she is well, and they can work things out in 6 months. BA can't even get the balls up to break up with her.

That's the story so far. MT is still hamstering hard because she doesn't want to move home, but at the same time she wants BA not to fuck other women, while she cruises Fetlife for guys to whip her and treat her like a depraved slut.

So yeah.. that's happening..

I've seen multiple people calling TRP a movement and it makes me laugh. This is not a movement. We're not social justice warriors and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me one. I'm just a man who figured a few things out, determined a sexual strategy that works for the lifestyle I want to pursue, went after it, and decided to share some of my wisdom. You're all my competition. You are learning how to raise your SMV and internalize game which will actually help you take my plates away, and you think I'm going to cheer you on? This is a war, gentlemen, and it is every man for himself. The feminists won't stop until they have complete female supremacy, and they can subjugate men as nothing more than worker class slaves for their husband: The State. I don't wish any of you ill will, and I have made some friends because of this community, but that's where it ends. You are a man, so go build your empire, but realize at the end of the day that you are ultimately on your own.

Hi guys,

I'm posting here because I'm not interested in the advice I would get from anywhere else on reddit. From what I can tell, you guys have a much better grasp on relationships than your average emasculated redditor. Sorry for the long post though.

I'm in my late twenties and so is my girlfriend. We've been in a relationship for three years, two of which we've lived together. It started out as a one-night stand (first for her, not the first for me) that turned serious over a few months into a textbook relationship.

We don't ever fight. She is really down-to-earth, caring, she loves and respects me, never talks back, knows how to deal with my occasional bad temper, jumps into my arms every single time I come home, perfectly matches my sexual appetite and we have a lot of fun living toghether.

I made a common mistake at our early casual sex stage, asking about her sexual history. I learnt that she had five partners before, and did a FFM threesome with one of them in college. I didn't care much about this given that she didn't mean a lot to me at the time and as it took a while for things to turn serious, I never had a definite moment of heartache although it did bother me a bit from time to time. She also cheated on one of her exes while moving on to the next guy. That's bad but I chalked it up to the guy being a loser and her being young.

This one night, being bored and all I decided to peek in her facebook. I didn't expect to see anything too interesting as she registered around the time we met (we're late adopter non-Americans) and she didn't keep in touch much with college friends, let alone exes (that she knew I wouldn't tolerate anyway).

What I found out and made my heart sink is that the guy she had a threesome with contacted her a few months ago and along with some friendly chatter he asked for her permission to include the story of that night in a porn novel he was writing on his conquests. My girlfriend starkly forbid it saying that her life was to fall apart if I ever found out.

I couldn't stomach it. This guy was not one of her loser boyfriends who got lucky once, it was a notorious alpha male classmate who is writing a fucking book on how he defiled dozens of girls in that goddamn dorm and all around the country. And did things to her that were dirty enough to 1.) write a chapter on it 2.) freak her out on what happened if I had found out although I knew about the event itself already. I was shaking.

I confronted her and she broke down, crying uncontrollably for an hour. I was disgusted of her. I wanted to throw her out right there and had a hard time convincing myself that past events that had to do nothing with me warrant at least a day's worth of calming down.

I did calm down. I guess it had to do with the fact that she seemed so utterly shaken for the coming day and begged for forgiveness without trying to excuse herself, and also that we've had it so good for three years now.

A week has past and although everything seems okay again, I still think about it a lot. Is she a rotten apple? What about that other story, once a cheater, always a cheater? She was raised by very decent parents and if I didn't know she had a dumb first year in college, I would have never guessed. I'm asking for your thoughts.

I know my anguish comes from my own insecurities. I've never had problems with women, had a good bit more partners than she did but FFM threesomes were a realm of porn movies in my head, something only sluts and super-alpha men did. I'm intimidated by the mere thought of this guy and disgusted with my girlfriend whenever I think about it.

What would you guys do? Has anyone had a similar experience? Does it get better over time or should I dump her? It would break my heart but it still seems easier than erasing this stuff from my memory.

PS. If I ever get the chance to have a threesome (not with my GF) I'll do it without thinking, although I never cheated. If that doesn't help, nothing will.",Ask Red Pill,False,,t5_2ve1u,1367957993.0,askrp,,True,t3_1dsztj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dsztj/a_dark_spot_in_my_girlfriends_sexual_past/,

1375757838.0,38,self.TheRedPill,1jsbto,[FR] Teaching a good friend some red pill truisms.,71,33,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1jsbto/fr_teaching_a_good_friend_some_red_pill_truisms/,"  Last weekend, went out drinking with a good buddy.  He is a natural talker, good at making girls laugh, so he is a great wingman.  I've talked to him in the past a little about the red pill (he went though a long drawn out breakup with a girl about a year ago - she somehow brought out some extreme blue pill behavior in him).  

  So we're at a popular sports bar, and I see two females that look like the perfect pair for us.  One is a short Asian, and I have a thing for Asians lately.  The friend is a skinny brunette and my friend is intrigued so it's on.  I tell him we should post up at the front of the bar, then I make some glancing eye contact with the Asian when they walk by and let her see me checking her out.  I tell my buddy to sit tight.

Well about 10 minutes later, the two girls sit down next to us.  Some guys are on the other side of them, and one says to the Asian girl, ""I like your watch, is that Michael Kors?""  But he didn't sound too confident and when she didn't really react he shrank away like he hadn't said anything.  The band was really loud, and I was having trouble for a few minutes thinking of an opening when the band suddenly stopped for a break.  I said something like ""I can finally hear my self talk..  wow I sound old huh?""  Admittedly one of my worst openers but I said it with confidence, and really just needed *something* to get them talking, at which point my buddy jumped in and started his natural gift of making them laugh.  The Asian that I was into was the queen of shit tests - I've never been barraged by shit tests like I was from this girl, but it seemed like every time I 'passed' she would give me a little smile.  (btw, she was from Thailand and had an accent like Mr Chow from The Hangover, but it was cute).  After talking to them for about 20 minutes, it seemed like everything was going well, but they suddenly got up and left (Asian seemd to be in charge).  We were a little confused, but I told my buddy don't worry about it, it's still really early.  We stuck around for another 30 minutes, and about that time people leave the sports bar and head to the trendier bars down the street.  

  So we decide to leave - I have a good idea exactly which bar these girls will be at, but I also tell my friend that there's plenty of other girls out.  We walk down the block to the bar I suspect they'll be at, and they're posted up at a table by the entrance.  My buddy is excited that they're there, but I tell him, we need to ignore them, lets go to the back, get some beers and scope out the talent. 

After a bit, I'm not too impressed with the rest of the talent there so we decide to talk to the two girls again.  Ignoring them seemed to have piqued their interest.  As we talk, the Asian is still shit testing the fuck outta me.  We're at a central table and the bar is getting packed, and other random guys are striking up conversations with the girls.  I can sense we're losing them, so I first try acting aloof - the pool table was right near us so I go and talk to the guys getting ready to play, ask if there are people on the table, yadda yadda.  The Asian girl (the leader) was losing interest, and it's getting late, so I tell my buddy we need to display higher value (DHV) now.  I we go over to two girls at the bar alone - they look like complete bitches but they're all dolled up in fancy clothes and hair done so you could objectively say they were hotter.  I wasn't attracted at all, so I just start talking to them not caring if I'm annoying.  Just made sure the other two saw us talking to them.  After a bit, we return to the table and guess who is suddenly all over me?  Tells me she is from Bangkok and grabs my crotch.  

The bar is now closing and we have them reeled in so start to head to the cars.  One girl says she wants to go swimming in a pool.  I tell her I live across the street from the beach, and we can go in the ocean.  We get to my house and I give the girls some T-shirts to swim in, which promptly come off when we all get in the water.  We go back to my place and the girls get in my shower together.  I legitimately have to piss so I walk into the bathroom and start pissing.  The shower doors are glass so they tell my they are giving me a show.  Well of course I join in.  I remember my buddy is in my guest shower, so after a little playing with the brunette (sorry I couldn't resist) I tell her to go out to see my friend.  

After the Asian girl gets out of the shower, she has a T-Shirt on and is laying on my couch with her ass showing, saying she doesn't want to fuck (One final shit test?) I say yea right and start rubbing and kissing backside, and within minutes we're back in my room fucking.  

  I think we could have easily had a nice big orgy..  but I don't think my buddy would be into that.  After I finish with the girl she asked if we can go watch her friend getting fucked.  Sure, why not.  :)  

I continue to be shit tested - afterwards she says ""You are big tall guy, I thought you'd have big cock""  I shrug and say "" you seemed to be enjoying it 20 minutes ago"", to which she gives me a little smile.  When I drive her home she tells me I can be her new boy toy (I find out she's married btw, but she claims her husband doesn't care if she fucks other guys).  She texts me after ""Thank you :)""  ""Call you sometime sometime""

1374960802.0,42,self.TheRedPill,1j6jf4,[FR] The Flight Attendant and the Damsel in Distress,60,18,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1j6jf4/fr_the_flight_attendant_and_the_damsel_in_distress/,"First time posting after a month of reading through TRP theories. I don't generally agree with everything I've read on this subreddit, but I have found many of the columns and theories incredibly beneficial to my relationship with women.

**Background**

I drive 18-wheelers for a large trucking company, so when I do get time off, I generally like to meet up with friends and go out and talk to women. I'm 24 years old and have a college degree, I do this job because I love travelling and I think it gives me some interesting stories. 

**Inviting the Blue-Pills along**

I called up my cousin and asked if he wanted to come out, grab a beer at a local spot and play some pool. He is a fun guy, but not very social or outgoing. He said he'd come by and told me he might bring a friend. That's fine, I like meeting new people.

They show up at the bar and we play some pool. We're having an okay time, and another of my cousin's friends join us. I should mention that while I wasn't exactly dressed up, (Good-fitting jeans/t-shirt and some nicer shoes) they were all wearing high-schooler outfits (Affliction shirts, baseball hats, converse/vans shoes, etc) This doesn't normally bother me, but I feel that just putting a little effort into your outfits makes a huge difference.

**The Flight Attendant**

We take turns paying for the pitchers, but there really isn't anyone at the first bar so we walk downtown and go to this bar with a great outdoor patio. I spot a big table with two girls sitting, looking bored. One is fairly attractive. I walk up and sit down, introduce myself and we all go through the rounds of awkward introduction. I make some jokes about them not remembering our names, talking about the band, etc.

A couple older guys come up and act annoyed at us ""stealing their spot"" (aka their targets) but I just smile at them, am overly nice, and they back off. I talk to the prettier girl and she starts making some strong eye-contact. We're trying to talk over the group and I just shake my head and say ""I can't hear you, you should come sit closer."" She gets up and sits next to me. We talk back and forth, I find out she was a flight attendant for a year overseas. 

I can tell she's probably in her late twenties, but she carries herself really well, and she is laughing at a lot of my jokes. I steal a line I read in one of /u/scottishredpill's FR's, and tell her to put her number in my phone so I can text her naughty things. I immediately text her ""naughty things"" and she laughs. 

I'm sure as a flight attendant she is used to turning down awkward pickup lines from desperate men, but I wasn't really trying to sleep with her, but just work on my conversation, and I think that detachment really helped me out.

I go to grab another round of drinks (My cousin and his friends have all run out of cash, so I decide to be nice and buy them a round) and I run into some of my brother's friends (all 21-22, while I'm 24). We're chatting and I meet a guy, Ben, and his girlfriend, Jane. I introduce myself to her and she immediately says ""I'm Ben's Girlfriend!"" before she even gives me her name. I shrug it off and go drop off the round of drinks with my cousin and his friends.

**Ditching the blue-pills for new ones**

My cousin and his friends are chatting with a couple new girls at their table, so I decide to leave them to it and talk with my brother's friends. Things are going okay, and the Flight Attendant even texts me a winking face and keeps making eye contact with me from across the venue. 

Whatever. Not really interested. My brother's friends are leaving to another place, and I go to invite my original group. One of the guys looks at me and says ""Only if you buy me another drink, I'm out of money""

I just look him in the eye and say ""No man, I'm not buying you a drink, just inviting you along."" He gets offended at me inviting him along without offering to buy him anything. I'm a little tired of that group, so I say goodbye to my cousin and leave with the new group.

**Shit gets ugly**

We go to a few new bars, but they're horrible college-type clubs, claustrophobic with people and pulsing hit-songs. I hate these types of clubs because it's like a sauna of cheap booze and axe body spray. I stand on the patio surrounded by cigarette smokers (I don't smoke and can't stand the smell). I'm not really having a good time, and I notice that Ben and Jane are having a fight over [random drunk relationship bullshit]. 

I leave the club alone and am walking in the street, chatting with people outside the bars, when I see Ben and Jane arguing very heatedly (and publicly) on the street. they are drawing a crowd, and Ben even pushes her at one point and storms off. I don't really know Jane that well, but I go make sure she's doing alright, and offer to call her a cab home. She refuses, says she wants to go out and have fun without him. (Yeah, okay).

We go to one more club, and I go out on the dance floor and just let loose. Jane offers to buy me a drink, and suddenly I notice her giving me a lot of kino, eye contact, smiling, making it very obvious she wants me to validate her to make her feel better about her relationship. She keeps asking my height but I keep giving her bullshit answers (""I'm this tall"" holding up my hand at head level). 

I get ridiculously sweaty dancing with a number of people and so I head out to the patio to get some air. Jane follows me, and we talk, but I'm trying not to lead her on. (She is cute, but I know her boyfriend, and I'm mostly just looking out that she doesn't go seeking attention from someone who might actually go for it). So instead I try to get her to wingwoman for me, which she refuses.

She keeps trying to escalate things, trying to snuggle up to me, holding my arm as we walk through crowds, and always standing next to me. I basically ignore her advances and don't reciprocate, but it has the red-pill effect of making her want me even more.

**The Damsel makes me realize something**

I finally realize that this whole bar/club scene is starting to gross me out. I keep seeing examples of women and men all there to get attention or sex, and the whole thing starts to seem just utterly unappealing to me. A number of girls are giving me the eye, talking with me, or initiating contact, but I'm not really having it. But the more I push away, the more of a pulling effect it seems to have. At the end of the night a number of girls are talking to me, inviting me to after-parties, numbers, etc. I turn them all down. Some get really offended and just go to the next guy over to try their luck with him, and this just compounds my frustration with the whole desperate scene.

I haven't been drinking since midnight, so when the bars close at 2, I've sobered up enough to drive home. Ben has apparently drunkenly taken his car home (he made it safe, thankfully) but Jane is stranded. Guess who she wants to drive her home? I reluctantly agree, since it's on the way, and at least I know she'll get home safe that way.

In the car ride she is obviously drunken and emotional, and starts telling me all about her relationship problems as I just drive and ignore her. I drop her off and make sure she gets up to her apartment. Ben is there, and she runs back down to tell me thank you. She tries to hug me through the door of my car, but I just offer her a handshake and tell her good luck. She obviously wants my number or something more, but I just put the car in reverse and drive off.

**What I learned**

* I know this wasn't the traditional field report since I didn't really escalate anything, or try to get laid. But those really weren't my goals. But the less interested I was in the outcome, the more attraction it seemed to build.

* I know I had a chance to go home with a number of women, but none of them really interested me after I had my experience where the entire scene started to just feel vain and shallow. (Has anyone else felt this emotion while at clubs?)

* It was more important to me to make sure Jane made it home safely, and didn't do anything she would have regretted later. It would have been easy for me to escalate things, and there might have been a time in my life when I would have leaped at those opportunities, but her neediness was just sad to me. In the end I'm more satisfied with getting her home safe than going home with some drunken bar girl.

1) I am from a city with a metro population in excess of five million people. I ride the subway almost everyday -- and have done so for close to 10 years -- and have never once seen what this women is describing in the article. **NOT ONCE.** I am calling bullshit on her. 

2) She acts as though without fail she is approached incessantly day in, day out. Again, on the subway/streetcars/buses in my city you see people simply keep to themselves. I have ridden public transit at ALL hours of the day and again, what do I see 99.9% of the time? Quiet people who keep to themselves. 

3) She keeps talking about... 

&gt; Because in my own way, I can (unfortunately) point out exactly what is wrong with men when they don’t realize how hard it is to be a woman.  How we do not have equal opportunities and freedoms in everyday life.  How most men, even good caring men, have no clue what we go through on a daily basis just trying to live our lives

...as if a man approaching you is such a hardship. Men are simply [oozing privilege and have life so easy](http://i.imgur.com/psua2KN.jpg). Guess I'd rather be 3 times more likely to be murdered than suffer the intense pain of a stranger asking what I am reading on the subway. But that's just me...

So a man yelled at her and called her names. She then says...

&gt; when people (men) want to talk about “legitimate"" forms of assault, tell girls they should be nice to strangers and give men the benefit of a doubt, tell them to consider it a compliment, tell them to ignore the bad behavior of men, I want them to be forced to feel, for even one minute, what it feels like to have so much verbal hatred and physical intimidation thrown at them for nothing more than being female and not wanting to share

She acts as though men **never** get yelled at or accosted by strangers. Women simply love being the victim and ostensibly turn to ""dick-measuring"" when it comes to who had it worse.

So, I pictured a girl with a pretty face, filled with interesting ideas about people and the world, always trying to learn new things, and who'd be up to discussing that shit with me whenever, and also being someone I have sex with. And I expected that emotional and intellectual connection to be what led to sex. 

In some ways, I guess I still am that guy, only that my expectations of that ever happening are more in line with reality, rather than my imagination. 

And the most significant difference is that I used to believe in the false notion that this hypothetical woman would be a significant part of my life. Some call her the ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"". For a minute, I thought I had one, and that was a [huge mistake](http://i.imgur.com/qEOSfWW.gif). After my then girlfriend and I broke, I was quick to realise that while she was a horrible bitch and everything, I had ""used"" her to avoid dealing with my own issues, in that when I was with her, I was happy.

Going through life as a Bluepill is easy.  You just breathe and keep going.  You do nothing all day, stay inside and play League of Legends for 13 hours, eat what you want and just be a shitstain.  It's fine, you're told ""People will accept you for who you are.""  ""I'll find a girl one day who loves playing games and accepts me.""

Give yourselves a pat on the back, everyone. You woke up this morning, **and you weren't this guy**.  You have to read his entire post to believe it. 

If you're not in the mood, here's a summary. He begins his story with this wonderful window into his mind:

&gt; So I met this woman on the internets see, and she was looking for a ""cuddle buddy,"" somebody to cuddle with, with sex an option but not primary. We had gotten together once, a month or so ago (I have very little time free of child care responsibilities where I can make visits like this happen) and had lots of wonderful cuddles and some outstanding sex.

I can't fucking stand that opening sentence. Fuck. And considering the rest of his post, particularly the next two portions I'm about to quote, it seems obvious they didn't actually have sex. But let's assume this dude did get some.

A month later, they were texting about fucking, but she apparently changed her mind: She wants to cuddle with him, but she doesn't want to have sex with him. Naturally, being a male, he feels irked. In fact, he tells the readers of /r/SRSMen that he found himself thinking the following, and he was _so ashamed for thinking it_:

&gt; wait, somebody was a jerk to you, and got to have sex with you, and you know I won't be, and I don't get too...

And:

&gt; oh, the assholes get laid and then I'm there when you don't want to have sex, because I'm safe

Dude, that's _exactly_ what is happening! Don't feel ashamed! Anyway, why did she decide she didn't want to have sex with him?

&gt; What the deal was is that she's had a few situations lately where she had said ""yes"" to men that she didn't really want to say ""yes"" to, and felt like shit afterward. 

In the ensuing one month, she fucked a few other dudes. But of course, women have no agency, so she couldn't help but keep saying ""yes"" to all those different evil men. **Naturally, she decided to wipe the cum from her exploits on this pitiful creature, using him for emotional support while saving her pussy for the real men.**

What's his takeaway?

&gt; Anyways... I had a wonderful time, even if I spent a some time with very achy balls afterwards. And I was absolutely affirmed as a sexual being. Absolutely.

What...?  I'd normally feel sorry for this loathsome creature, but after his feminist masters congratulated him with infantilizing replies like...

&gt; A+++ for you.

... And...

&gt; This is good. You are a good person and should feel good.
&gt; 
&gt; _a woman_

...his self esteem temporarily inflated enough to add this self-righteous edit, making any sympathy impossible:

&gt; EDIT: I'm really grateful for people who thought this was me being awesome, but really it was just me meeting minimum standards of human decency. 

His edit is especially telling, considering he opened his post with this:

&gt; I will either be bragging, or else tragically admitting to Beta-ness, depending on your point of view.

In other words: _Please, tell me I've been a god boy. Let me feel fleetingly superior about my lot in life, rather than ashamed.

Background:
I've had this girl A [HB 8] in my harem for the last couple of months, and things have been going well. We saw (fucked) each other about 3 times a week, and I occasionally took her out when I was in the mood for it. Overall, she was hooked and everything was good. Apparently, last week she found out that I have been seeing two other girls, and she went into full desperation mode. So she calls a meeting of all her feminazi friends, who all tell her that I'm a lying asshole and should be thrown to the side of the road. She thought she had me since I had no idea this was going on. So she thinks up (and rehearses) a full verbal beatdown, and gets psyched for the most epic moment of man bashing she'll ever have in her life. 

That moment came on Thursday. I was chilling at home, bullshitting with my guys before heading out to a party. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. 

Bro 1 gets the door. ""Hey A, what's up?""

A: ""Is uvraise here, I really need to talk to him."" 

I heard the tone in her voice, and immediately sensed she was out of sorts. 

Me: ""Hey A what's got your panties in a knot?""

This enraged her further. A: ""HEY ASSHOLE MY FRIEND TOLD ME YOU'VE BEEN SEEING TWO OTHER GIRLS YOU FUCKIN PIG."" 

I saw this becoming a pretty big scene. She keeps yelling at me, so I go ""fuck it let's ramp this shit up"". I say ""Yeah, hold on a sec."" I call one of the other girls and tell her ""Hey, come over tonight. I'm heading over to (some person)'s house for a party, get dressed up and meet me there."" 

I hang up, and A (who was silently fuming at the fact I just called someone in the middle of her tongue lashing), opens her mouth to start up the crazy engine again. I calmly ask ""So you're done with me then?"" 

A: ""OF COURSE YOU ASSHOLE. FUCK YOU YOU DOU-""

Cutting her off, I say ""Yeah, cool"" and proceed to close the door and lock it. She continues to bang on the door for the next 10 minutes, and I just go back to doing what I was doing before. We turned the music up. 

Not sure if I handled it in the most calm, RedPill way possible, but fuck it I forgot about her the second I saw the other girl at the party. ",Field Report,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,fr,,True,t3_1ax27m,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ax27m/the_most_red_pill_break_up_ive_had/,

Twenty-four hours are almost up, but I'll hit you with a coupon code any time in the next week if you PM me asking for it. I've written too many posts about the importance of avoiding the internet to fuck over anyone who just doesn't check Reddit every day...

- Frost here everybody, ready to answer your questions. Thanks to RedPillSchool for having me and more importantly, for creating this excellent subreddit. Now let's get right to business, i.e. my favourite hobby, talking about myself. 

- I'm the author of [The Freedom Twenty-Five Lifestyle Guide]( http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/150706), [The 2012 End Of The World Tour]( http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/151940) and [A Generation Of Men]( http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/281092). 

- The first is a modern man's guide to health, money, sex, and focus in the world. I've received literally hundreds of emails from men whose lives have been changed by it.
The second is a collection of stories from my first four months of a year I spent backpacking around the world. Reviews were meh, but I still like it. Definitely worth a read if you're considering a gap year type thing and don't know what to expect.  

- The most recent, A Generation of Men, is a novel about three university students navigating life and masculinity in the modern world. I think it's fucking awesome. But I would, wouldn't I? In any case, you have no reason to complain you lucky cunt, because I'm [giving you a free copy today]( http://wp.me/p2Tuga-5c). 

- I'm the author of www.thumotic.com, a lifestyle blog that helps men optimize their health, wealth, sex and focus. I also occasionally update www.freedomtwentyfive.com, where I write about reactionary politics, books, pop culture, and whatever else I feel like vomiting onto the page. 

- I wrote regularly for 2Blowhards.com during its twilight, contributed a dozen or so guest posts to In Mala Fide, and I'm starting a regular column at Return Of Kings as soon as I get off my ass and upload some posts. 

- I'm 27 years old, a Pisces, and I like long walks on the beach. I'll be answering questions for the next couple of hours, and returning later this evening.

""You seem safe.""",62,20,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i8ecj/girls_are_constantly_examining_your_frame_you/,"This is something I've seen happen every once in a while - maybe one out of every 10 girls.  After meeting a girl and talking for a while she will start sharing her insights and observations about me.  On the surface you might say this sounds like a shit test and in a way it is but only if you are reactive.  If you are non reactive the comments start becoming more honest and reveal how her mind is working during the interaction. 

It usually happens when I stop talking and just make eye contact through awkward silences in the conversation.  This is what happened last night when the girl I was talking to said ""you seem safe.""  At first I didn't understand what she meant. Did she mean I was a safe boring nice guy?  I asked her to explain. 

She said almost every guy she talks to has and extreme variance in their mood, vocal inflection, and facial expressions during a short span of interaction. She said this always makes her uncomfortable because there is an underlying feeling that the interaction is not honest, not genuine. 

She said that everything about me was consistent (ie frame). If I didn't want to smile I didn't smile. If I didn't want to laugh I didn't laugh. I didn't change the pitch of my voice. She said ""that makes me feel comfortable and safe.""  (Once I understood what she meant I found her choice of the word ""safe"" interesting. The first thing I thought of was her biological function to seek out a mate that can provide safety and security.)

I thought back to the times where I had been that inconsistent guy talking to girls for hours while unbeknownst to me they were probably all thinking what this girl just described but didn't say anything.

I fucked it up being too full on and emotional before. Long story short we met up 3 month ago, kissed, and been in contact since. I found out she got a bf, which was a guy who declined moving abroad to stay with her in London.

Anyway, we'd been talking now and again, mostly provocative shit, and I was aloof. She went away with the bf for a drive around europe, and spoke to me whilst being away. I was telling her to tan topless etc, quite inappropriate shit. 

She returns and messages me that shes up for a drink last night, I said sure. She lives 4 mins from me, but I couldn't help but laugh that he bf who lives 30 mins away was giving her a lift all the way home.

I was getting bored as she took her time, I told her ""if you arent home by 9.45 we will meet another time. She got home and texted me at 9.44.

So I pick her up, she loves my car, she loves that im in shape, shes in awe. We spend the journey talking about dicks, tits, and complete shit. She loved it.

We get to this bar, and we sit down. She shit tests me asking for me to do gestures like pull her chair in etc, I just sit down and carry on talking.

""You are in great shape, you are looking so good"" she smiles and brushes my leg with hers, but Im not fazed.

Suddenly, only 30 mins after he dropped her off, the bf calls ""where are you?...with who?....oh...i might come down..""

her ""yeah if you want i ....guess.."" it was all unfolding infront of me.

She hung up, and told me how he might come down, and how she ""didn't mind"" but you can tell she was a little pissed.

I was going to be a bit pissed, but then I thought ""i'll show her, I'll game the bf, and befriend him, fuck with her brain totally""

It got worse, were talking joking laughing, and up he comes, literally 1.5 hours after driving her all the way home, he just walks in, looking awkward. 

The look on her face was one of just ""oh, you actually came..""

The kissed hugged, he sat opposite, and it was like the guy was grabbing hold of a slippery soap. He couldn't keep a firm grip.

He spoke, he was pleasant, but I put him on a pedestal. He was laughing, joking, he liked me, he wanted to do business! Her face was priceless.

She kept talking about how much of a joker and ass I was (only to her), but the bf held me in a high regard. 

She touched my leg, once again, whilst saying ""Look at this guy, how cool, funny successful he is."" The bf, disliked this and replied ""oh i left my wallet in your bag...can I come please and get it please..""

She was like ""errr ok""

I was about to leave and offered her a lift, she was getting ready to leave with me, till the bf goes ""oh my wallet, probably better if i take you home"" (AGAIN!)

Her ""oh but its cool i can go with him, we live so close, and his cars got seat warmers"" (his ride is a joke in comparison)

him ""nah nah let me take you please, also maybe we can you know....hang around....""

Her ""...ok then..""

Me smiling and laughing, ok guys, see you later. She followed my eye and grabbed my ass as she kissed me on the cheek goodbye.

She messaged me the next day, telling me how she wanted to meet up again, but next time just the two of us.

I have no qualms with her life choices (I just wouldn't date her). However, she is pretending to like sex to keep her boyfriend happy and would be fine with never having sex again. Her reasoning is to ""make him happy"" which is nice of her, honestly. However, what's the long-game? Marriage? How long would it be after everything she wants is secured before the hamster kicks in and she doesn't have sex with him again? Suddenly this nice gesture of her affection becomes an ""obligation"", then a ""chore"", then (if the hamster is on a roidrage) ""oppression/rape."" The hamster is spinning to cover up the idea that *she is done fucking around and wants marriage, but needs to fuck this guy's brains out long enough to secure that*. 

It goes without saying that the fact that she's an ex-prostitute means sex has been reduced to a chore. A sexually promiscuous woman would have similar feelings I imagine. Bad long-term investment if you value sex in your relationships where she holds the power of the family courts. 

An important note is not one person on that thread is saying ""break up with him so he can find someone that's truly sexually compatible.""

1369978805.0,40,self.TheRedPill,1fe0bg,"After 1 year of TRP, My Marriage is the best it has every been, Last night was a huge jump forward.",54,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1fe0bg/after_1_year_of_trp_my_marriage_is_the_best_it/,"EDIT: I have no idea how to flair this, so I will say it is an example of how ""blue pill"" i have been for 9 years and the ""red pill"" awakening.

So, as the title said I have been exposed to TRP for about a year and living it for most of that time. Those who have seen my posts, know most of that.

Last night though was a real break through for both myself and my wife. My wife really is a good woman and tries her best. She is a good mother and really takes care of me (in a very traditional way). I do my part, pay 90% of household expenses, discipline the kids (she is the good guy in that). Although my wife is Japanese and we live in Japan, she has a very strong personality and will speak her mind to anyone. This is something that I love, but its always annoying when it is directed at me. 

We don't argue much anymore as we are both re-learning our roles in our marriage and get along much better than before, but last night we started getting into it. She started her usual way of debating in which she would try to point out an issue or flaw and when I replied to it with something rational she would change the focus to something else. 

Right as I was getting to my boiling point, it hit me. Why do I debate with my wife or argue with my wife like she is a man. She isn't, there is nothing manly about her. The reality is, she can't have a honest argument without getting personal because her rationale is based on emotions.
I waited for her to finish her, off-the-point, point and then told her that I was sorry for engaging her like that. I told her that my side of the argument was ""XYZ"" and that in a logical sense it was correct, at the same time her argument was completely based on something else, so in her mind it was correct.

She just looked at me and started crying. She replied that she was frustrated all along because I would argue with her like we were equals, and that we weren't. She said ""I am the woman, I need you to comfort and protect me and to tell me when I am getting too off point or out there without any anger or judgement"". 

For so many years I thought that having an argument/disagreement with your wife was supposed to be like I was told in health class, equal. So wrong! I run my house. My wife, whom I do love and have respect for, is free to disagree or ask anything she wants; but, at the end of the day, I will make the choice and she will support me.

After that she talked about how what I was saying in the argument was right but that she was scared about the choice because of ""Insert Example Here"". She knew she was being irrational but needed me to be a man and tell her that it would be ok. 

I will say that for the last few months, I have finally enjoyed being a husband again. Yea, I work my ass off for my family but then I come home and throw all the stress out of the window and enjoy being the man of the house. 

TL;DR -- Last night my wife told me that she needed me to be the ""captain"" in the relationship at all times. She told me to start treating her like the soft woman she was and not to argue with her like she was a man and my equal because she said she wasn't.

It seemed to him that ‘the ladies on this ship possess great authority and assume an air of importance equivalent to that of an imperial princess in our land. He was curious to discover the British custom of paying inordinate respect to ladies; they take their seats before their husbands and sit in the best places at mealtimes as well.*

*Later in the voyage he concluded that, of all the countries in the West, Britain has the most pronounced custom of paying respect to ladies. From what I have seen on this ship, it seems that, when talking to a lady, you take off your hat and treat her most politely. This is the reverse of the ranking in our country, and I find it most astonishing’. Kawaji felt moved to ask for some clarification on the subject of chivalry, but was disappointed to learn that ‘this is an old custom, and there is no particular explanation for it’.*

Everything seemed right, it matched up to how I perceived the world.  I still reserved that 10% within me though, that little blue pill self that really hoped someday all of the red pill would be proven wrong and I would find a girl who was like the others.  This is no longer the case.

Now I will tell you the story of how the 10% bluepill in me died.  But first, a little bit about who I am to put context into the story: I'm fairly new to the red pill and gaming.  I started reading about 4-5 months ago and have been working at it since then.  Before TRP I had laid a few women and been in short term relationships, and I wanted to improve.

Now, let me take you back a couple of weeks before today.  I went to visit a new friend at his house and enjoy some steaks.  While we were there his sister came home and we were introduced.  I was on top of my game last night and instantly built much attraction with her (she kept trying to touch me and asked me for my number, texted me the next morning at 7 AM).  Well, I wasn't flawless (I lost a bit of attraction by saying some dumb things and being too overattentive to her), but I still came and visited every once in a while.  Each visit would end up in us going to her room and getting physical, and we ended up having sex a few times.

Well, a few days ago I learned from a mutual friend between me and her brother that their dad died.  So the next morning I showed up to be emotionally available to her family for a while.  I walked in the house and guess what?  Her and some guy I had never seen were sitting at the table.

Now, I'm not an idiot.  I knew instantly who this guy was, and listening to a few minutes of their conversation made me sure:  he is her boyfriend.  They've been together for quite a while.  He took her shopping that day, to make her feel better, and spent about $150 dollars on her at Victoria's Secret.  He said he'd take her to a nice dinner soon.  I simply played the visit off like I was there to spend time with her brother, which I did, but she still found time to talk to me when she could.

Now, most guys would feel jealous.  I did not.  Instead a weird sensation filled me, one that can't be described by regular emotions.  This was it.  The Red Pill is truth.  I don't have any doubts anymore.  I suppose I should be happy to find the truth, but instead I don't really feel anything.  This is how it is.

Over the last two years I've started to honestly and objectively look at my relationships, my upbringing, my concept of masculinity, and how it all fits (or doesn't fit) into the world I'm surrounded by.  

I grew up from a very young age without a father.  This is a tremendously disadvantageous starting point in terms of developing a full and positive masculine identity.  Naturally you look to the men around you as examples.  I grew up with uncles and family friends who were marines, firefighters, police officers, iron workers, and carpenters.  On the surface all of these men had the trappings of masculinity and as a child I never questioned it.  As as an adult it's painfully obvious that these same men are not and never were in control of their lives.  

Most of them, despite being the main breadwinners for their families, are completely subservient to their wives.  Their wives call all the shots and even openly disrespect them in public and they don't say a word about it.  Most of them do not have their lives and finances in order.  They've worked many years, taken out second mortgages, and don't have enough money to retire.  They they haven't taken care of their bodies.  They are essentially mindless robots who take orders from their wives and go to work to pay a mortgage they they're never pay off.  

I feel like I'm surrounded by these kind of men even in my own peer group.  I have a friend who did two tours in Afghanistan.  He is 6'4'' 230lbs.  He goes out of his way to assert his masculinity.  He always tries to show that he is the biggest, toughest, strongest in the group.  This man's life is run by his wife.  He must ask permission for everything he does.  He runs home from the bar because he knows she will be furious if he's not home by the time he said he would be.  

Why are these seemingly masculine men choosing to live like this (if you can even call it living)?  I believe this goes beyond societal pressures and norms.  I believe on some level this is a choice because despite how hellish it obviously is in many ways it's easier to not take a harsh look at yourself, your reality, and what it really means to be a man.  

You put your gun in your holster, pick up your hammer, put on your helmet, put on your ""man mask"" every morning when you walk out the door, but when you come home you're a groveling, weak, pathetic excuse for one.

1368657211.0,39,self.TheRedPill,1eevuk,I'm a 26-year-old virgin in need of redpill advice,52,13,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1eevuk/im_a_26yearold_virgin_in_need_of_redpill_advice/,"I am a 26 year old virgin. I’ve never been in love and I’ve never had sex, although I’ve always wanted to. I think it is more common than it is given credit for. I know that if I were given a questionnaire, I would deny virginity. 

I’ve always wanted love; I think that this is the natural instinct in men. With love, I expected to lose my virginity. However, the time has gone by and nothing spontaneous has happened. I’ve realized recently that nothing spontaneous ever truly happens; the impetus is on the man to make the interactions seem spontaneous. 
I’ve kissed quite a few girls, but there has always been a mental wall past that. Partially due to a very Christian upbringing, partially due to fear of rape charges for going too quickly, but mostly due to fear of her opinion of an old virgin. I’ve figured that male virginity, for most girls, means lack of pre-selection at the sexual level, and is a turnoff. I was embarrassed about this at 20 and every year the embarassment increases. Even the incel in the sidebar lost his virginity at 17. Everyone here seems to have had his heart broken by acting completely bluepill or had his ass handed to him in a divorce. I feel alone in my situation. 

I’m fairly outgoing. I go to parties, drink, enjoy movies and books; conversely, I’m not really into video games or religion, which is what I think explains some incels. I spend time on my wardrobe and working on my body. For the most part, I get along fine with everyone and I don’t think about my virginity except in moments of occasional introspection. Last night was one of those moments; I couldn’t sleep because these thoughts kept me up. All of the sudden I realized that I’m not young and I may not lose my virginity until my mid-30s.

I’m in medical school, just finished my first year. I have this summer, where I work 8-5, then starting next year, there is no time anymore for any social extracurriculars. Studying and medical extracurriculars are all that I will focus on. I realized this and it frightens me. I can’t fuck up medical school for something as fickle as losing my virginity. And, like I said, I don’t think about this most days. In med school, I’m surrounded by people like me. There are people who went into school in a relationship and others, like me, who you can tell have never been close to anyone. They’re planning to marry after they get their MDs. I can’t honestly believe that I am the only involuntary med school virgin.

I asked my parents about this problem in an indirect way a while ago, and their advice was to just wait to marry a good Christian girl after I’m professionally established (which would be my mid 30s). They have been extremely supportive and I really enjoy their company and value their opinions, but this advice is worthless to me. I don’t blame them for their philosophy, it’s worked well for them, but they are products of a different time and place. A major milestone in my life is missing.

I could just go for the bottom of the barrel, go for any fat girl with a pulse, but I don’t think I would be able to go through with it. I’ve waited so long, part of my brain says it needs to be special. Also, I genuinely am not attracted to fat girls; they’re about as sexy as men are to me. I don’t avoid them in daily life or anything, but I can’t actually imagine having sex with them. 

The best scenario would be this: I meet a girl and we hit it off and fall in love. I open up to her and we have sex with her understanding my virginity. But unless I’m really close to the girl, I wouldn’t reveal something as personal as my virginity.

If I were to predict advice from other subreddits it would be this:
 
Any female-dominated relationship subreddit:
*Virginity’s not that big of a deal. I’d love to meet a virgin man, I could teach him what gets me off. I like working with a blank slate…blah blah blah.*
When in actuality, I’m fairly certain it would turn her off in real life. 

I could go online dating, but it caters completely to women. 5s think they’re 9s due to the amount of messages they receive. If I can’t plan anything out in the next few days, I’ll create a match.com profile. That’s as much as I’ve planned so far.

The seddit community looks like it is full of college students with posts like 
*I just got a phone number! What do I do now?!*
And to be honest, I was just like that in college. I read *The Mystery Method* a few years ago, but I put seduction on the backburner to get into med school. 
More recently, I read *Bang* a few weeks ago, but the applicability seems so removed from me. How do you meet wingmen when everyone you know is in the midst of professional competition? How can I go out every night? Everyone I winged with in college has grown up and moved on. I’ve lost touch with them all.

The med school girls split into a dichotomy: the straight-laced, professional, type As (the kind who dress to the nines to walk across campus); and the sloppy fat girls who always wear sweats and a hoodie. To be fair, this is true for the men too. Ideally, I would hit it off with one of them and live happily ever after, but that hasn't happened. The problem here is hypergamy: they don’t want a peer. And like the men, they tend to cut dating out completely and just plan to get married when they are professionally settled. 

I want redpill advice. For months, I’ve read this subreddit and I completely agree with it’s philosophy. I don’t want cuddly or soothing advice; I need practical advice. I have three months of a relatively lighter workload. How to I make the most of it? How do I lose my virginity? How do I go from nothing to haram?

TL;DR: I’m a 26-year-old virgin in med school. I have three months where I have a lower workload and I want to lose my virginity in this timeframe. 

Edit: Alright, I'm going to sleep now. The plan is to set a deadline. Until then just have fun and try to get laid by being more open and using online dating sites. If I'm not laid at the deadline, I'll get an escort. Also, if I get a girl, I plan to not mention anything about virginity and just having awkward virgin sex with her. Thanks guys.

So you guys get a second hand story instead of actual proof. 

There is a radio host that complains constantly that she is single and this morning the topic was ""Am I too funny to date?"". A friend of the host had told her that guys won't date her because they are intimidated by her being funnier than they are. A whole bunch of callers called in to tell her that isn't true. One caller actually fully demonstrated hypergamy by saying that she is having trouble finding a guy that is on equal ground as her. ""She doesn't want to date down."" One guy even called in to say that ""A woman should be seen but not heard."" He got ridiculed like crazy. 

About a month ago I had tweeted the radio host telling her she was full of shit for complaining about being single because she is attractive she should be dating. She responded by saying she doesn't have time. 

So I tweeted back this morning saying I had a crush on her because she was funny. She had already told me she didn't have time though. Her response was ""I have time if you're Robert Downey Jr."" 

I told her that her problem wasn't that she was too funny, it was unrealistic standards and to look up the definition of hypergamy. So far no response. 

I know this isn't some huge surprise. I just wanted to say that since I've discovered the red pill I see proof of it everywhere. I listen to a lot of music and I really wish I had the time to analyze all of the songs I've heard that perpetuate the status quo.

Women consciously understand that professional, altruistic, brave men with access to resources are attractive, however, it seems there are a number of mental shortcuts they use to **subconsciously** test for these traits. 

They look for outward signs of the above attributes, like abundance mentality, confidence in body language, dark triad traits, passing shit tests, putting women second to your life mission, demonstrating passion, demonstrating mastery, taking initiative, having energy, amused mastery, etc.  

I think this is what’s responsible for the cognitive dissonance that so many women experience when they complain about not being attracted to the fit, family oriented guy with a good job, and instead getting the tingles for ""jerks."" They are consciously aware that one is of more value than the other, but subconsciously are attracted to the latter because he is displaying those signs. Similarly, a guy can be consciously aware that some girl is a bitch with BPD, but still gets a boner from looking at her ass. 

Women subconsciously seek for and filter men based on outward signs. These signs can be faked, which is why they shit test. 


And this is why game works - PUA’s and jerks either understand and imitate, or innately demonstrate those observable traits that women unconsciously look for. 


We can talk about love, genuine attraction, and “the spark,” but I think any guy who can demonstrate to himself (and I think this is the eye-opening, TRP-is-true moment for most men) that more women are more attracted to him as a result of changing his behavior, literally overnight, to display these outward signs, regardless of his own underlying attributes, then all such illusions will be dispelled. Love, and more importantly - human sexual relationships, are conditional, transactional, and opportunistic. 

This brings us to one of the major criticisms of game - that it is manipulative. In a sense, this is true, but only insofar as makeup, perfume, tight clothes, cosmetic surgery, and push-up bras are manipulative - both seek to influence unconscious attraction factors. 

For women, this has to do with the attributes described above - brave, altruistic, professional with access to resources. For men, wide hips, a thin waist, large breasts, etc, are all just markers for what we’re ultimately hardwired to seek - good mothers for our children. Game is male make-up. 

NAWALT means that all people get certain impulses or unconsciously respond to certain stimuli. Just like chicks can’t help but dig amused mastery, neither can guys not feel lustful after a pair of long legs supporting a tight body accentuated by feminine curves. 

When TRP tells us “she's not a special snowflake,” and AWALT, it means that she's human and is subject to her own biology. Whether or not someone acts on their impulses is a different story.  


For me, TRP essentially comes down to 3 core concepts: 

* understanding sexual relations and attraction as they really are

* demonstrating the above mentioned outward traits (this is Game)

* and finally, actually achieving the underlying attributes (brave, altruistic, professional with resources), which are demonstrated by the outward traits described above, for my own sake

What happened was essentially the polar opposite of what happened in my last post which can be found here.

[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i8ecj/girls_are_constantly_examining_your_frame_you/]

I reference my last post because my frame and general attitude were very similar during both of these interactions but the responses were wildly different.  I'll try to make it brief. 

I walk into a bar around midnight with a friend.  It's busy, laid back, and has a good vibe in general.  We get a few beers, relax, and talk to each other.  Next to us there is a group of 3 girls.  HB4, HB7, HB8.  I am closest to the HB4 and HB7.  I see them drinking beer out of a straw so I ask them what that's all about and tell them it's not ok.  The 4 loves it and offers to buy me a drink on the spot.  We talk more and exchange names. I introduce them to my friend. I didn't engage the HB8 at all and they didn't introduce me (this may be relevant later).

Anyway I do the usual push/pull.  The 7 tells me they met a guy earlier who looks just like me.  I say he must have been hot.  She smiles, rolls her eyes.  She tells me where she went to school.  I never heard of it so I say, ""is that a real school or are you making it up?""  She smiles and says I'm being an asshole and asks where I went to school.  I say I didn't and I never learned how to read before telling her where I actually went.  We talk about where we live, local bars, guess each others ages, and have a decent conversation.  

At this point the HB4 goes home.  I go to the bathroom and tell my friend to talk to them while I'm gone.  Unfortunately he was shy and didn't talk to them at all.  I get back and talk to my friend about five feet away from the two girls who are now talking to each other.  I look over and see the HB7 who I had be talking to shoot me a look of anger and disgust.  I immediately say ""what was that for?"" She says she wasn't looking at me and was trying to see something outside.  

This is where it gets weird.  Sitting at the bar with them I finally try to introduce myself to the HB8.  She tells me her name in the most bitchy, ""go fuck yourself"" tone ever.  I can tell the 7 is pissed as well, acting like a completely different person.  

The 8 says ""We both just got over a breakup and we're not interested.""  

I said ""What makes you think I'm interested?""

""You're talking to us.""

""I talk to everyone.  I enjoy talking to people.""

The HB7 says ""I don't like you.  You've been degrading me all night."" (we had been talking for 20 minutes)

I ask how and she couldn't give me any specific examples.  She just kept saying I was rude and degrading over and over again.  The only example she gave was that she went to take a sip of beer and picked up my glass by mistake and I corrected her.  I said ""that's my beer.""  This was her only example.  She said my whole vibe and the way I was looking at them was creepy.  (Again contrast with the last post)

As shocked as I was I sat as calmly and relaxed as I could at the bar. 

This seemed to upset them ever more as the HB8 said ""why are you still here?  we aren't interested. you need to leave.""  

I said ""I'm not interested either.  I'm going to sit here until I finish my beer.""

""You can finish it somewhere else.  It's a big bar.""

""You're right.  So can you.""

""If you don't leave we can go get the bouncer and tell him you're harassing us and he'll throw you out.""

""That's fine.""

I finished my beer and told them they would benefit from improving their social skills, wished them a good night and left. It was very difficult to remain calm and relaxed while they were both ganging up to attack me.  **The vehemence and intensity of their anger was very similar to a verbal altercation with two other men that could escalate to a physical altercation - except for the fact the fact that they knew there was no risk of that happening.**  Internally though, your fight or flight response is triggered and it would have been very easy for me to raise my voice in anger at them and start arguing.  I think this is exactly what they wanted.  It would have proved them right despite their argument lacking any facts or logic.  I'm not surprised by their actions, I'm just surprised about how quickly things went from one extreme to the other.  Thoughts?

What are your observations?,54,18,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i06k0/any_other_redpillers_living_in_a_nonenglish/,"First of all, I'm an Asian-American living in Korea. I've been here 5 years and have prospered here immensely when it comes to girls and having a redpill mentality. One reason is that here in Korea, I speak the language and frankly being Asian is the *norm* here. But I firmly believe the main reason is due to the attitudes and culture of Asian girls here in addition to the effects of the culture on Western girls. Let me explain.

Informational background: Normal Kgirls wear high heels and miniskirts in the winter, makeup in the gym, and will always shower before sex. Image is everything in Korean culture and most Kgirls define themselves on how guys see them. In relationships, they embrace their femininity and submissive roles (although many Kgirls can be fiesty and emotional). They like guys to take care of them; in fact, they *require* it. One quirk is that Kgirls will act really shy and innocent, when in fact they are slutty and are down to do stuff in bed no American girl would (because degrading!). In other words, many Kgirls got *game* and know what to do to attract guys. Although Kgirls are unique, I've been with many girls from Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, etc and the same is usually true; much more feminine without any feminist hangups. 

So onto my REAL topic: Korea has really become global the past few years. Tons of people are becoming obsessed with Korean culture (not to mention all of SE Asia already loves Kdramas, Kpop etc). This has led to TONS of foreign girls from Europe, Australia, US, Canada, UK coming to Korea to teach English, study Korean, and just travel. Even 4 years ago, there were hardly any foreign girls; 9/10 foreigners here were guys while now it's like 50/50.

Basically, the #1 effect I've seen: Western girls who come to Asia are forced to become ""more feminine"" to succeed in the dating field. If they don't, they *always* get left alone as White guys here almost exclusively go for Asian girls and Kmen are hardassess when it comes to things like weight, femininity and appearances. As a result, many complain &amp; Hamster about Kmen &amp; Western men. Then, my favorite: they shame Kwomen for loving cosmetics, beauty, and for being *too thin &amp; cute* (as if weighing &lt;120 lb is a crime). They are forced to start wearing leggings, heels, and *gasp* a dress instead of flip flops and some baggy jeans to the club. They, for the first time, are faced with men who have ZERO fear of feminist-like reprisals from angry women mobs (kudos to you, Kmen!).

Basically, women who come here fall into two categories, usually based on nationality. 1) Women who are usually overweight to begin with and cannot handle Korean culture and expectations for women in terms of beauty, relationships, work, etc. These are typically Canadians/Australians/American girls. 2) Women who have experience living as minorities, have healthy sexual attitudes, are open-minded, and most of all ***lack the typical feminist attitude that embracing femininity is a terrible/weak thing***. These are usually European/Eurasian girls. They are almost always thin, have no aversion to high heels or skirts, and are *super* open about sex. Both groups must adjust to Korean culture, obviously, but I have also observed that European/SE Asian/Russian girls can adjust much easier. 

So, I would like to hear some stories or experiences from you guys, especially if you have lived in Japan, China etc. What kind of Hamstering have you observed by Western women living overseas?

Could you describe the heart of TRP in a few words?,63,23,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hpcs5/which_aspects_of_trp_do_you_most_readily_accept/,"The whole source of ""The Red Pill"" is accepting the world as it really is.  I consider TRP to be a useful model of the world and many of examples and explanations we see on a daily basis help to shed light on our own experience.

I'm curious what other people in this sub readily believe and what parts they are skeptical about.

To get us started: 

For me, **Feminist Indoctrination**, **Hypergamy**, and **Sexual Market Value** are the heart of TRP.  These concepts alone can explain so much of sexual strategy.  Of course other concepts have been validated by real-world experience: White Knighting, Mate Selection, Shaming Tacticts used by women, Female Privilege, Hamstering, etc...  

I think a lot of the posts we see on here are related to tactics, but in terms of the big picture for how western society currently functions, Indoctrination is what takes away our male identity, SMV explains why people end up with the mates that they do, and hypergamy expands on why women act ""predictably irrational"".

So what am I skeptical about? I see a lot of very experienced PUAs make sweeping generalizations about women.  Could it be that NAWALT has something to it?  I know that exceptions prove the rule, but my specific concern is a pretty common pattern I see:

* Experienced PUA has a successful system for sleeping with a lot of women.
* Predictably sleeps with a lot of women.
* Makes some statement ""All women are X""

If you read in depth into any system, they naturally create filters.  Hopefully you are filtering conciously and you know what you want in a woman.  The first thought that always pops into my mind when I see this pattern is that the PUA is seeing a confirmation bias because the women he filtered out are actually not X; he just never gets far enough in the interaction to discover this fact.

So my question for you: What is the heart of TRP? Tell us what you are skeptical about.  Are there any parts you completely disagree with?",Ask Red Pill,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,askrp,,True,t3_1hpcs5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hpcs5/which_aspects_of_trp_do_you_most_readily_accept/,

 I'm sure some of you have interacted with a male that lost his sex drive for whatever reason (medication, surgery) did you still feel like  he somehow represented a part of your being or did you think he was uncapable of dealing with life like how it's meant to be and he should not be considered a ~~male~~ man anymore?

I posted this article for a slight change of pace. It is about a man we all know and love. What does it have to do with the red pill (TRP)? Read the whole article, and you find that Mr. Rogers is a man who led his own life, made decisions, and affected millions. He refused to be subject to the decisions of others. He fought his own noble battle, even past the age most men have given up and retired. He created his own reality, and children and adults alike were drawn into his reality, and awarded him their undying love. TRP is not just about becoming a sex machine, or lashing out at real or imagined oppressors. TRP is acknowledging that a man does not react to the decisions of others, but acts, and others follow.

I mean being self-entitled, slutty and neurotically illogical (hamster) are not traits I'd want the mother of my kids to have and yet ironically so many women feel entitled to have kids because they WANT the kid. As a man I find that vile. Women having kids because they want a kid, fuck logic. Having kids should prioritise the well-being of the kid and giving it the best possible life which includes **keeping the father around** (something many dumb hos think is irrelevant), being a dumb broody ho shouldn't give you the right to bring life into the world, quality over quantity is my line of thought here.

Validating dark triad assholes and the short-term over strong long term providers is dumb. Alpha fucks beta bucks fucking sucks. Betas deserve respect for what they bring to the table but I don't agree with feminist culture making men sissy, weak and overly liberal and tolerant of everything, being alpha and not being dark triad is a rare combination in today's society due to this and it blows, both as a man trying to find his way and as a woman wanting a ""good man"" that isn't unattractive but not a complete cunt either.

Most of the women I meet provide none of this. Am I looking for value in all the wrong places, or dating the wrong girls? Maybe I value myself too high?

And, in my opinion, usually yields a lot better sex.

After finding this sub from a thread on the front page I've been reading stuff from the side bar and past threads. I find some of the ideas interesting but I am hung up by statistics and research that doesn't really align with the conclusions made here. I'm wondering how RedPill addresses them. Namely:

1. It seems like a lot of the discussion revolves around ""hypergamy"" and a women's propensity to cheat. What about statistics that show that most women (and men) don't cheat in marriage (and in most of their relationships), and that men are estimated to cheat more often? Stats can be found [here](http://www.statisticbrain.com/infidelity-statistics/) and [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/love-and-gratitude/201109/low-infidelity-shock-statistics-and-the-forgiveness-factor) and even [on the Wikipedia page on infidelity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity). I've also heard stats that estimate that women are much more likely than men to commit EMOTIONAL rather than PHYSICAL infidelity, although I can't find them at the moment. This wouldn't make sense in the context of hypergamy.

2. Somebody in another thread criticizing RedPill brought up John Gottman's research, and I found that very interesting. He's managed to predict divorce at a very high rate using his model, and some of the factors that lead to divorce seem contradictory to the strategies that RedPiller's stand by. Info on his research can be found [here](http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/what-happy-families-know/how-to-keep-love-going-strong) and [here](http://www.edge.org/conversation/the-mathematics-of-love) and, of course, [on his Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gottman). 

A finding from the first link that seems to fly in the face of RedPill ideas:

&gt;The happiest, most stable marriages are those in which the husband treats his wife with respect and does not resist power sharing and decision making with her. When the couple disagrees, these husbands actively search for common ground rather than insisting on getting their way. It’s just as important for wives to treat their husbands with honor and respect. But our data indicate that the vast majority of wives—even in unstable marriages—already do that. Too often men do not return the favor.

So why should I follow RedPill advice versus well-respected empirical research? Why should I care about the concept of ""hypergamy"" if the stats indicate that it's not really a thing? So far I've found RedPill calling on evolutionary psychology and anecdotes to support conclusions. Is there anything else?

They have discovered that holding out is a bad policy as MEN DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO unlike the opposite role reversal. It has backfired on some women and they have gambled and lost their most precious asset: youth. Career women over 35 years old are looking around and painfully noticed they have very slender dating options and it's leaving them dumbfounded.

Feminism needs to acknowledge beauty and youth play an important role in mate selection for men. We aren't inherently hypergamous nor will we ever be.There is a point where the role equality nonsense needs to stop and recognize the importance of biology in both genders and the role of sexual attraction. This can't be ignored for much longer and not for men, but for the sake of womankind. They need to look at cold hard facts and accept the truth, not some idealized fantasy.

It ruined the nuclear family. Prior to the feminist revolution, men and women had set roles in society, now men have no real role since they've been replaced by the government. Everything that a husband used to be the main provider of, now the government provides if the woman wants to be a single mother.

It ruined marriage as an institution, which directly ruined the subsequent generation of men and women raised outside of a nuclear family. Women honoring and respecting their husbands is now a thing of the past. Getting divorced is now more common than remaining married.
Each generation that came after the feminist revolution spawned more masculinized and less feminine women. How is this good? How is being more like a man good? WTF are women thinking?

It spawned today's generation of sluts that are unsuitable for marriage or raising a family. Today's American woman wants to fuck around with 100 guys before settling for a provider husband in her late 20s early 30s. WTF?!? How is this right? Then after that, her most likely course of action is to pop out a couple of kids, then divorce him for half his money and keep full custody of the children.

Prior to the feminists coming around, women ALREADY had the right to vote, to higher education, and to work in whichever field they decided to specialize. All feminists did was fuck everything up. Every report or study I've seen clearly shows that women today are unhappier than they were in the 50s and 60s. I'll look a couple up if you're interested. Traditional gender roles are BIOLOGICAL, not imposed by society. If they were imposed by society, we wouldn't have found civilizations halfway across the world with the exact same gender roles we had in Europe in the middle ages and renaissance. Which were: men provide shelter and food, women rear the children and keep the home.

And the worst for last: since feminism told women they could fuck around, it skews the sexual marketplace in favor of Alpha guys that have sex with all the girls. The current situation is 20% of the guys having sex with 80% of the women. In the past, all men had to do was be a good man, have a stable job, and he'd be basically guaranteed a wife he could have sex with all his life. Now these nice men don't have sex until their 30s when the sluts get tired of fucking around and are looking for a provider husband to rear the cost of her children. I hate feminists for this. I hate that I had to learn game to have sex. I'm great at game and have had 21 different girls over the past few years, but still I hate doing this to have sex because I know I'll never have a 100% stable girl I can settle down with. I hate that I can't have a wife and children without the fear of her taking all my money and my children away from me (which is the most likely scenario, I remind you).

Feminism has nothing to do with women's rights, it's only there for female advancement. It's there to screw men over and treat them as disposable.

**Alpha** – Leader. Somebody who displays high value, or traits that are valued by women. Alpha can refer to a man who exhibits alpha behaviors (more alpha tendancies than beta), but usually used to describe individual behaviors themselves. 

**AMOG** – Alpha Male Of Group. 

**AFC** - Average Frustrated Chump (Also known as beta)

**Beta** – Follower. Sombody who validates others, men &amp; women alike. Beta traits display low value to women. Beta can also be used to describe individual behaviors.

**Blue Pill** – From The Matrix and its sequels. The path of conformity with Society’s expectations; the state of being unaware of the problems engendered by society.  Compare with “Red Pill,” below.


**Carousel** – Better known as the “**cock carousel**.” The period of time in a woman's life where she successfully exploits her sexual value and maximizes her hypergamous tendancies by having sex with as many alphas as possible. Usually happens between ages 18 - 27. Often ends when the woman hits the wall.

**DHV** – Display of Higher Value, the accomplishment, anything that improves your sexual market value in the eyes of another.

**DLV** - Display of lower value.

**Feminism** –  ”A doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, the proxy use of violence and wealth appropriation. In whatever flavor, and variation, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism. Feminism is therefore, a doctrine of class hatred, and violence.” (John The Other, “Why not date a feminist?” A Voice For Men, 4 June 2012.)

**Friendzone** - See Orbiter.

**Game** – A loosely based set of behaviors specifically designed to increase attraction.

**Hypergamy** – The instinctual urge for women to seek out the best alpha available. This is marked by maximizing rejection (therefore women are the selective gender). A woman will vet her alpha through various shit tests to ensure his ""health"" on the alpha scale. She is conditioned to recognize a declining alpha, as hypergamy also tends to continue seeking out higher status males even while with an alpha male. Shit tests allow her to prepare herself for eventually leaving when a new higher status male is found. If the male fails shit tests to a great enough degree, it will effect her feelings for him. He will effectively lower his sexual market value in her eyes. This will enable her to jump to the next male with ease and little remorse.

**Incel** - Involuntarily Celibate. 

**MGTOW** – Men Going Their Own Way; the growing contingent of the male population who are saying “Fuck It All” to the Mating Dance.

**MR** - Men's Rights Group. 

**MRA** - Men's Rights activist.

**NAWALT** – Not All Women Are Like That. A common response to generalizations, signaling a fundamental inability to understand how generalizations work. [More info on Rationalmale](http://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/generalizations/)

**Oneitis** - When a guy has fallen in love with a woman in the same way a boy loves his mother. He obsesses about her, but she does not reciprocate. 

**Orbiter** - Also known as Beta Orbiter. A beta guy who accepted the proposal to ""just be friends"" from a girl he has oneitis for. He will stick around her and constantly validate her whenever she requests it. Also known as ""friendzone."" She will keep him around because he will do anything for her and provide validation, giving small hints that he might eventually win her love- but he never will. Typical signs of orbiter status: likes and comments on new facebook photos. Go-to guy when girl has problem with boyfriend. Also known as emotional tampon.

**Plate Theory** (Or Keep Spinning Plates) -- Gaming multiple women simultaneously to boost ones sexual market value. Read on Plate theory here: http://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/plate-theory-2/

**POF** – PlentyOfFish.com

**PUA** – Pick-Up Artist

**Rationalization Hamster** - The tendency for women to use rationalization to resolve mental conflict and avoid cognitive dissonance. The core mechanism that allows women to say one thing and do a different thing. 

**Red Pill** – The recognition and awareness of the way that feminism, feminists and their white-knight enablers affect society. Seeing the world for what it is, seeking truth no matter how painful or inconvenient the truth may be.

**Seddit** - The game-oriented subreddit : /r/seduction which is not strictly red pill but has good pickup advice.

**SMV** – Sexual Market Value. A shorthand statement for “what you bring to the table,” whether for an one-night stand or for a longer sexual/emotional relationship. 

**SMP** - Sexual Market Place. A description of the free market that is mating.

**Snowflake** - A woman who tries to persuade a man that she’s somehow unique, different, or special by playing up her good girl resume and downplaying her bad girl resume. When used as a verb, snowflaking refers to the argument she puts forth to justify her claim.

**The Wall** - The point in a woman's life where her ego and self-assessed view of her sexual market value exceed her actual sexual market value; the beginning of the decline. Usually occurs as a wake-up shock to women when they realize that their power over men was temporary and that their looks are fading. This usually results with first denial and then a sudden change in priority towards looking for a husband. Even after hitting the wall, many women will squander a few more precious years testing her SMV with alphas to double-check, hoping her perceived decline was a fluke, this will make her even more bitter when she finally has to settle for a worse-beta than she could've gotten before because of squandering her youth.

**White Knight** – (1) a man who “comes to the rescue” of a woman, or of women, reflexively, emotionally-driven, without thought or even looking at the situation; (2) a man in authority who enables Team Women in his legislative actions, judgments, or rulings, reflexively, emotionally-driven, without thought or even looking at what’s right. Also known as ""**Mangina**""

_______________________________________________
Abridged article/selected quotes by me:

&gt;**Abstract:** Males tend to cooperate with physically attractive females without careful evaluation of their trustworthiness, resulting in betrayal by the female. In this experiment, healthy male participants made risky choices (whether or not to trust female partners, identified only by photograph, who had decided in advance to exploit the male participants). The results show that trusting behaviour in male participants significantly increased in relation to the perceived attractiveness of the female partner, but that attractiveness did not impact trusting behaviour in the minocycline group.

**Introduction:**  

&gt; In an economic exchange, attractiveness in a female increases sexual arousal in a male...without careful evaluation of her trustworthiness 

This is normal, as we are all going for beauty when looking to bang a girl

&gt; While these traits should be adaptive in terms of mate-choice, experimental studies have shown that they also affect decisions in social and economic exchange 

In other words, although thinking of a girl's tits &amp; ass is good for mating purposes, it basically is a shitty strategy in any other social situation with women, as they *will* screw us over.

So what's with this drug?

&gt;Recent studies with human subjects show that minocycline, a commonly used tetracycline antibiotic, may facilitate focus on appropriate environmental cues for social decision-making

Okay, that's good...but this is interesting:

&gt;Minocycline is also known to improve symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression

Anyone else find it funny that the same drug used to inhibit the effects of both psychiatric disorders is also effective in protecting against the ""honeytrap""? No wonder husbands say that their wives drive them crazy! 

**Method**: Here's a [flowchart of the ""economic game"" they played.](http://imgur.com/8SSVPdG). Very easy to understand. 

&gt;The amount of money given was expected to function as a behavioural measure of the trust the male participant has in the female partner. In this experiment, male participants had no information about the female partner except for a photograph.

**Results**: [Bar graph of the results](http://imgur.com/8TefVI2)

&gt; * Placebo and Minocycline groups gave the same amount of money to the non attractive female

&gt; * Placebo group gave larger amounts of money when the partner was more attractive

&gt; * Minocycline group did NOT give more money when the partner was more attractive

**Conclusion**:

The authors mainly focuse on Minocycline as a drug and it's usefulness in the future. 

But I think the RP lining in this study is that the *same* drug that improves schizophrenic symptoms *also* was shown to improve resistance to irrational thinking and the ""honeytrap"". If our brains process both of these the same way, then that has implications for how to attack manipulative social situations in the future.

&gt; I've decided that you are an asshole

That's fine. You're still very unattractive.

&gt; If I feel like a 7 or an 8 then I am

If I feel I look like Ryan Gosling -- I DO!

&gt; I don't need you to validate how I feel or make me feel worse than I am

You came on the internet looking for validation. If you found any -- you DON'T deserve it. Besdies, your elbows are too pointy.

&gt; I'm obviously not your type

Or the type of 95+% of other men who know you're the bottom rung of what they can get

&gt; I don't know what you are working with, but judging by your judgmental nature your personality is extremely unattractive

The girls love my personality. Where I work I am asked all the time how I am able to talk with so many attractive girls and have them always coming back for more. And I'm talking real 7's, 8's and 9's

&gt; That being said, I was asking for advice on meeting people, not what you think of my appearance.

You need to improve your appearance to improve your results. I gave you an honest assessment of your photos (that you provided and asked for an assessment) and you didn't like what I had to say. You're a broken women and like Humpty Dumpty -- nobody wants to put you back together again. Especially men. Especially, especially high status men. Because they saw your androgynous face (zits and all) and said a silent ""Next!"" You want to find men to bang for free? I assure you there will be a lineup -- even for an unattractive woman like you -- not because you are a 7 or 8 like you think. But because they are thirsty.

&gt; I just got out of an emotionally, and at times physically, abusive relationship where I was constantly told I didn't look good enough and never did anything right.

But that is no reason to delusionally inflate your ego because you claim you were a victim. I don't know if you're telling the truth about your previous relationship (as most women outright lie or really exaggerate the severity) but I can ask you one question -- Why did you stay in an abusive relationship for so long? I don't feel much sympathy for you knowing you could have left but didn't. They say the door to abusive relationships is locked from the inside.

&gt; So the last thing I need is someone like you judging me.

You asked us to when YOU provided photos to do so. So don't blame me for granting your wish

&gt; I do alright and the people I like and care about find me attractive.

Then bang them

&gt; They like my tattoos and they don't say sexist, unhelpful things.

Please show me where I made one sexist remark. To you (and 99% of women who have been brainwashed by modern feminism) anything that is said that is in any way critical of you is sexism? Criticism about you (and not your gender) is not sexism

&gt; You are the reason I prefer imgur to reddit and you are the reason I can't take people seriously online

Online or offline -- we men all feel the same. You are unattractive and don't deserve the caliber of men you desire. Lower your standards because a majority of men will need to do likewise if they choose to bang you

&gt; That being said I'd like to add a big fuck you. I now bid you adieu. You arrogant asshole.

1367693466.0,35,self.TheRedPill,1dovmp,[Mod] State Of The Subreddit May 2013,59,24,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dovmp/mod_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2013/,"Well Red Pillers, it's May. In half a year we've managed almost 5,000 subscribers, and we're growing faster each day! 

Since we're growing at such a fast rate, it's always a good idea to refresh everybody on our [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1a59tv/mod_posting_rules_update_2013/), and to address some new issues that have come to our attention.

I would like to take this moment to address the stance the moderators have on a few topics- and the direction we intend on steering this subreddit for the foreseeable future.

Spousal Rape
-----------

A commonly repeated trope is that we support rape because one of our moderators said ""I don't believe in spousal rape."" I will only address this once.

Any forcible exertion of will over somebody else's will is clearly wrong. Bodily autonomy should always be respected, and this applies in all scenarios, including marriage. Any debate on TheRedPill regarding the specifics of spousal rape is an argument of semantics and religion, and not one dismissing basic human rights. **Nobody here advocates denying anybody else's autonomy, not even our moderators.**

As rape is being defined as wrong because it denies the basic human right of agency, we must also consider the following:

Any force that requires a man, against his will, to make payments or to labor to afford making payments towards a another party must also be considered exertion of one's will over another's autonomy. This *denial of agency* denies a man's right to bodily autonomy. 

Therefore we will refer to alimony as divorce-rape, circumcision as baby-rape, and conscription as life-rape.

If we accept that not all exertion of will over somebody else's autonomy is wrong, or that one can consent to waive certain rights to autonomy in certain conditions to certain people (even if the agreement includes a lapse of time), then we must revisit these definitions. 

This will be the last time I address this: If we revisit the definitions, it is an exercise in hypothetical theory and not in itself an endorsement for rape. 

Any attempts to conflate the two will be immediately removed and banned. It is a disservice and insult to victims who have actually suffered the terrible tragedy of rape.

Trolls
----------

With the influx of new users, we have to deal with the unfortunate reality that there will be more trolls. Because of this, we're going to have to be a little more strict in our adherence to the policies. 

Posts that utilize any kind of concern or shaming language are immediately suspect. We will take a look at each post on a base-by-case basis. Typical phrases that we will be looking out for include:

* ""I feel so bad, sad, etc."" 

* ""You're bitter."" 

* ""Misogynist"" 

* ""You all...""

Please note, we encourage open debate and discussion of our theories, but please bring facts, and not ad hominem attacks or concern for our well being. 

A new trend that we have been seeing recently are the passive aggressive trolls that disguise themselves with plausible deniability. They attempt to cloud their true purpose by representing themselves as honestly inquisitive or perhaps genuinely mislead, and here to learn. We identify them by their concern language, ad hominem attacks, or insults to our moderators.

It is very possible to be here and ask questions, or disagree without setting off any red flags. However, common attributes of a troll post include:

* Leading with a presumptive conclusion. ""The fact that you're bitter is getting in the way of..""

* Asking complex questions (fallacious questions) to which any answer is an endorsement to a presupposition that has not been determined or agreed upon. ""Can anybody tell me why you guys hate women so much?""

* Ad hominem ""just because you are bitter..""

* Condescension ""This just seems like a bunch of chest beating to me..""

* Unfalsifiable rhetoric - phrases, insults, accusations that cannot be falsified and serve no purpose but to manipulate the emotional state of the opponent or onlookers. ""This is just a circle jerk""

* Concern ""I feel like this sub is focusing too much on.."" (If you are genuinely concerned, contact a moderator, or submit more content of the quality you would prefer to see.)

* Accusations of echo chamber/circle jerk. This is a combination of just about all of the above, but I want to highlight that the term ""circlejerk"" itself is meaningless and unfalsifiable rhetoric used to gain an upper hand in an argument without any of the legwork required to disprove the opponent's points.

* Insulting the moderators - If you disagree with a moderator, that's just fine. You can do so publicly or in PM. We're not gods, we don't know everything, and we spend a lot of time learning every day. However, if you show disrespect to the moderators by using ad hominem attacks or thinly disguise an insult as a ""genuine"" disagreement, you will be banned. 


If you feel you were unjustly caught we have no issue looking at appeals on a case by case basis, just know that your post history and account age will be looked at.

If a woman determines that her husband is a cheating scumbag or such, she might just also give herself the permission to trash the guy's house, key his car, or anything in between.

And this is a recurring phenomenon. I personally recall a situation where the mother of one of my friend's mom pulled something comparable in nature. This mother insisted that my friend and his stepdad go and sell some worthless crap in a garage sale, but they were too lazy or too busy (and the money to be made was almost nonexistent), I can't remember, because it was too long ago. What I do remember, however, was seeing that woman throw all that stuff from one room into the corridor in the most ostentatious manner possible. [Useless, abandoned] things were breaking, sparks were flying, major drama was had. All because that woman was not willing to do that shit herself (while her husband and son were rightfully in favor of throwing away that worthless stuff, instead).

At least in that case, no real property damage was done. But, again, can you even imagine a guy pulling that kind of ****? Can you imagine having a temper tantrum because someone did not handle a situation precisely in the way you felt was ideal? Or can you imagine a guy going and trashing his girlfriend's apartment because she cheated on him?

I feel like women are just institutionally encouraged to do whatever they please and with no consequences. Things that would get a man's ass kicked so bad, he would never even consider pulling that kind of stunt again.

One thing I noticed about booty calls that I found amusing and was thinking about the other day... It will be obvious to most of us now, but it may make a few blue pillers think. 

Back in the day I used to have usually a dozen or so booty calls in my cell phone at any given time. Sometimes more. Any day of the week, almost any time of the day, I could call someone up, have them come over or go over there, and get laid. 

One thing I figured out real fast, though, was that when I would contact these women, for the vast majority of them, if I ever *mentioned* that I was calling them up for sex or even alluded to the fact that we were going to have sex, they would shut down and there would be none. And I'm not talking gutter talk here. Even if I talked about it in the most respectful terms possible, bringing up sex to most of them was a guarantee they wouldn't give me any. 

See, they *wanted* to have sex. They *knew* just as well as I did that they were coming over for sex. But if we ever acknowledged that, then they had to face the reality that they were having what was also to their minds dirty meaningless sex.

No, they *needed* me to tell them that I was just having them over to watch a movie, or have a drink, or ""hang out,"" so that when the sex actually occurred the hamster could do its work and let them believe that I had simply seduced them after the fact and that they hadn't actually come over for premeditated no strings sex. After all, they had simply come over with the pure intentions of merely hanging out. 

Granted, there are plenty of women you can game who don't have this much internal fear of feeling ""slutty,"" but in my experience most women have at least some aversion to doing anything that could be considered as such. So you have you give them that ""out,"" so that they can chalk the sex up to you seducing them and not because they actually wanted it.

So yeah we have a fat SJW who goes to comic con, and is enraged by white males and everything that have built. Complains that there isn't enough content made for her and then blathers in about privileged for a bit. 

Yes, again we see female hypo-agency in action kids! It's easier to sit on your fat arse and complain !

It reminds me of an experiment that I saw ages ago, where you took a female toddler, and a male toddler. 

Between the toddler and mum, there would put a cloth barrier. It was low enough that they could see the parent, but it acted as a barrier to getting to them. 

When faced with this challenge the differences between the sexes were stark. 

* Male babies would attack the barrier, or actively try and get past it somehow. 

* Female babies would stand there and cry until they were helped by a parent. 


This is one of the starkest differences between men and women.  She is sitting on her fat arse complain about the very culture that built everything she likes, yet is unable to waddle out and solve the problems she sees.

1374596775.0,33,self.TheRedPill,1iw4qb,3 ways to keep your motivation to stick with the gym.,52,19,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1iw4qb/3_ways_to_keep_your_motivation_to_stick_with_the/,"I'm glad things have been focused on fitness here lately, as it's one of my passions in life and something I've struggled with (having no mentorship, knowing no one who was truly in shape, not knowing what to do, etc).

**Disclaimer** My weight before working out was 140lbs at 5'11"". Just to be clear I'm not at my goal weight yet, I'm 170lbs currently (fairly low bf%, clearly visible abs) and my goal weight is 195-205lbs. I will reach these goals fairly quickly, but I still think I can write this now. My best lifts (@165lbs) were a 475lb deadlift, 255lb bench, and 345lb high-bar squat (I don't like low-bar). Currently I'm into olympic weightlifting.

I've been into fitness for a while, but my biggest problem was I never could eat enough (been skinny my entire life), but now that I actually have stable income and just recovered off a TERRIBLE knee injury that lasted months, I'm going crazy in the gym every day and it feels great.

----------------------------------------------
One thing I've seen from many people is they lack the motivation to keep going to the gym. Everyone should have their own reasons for staying motivated, but some I found that really keep people going:

* **Focus on beating Personal Records**

Nothing feels better during a gym session than breaking a PR. You get an adrenaline rush, a sense of accomplishment, and it fuels your desire to come back and break that record again. Also, along with breaking PRs, the muscular gains just become a side effect, rather than the goal. Find me one guy who can deadlift 600+ lbs that doesn't look great (unless they are 20% body fat) 

* **Have a big mirror in your bathroom/room or somewhere you can admire your body's progress**

This may sound shallow, but taking some time out and admiring how far you've come and what your body is becoming is a great motivator. It can help with your self esteem / love of self / narcissism a bit as well, which honestly a ton of guys could use more of. Make sure the lighting isn't shit as well (light directly above you is best).

* **Compete**

Competition: The great motivator. For people who are trying to pack on muscle, the best areas of competition (that easily support amateur level people as well) would be, in my opinion:

- Bodybuilding
- Powerlifting
- Olympic Weightlifting
- Strongman (a bit harder to find)

These are great because there's hard deadlines for competitions, force you to research everything, and it helps with accountability knowing you've registered and paid for an event that will be coming up in X months, and you want to make sure you put on a good performance. The people I know who are the most fit and most obsessed with keeping in shape all compete.

-----------------------------------------------------

Playing off the competing for motivation bit, those 4 areas of exercise are, in my opinion, the best routes a man should take for packing on muscle quickly and actually getting some real size.

Some areas of exercise that probably won't give you decent muscle:

- Jogging (lol)
- Marathons
- Cycling
- Triathlons 
- Rock climbing (although rock climbing is really cool)
- Yoga
- Pilates
- Any type of aerobics

-----------------------------------------------

So, those are 3 things I think will keep you motivated indefinitely to keep going to the gym. Some great subreddits on exercise are:

Long story short, he is a 21 year old virgin who has potential to become a wealthy doctor. He's so ashamed of his sexual status that he's debating on castrating himself (or looking to get an operation if possible). He made ONE small statement about by the time he's 29-30 (finished with school and making bank) he'll only have ""washed up"" girls with 10+ partners looking to settle down (AKA girls off the carousel hitting the Wall) to choose from.

Guess what a majority of the top comments choose to scream at him about?

This serves as a great example as to what many men have to deal with when they don't have TRP and other manosphere-type places to get a second opinion. They don't like the life plan of being an ugly-but-smart virgin, working their ass off in school and early career through-out their 20's, only to finally make it decent and spend all their money on some chick that spent those same years partying it up and riding a different cock a week until the Wall (if they are lucky). Society says ""tough shit. She's not a slut for fucking 20+ guys. You're an asshole.

It finally hit me, I've been seeing this debate over ""don't tell women blah blah, teach men not to rape"" thing for quite some time and I would like to shed some light on it for you.

The trouble most people have upon hearing this argument is to approach it logically and debate the effect of this assumption on the basis of pretext and effects. We know how that goes so I wont get into it.

However the feminist sees this argument under a broader ideological context. To them reeducation is the goal. And it's not in the simplistic way you might think of hearing that agreement, that is just telling men not to rape women. It's about indoctrinating men and forcing their whole victim paradigm on them from everything to their ideas of privilege to other magical powers that males posses, and most importantly this kind of potential rapist statues the man must always work to try and avoid with a series of never ending 20 questions that they must recite to any girl in order to make sure she is 110% comfortable at all times.

This is why I urge you to spread this simple info and never approach a feminist on a rational level.

1366476489.0,33,self.TheRedPill,1cqye1,Common Critiques of The Red Pill,104,71,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1cqye1/common_critiques_of_the_red_pill/,"I wanted to have an on-hand url to link to when people make one of the common red pill critiques, since I'm tired of rewriting the same thing over and over.

The Red Pill is Misogyny
-------------------------

False. I'm going to break this answer into two parts.

**Part One**

There is no systemic hatred of women here. The red pill is a subreddit dedicated to helping men find the truth regarding inter-gender relations. The sad truth is, a lot of these men were raised to believe a set of values that are no longer relevant in today's culture, and yet our culture continues to propagate these values. Men find themselves repeatedly failing when trying to do the simplest and most human task of all: Finding love. 

Finding love isn't an unreasonable goal, everybody should have their shot at happiness. Or so we are told. But these men quickly find that the learned traits and behaviors they grew up with, the ones re-enforced by popular media (movies, tv), the ones their mothers and fathers advocated, they actually work against them if they are to find a mate. It actually makes them unsuccessful.

Of course upon hearing the reality of what it is that makes some men successful with women, the first gut reaction is typically denial. There's no way any of this is true. It contradicts **everything** I've ever known and heard. Nobody agrees with it. Heck, if I ask a girl if any of this is true, she'll be disgusted at the very concept... *it must be wrong!*

But nevertheless, here we are, discovering these theories and truths, and putting them into practice on the field, and getting real results.

We call learning and internalizing the red pill ""swallowing the pill"" or ""unplugging."" Yes, it's a cheesy Matrix reference, but it's an apt metaphor. Ultimately the pill is a bitter one, it pulls the proverbial carpet from underneath your feet. Everything you believed about society, marriage, relationships, women, it's all wrong. You've been lied to.

It's a very difficult transition between being plugged in and really understanding the concepts here. Often this transition is met with anger. This is a normal step in the transition.

*Why would people lie to me? Why would mom lie to me? Why would my girlfriend lie to me? Why would society lie to me?*

This stage usually doesn't last too long, but does come with it's share of venting. Is it hatred of women? It is not. It's anger towards every person, group, and system that has propagated lies. And rightfully so. I believe anger is an important step. It's the first real step in taking control of one's own life and understanding happiness is yours to take if you want it.

But this is not to be confused with a systemic hatred of women. While these men may curse god and all that live on this planet, this is anger, and not directed hatred. It's important to note that when somebody says, ""how can women do something like XYZ??"" It is an expression of anger a perceived injustice.

Our critics would like to paint this anger as hatred. It's a temporary anger, and as we learn the theories and concepts here, it's an anger that fades. It's difficult to really grasp a different world view, and the red pill changes everything we know.

When men begin to realize that their goals are unrealistic, and begin to understand more about our theories and what we've labeled the feminine imperative, an understanding of what the lies are that are propagated, and why they are told.

This transforms anger into something constructive: understanding and setting new goals. With new goals, happiness can be achieved.

This is not the systemic hatred of women. This is introspection and understanding, and all the emotional outcomes of the process.

Now, you've probably noticed, we do heavily critique women's mating strategy, we analyze the public face on their strategies, the rationalizations they make for their actions that they readily admit to on threads in askwomen or relationships. This does not constitute hatred, and anybody trying to conflate the two is disingenuous and flatly wrong. Critique and hatred are two very different things. 

**Part Two**

The term misogyny is a thought terminating cliche. We disallow it's usage in any way that isn't' strictly ironic on our sub because the term itself is terribly meaningless and serves no other purpose but to attach a negative stigma to a very real experience these men are having. The term itself is part of what we refer to as the feminine imperative, because it's only real usage is for shaming men and ensuring their obedience.

The very act of discussing ideas that are different or not specifically politically correct is what draws this fire, the accusation of misogyny. Ultimately, our culture attempts to shame instead of understand where we are coming from. Instead of debate with reason, the term ""misogyny"" rears its ugly head. It's an emotional trick, to try to stigmatise our subreddit- and it always points to one logical conclusion: If there were a solid logical argument against the red pill, would opponents not rather use those instead of cheap tricks like the word ""misogyny?""

Usage of the word misogyny accomplishes precisely the goal of those using it, not to encourage an open discussion or debate the merits of red pill ideology, but instead to stifle conversation, to ensure arguments are not heard over the cries of ""misogyny."" Any who attempt to defend it be wary, as they themselves will associate with said misogyny, and themselves risk the label misogynist. Instead of having to reason on merit,  they declare evil the very debate itself. An effective tool to silence people. Except, of course, not any more, since we really don't care.

1373468073.0,32,self.TheRedPill,1i0dk5,Any suggestions for gold mines for plate-spinning? I suggest Couchsurfing...,56,24,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i0dk5/any_suggestions_for_gold_mines_for_platespinning/,"**Besides bars and clubs, which I frequent almost every weekend, I was wondering what other sources you guys use for new plates to spin?**

My suggestion: Couchsurfing. For those who don't know, CS is a site where travelers can meet ""hosts"", who will let them stay for free, or ""surfers"", who stay at your house. It promotes cultural exchange, gives you a free place to stay, and a free guide (and save $$$). You make a profile and can either ""host"" or ""surf"" or go to ""CS meetings"" where you can meet new girls who are traveling. 

This is all within the context of ""CS community"". This is SUPER important as that very fact lowers the ""bitch walls"" of many girls. You're just a cool, outgoing guy who likes meeting new people from other countries! 

Why does it work? Truth: traveling girls are down to fuck. Hostels are cesspools of hookups and sex if you have ever traveled that way. CS is the same way. You get the ""foreign country effect"" (sexual inhibitions are always lowered while traveling because girls' sense of self-accountability is way off; she can act like a new person and no one will ever know). Also, it's a self-selecting population (any girl traveling alone and willing to stay at a guy's house or host a guy she has never met is more likely to have sex anyway). 

In my experience, I have been on the site for 3 years (since the old days) and have probably banged like 25 girls from the site in all types of situations (hosting, surfing and just activity meetings). As a ""host"", I get a great mix of different nationalities since I live in a huge Asian city and lots of tourists come through here.

So, check it out RPillers! Chances are your city has a community page already and lots of activities. First step is to go to CS meetings because it allows you to get good reviews from female members. If you try to contact girls with no ""reviews"" yet, your reply rate will be low. Also, going to meetings is simply a great way to dominate the local betas who are also looking for hookups. For me, almost every meeting I go to, I end up with a girl. And I have 32 positive reviews, and 25 are girls I've banged.

tl;dr Try Couchsurfing. If you have ever heard ""CS is not a dating site"", it is a load of crap!

We don't subscribe to typical gender assigned roles of the relationship so I don't feel it's above me in the least to do dishes, dust or vacuum, or tidy up the apartment when she's out with friends.

Through out talks and readings together I have seen the destruction that can come from men using male privilege to try to dominate and control women putting them in cages and prevent them from reaching true self actualization and fulfillment.   Parts of this are incorporated in our daily morning mantra.

Now on to some issues.  I'm asking for help with two issues.  The first is with America's predefined standards of beauty and what is considered attractive.  My girl and I are looking to spice things up a bit with some exotic eveningwear and we recently took a trip to Victoria's Secret to find some sexy undergarments.  

While we were both delighted with some of the fragrances available to the discerning provocateur, we were disappointed after careful examination of their inventory. It became apparent that VS does not cater to women of larger stature such as my big beautiful gal Courtney.    So I'm seeking a vendor of sexy lingerie garments that deals in the upper echelon of plus sizes for women if anyone can be so kind as to share this information.  I'm open to custom tailoring as well as I have a connection out east that could possibly provide a good deal on fabric if I buy in bulk.  

I want to discuss an aspect of my Courtney's life that has recently visited some trouble upon my soul.   Courtney has met some new guy friends recently on the subway.  A diverse group of inner city fellas that are local aspiring rappers and she likes to hang with them sometimes late nights and weekends.  

I'm happy for her and encourage her to maintain many types of friendship to help in her life journey of self discovery. Again, these ideas incoporated in evening mantras.

I'm not nosy but we've had some discussion of what she does when she hangs out with her guy friends during one of our share/care talks.  She says they often like to just hang out and watch and smoke a little bit of weed while they kick some rhymes.  

I'm all for the idea of her expanding her musical horizons and enjoying the poetry and prose of these local street talents but I have a problem with some of the lyrical content.   She recently brought home a demo CD and I gave it a listen. 

I believe firmly in the idea of a compliment sandwich so I'll start with some positives.  The beats are nice.   It's actually a bit reminiscent of Timberlands earlier stuff with Missy Elliot ...but I digress.  My ~~problem~~ concern is with some lyrical content.  

Their raps consists mostly of the ol male patriarchy archetypical content found in some rap today that is degrading to women and filled with braggadocio and tales of sexual conquest without much regard for for monogamy or fidelity.  A couple lines that stuck in my brain.  ""Come get some, open your mouth spit out your gum, I take the cake from under the bakers thumb. Mami he can have you back when I'm done.""  Ugh.

This was an emotional moment for me and I called for one of our sit downs.  When it was my turn with the talking pillow, I played some of the music and checked with her to make sure I wasn't misinterpretting lyrical content.   She went on to explain a bit about artisic expression and how often the emcee's rhymes are an emotional outlet and that you really must separate the artist from the actual person.   She assured me these guys are actually respectful gentlemen in real life and this is a musical outlet for them.   

I trust what she's saying.  No problem there.  But I feel the desire to contribute with an example of some more positive ""phat rhymes"" that will highlight women in a more respectful manner and perhaps accentuate the pros of monogamy and marriage.     This type of thing is maybe not typical for this sub-reddit but I'm challenging you to help me.  Thanks so much.

Oops.  Forgot to complete the compliment sandwich.  Their rhymes schemes are pretty clever :)

Men's answers were sorted. Most were in favor of free speech. Some had no problem deleting stuff for the lols, and some got into an interesting discussion about wanting free speech unless they themselves could be the arbiter, in which case they would delete anything they didn't like.

Ask women on the other hand just deleted my post. Apparently I was inciting subreddit drama.

Below I've linked to 10 scientific articles that detail evidence of various redpill and game theories. Many of these you have likely read before, and some are surely new to you. The point with all of this is to simply create a repository that can be linked to with ease, detailing various concepts being reaffirmed and backed by science.

[Chase-Away Sexual Selection: Antagonistic Seduction Versus Resistance](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/h/hollandb/Publications/downloads/Holland&amp;Rice.98.pdf)

* Describes both peacocking theory, and the evolution of female sexual resistance. 
* There is strong evidence here supporting the very existence of game, and many modern game techniques. Many of which focus on achieving greater sexual dimorphism and fulfilling the masculine gender role to completeness in order to garner better success with women.

[It's His Immune System That You Actually Want to Sleep With](http://kotaku.com/5887562/its-his-immune-system-that-you-actually-want-to-sleep-with?tag=uk)

[Testosterone and Extra Relationship Interest](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Testosterone%20and%20extra-relationship%20interest.pdf)

* Both evidence that testosterone plays a strong role in securing a mate, and reasons that females may lose interest in men who don't seek extra pair copulations. This also heavily supports theories that state women prefer short-long-term relationships, and they inevitably lose interest after 3-5 years of time with one mate (her partner's dropping testosterone levels may trigger the eventual loss of attraction).
* More reasons to remains as ""alpha"" as possible, to ensure partner fidelity. Direct evidence that harem building may be a far more effective way to keep relationships in tact and ""alive"" than white knight cuckold game.
* Explains why men who take ""the red pill"" report being much happier in general after experiencing the long term effects of this alternative lifestyle. They also report being able to better secure long term mating partners, despite their diminishing desire for it.

[Animal Behaviour: Sexual selection in females](http://www.princeton.edu/~eakcay/publications_files/Roughgarden%26Akcay2010_AnimBehavForum2010-FullBundle.pdf)

* ""In group-living species where several mature females breed each year, females commonly compete for social rank, which is often related to their ability to produce or rear offspring"" - Evidence of ""mother hen"" cock-blocking, and general female psychological manipulation to prevent other women from accessing resources that could be used to achieve reproductive advantages.
* ""In humans, the voices of women become more attractive when they are fertile (Pipitone &amp; Gallup 2008) and studies of female lap dancers show that they earn significantly more in tips from clients during their fertile periods than at other stages of the cycle (Miller et al. 2007)."" - Evidence that female fertility plays a very powerful role in sexual selection amongst humans.

[Sexual Economics: Sex as Female Resource for Social Exchange in Heterosexual Interactions](http://www.csom.umn.edu/assets/71503.pdf)

* Explains how the dating environment came into existence, how it may differ from one culture to another and even vary over time. Also, how females use sex as a weapon to garner themselves social standing, resources, and top shelf genetic suitors.
* Yet more confirmation of why game theory itself is simply a natural step in human evolution.

[Evolutionary Aspects of Aggression: The Importance of Sexual Selection](http://www.zoologi.su.se/research/tullberg/papers/11-Aggression.pdf)

* ""Nearly half of all mammal species exhibit male-biased sexual size dimorphism, a pattern that is clearly linked to sexual selection."" - more reasons to lift big, eat big and be big.
* More indication of the 80/20 rule, one man getting all the women.

[Alcohol's Effects on Testosterone](http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/abuse/l/blacer030117.htm)

* A finding that lends support to various pickup theories on why alcohol tends to garner better results in the field, both when consumed by females and males.

[Eye of the Beholder: The Individual and Dyadic Contributions of Empathic Accuracy and Perceived Empathic Effort to Relationship Satisfaction](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/fam-26-2-236.pdf)

* More evidence that women love the dark triad personality traits, perhaps especially so when properly wielded through dread game.
* More evidence that women in general love drama in relationships, and thus require some form of ""upkeep game"" if a man wishes to maintain a long term relationship with them.
* This further explains why married women tend to have much lower sex drives (with their husbands) than women who are in less committed but long term relationships. Once a woman feels she has secured enough of a commitment to no longer fear her husband's extramarital activities, she may develop apathy towards the relationship entirely.
* Evidence that women will use psychological manipulation to test their relationships strength (evidence of shit testing).

[Married Men Are a Better Catch, Ladies Believe](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Married-Men-Are-a-Better-Catch-Ladies-Believe-119241.shtml)

* Proof of pre-selection, a quite commonly wielded tactic in pickup.
* This may also be closely related to disqualification techniques in pickup. By using a disqualification technique on a woman, you effectively displaying a lack of need for her sex, which means you are getting it somewhere else, or her value is much lower then your own. Either way this should conjour feelings of sexual desire and work towards the favor of the man in achieving his goal of copulation.

[New Study Finds Women's Brains Recognize, Encode Smell of Male Sexual Sweat](http://www.rice.edu/nationalmedia/news2009-01-08-sweat.shtml)

* Yet more evidence that the underlying biomechanics of reproduction play a much larger role in sexual selection that most of us would like to admit.
* This particular study reminds me of a recent 5-minute lay I pulled off. I walked up to a women at a party, engaged in small talk while lightly kinoing her, and within moments I could feel an erection comming on.

Who would've thought in two short months we’d be at a thousand readers?


As we grow, we gain more attention. There have already been a few small outbreaks where different corners of the internet have discovered us and had their private bashing sessions. They don’t like what we’re saying.


Every time I see a discussion denouncing our viewpoint I notice they all have something in common: They all mischaracterize our standpoint and rally the troops against it. 


It’s easier for them to characterize us as rapists than for them to develop a coherent argument against our viewpoint. There’s a reason for that. Because there is no argument against us. There is only truth and that which fails the truth test. We already dismiss the lies.


How much denial must one embrace to assume that we’re just an outlier group of misfits that don’t understand women? We’re growing, ladies. We’re growing. And we’re not stopping. Surely, if there were no truth to our theories, men wouldn't stumble upon our group and think, “wow, these guys describe everything that’s happened in my life…”


We’re at a thousand members now. And that’s two months. Consider that. Think about it.


We’re not a hate group. We’re not violent. We’re not rapists. We’re just men. Doing what men have always done.  And you don’t have to like it. Because all the other women *love it*. 


We don’t care if you understand. We think you shouldn't, and rightly assume you won’t. That doesn't matter.

All right guys there is a lot to be said about this video from a Red Pill perspective.

Lets start with indisputable facts:

The Teen Choice award live audience demographics is predominantly females 20 to 25. I know this because iv actually gone.

Ashton Kutcher isnt just an attractive actor, he is an intelligent guy  who produced and directed numerous high grossing films.

Ashton Kutcher has extensive experience in entertainment and has a firm understanding of how the industry works.

**Analysis:** When Ashton walks on stage he knows that the Teen Choice Award is bullshit, and is jaded by the whole spectacle. Ashton proceeds to attack the industry that gave him this award, however he does it under the auspices of helping the audience.

**My real Name is Chris**: Being a celebrity makes you a fetish object. Ashton begs the audience to listen to him he wants them to know that he is human just like them and begs for them to connect and listen to him on a person to person level.

**Opportunity is hard work:** This is an indirect attack on female entitlement. Ashton talks about how he used to work menial jobs and how hard work breeds success. A concept lost on this entitled generation.

**Sexy is being a well rounded adult:** Ashton attacks the entertainment industry for pushing consumerism. All a woman needs to be desirable to men is a good brain and a good heart, she doesn't need to spend thousands on being sexy.

**Life is made up by people no smarter than you:** Challenge norms push boundries life is what you make it. Don't let others make rules for you.

Chris wants the audience to snap out of it and see the world for what it really is. The chances of this happening is zero unfortunately these women are going to clap retardedly and fantasize about having sex with Ashton. No one gives a fuck about what Chris has to say.

These are twenty year old women and they cant see the man all they can see is his status. These women's inability to connect with the man makes them something less:

Going with Blue since it's about me.  

I dated a girl for 11 months - relationship ended 2 months ago, way before I discovered TRP. At one point she found a new job in the automotive industry - design. Ever since, she'd met a new man there who she'd occasionally talk about. She'd be texting him when we were together, on dates, etc. 

In one instance I took her out for dinner. She's not completely insensitive so I would notice her realizing that she was constantly texting this guy and put her phone away. Same night, I drive her home and she says she's tired and has work in the morning. I understand. I get home, I find that she's on skype (with whom I later find out was the same guy.) She stayed up beyond 2 a.m., at which point my beta self decided to stop waiting.

Ever since she met this man, she would talk about how much of a douchebag he is. That he was such an ass. Eventually I'd ask why she still associated with him, and she'd have no answer.

Later on he'd asked her to go with him on a road trip over a weekend - to which she **accepted**. 

I could go on and on about how this guy, who I presume was/is an alpha, had a hold on my ex. The point is that the more I think about things, the more effective TRP seems to me.

Out recently with a few friends, 3 guys, one of which I work with and is kinda a wing, but he rejects most of my advice and is happy with low hanging fruit from OKC and letting me do the opening.  One of the others is married and the other is getting married in November.

We hit a local bar for some food, then a lesbian bar that does plays some great music and cheap drinks. Also, lesbians, I love lesbians.

Somehow we got onto some TRP topics, and I was of course informed I was wrong, and NAWALT.  The guy that is getting married in November looks a little pissed at me, I was out with his fiancée two weeks before, nothing happened beyond sexy dancing.

 At some point a lovely blonde (claire, 8) and an older women had came into the bar, and my wing and I noticed her as she went to get a drink.  I suggested he went up and say hello, which he refused to do so, sarcastically responding ""why don't you use your awesome powers"".

As we were all going out for a smoke, I figured it was a natural time box and approached her.  She was very responsive, and we were hugging within a minute or so, and she suggested I join her and her mother (the older lady with her) for a drink when I came back from my smoke.

When we returned I noticed there was a guy sitting at their table across from them, he had been chatting to her at the bar, but she never introduced me to him, so I figured he was no one important.

As I walked to their table, Claire see me coming over and moved her bag that was next to her to the floor and waved me to sit next to her. As I sit she take my hand to pull me closer and put my arm around her waist.

She introduces me to her mum, and then the shit tests start from both of them.  I push/pull a little by pretending to stand up and leave, they both drag me back down.  It's all fun and the vibe is good.  She is making a lot of contact and eye contact, and her mum is reaching over to also initiate some touching. The other guy was pretty much out the conversation as soon as I sat down and left, I didn't notice when.

After about 20mins, Claire asks if I smoke, and if she can borrow one.  We get up, I offer my arm, which she accepts and as we walk out I let it drop and take her hand, which she squeezes.

As soon as we are outside I spin her into me and k-closed her.  After a few mins I pull back, and she laughs saying I was bold and fun.  She then proceeds to tell me how she lives b herself, but recently got back with her boyfriend, he wants her to move back in, but she likes living on her own.  We kiss a few more times between her moaning about her boyfriend and me calling her a terrible person.  It's closing time in the bar, so her mother joins us, as they head home.  I never #-closed her as she lives across from the bar, and I said I would see her around.

My wing and I head to a club, and bump into a girl, Jill, from our work.  She has a boyfriend, but her and my wing have kissed a few times drunk.  I've turned her down numerous times and used her as a wing women.  She has 4 pals with her, one I'm crazy about, who endlessly flirts with me but has a boyfriend, one that I know fairly well but not interested in and two I've never meet before. One is a black chick called Sabrina, easy 9.  We say hello and leave them to it.

Wing and I dance a little, and hit the smoking area.  I open every set, get few k-closes with some cute 6-7s, #-closes and a slap or two, while he hangs around with the first set I opened.  His game is so slow and awkward, it's painful to watch.

I spot Jill and friends sitting down, so I grab my wing and head over, taking a seat next to Sabrina.  Again there is some random guy sitting with them, Sabrina asks me to get rid off, so I nice guy him out and he leaves.  We hit it off instantly, lots of kino, heavy eye contact, whispering in each others ears and creating inside jokes. Things are going well. We head in to dance, and I pull the usually arm to hand holding trick.

On the dance floor I'm dancing with them all, taking time to spin and slap all their asses, grind, etc.  At some point Sabrina isolates me and pulls me onto her so her ass in my crotch and starts to grind it.  I figure this is as good a time as any for the k-close, so I soon her round and k-close.  During the dancing I have been holding a can of beer, and out of no where Jill smashes into us, sending my beer flying.

I turn to say ""wtf"" and she cuts me off by yelling ""Someone with a face like yours has no right to flirt with girls the way you do."" And proceeds give me shit for hitting on her friends, being a dick, trying to kiss Sabrina when the other girl I flirt with was there, etc.

At first I thought she was playing around, but when it became clear she was being serious, I walked away to the smoking area.  Of course she followed me, continuing to call me names and curse me out.  When it became clear she was not going to stop, I walked away, got my jacket and left the club.  Unfortunately she completely broke my frame, and I wasn't up to doing any post-club street game.

I woke up the next day with a text sent at 4am apologising and that I have a lovely face.  I ignored it for a day and text back telling her she can make it up by being my wing women next weekend.

Consider Feminism, the ""pro-women"" (they claim) movement. Feminism actually is anti-men. Feminism bases itself on lessening men, in order for women to be built up. This explains the familiar charge of 'woman-hating', as feminists, they ***are*** man-hating, so to them it's only natural that the Red Pill movement is women hating, after all, its what they did.

This also explains the term 'Toxic masculinity' which has been spit out semi-frequently by feminists. For a long time I felt it was a nonsense term, but I finally realized: Toxic Masculinity is the attitude of feminists. They are the one's who actively seek to destroy the feminine, and shame woman who are feminine.

I ignored all instincts to be gentle or make love.  I just rocked her and she loved it. Didn't let her spend the night.  Sent her home.  Confidence way up.  Game dramatically improving.

Before tonight, the last girl I had sex with other than my ex was when George W. Bush was president.  

I am lifting weights daily, dressing sharp, learning game, learning red pill theory, and now getting laid.  I still have 2 other plates spinning.  I want to fuck them too.  Should be easy simce my comfidence is up.  I have a comma in my bank account and I'm ready to keep improving.

And to think, if events had played out differently I would have been financially tied to a girl who did not appreciate me and was lazy in bed.  Her family and friends hated me.  All my time and money would have gone into this.  It likely would have ended in divorce.  

Instead, I am a free man with options.  My ex is but a memory.  

I am so grateful for TRP and all the support and advice I've received. 

Questions

1.) how to deal with the girl I fucked tonight.  She will want to start a relationship and get serious.  What's the best way to respond to this?  I still want to keep fucking her...she was incredible. I don't want to be her BF though

2.) do I tell my other spinning plates, if they ask, that I slept with another girl I'm seeing?

3.) do I let the plates know that I am seeing other girls?  This will soon come up

I've pretty much kept up to date with most of the current topics in men's rights and in red pill ideas. So, when this happened, I thought you guys might enjoy my story.

I'm currently living with my brother in a small apartment in a suburb of Dallas. Let's call him Drew. Both Drew and I are similar in a lot of ways. We share common interests and hobbies. He has the worst taste in women and got burned because of it. Because he's well educated and is pretty rational in general, he has learned through trial and error about shit tests and the like, and how to deal with them (well, mostly). But in general, he's a blue pill factory.

Drew met his current girlfriend online through a dating site and they jumped headlong into an LTR. They probably had about two dates before they moved into the LTR.

For financial reasons, she moved in with us at the start of the summer. She's a college student, and can't afford an apartment on the type of money she'd be making. So the white knight steps in and offers her our place, rent free. In exchange for rent, her duties included keeping the common areas clean and cooking semi-regularly so I don't have to when I get home from work (my income and his unemployment make it possible to live where we do).

Generally speaking, its our rule that I don't get involved in his sex life if he doesn't get involved in mine. So when she came to live with us, I mostly paid her no attention, and went on with my life.

I get home from work and I can hear shouting from our apartment. Its pretty late as I have a long commute, and as I go up to see what the hell is going on I notice all the lights are on, I notice that the front door is open.

They're standing in the living room going at it like George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. Because my memory isn't that good and I can't remember what they said exactly, suffice it to say she was not happy at all that she had to cook.

But I didn't write this to describe the first bit of the conversation. The worst part was when my brother said ""If you won't cook, and you won't clean, you need to pay rent.""

Shit hit the fan.

In no time flat she was on the floor (literally), bawling her eyes out. I work with children. All I could think of was a very ugly two year old in a tantrum because she didn't get her cookie. I had never seen a supposedly grown woman act like this. I sat and watched as Drew tried to plead with her to stop crying about how he was being unfair and how the only reason she had to cook was that I (she used the phrase ""that fucking bastard,"" by which she meant me) was to lazy to do it himself, so she was forced to. I did my best ""who, me?"", went into my room, and locked the door.

The next morning my brother told me that after I left, she ran into the bathroom and locked the door, refusing to come out (I did a similar thing when I was 5). Fortunately my brother had some red pill left over and decided to just leave her to sit in her own shit test for a while. I then told Drew that if she ever pulled that kind of shit again, she would be gone. He agreed.

That was a few months ago, and its happened a few times since. Every single time I remind him of our agreement, but because he ""loves"" her he probably will never pull the plug. Start of semester cannot come fast enough.

1375038067.0,28,self.TheRedPill,1j88gz,The importance of passion and goal setting,50,22,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1j88gz/the_importance_of_passion_and_goal_setting/,"With the ever growing numbers here at TRP, I've noticed a flood of /r/relationship reposts highlighting weak relationships. Though these posts are great examples for those swallowing the red pill for the first time, they often lack any real advice for those looking to not fall into the trap of modern day dating. 

If you've read the sidebar material then you know modern day dating is a trap. Sure, most of you will be angry for awhile. I myself went on a rage trying to convert friends, calling out women regularly, and feeling rather hopeless about the situation. 

Luckily, this all changed when I was talking to my brother-in-law about his failing marriage with my sister. The two of them had been together 12 years before getting hitched and now that they have their relationship has fallen to shit. Why? Because their identities are so invested in each other that every little emotion becomes amplified. Shit like ""I can't believe she liked something on facebook before saying good morning to me."" has become the norm in their relationship. 

This is why I cannot preach enough to new followers of TRP to find something you are passionate about. There are too many of us, myself included, just floating along without the slightest clue as to what makes us happy. Once you discover that passion for living and challenging yourself not only will you be able to have more authentic relationships (because you aren't putting pressure on others to give you something), but you'll be much happier in general. Every morning becomes a challenge you look forward to taking on as opposed to the enslavement of doing something you hate strictly for money.

Don't know what you're passionate about? Make finding out your passion your passion. Try new things, challenge yourself, and see how you feel afterwards. I'm not advocating that you quit your job and join the circus, however, pushing towards a lifestyle that you want is one of the greatest journeys a man can take. It doesn't happen overnight and, if you're lucky, you may realize that the journey itself is the reward.  

Also, for those still in highschool or college unsure of what you are doing, the best advice I can give you is: don't let the pressures of others put pressure on you. If you truly love what you are doing then you won't have a problem investing tons of energy and time into it which is a great foundation for success. 

On a completely unrelated side note, stop putting pussy on a pedestal. This goes out to the people who don't want a women that's had multiple partners. Sure these unicorns exist, but this is still vag-worshiping. Take a second to imagine if you had the amount of sex being offered to you that most 5+ women do and then tell me that you wouldn't be stopping to see every float taking part in the pussy parade. It's okay to have boundaries and not want to marry some of these chicks, but slut shaming is still a reactive behaviour. Real men act, they don't react.

I'm a student of TRP seeking advice on how to best respond to a girl (we'll call her M) who's trying to pull the LJBF line. M is a very attractive girl and thats largely why I pursued her when I was still a blue pill. Among my cringeworthy mistakes was allowing my emotions to get the better of me; I told M guarded secrets about myself, thereby destroying any mystery about me. Unsurprisingly, she lost interest and returned to her ex as a result. When she told me about this, I was crushed and her question, ""can we still be friends?"" seemed innocuous. Foolishly, I said yes. In retrospect, I've realized that I dodged a bullet with my own incompetence; M is emotional, impulsive, indecisive, and a feminist.

Since then (8 months ago) I've entered grad school and used the transition as an opportunity to improve myself (clothing, game, exercise, learning RP theory, etc). Applying the Red Pill is like seeing the power of realpolitik in a market full of idealists!

Anyway, I recently received a text from M asking why I haven't contacted her and spoken to her, missing our conversations as ""pals"". In a few months I'll go from not seeing her on campus at all to seeing her often, so I anticipate that she'll want some explanation for why I'm not speaking to her. I realize that she is simply seeking attention and favours from an orbiting beta, but I've decided that I'm not interested in playing along with the LJBF game. She's just not worth keeping around when there so many dateable women, and its not like I would keep her around for intellectually stimulating conversations. In short, I stand to gain nothing from this ""friendship"" while she looks for attention and favours.

**My question is, how do I diplomatically snuff a fake ""friendship"" arrangement without making an enemy of her?** I'm not interested in getting out from the friendzone to a level of attraction (I blew that royally), I just want to get rid of it without being left with a petty, vindictive woman and a common social circle.

http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ia3xs/exploration_of_redpill_ideas/

His quote: ""One thing that seems to be ignored is the fact that it is not just women who conduct shit tests, but rather it is everyone.""

Note: These topics may have been discussed before on this thread, but I felt that revisiting it and rediscussing it can lead to more insight.

Now the reason I put these up (not tooting my own horn, just want to have a discussion), is that we are discovering things about ourselves as a species on this subreddit that are helping us maneuver through our social interactions everyday.  Under the assumption of evolution, we are all animals, civilized animals.  We can create skyscrapers, build nukes, fly planes, yet deep down, there is that subconscious that we still strive to understand. 

In TRP, the sidebar says ""The Red Pill: Discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.""  From what I've read, over my time in TRP, I have seen alot of ideas and some ""growth"" to these ideas, leading to new ones, one of which I am proposing today.

We, as men, identify the issues that exist today, in 2013.  However, these issues have existed since man has existed.  Instead, we are putting words to these issues, giving them light, and most importantly, comprehending them.  

These two links I put up brought to light something very important.  The perpetrators of the issues that we, as men, face, are not just women.  Its EVERYONE.

Kids will shit test you, push you to your limits (which is where good parenting comes in to set the boundaries).  Hell, everyone does, people won't want to be your friend if you don't pass their shit tests, women won't want to fuck you if you don't pass their shit tests.  Men and women BOTH hamster (or rationalize), who does it more is another question.  

Now, this is as far as I am going to go.  My goal with this posting, is to uncover, identify, and EXPAND the ideals of TRP into more than just sexual strategy.  This is about life, primal, unadulterated, pure, animalistic, YET civilized life.  We have evolved as a species, but we still maintain these concepts like ""shit tests"" to see who is better than who, who will add to MY value, who will help ME survive in the long run.

TRP is all about becoming a man.  This man must be a leader, not just to women, but to EVERYONE.  This man is the one who strives to survive, not take anyone's shit, and will let you go at the drop of a hat in order to ensure his own survival.  This may seem selfish but remember, the only person responsible for your own actions is you.  People will do mind boggling, eye opening things just to ensure their own survival.  So just remember how selfish other people can be, and how they could easily leave you in the dust when it comes to saving their own skin.  But also use good judgment too and make sure your actions are justified.  The ideas of being a leader to everyone, not just women, has been mentioned and even emphasized in TRP, but I, at least, feel that it hasn't caught on like it could, or even should.

Basically, I hope that, in this post, and possibly in this subreddit, we can talk more about growing as men, and more importantly focusing on what social concepts we encounter in everyday life that affect our survival and our standing in society, instead of focusing on JUST women.  In a sense, climbing to the top of the proverbial ladder and staying there.  By being a leader to everyone, we assert our social dominance over everyone, thus increasing our chances of survival as men.

TL;DR-Expand TRP ideals to focus not just on issues with women but issues we as men face in everyday life, more so socially, in a primal way.

It was a Tuesday evening, and I was joining a few work colleagues at a presentation being given by a fairly well known developer in my fields community.  After it, 4 of us went to a bar across the road.  The bar is on a street called The Royal Mile in the center of Edinburgh, and if you know Edinburgh, you will know this is one of the most popular places for tourists as it leads to the castle.

I get us to sit at a table next to the main entrance so I can keep an eye on who comes in.  After a few drinks I head out for a smoke.  While standing outside, a couple walks past me, and straight away the girls is making strong eye contact, she holds it while she walks past me, turning her head to maintain it as they enter the bar.  Intriguing.

I enter the venue and notice them standing at the bar, ordering a drink, the girl is still staring at me.  At this point I'm still not sure about doing the approach, a male/female set of tourists usually end up being boyfriend/girlfriend (which can go interesting, I have banged a girl who was on holiday with her boyfriend because she really wanted to sleep with someone from Scotland).  I join into my friends conversation, keeping an eye on her and making faces at her when we make strong eye contact, she smiles or laughs.

About 15 mins pass, and I notice she is arguing with the guy she is with, lots of hand movement, he tries to drag her away from the bar.  After a few minutes of this, he storms out the bar.  Game on.

I head out for a smoke, and when I enter the girl is standing with the back to the bar, her body full open, plans out, legs apart, and she is eye fucking me the entire time I am walking to my friends.  I stand at my group:

""Guys, it's my round, what do you want?""

I get the orders and then tell them ""Look, I'm going to be returning with someone, but I really need a piss, so can you keep her company for me?""

I am meet with disbelief, and mocking, as always. ""STFU scottishredpill""

I head to the bar and stand next to her with her on my right, I raise my right foot onto the bar foot rest, so I have to turn my head to engage with her and she turns and faces me, her left side is pointed towards the bar.  I turn to her:

""Hi""

""Hi"" in a thick accent

""Tourist?""

""Yes, is it the accent?""

""No, it's the backpack and the god awful trainers you are wearing""

""Haha"" touches my arm ""Are they that bad?""

I move my body, swapping my feet around so I can face her a little more, I place my hand on her right hip and look her up and down ""They are truly terrible, I wouldn't be seen dead in something similar!""

She places her hand on the wrist of the arm I have on her hip, smiling ""Ha, I have nice shoes, I like nice shoes""

""Liar""

She squeezes my arm and laughs.  I notice the barman is waiting, so I drop my hand and return to my original position and order the drinks.

""I am here with my brother, we are visiting Scotland for a few weeks""

""Is that right?""

""Yes, we arrived in Edinburgh yesterday""

""Seen much of the city?""

""Yes, we went to the castle and some other places""

""Wearing your terrible shoes""

Laughing ""Yes, wearing my terrible shoes""

At this point the barman has finished pours mt drinks ""Grab those beers for me, I'm sitting over here""

I grab two of the drinks and walk off, and she follows.  On reaching my group, I tell her whose drinks she had and introduce her to the group and I get her to sit on a bench

""Wait here, I need to go to the toilet, my friends won't bite.""

She laughs and nods and I head to the toilet.

As I return, she is staring at me and smiling.  I sit next to her, and she moves her legs to bring them onto the bench, knees pointed towards me, legs apart.

I start discussing her plans for her trip, turns out she is leaving the next day and travelling to a part of the country I know well to do some hiking, so I recommend some places, making sure to bring in emotional phrases.

""It's amazing walking up some of the hills here, reaching the top and looking over the deep valleys is awe inspiring, really takes your breath away and feel so lucky to live in a beautiful country""

We discuss clubbing, the kind of music she likes, how their nights start later because clubs close late.  During all of this, her hands are either on my thigh, or in my hands and her eye contact is pretty much constant.  After about 20 mins or so she starts talking about how she has to have an early night because they are leaving early in the morning.  I take this as a signal to move things along.

I tell her I am going out for a smoke, and she says she will join me.  I take her hand and lead her out the bar, and as we walk out, I pull her into me and kiss her.

After a few minutes we stop, and she looks at me and says ""I am staying at xxx hotel, come with me."" (I know the hotel well as an ex and I used to stay there when we visited Edinburgh before I moved through)

""I can't, I have work tomorrow, got to behave on a school night""

""You don't strike me as a person who ever behaves""

""Ha, you know me so well already""  

""You shouldn't smoke, it's bad for you""

""I know, many things are""

""Let's go, I have to go""

""No, I can't, sorry""

""Ok, I am going back to my hotel, I will have a drink at the bar, for one hour, if you change your mind come""

We say good bye and she leaves, I finish my smoke and head back to my friends.  After receiving a well done, you got lucky from them, they proceed to rag on my for not bringing her back in, I don't tell them about the hotel (if I'm later for work, the last thing I need is them knowing why) and the one hour time limit I have.

We finish our drinks, and we go our seperate ways, I head to the hotel she mentioned.  She is sitting at the bar with a glass of wine, she smiles ""I knew you would come""

""Aren't you full of yourself?""

Laughs ""I like you"" gets up and takes my hand ""Let's go to my room"" tries to walk from the bar

""Wait, I'm not that easy, you can at least buy me a drink!"" tugging her back

Laughing ""Stop it, lets go, I have to get up early"" and I let her drag me to her room.

1362508638.0,32,self.TheRedPill,19pyj5,The red pill was the only thing that made sense of my past relationships.,38,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/19pyj5/the_red_pill_was_the_only_thing_that_made_sense/,"I was raised to be extremely Gamma (White Knight).  It didn't make any sense to not be as nice as possible to a girl, especially for someone like me who was happy to get any girl's attention, which I didn't start to get until my mid-20s (was skinny with lots of acne in my teen years, had no female attention).  In my mid-20s I had two relationships, the first I ever had (my looks department began to mature and I actually looked like a man).  One relationship lasted a month, and one a week.  The first girl broke up with me over AIM telling me that I wasn't her kind of guy (she was a pretty rough-around-the-edges lower class girls with tats and generally hung around gangsta-types; met her at a warehouse where I had worked).  Nothing had gone wrong up to that point in the relationship, but I became almost obsessed with her after that breakup.  I was so broken up I lost 30 lbs. because I couldn't eat very much and threw up a lot for several months afterwards.  

Pathetic, right?  Seriously, I was pathetic then and I had made a vow to myself to never get sick in the stomach again from a girl.  A couple years later I met a girl in college.  She was super cute, she looked like a very young Sela Ward.  I was extremely attracted to her because she was the most feminine girl I'd ever had a chance to hang out with (I had never really appreciated a very feminine girl until I met her, I was attracted to athletic girls primarily) and we had a ton in common, everything from humor to comfort food.  The first, and only, week we were together was stellar, I had never experienced being totally infatuated with someone before and her infatuated with me.  The sad thing was the first, and only, week we were together we were separated because it was spring break.  We spent hours, literal hours, on the phone each night, I had never had a girl so into me before, I couldn't stop thinking about her, hell, she even liked my voice (and I hated my voice, so it meant a lot to me).  At the end of the week when she came back after the school break she acted very weird around me and I immediately knew something was up.  My stomach started to churn.  She broke up with me over the phone, I was in complete and utter disbelief.  It didn't feel real, it made no sense whatsoever to me from any angle I looked at it.  We were the perfect match as far as I was concerned, so what the hell happened?

It wasn't until I started to read red pill stuff that things began to make sense.  I smothered her in Beta.  I had written her several extremely beta love letters on facebook, which I thought was casanova at the time, but didn't realize how much of a pedestal I was putting her on, like practically worshiping her because I liked her so much and she was giving me attention I had never had.  Before the red pill, I had no idea how much of a turn off those actions would be.  Had I known game, I might possibly still be with her today and kept her attracted to me, but that's oneitis speaking (she still invades my dreams now and then, which is annoying as hell).  It's so obvious once you realize it, that pedestalization of a woman is relationship suicide, but before the red pill it was a mystery that I couldn't solve because every authority in my life had told me that was how to behave towards women.  I lost a lot of good years being insecure about myself and not learning about women until my mid 20s, it is up to the red pill community, the only community that truly understands the plight of the natural beta-male, to help young men learn that being yourself is stupid fucking advice, but here is how you attract women and keep their attraction.

My story ends well in the present.  I met and married a woman who is very feminine and athletic and we've been very happy together for several years.  I know how to keep her attraction, I've applied some of the basic tenets of the red pill community and have seen firsthand that it works.  I've confirmed a lot of things, that my wife gets turned on when I act like a man, and turned off when I act like a boy, and it feels goddamn good to finally have some sense of control over my life.  I am also not worried about losing my wife, not because I'm some cold hearted asshole who doesn't love his wife, but if she ever leaves or dies I know I can get another woman.  It is very liberating for any beta male to know that he has a plan, a base of knowledge, on how to get other women should his current one fail.  To be honest, I'd really hate to lose my wife, but that's the risk you take when you get married, and, full disclosure, I'm a Christian so getting married was part of the plan (I had an opportunity to have sex with the first girlfriend but turned her down because I was saving it for marriage.  Sometimes I feel stupid as fuck for saving myself because I haven't met any girl who is somewhat attractive who is a virgin, even among the Christians).  

I will close this by saying that the red pill community was/is the only thing that has validated my manhood and respected me for wanting to be a man.  No other person or institution has ever done this, and I would say today that one of the greatest strengths a man can have is to have no fear of any woman, ever.

Obviously, she was upset, and probably very turned on. She proceeded to send our entire texting history to my gf over Facebook in hopes that she would be able to break us up. ""if I can't have you, no one can"" kind of thing.

Nothing could have been better for me though. Remember boys and girls, women ALL want the alpha male. A huge indicator of ones alpha status is how many other women want a man. This knowledge is very important for any red pill man.

My girlfriend confronted me in tears. I tell her ""baby, this dumb bitch wants my cock so bad. She wants to be the one in my bedroom on a full time basis getting fucked by me and she's soooo jealous of you. It drives her crazy to see you succeed where she fails. That's all this is about. She wants what you have and since she can't have it, she wants to take it away from you. Don't feed this girl. Don't get upset, I'm yours""

More red pill facts: women despise men who share their emotions the same way men dispose women who indiscriminately sleep with anyone and everyone. To them, a man who shares his emotions is slutty and dispicable, but they don't care about how many women you sleep with, in fact, the more the better. It actually tens them on because preselection means Alpha.

Knowing this, I say ""besides, she's just a dumb bitch, she means nothing to me. I never cheated on you emotionally."" she says ""well that girl seems to think you're in love with her"" I say ""she's a dumb bitch. That's just standard game, babe, I only love you"".

Make up sex was great, and she cooks more and cleans more because she wana to prove that she's better than te other girls. Also, this other chick was pretty hot, which increases my alpha value further.

Blue pill betas like general petraeus and tiger woods Apologized for their infidelity. If you own it, you become a champion. A Viking of a man. 

Please note, if I was married or lovin with either of these broads, they could have divorced me and taken half my money for EEEVER. But since they give the sex away to anyone with game, I have no need to risk my well being. Let the red pill save you. Go after that pussy, never commit, let a beta marry your leftovers.

Not specifically seduction or game based, but interesting books with useful information and knowledge.",49,19,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i5el7/useful_books_for_trp_not_specifically_seduction/,"Hello.  I just wanted to get a list of non-seduction type books going from the readers here.  These books could be about anything, fiction or non-fiction, historical, philosophical, etc.  

I feel like it would be good to have some quality (non-""game"" themed"" books that illustrate and inform on understanding TRP.  So please, list some books that you think would be good to check out and why you think they are.  

Here are a few that I've liked:

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius----Philosophical book about ""stoicism"" and finding meaning in yourself even when faced with uncertain events.

Anything by Thomas Sowell.  This guy is a genius.  He writes on a variety of topics including economics, politics, race, the ""isms"", and much much more.  His works are very informative yet very easy to understand.  He is def. NOT PC...he tells it like it is and he backs it all up with data.  I really like ""A Conflict of Visions"", ""Intellectuals and Society"", ""Economic Facts and Fallacies"", ""Every Wonder Why?"", and a whole lot of his other works as well.  A good place to start would be with ""The Thomas Sowell Reader"".  It's a collection of articles from a lot of his works and gives a very broad and encompassing look at all types of issues that are at play with TRP.  

Rhetoric by Aristotle---This is the book, and the man, that ""invented"" logic.  It's not an easy read (a lot of his work can be like reading a lease) but it lays out the forms of logic, the fallacies used in arguments, and how you can become more persuasive.  Also, like many older/ancient books, you can get them for free online.  This book, and others based on it, can REALLY help you see things from a logical standpoint and quickly identify bullshit arguments/statements.  

The Virtue of Selfishness by Ayn Rand----Some people like her, some don't.  Whatever.  This isn't a novel, it is more of a philosophic book about why YOU should come first in your life and how if everyone took care of themselves, there would be less burden on others to do so, and we'd live better, more meaningful lives.  This is a quick read and I feel it really applies to TRP b/c it's about how striving for your own happiness IS actually a good thing.  

Thus Spoke Zarathustra or other works by Friedrich Nietzsche---His works have strong themes of becoming what you want, seizing the power, observations about human nature, the ""Master-Slave morality"" (From On the Genealogy of Morality.  This is very relevant to true unplugged human behavior)

The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek----This book pretty plainly spells out the dangers of collectivism and collectivist thought.  It highlights the disdain for the individual at the behest of the collective.  

Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt----Pretty short, quick, and concise book that does a good job of explaining how economics works in reality, aside from all the bullshit you'll hear on TV, major newspapers, etc.  Hazlitt and Hayek were colleagues.  

The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and F. Engels----I would include this book, b/c you can see where sooooooooo much of the bullshit of today comes from.  It really is astonishing how feminism is just repackaged Marxism and how they ""plan"" on getting to their utopia.  I guess it's kind of like looking at the other teams' playbook in a way.  Along these same lines........

Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky----A lot of these rules are being used against people everyday and they don't know it.  If one can identify the tactics, they are much easier to defeat.    

My background is in politics/philosophy, economics, and law so my above selections likely show that.  But I think they are great books that can really help people unplug.  (I mean there is a reason why people don't want you to learn about Aristotle or how the economy actually works....b/c then you'll be more logical and less apt to fall for the constant stream of bullshit coming at you!)

I'm a US Marine and I consider myself an Alpha. I've been married for 2 years now and it seems I'm fighting a losing battle with my marriage. I have always been the sole provider and I trust my wife to take care of things at home e.g. cook and clean, and pay bills. With that being said I would still on occasion cook and clean on my own just so I could help out. Although I still considered these tasks to be her duties as a housewife and (soon to be) stay at home mom. 

Over the course of these 2 years I've experienced what felt like is her relegating my role as a Marine and husband from being an Alpha male at home to more of a beta. When we first met I believed she was attracted to me because of my assertiveness and the control I just assumed over our relationship, but now she gets upset when I'm ""yelling"" or that my uniforms and gear are in the house instead of down in the garage.

It's like I'm being marginalized by her. Working on my bike or my car in the garage is a ""waste"" to her and I spend too much time using the computer rather than watching TV with her. And the things I used to do to help her out have become more of a responsibility rather than a polite gesture. The only guilt-free  time I get to myself is at the gym. 



Is my wife turning me into a beta? and how can I fucking change this??

So we spoke last night, and we spoke about going for a drink and I was being a bit flirty to which she goes ""I don't think my boyfriend would like that""

Me ""I dont care what anyone thinks. Oh whos that?""

Her ""the guy who I told you about before""

Me ""wasn't he supposed to leave?""

Her ""yes, but it didn't pan out""

Me ""wow thats, great, its sweet, he confessed he loved you, whether he was leaving or not, And look at you now! Completely together. Shows no matter what, he clearly values you very high, and needs to have you no matter what.""

Her ""yeah you are right!""

Me ""def, however shows that he'd do almost anything for you. Could mean he's needy, but its not an issue""

Her ""No no, yes he does care deeply, but he is very strong guy, no needyness for sure from him.""

Me ""Sure, he holds you in very high regard for sure.""

Every girl that buys into that shit feels some sort of undeserved entitlement.  Sadly, this  load of shit is repeatedly fed to them day in and day out and the victim mentality becomes reality for them.  To them, they CAN'T see the other side.  This is what I call the Magic School Bus analogy.  The clean slated female gets aboard the bus at the ripe age of zero and their tour guide(their TV) begins blasting propaganda and lies to reinvent the scorn that some old women felt 60 years ago. While in the Magic School Bus, they experience the world behind the windows of the bus.  When they step off the bus, their views of men and society are so perverted and dense that their immediate reaction is to play the victim card and say everything is not fair because their expectations were not met.

In my time of gaming of approx 2.5 months, I have run into some feminists that have REALLY thrown some wild shit tests.  Being as inexperienced as I am, I will admit that I got blown out severely several times, however, there was one instance where I pulled a James Bond and broke through her line of Bullshit.  The result was immediate surrender and instant attraction unlike I have experienced before.  I think Feminists have a VERY strong frame due to the training they receive from society.  If your frame is more dominant and you can bring them down a couple notches, her attraction that follows is THAT MUCH more sincere and strong.  Its like they are waiting for some Man to put them in their place and not deal with their bullshit.  When they run into these types of guys, their DNA takes over and the Feminist mindset takes a backseat so she can get stuffed with the alpha's sperm.

""Women are directly adapted to act as the nurses and educators of our early childhood, for the simple reason that **they themselves are childish, foolish, and short-sighted—in a word, are big children all their lives, something intermediate between the child and the man**, who is a man in the strict sense of the word. Consider how a young girl will toy day after day with a child, dance with it and sing to it; and then consider what a man, with the very best intentions in the world, could do in her place.""

""With girls, Nature has had in view what is called in a dramatic sense a “striking effect,” for **she endows them for a few years with a richness of beauty and a, fulness of charm at the expense of the rest of their lives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy of a man to such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honourable care of them, in some kind of form, for a lifetime—a step which would not seem sufficiently justified if he only considered the matter**.  Accordingly, **Nature has furnished woman, as she has the rest of her creatures, with the weapons and implements necessary for the protection of her existence and for just the length of time that they will be of service to her**; so that Nature has proceeded here with her usual economy. Just as the female ant after coition loses her wings, which then become superfluous, nay, dangerous for breeding purposes, **so for the most part does a woman lose her beauty after giving birth to one or two children; and probably for the same reasons.**""

Man reaches the maturity of his reasoning and mental faculties scarcely before he is eight-and-twenty; woman when she is eighteen; but hers is reason of very narrow limitations. This is why women remain children all their lives, **for they always see only what is near at hand, cling to the present, take the appearance of a thing for reality, and prefer trifling matters to the most important**. It is by virtue of man’s reasoning powers that he does not live in the present only, like the brute, but observes and ponders over the past and future; and from this spring discretion, care, and that anxiety which we so frequently notice in people. The advantages, as well as the disadvantages, that this entails, make woman, in consequence of her weaker reasoning powers, less of a partaker in them. Moreover, she is intellectually short-sighted, for although her intuitive understanding quickly perceives what is near to her, on the other hand her circle of vision is limited and does not embrace anything that is remote; hence everything that is absent or past, or in the future, affects women in a less degree than men. This is why they have greater inclination for extravagance, which sometimes borders on madness. **Women in their hearts think that men are intended to earn money so that they may spend it, if possible during their husband’s lifetime, but at any rate after his death.**

**So that it will be found that the fundamental fault in the character of women is that they have no “sense of justice.**” This arises from their deficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, and reflection, but is also partly due to the fact that **Nature has not destined them, as the weaker sex, to be dependent on strength but on cunning; this is why they are instinctively crafty, and have an ineradicable tendency to lie.** For as lions are furnished with claws and teeth, elephants with tusks, boars with fangs, bulls with horns, and the cuttlefish with its dark, inky fluid, so Nature has provided woman for her protection and defence with the faculty of dissimulation, and all the power which Nature has given to man in the form of bodily strength and reason has been conferred on woman in this form. Hence, dissimulation is innate in woman and almost as characteristic of the very stupid as of the clever. Accordingly, it is as natural for women to dissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to their weapons when they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that in a certain measure they are only making use of their rights. Therefore a woman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is perhaps an impossibility. **This is why they see through dissimulation in others so easily; therefore it is not advisable to attempt it with them.** From the fundamental defect that has been stated, and all that it involves, spring falseness, faithlessness, treachery, ungratefulness, and so on. **In a court of justice women are more often found guilty of perjury than men...From time to time there are repeated cases everywhere of ladies, who want for nothing, secretly pocketing and taking away things from shop counters.**

**Nature has made it the calling of the young, strong, and handsome men to look after the propagation of the human race; so that the species may not degenerate.** This is the firm will of Nature, and **it finds its expression in the passions of women**. **This law surpasses all others in both age and power.** **Woe then to the man who sets up rights and interests in such a way as to make them stand in the way of it; for whatever he may do or say, they will, at the first significant onset, be unmercifully annihilated.** For the secret, unformulated, nay, unconscious but innate moral of woman is: We are justified in deceiving those who, because they care a little for us,—that is to say for the individual,—imagine they have obtained rights over the species. The constitution, and consequently the welfare of the species, have been put into our hands and entrusted to our care through the medium of the next generation which proceeds from us; let us fulfil our duties conscientiously.

But women are by no means conscious of this leading principle in abstracto, they are only conscious of it in concreto, and have no other way of expressing it than in the manner in which they act when the opportunity arrives. **So that their conscience does not trouble them so much as we imagine, for in the darkest depths of their hearts they are conscious that in violating their duty towards the individual they have all the better fulfilled it towards the species**, whose claim upon them is infinitely greater. 

Because women in truth exist entirely for the propagation of the race, and their destiny ends here, **they live more for the species than for the individual, and in their hearts take the affairs of the species more seriously than those of the individual. This gives to their whole being and character a certain frivolousness**, and altogether a certain tendency which is fundamentally different from that of man; and this it is which develops that discord in married life which is so prevalent and almost the normal state.

It is natural for a feeling of mere indifference to exist between men, but **between women it is actual enmity**. This is due perhaps to the fact that odium figulinum in the case of men, is limited to their everyday affairs, but with women embraces the whole sex; since they have only one kind of business. **Even when they meet in the street, they look at each other like Guelphs and Ghibellines**. And it is quite evident when two women first make each other’s acquaintance that they exhibit more constraint and dissimulation than two men placed in similar circumstances. This is why an exchange of compliments between two women is much more ridiculous than between two men. Further, while a man will, as a rule, address others, even those inferior to himself, with a certain feeling of consideration and humanity, **it is unbearable to see how proudly and disdainfully a lady of rank will, for the most part, behave towards one who is in a lower rank (not employed in her service) when she speaks to her. This may be because differences of rank are much more precarious with women than with us, and consequently more quickly change their line of conduct and elevate them, or because while a hundred things must be weighed in our case, there is only one to be weighed in theirs, namely, with which man they have found favour**; and again, because of the one-sided nature of their vocation they stand in closer relationship to each other than men do; and so it is they try to render prominent the differences of rank.

**It is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual instinct that could give that stunted, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race the name of the fair sex; for the entire beauty of the sex is based on this instinct.** One would be more justified in calling them the unaesthetic sex than the beautiful. Neither for music, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have they any real or true sense and susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in their desire to please, if they affect any such thing.

This makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in anything, and the reason for it is, I fancy, as follows. **A man strives to get direct mastery over things either by understanding them or by compulsion**. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to indirect mastery, namely through a man; all her direct mastery being limited to him alone. Therefore it lies in woman’s nature to look upon everything only as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything else is always a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends, consisting of coquetry and pretence. Hence Rousseau said, Les femmes, en général, n’aiment aucun art, ne se connoissent à aucun et n’ont aucun génie (Lettre à d’Alembert, note xx.). **Every one who can see through a sham must have found this to be the case**. **One need only watch the way they behave at a concert, the opera, or the play; the childish simplicity, for instance, with which they keep on chattering during the finest passages in the greatest masterpieces**. **If it is true that the Greeks forbade women to go to the play, they acted in a right way; for they would at any rate be able to hear something**. In our day it would be more appropriate to substitute taceat mulier in theatro for taceat mulier in ecclesia; and this might perhaps be put up in big letters on the curtain.

Nothing different can be expected of women if it is borne in mind that the **most eminent of the whole sex have never accomplished anything in the fine arts that is really great, genuine, and original, or given to the world any kind of work of permanent value**. This is most striking in regard to painting, the technique of which is as much within their reach as within ours; this is why they pursue it so industriously. Still, **they have not a single great painting to show, for the simple reason that they lack that objectivity of mind which is precisely what is so directly necessary in painting**. **They always stick to what is subjective**. For this reason, ordinary women have no susceptibility for painting at all: for natura non facet saltum. And Huarte, in his book which has been famous for three hundred years, Examen de ingenios para las scienzias, contends that women do not possess the higher capacities. Individual and partial exceptions do not alter the matter; women are and remain, taken altogether, the most thorough and incurable philistines; and **because of the extremely absurd arrangement which allows them to share the position and title of their husbands they are a constant stimulus to his ignoble ambitions**. And further, it is because they are philistines that modern society, to which they give the tone and where they have sway, has become corrupted. As regards their position, one should be guided by Napoleon’s maxim, Les femmes n’ont pas de rang; and regarding them in other things, Chamfort says very truly: Elles sont faites pour commercer avec nos faiblesses avec notre folie, mais non avec notre raison. Il existe entre elles et les hommes des sympathies d’épiderme et très-peu de sympathies d’esprit d’âme et de caractère. **They are the sexus sequior, the second sex in every respect, therefore their weaknesses should be spared, but to treat women with extreme reverence is ridiculous, and lowers us in their own eyes.** When nature divided the human race into two parts, she did not cut it exactly through the middle! The difference between the positive and negative poles, according to polarity, is not merely qualitative but also quantitative. **And it was in this light that the ancients and people of the East regarded woman; they recognised her true position better than we, with our old French ideas of gallantry and absurd veneration, that highest product of Christian–Teutonic stupidity.** These ideas have only served to make them arrogant and imperious, to such an extent as to remind one at times of the holy apes in Benares, who, in the consciousness of their holiness and inviolability, think they can do anything and everything they please.

**In the West, the woman, that is to say the “lady,” finds herself in a fausse position**; for woman, rightly named by the ancients sexus sequior, **is by no means fit to be the object of our honour and veneration**, or to hold her head higher than man and to have the same rights as he. The consequences of this fausse position are sufficiently clear. Accordingly, it would be a very desirable thing if this Number Two of the human race in Europe were assigned her natural position, and the lady-grievance got rid of, which is not only ridiculed by the whole of Asia, but would have been equally ridiculed by Greece and Rome. The result of this would be that the condition of our social, civil, and political affairs would be incalculably improved. The Salic law would be unnecessary; it would be a superfluous truism. The European lady, strictly speaking, is a creature who should not exist at all; but there ought to be housekeepers, and young girls who hope to become such; and they should be brought up not to be arrogant, but to be domesticated and submissive. **It is exactly because there are ladies in Europe that women of a lower standing, that is to say, the greater majority of the sex, are much more unhappy than they are in the East.**...",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,True,t3_1dfd3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dfd3x/philosopher_arthur_schopenhauer_on_women/,

I am here to listen. I do not post to SRS and roll my eyes when it comes up. Give your honest answers because I intend to take the answers I'm given and not stick my fingers in my ears and pout if I don't like them.

While reading this subreddit, I have not been angered. I feel like I should have been angered, but I'm just sort of saddened instead. There are some things that make me say ""hell yeah!"", such as for example I think women who are never willing to have sex and then get dumped shouldn't complain, because sometimes relationships involve doing things you don't want for the sake of the other person. But I'm not here to ask about the stuff I agree with.

One: do you believe that there are exceptions to the generalities about women? I see a lot about hypergamy, and about women naturally wanting to be submissive/controlled, but I've never related to that. Status is mostly irrelevant to me, and the degree I am working on (computer science) is one that will give me as much money as I need. I don't need excessively extravagant material items. I've always been glad that I won't need to burden someone with supporting me, and thought it was a 'plus'. There are guys in my class that I would date, and I'd also 'date down'. I have no desire to be an over-controlling or nagging girlfriend (that type of thing is just annoying), and on that matter I like a guy who is confident and decisive enough to assert himself and do his own thing. I just don't really want to be 'the submissive one'. Compromise is part of the relationship but I'd feel useless and like a burden for letting someone else be in charge of me or treat me like a teenager.

Two: I often see it mentioned that women do not have the same capability for achievement as men. I think, on average, there will be more genius/talented men than women (because there have been studies to prove it), but do you think it is impossible for women to be on some sort of higher level, even if it's rarer? I've always thought that life without the possibility of achievement would be fairly pointless.

I can understand a lot of red pill ideology, but these are my sticking points. To me, it seems so much better to be a man in a 'red pill' world where being a woman seems like you're stuck with having your entire value put on quickly-fleeting beauty and sex appeal. It frightens me. But I am trying to understand. I don't believe I'm in denial of what I really want - so, is there a place for women like me in a red pill world?

My divorce was not particularly traumatic (not having kids helped). I've never been cheated on that I know of (maybe in high school, but who cares). I'm not angry. I don't feel like I've ever been wronged by anyone. Rejection (I get shot down all the time) doesn't bother me.

When I look back on past relationships, I have no reason to be upset with women. I have a lot of good memories. I'm still friends with a lot of the women I've dated. The only thing I think is, I could have done better. The only thing I regret is that I didn't know then the things I know now.

Anyone else here have the same outlook as me?

So it turns out that a little bit power reduces one's 'mirror response' to watching what others do.  In essence the more power one has the less likely they will be reactive to the activities of others.  

I think this mechanism is the likely root of peoples acting out to get a reaction, which we know is a test, but the test is to accurately gauge power vs powerlessness.  

This is also likely why the dark triad while not actually being a measure of power is indistinguishable from actual power through fitness testing.

We are learning, I thought I knew it all weeks ago, I was wrong, I assume my friend is still learning too. Although we are different personalities, we are essentially becoming red pill.

Even before the Red Pill I was slowly evolving. I want to share some pointers.

It might be cheating, in the sense that I've had my buddy on my side to bounce theories, scenarios etc off, but essentially its all down to you.

I'd like to give some great pointers that I am sure you know, but will effectively change your life. In not so long, things have really changed for me and I'm not talking just about women;

1) Physique - Vital. Absolutely vital. People look at me differently now I work. I now have muscles. I stand up straight, people think I've grown. Find yourself routines and change them every 8-12 weeks (big thanks to my friend for that tip). I.e. Diet and Workout NOW.

2) Read - Beyond important. The things I've learnt Red Pill, and more are essential. I have no preference either. I'd read LOTR and loved every second. I read because its better then frying your brain and vegetating infront of that idiot box they call the TV and being brainwashed by blue pill bullshit. Read as often as you can.

3) Get a look - I'm going to say that I've completely changed my look. I was trendy-ish then wore loud t-shirts with spiderman on them to appear cool, now i just wear plain coloured shirts and polo's. My new physique helps. What also helps is a beard. I am rocking a beard, and I now have a spikey new rock star-ish look. I can't tell you how many looks I get now compared to before.

4) Watch Two and a Half Men - Watch Sheen and how he acts, thinks and treats women. Perfect.

5) Start a business - Times are hard, but do you think Google give a shit? Thats because they are in control and are still benefiting. Im not saying start google, but find a niche, and make some money. Better then searching ages for a job that might not last a year due to the economic crisis.

6) Get a ride - Don't have a car? Get one. Don't have a good car? Save up and upgrade. I hate to say since I bought my new car, the status ive generated, disgustingly materialistic is staggering. The attention ive got, ridiculous. But hey, im not complaining, would you be?

7) Remove yourself from social media - Its more harm then good, however if you've got a good system going that doesnt include facebook messaging a girl instead of calling or texting her, then Get out while you can from it.

8) Read Bang and Day Bang by Roosh - Forget Mystery Method, get with the times and read these books and make notes.

9) Eliminate Sorry from your vocabulary - It may be hard to do, but you will see a significant difference doing so 

10) Lastly, don't teach or preach red pill - It is a waste of time. Its like convincing someone WWII never happened. Let your brothers, other friends etc, learn the way you did. It is a waste of time preaching it, and even worse mentioning it to women.

I hope this helps, the last few months have transformed for me, but remember, you think you've nailed it but you haven't. It takes practice and time.

again, it is based on behavior.
One night stands say a lot about he attachment type a person is, if they can view sex as a casual affair, then they are more likely to cheat.

&gt;Women who start having sex early in life are more likely to divorce.

I just responded to a guy about this, so I thought I'd try to reach a wider audience as I think this mentality is common here.

Look, Mystery-style game is probably still possible, but when someone tells me that they are avoiding social circles, that they don't want to be mixed up in the power dynamics of cliques, this is a really bad sign for the wannabe player.  This is a strong pattern for no confidence, reclusive habits, someone who follows the path of least resistance, and who is more afraid of alpha's than a potential alpha himself.

You need to start circulating.  Make friends by employing a [tit for tat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat) strategy: offer favors, and see if they reciprocate favors.

I highly suggest *The 48 Laws of Power*.  Honestly, I just have the summary on my Kindle, you might be able to find summaries of the laws online.  This has everything you need to know about how to manage dominance hierarchies.  Power and sex, of course, are strongly related.

Some times it is used in reference to things that are specifically beta: asking a girl where she would like to eat on a date; while other times is used simply to say 'not alpha'. While these are reasonable uses and largely correct, I don't think they fail to do us the service of properly defining beta.

Considering how much effort is spent in understanding alpha, I have seen little discussion on exactly what beta is and why is exists. I do recall one article discussing this way back in the early days of this sub. It talked about betas having their own sexual strategy rather than simply being flunked out alphas. Essentially, in the times before feminism, beta's did pretty well. Women wanted them because they were providers and stayed with them because of marriage. Obviously that has all changed now that women are free to wander off the moment they get the scent of the alpha cock, but it's important to remember. 

Beta is not simply all things un-alpha. In a recent conversation stemming from [this](http://i.imgur.com/AEeUohV.jpg) photo, people generally called pegging beta. While I agree that it is not alpha, its not beta either. If we look at beta as a sexual strategy, pegging doesn't really fit in anywhere. It's its simply 'un-masculine'.

I propose a new way of using the terms alpha and beta. An alpha is a male who derives more value from sexual interaction than he puts in, A beta provides more value than he receives. He provides resource benefit to the woman and she provides sexual access.

That is a sexual strategy that works remarkably well under the right conditions. In a resource scarce environment a beta would be a woman's best bet for successful reproduction. In that scenario and alpha, while attractive, would be too high risk as they tend not to provide for offspring.  

Of course today the beta is playing a losing game. The beta sexual strategy is no longer effective. What we have is an environment of plenty, and that means women can start shopping for the strongest genetics over the best providers. Like the birds of paradise men are now selected to be flashy show things. only the high risk, high yield, alpha game works. But let us not forget the value of the beta and all he once was.

What is getting laid, exactly? Why do we pursue it? It's mainly because we (men) are programmed to do so. That's how we managed to remain here after millions of years.

But in more immediate terms, it's because it feels good. Sex releases dopamine. A release of dopamine is pleasurable. But what is the point of pursuing pleasure?

Personally, I have done my share of drugs. I particularly happen to be fond of uppers. Cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines, I like them all. But it's all temporary pleasure. The way I see it, the nuclear family, the classic gender roles are just about optimal, at least for the betterment of society. Women are submissive and nurturing by nature. They want that guy with the goals and the ambition and the talent to approach them, romance them, impregnate them and.. well, I guess they want all that to occur again, with whoever can pull it off. Meanwhile, for men, it's about sleeping with that next attractive girl. To pass off their genes (or fool your brain into thinking that it's actually doing so).

But it is only with the classic gender roles that society can be improved. In the case of the nuclear family, where the man works the higher-end job and the wife either works a generic HR-type job or stays at home &amp; raises the kids, the man is highly driven to succeed in his career. Not only does he want to leave a legacy to his name, for his offspring, but the man also does not have anything else to worry about. As far as his reptilian brain is concerned, he has passed off his genes at least once. He can focus on other things in life.

I'm not even sure if there's a question here anywhere. I might just be at a loss as to what is our purpose here, exactly? Why not fuck everything that moves and do every drug under the sun? After all, it feels good. Why bother making scientific or cultural contributions? We are a blip in the passage of time.

I've been just devouring every manosphere blog I come across including CH, Roosh, RationalMale, and recently ROK.

So all of these guys talk about game and how amazing game is, but all this time I've been wondering...how do I get started? I did a lot of searching and came across things like the Mystery Method and lovesystems, which seem to be the most popular. But which is the most effective? For example, I've heard about criticisms of Mystery Method being outdated and self-limiting in approaches.

If possible, I would like to learn for free or cheap. I'm not into the idea of taking bootcamps that costs a lot of money or paying hundreds for an online system. If I really have no choice, I'm willing to fork over the cash. I just want to be aware of cheaper of free alternatives that are equal in learning effectiveness.

So can anyone point to me any books, DVDs, or well known websites where I can get started?

1362087008.0,30,self.TheRedPill,19f4zt,Why Can’t I Use a Smiley Face? - Review of Roosh's upcoming book.,37,7,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/19f4zt/why_cant_i_use_a_smiley_face_review_of_rooshs/,"There is a bittersweet calming feeling reading somebody else’s life experiences and identifying them as if there were your own.  On one side of the coin, you get to see that you are not alone in your experiences, that there are others that share it- and on the other side: you realize your experiences are real; the world we live in really is that bad.

I was recently given an advance copy of Roosh’s latest work, *Why Can’t I Use a Smiley Face?* 

With all his latest books detailing his various adventures throughout the world, each an exotic new country I haven’t been to, I was curious what this one would be. It’s one of the few books I’ve seen from Roosh that didn’t carry his standard “bang” title-set. I was pleasantly surprised to see he had documented his journey back to DC. 

It’s a short book, totaling around 61 pages. Not to its own detriment, mind you. For a short period of time, while I read it, I felt like somebody else knew my experiences. I felt like I was reading a book written *by me!* 

I’ve had a hard time identifying with certain parts of the game community. Although my game is tight- it really is- and despite past success (quite a bit of it), I’ve noticed a strange trend recently where women were getting bitchier and bitchier. The general attitude around me has dropped. It’s been getting worse, and I’d argue most of this was in the past few years, and surely a lot in ten years.

There must be a regional issue, since a lot of guys I talk to don’t necessarily have the women on hard mode like I experience around here. This makes discussion of game difficult. For some guys, it’s as simple as talking with a few girls, being friendly and outgoing. Around where I am, I find myself going nuclear on women more than being friendly. And it sometimes works, though recently I feel it’s rarely worth it.

Through the book, he documents his stay back in the states, in DC, meeting up with a few friends and sarging the bars. The most amazing (and depressing) thing I kept seeing over and over is how Roosh’s mind worked like my own. In the book, he’s able to detail his thinking process, which is a form of validation to me. 

Perhaps this book is a form of catharsis. For those who have seen the decline in American women, this book is a form of venting, to stand solemnly with our brethren and say, “It’s not you, it’s them.” Sometimes that affirmation is enough of a kick in the nuts to make a plan, start saving, and decide it’s time to leave the country.

We discuss on TheRedPill exactly what mechanisms are causing the degradation of American women. It still surprises me when women have such terrible attitudes. It makes me wonder, is it at all possible for these women to ever find happiness? They’ve made access to their sex such a chore, surely no man who is worth it would bother?

&gt;I walked downstairs and approached a mediocre girl. She told me she was a model but even in the dim light I wasn’t seeing it. When I tried to get things moving, aware of the little time I had left to make magic happen, she repeatedly told me, “I’m hard, you have to work for me.” No thanks. I left and went upstairs.

*“I’m hard, you have to work for me.”* I’ll just let these words sink in. How on earth did we get to a place where saying these words would ever be commonplace let alone socially acceptable? I wish I didn’t know the answer. It’s staring us right in the eyes, every day on TheRedPill. We know what happens when somebody gets constant validation. iPhones, Facebook, OkCupid, and then bars- there is an entire network made to inflate women’s self-worth, making the streamline of attention from everybody towards women as efficient as possible. And with almost no negative feedback, why would a woman keep her feet on the ground?

My only solace is that long term happiness is not something promised by their lifestyles. 

Throughout the entire book, Roosh describes interactions with various DC women. The cute one, the cougar scene, the bitches, the drunks, etc. The most interesting part about reading this book- the biggest connection I’ve had with a book, mind you- was that each interaction described not only experiences I’ve had, but demonstrated his responses being similar to mine. I’m sure it’s said over and over that bitches aren’t worth your time- but when you’re faced with a population of only bitches, what do you do?

Well Roosh describes in detail exactly what he did. I won’t give away too many spoilers, but needless to say the ending to his book is his salvation, and for me, a new life plan.

It is *not* going to work in every single case or for every single person, but I have made it work in some of the most unlikely scenarios. The reason it works is because women just want someone strong enough to lead them. Someone they can be subordinate too. They *crave* a captain, and sometimes you just have to say ""I'm the captain, and you're going to do what I say"".  A lot of the things I write about will presuppose a few things:

1. You are physically fit. You don't need to be Don Draper, but you had better know your way around a squat rack.

2. You are moderately accomplished. You won't get anywhere without a paycheque you can be proud of, or some skills that make you useful.

3. You have pretty sharp game. You are going to need to have some grace and tact. This comes from gaming people.

Those three things are things everyone here *should* be trying to acheive already, and if you haven't, you need to work on it. Now... on to the guide.

*********************************

One of the 10 basic principles of economics is that *People respond to incentives*. This serves as the basis for most of these lessons. If a company want to inrease sales by ten % in a quarter, they can issue a coupon in a daily newspaper to save 50 cents on their product. The people who are on the fringe of buying the product will go out there in the cold and buy the damn thing, increasing sales. This is what drives business. Have you ever seen a 2 for 1 sale and then bought TWO things you didn't even want, just because it was like getting 50% off? I know you have. And most people have. The company dangles a carrot in front of your face and you get your things and they get their money. What I'm going to show you is how to do this to your woman. You want her to act more feminem, and what does she want? A strong man thing to tell her what to do, and praise her once in a while. Your praise has to be scarce. Reserve it *only* for when she's done something good. 

**Lesson 1 - Sex**

You have to dominate your women in bed. This means being selfish. This means doing whatever you want to her. Unapologetically have your way with her. Finger her and make her suck your fingers off. Then tell her how hot that was and how well she gets you off. Blow your load on her face, tell her how beautiful it makes it. Don't EVER break eyecontact when dirty talking. Ever. Push your woman's face down to the pillow. Rub your hand all over her face. Pick her up and move her. You basically go primal.

It is important to take it whenever you want. When a woman tells me she's tired, I tell her 'I don't fucking care, you're pussy belongs to me and I'm going to fuck it whenever I want"" - I have never had a woman say no to me after this. It is dominant. They respect that. You can't say this half asses, you need to *know* you're in charge. Its okay to tell her you're in charge too. ""I'm in charge, you do what I say, do you understand? Say *yes*"" She'll say yes.

If she actually resists and its not fake resistance (ie- dom sub or roleplaying resistance) than obviously stop. 

Doing this sets the tone for the rest of your relationship and makes everything else come naturally.

**Lesson 2 Dishes and cooking**

If you're buying food, you have no reason to cook or clean a damned thing unless you decide that in the heat of the moment, you're going to cook your favourite dish.

You can get her to do the dishes and clean by a) ordering it and then b) following up with delicious praise. 

Example: ""Why are there so many dirty dishes? Why aren't you doing the dishes? If I buy all the food, you should be cleaning the dishes."" or ""How about we trade? Why don't you buy everything, and I'll cook and do the dishes for you sometimes"" and don't be afraid to show your value with ""If you don't wanna do your job, then maybe you'll just need to go to your own apartment. This doesn't work for me"". Its really important that you are firm with this. You demonstrate a lot of value by being able to legitamately say this. Your game should be tight enough that you don't care about her loss if she does leave, which she might.

When she caves and is cooking for you and doing dishes, its time to provide incentive. Go up behind her, tell her how much it turns you on to see her be so feminine. Rub your boner against her. She'll be skeptical about how serious you are because she's been told since birth its insulting for a woman to clean anything. She has been raised to be a princess, remember. So praise her for cleaning. 

**You're a good woman, and I'm so glad you're around** is my go to line. I use this to positively reenforce all feminine behaviour. Say this with a straight face and solid eye contact. If she gives you some fucked up 'did you just say that' face, which you'll likely get at first, follow up with 'I'm serious. I love it when you clean for me. I'm really glad I have you' DEAD PAN SERIOUS FACE. Fuck her like Lesson 1 after this if you really wanna drive it home.

Get her used to hearing ""You're a good woman"" and if she says something snippy back say ""I take it back, you're not a good woman"" she'll be hurt. As much as feminism makes women not want to hear 'you're a good woman', their internal instincts make them DREAD hearing 'you're NOT a good woman'. This is the basis for all behaviour modifcation. If she does not comply, tell her she's a bad woman, or a failure as a a woman. 

This all depends on you being successful as a man. Learn as much as you can about positive masculinity to effectively do this.

**Lesson 3 - Positive Masculinity**

Be a man, for God's sake. You're a man! Lift heavy things. Take the long hard route. Focus on bettering yourself. Learn an instrument. Its hard? Yeah, of course, but you're a man so you can do it. Earn MORE MONEY and STOP SPENDING frivolously. MOVE MOUNTAINS TO MAKE THE WORLD AROUND YOU INTO SOMETHING YOU FIND DESIRABLE.

Learn to build things. Learn abotu tools, how the work, and what they do, even if you don't need them RIGHT NOW. Get skilled. Learn to program. Stop being a lazy pussy boy slob. Go game, swallow your pride. Do squats and deadlifts. Its hard. Most people don't like doing them. But you're a MAN NOW. Learn how to FIGHT. Especially if you don't want to fight. How can you boss around a woman when you're a woman yourself?

I love shaving with a straight razor. My girlfriend was telling people at her work a story and it involved me shaving with my razor on a Sunday night. 

One of the chode managers with a failing marriage says ""pff what kind of person shaves on a Sunday night"" she says ""A *MAN* with a *straight razor*!!"" She brags about my manliness to other men who would try to DLV me when I'm not even there. If you're a man who embraces positive masculinity, your woman will know, and love you for it. If you bend to her will and act like a feminine pussy man, she will resent you and defer her affections for a man like me.

This is not an exhaustive guide, but it should be a solid primer for anyone looking to get their relationship on track.

I'm not overweight at all (for most of my life I've been underweight, actually), and I work out 4-5 days a week. Natural hair. Guys tell me I'm attractive and I see no reason to object.

Anyway, I'm a virgin. Of course I've had many opportunities to lose my virginity, but I don't want to get ""used"" like so many other women and girls I know. 

I didn't start dating until I was about 21 and had my first job in college. I purposely waited because I prefer to pay my own way on dates... I think it's a nice gesture for a guy to pay and every now and then I will let them, but I always make sure to at least pay for drinks or something.  Why? Because I don't believe in taking advantage of people. Sure, not all women are ""dinner whores"", but I have no intention of ever being mistaken for one.

Anyway I'd like to find love or at least a commitment before having sex (I have no intention of waiting for marriage... I don't even know if I want marriage), but I've never gotten that far. After the third or fourth date the guy just seems to lose interest because he sees I'm serious about waiting a few months for sex. 

In my mind a few months seems rational, but it's really hard to find like minded people of either sex these days. 

I have a bachelor's in electrical engineering and an AA in philosophy. Not bragging, but I support myself and I'm pretty intelligent... I like conversations about current events, etc. Anything interesting. I never dominate conversations, I don't emasculate, I show everyone respect. If they disrespect me I end the conversation and walk away.

Now I'm getting older and although I'm still getting hit on I know that it's going to slow down and stop completely as I get older. 

Side note, I've actually had guys approach me and seem really interested until they asked my age... I look like I'm 18, but some of them get turned off when I tell them I'm 25.

My question is this, what am I doing wrong? I realize that as a black woman in America it's going to be hard to find a man who wants to take me seriously, but there must be something I can do.

I don't discriminate based on race. I have no issue dating a man who makes less money than I do (I've been on dates with engineers, med students, bartenders, and construction workers). All I really ask is that he's not obese, is kind, and is intelligent. Age isn't that big of a deal either. Most guys I'm attracted to are a couple of years older than I am, but I've went out with guys from 21 to 40.

Any advice? Not just for myself, but for women in general who may be in my position. I'm starting to think I'll never find anyone and that maybe I was just born to be alone and never find love. I want the opinions of red pill guys because I'm looking for a different perspective, not just ""oh they're intimidated, you'll find the right guy someday.""

Give me your worst, I'll take it constructively.

Working with my female co-worker for 10 months. Very good rapport, we eat lunch together, do pranks to kill time and make each other laugh. She moves to another team and I ask her to hook me up with some free shit (half jokingly). She outright dismisses she cant do it because its not professional etc. In the past I hooked her up with stuff.

Another female colleague from a different department asks me to do her a favor. I flat out decline and she gives me the crap ""Its for the company!"". I still say no. She threatens me by calling my boss and saying I am uncooperative. I tell her ""go right ahead"". She asks for my bosses name and I tell her. Minutes later she returns with a manager from another department and he asks me nicely to do the favor (typical white knight). I am cool with the manager as hes done me a favor in the past so i do it. Same girl asks for a favor later and this time around shes flirting and acting very submissive.

tl:dr Whenever a woman asks you for a favor, 99% of the time she will offer nothing in return. Most girls will hook the bait with flirtation to make sure you're receptive.

Took the redpill 1 month ago.  Regretted it at first (just being honest-hard pill to swallow), but I kept at it, and haven't looked back.

I am seriously considering leaving my wife of almost 6 years.  I am 38.  We have no kids (she can't seem to have any).  I am NOT considering divorce because of that.

I married her because back 7 years ago, I was extremely beta, no career, forced to move back in my parents house in my late 20s.  She was the only girl who gave me any attention. I was needy. But she and I never clicked in terms of chemistry, and I never really had any attraction for her.  I just thought ""I should put that aside, and over time I will grow more attracted to her"".  Nope.  I remember telling a close guy friend that I don't seem to have anything in common with her. He raised the red flag, but I ignored it.  I assumed that over time ""We would grow closer"".  The opposite happened.

I don't know what is up with her, but everything I read here about women needing both the provider and a strong alpha man to meet her sexual needs, I see the provider need in her.... but I don't see the latter in her AT ALL.  She made me wait until marriage for sex. She was a virgin and conservative christian, and was very scared of sex.  The first time I was about to go in, her face of fear, you would have thought I was trying to put my fist up her butt.  

Since day 1 of marriage , she has absolutely no passion in bed.  She refuses to hear me out when I tell her that ""no man wants a woman who just lays there"".  She doesn't seek that need elsewhere like romance novels, Magic Mike movies, or seeing other guys.  Past relationships of mine, the sex was anywhere from ok to incredible, so I know that I know at least something about good sex. I've tried so many things to try to ""wake her up"".  Nothing.  Good lord, it took her a year to warm up to the idea of different positions.

Since getting married, she refuses to let me lead. When I get strong, and try to lead, she fights.  Nag is her middle name.  She tells her friends that I am trying to ""control her"", like some dude you would see on Oprah that literally controls a wife (tells her what to wear, eat, when she can go out, etc.).  I am not like that at all.  I just stand my ground and not put up with her shit.  (Me standing up for myself is a more recent development)

She does almost nothing around the house except watch TV, netflix, text, and read books.  The only thing she does for the household is the laundry (I ruined a shirt of hers to convince her to not let me to do it).  I do EVERYTHING else, cook, food shopping, finances, clean, yard stuff, house maint. Yeah I get that I need to do things to, and to be fair she also works full time, but she needs to step up.  God forbid if I try to tell her the way I feel. If she does end up doing something, she goes ON AND ON about how worn out it makes her.

I read some threads on redpillwomen, about being an ideal wife and so forth, and I don't see hardly any of that in her.  Even my mom and sister see how miserable I am, and wouldn't be upset if I left her. Sister told me when we were both out getting drunk with friends.

The flip side is that I feel guilty, the thought of forcing a 33 year old woman who can't have kids back out into the church single market where divorce is frowned upon.  I don't want her to be alone the rest of her life, even though I would be FINE if I was.

Thoughts? Am I being selfish and too entitled?  Or am I justified in my consideration of calling it all off?  Hoping to get some RedPillWomen input too.

**UPDATE:**  Thanks for the brutal truth.  I wanted to hear from you guys, and NOT some feminists or white knight betas elsewhere here on reddit.  bigyellowtwinki mentioned that I did not say whether I have a career or not.  I did get my shit together in that area, and have a solid career (not just job), doing something I really enjoy.  I've even found a niche in the field that I am growing in, a niche that I MIGHT consider starting my own business with.  Been in it 5 years now and I am even growing into an informal leader here in my team.  And at home, I am the main income earner by a margin of 2:1.

**UPDATE 2**  Will anyone see this update since the original post was from yesterday?  Anyway, I've made my decision.  I am going to...

* Stick with it (here me out)
* I've ordered MMSL and will read it over the next week.  Yes, I realize it's fire hose style, but I need to act on all this NOW rather than wait months. I can always read it again, to let it marinate on my brain.
* Have a sit down with her in 8 days.  I have set aside a time, not this Friday, but the following.  I want the time to gather my thoughts, read through MMSL, and construct the plan for the discussion.  She has no idea what's coming, and she will be upset, but honestly I don't care.
* I have given myself a firm time frame of 6 months.  In 6 months, there will be plenty of time for me to improve myself, time for her to adjust and either catch on to the new habits or not, and time for me to ""practice"" standing my ground.  
* If 6 months, things do not significantly improve, I WILL leave her.  I'm not sharing the 6 month part, unless someone provides a valid reason to.
* The one aspect I have not decided on yet, is whether I will pursue a marriage/sex therapist.  I might wait 1 month into the 6 months to either go/no go for a therapist.

1372153651.0,31,self.TheRedPill,1h124t,"""Partying"": what it is really is, what it is really about, and why you can decide to ditch the whole thing without the slightest loss or regret.",51,20,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1h124t/partying_what_it_is_really_is_what_it_is_really/,"- First of all not all cases of people dancing to music qualifies as partying in this sense: the mosh pit of a metal concert or a hardcore techno rave with everybody drugged out of their minds is not partying in the sense I am discussing it now.

- Partying is defined as going to someone's house, or a bar, or a club, drinking, being chatty, and most importantly dancing to typically pop-like, romantic, sexual music. It is feminine music, it is music more liked by women than men. Masculine music from country to metal to dubstep noise is generally not partying in this sense. Party music always has sexy tunes and lyrics that are all about romance, sex, relationship, ""baby I want you"" kind of lyrics, (or lyrics about partying itself: ""let's dance""). Generally women like party music and men like only the women there, not much else. Almost everything made by a gay male singer becomes succesful party music because it resonates with women: I don't know about todays stuff, but in the nineties it was Ricky Martin, eighties Village People (YMCA), seventies Freddy Mercury, sixties Little Richard etc. So if the DJ knows to play the kind of gayer music women like, because if women start dancing men will start dancing too, it is the textbook definition of partying.

- Partying is a highly sexualized environment. The music is all about romance. Women try to look their best. Men show off their best moves on the dancefloor, and those best moves look very much like showing off bed moves. ([And women can judge T levels based on how men dance.](http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/so-you-think-you-can-dance-20091226-lflm.html)) The whole thing is really not about anything else than sex, romance, pairing off or at least getting some confidence improving flirts and validation.

- You can add to this idea the traditional disco environment with the colorful lights, mirror ball, etc. is an environment that is decorated in a feminine style, the idea is to make women relaxed and happy so that they open up sexually.

- Generally the only thing men like about this all is women. I.e. that this environment, this music, this decor, this whole thing is meant to make women happy, relaxed and sexually open. All it delivers to men is the women. (This is why the often unequal entry policies i.e. women often get in for free, men pay an entry fee.) This is not something that is meant for men, neither the decor nor the music, men are not meant to enjoy it much, the idea is just enjoying the women there. If there would be some kind of a male-only event meant to make men happy it would sure as hell not have mirror balls and red and yellow lights and music like [Samba di Janeiro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1iclqbNyM). It would more likely to have a cowboy-saloon decor of wood and leather and some kind of country-rock music.

- In other words, never make the mistake I did that I thought partying is the only form of entertainment. It is not. It is mainly made for pick-ups or people faithful in LTRs getting the validation that they could pick-up if they wanted to. It is highly sexualized and about really nothing much else. It was meant for women to enjoy, relax, open up sexually, and for men it is a mildly boring/annoying thing to endure because it delivers sexually opened up women.

- So if you can satisfy your sexual and relationship needs elsewhere, you can ditch the whole partying culture without any kind of regret or feeling of loss. You are not losing out on anything. It is hardly more than Barbie doll houses made to make women happy, and if you don't need the specific ""crutch"" of making moves on women who were softened up and opened up by the whole partying athmosphere, if you can find your GF or soft harem or adventures elsewhere, then you are really not losing out if you avoid it. You can feel free to go to places that don't have such a sexual athmosphere and plays music you actually like. (If all you know is partying pop music, try the following 7 genres: country, metal esp. Turisas type fighting metal, hard techno, dubstep, 
jazz, classical and folk dancing kinda stuff. It is virtually guaranteed you will like at least one of them.)

- Even if you think you could use this ""crutch"" because you are not (yet) full alpha, actually I think partying does not actually deliver that, in fact it is a hindrance. Partying is full of the toughest of tough alpha assholes who easy supress you if you are not 200% sharp. In a club they may straight up walk up to the girl you are dancing with and start grinding or feeling her up, in a more chatty place like a party in someone's house or a bar they may downright cut in and aggressively invite a girl you are talking with to a drink. I have always felt downright 
suppressed, sidelined and emasculated by such situations, felt castrated, because I did not know how to react, my only idea was a punch and I did not have the nuts to do that. Partying is a **crazy competitive** environment and a guy who is decently confident in normal circumstances can very quickly be betaized into a total wimp at a party. So unless you are the top of the top, you better find your GF somewhere else.

Parallel to make it clearer: suppose you own a construction company and John, a potential client wants to build a new office building. Partying is like when John wants to have an open tender and invites 10 construction companies for competitive bidding, as the whole event is about making or losing the deal it is insanely competitive, and everybody but the most aggressive loses. This is partying - a form of entertainment that is extremely focused on being a competitive sexual 
marketplace. Now making a pickup or finding a GF in some other place from jazz club to library is more like you approach John at a golf club, chat, and make your rough estimate for the construction job, the whole thing is just more relaxed.

Of course if you enjoy partying and works for you then do it. But if you have this dread in your gut that oh no Saturday is coming, it is an awful drudgery but this is how you get entertainment and this is how you meet women, and it beats staying at home - then by all means no, you can meet women elsewhere, there are other forms of entertainment, other and much likely more enjoyable musical events to spend the Saturday night (see above 7 genres), it's not something everybody but stay at home losers MUST do. (And even people who stay at home are not necessarily losers, some just decide to.) Modern culture tries to cajole men into thinking that partying is necessary and a MUST or else you are the hopeless, ridiculous guy with no social life and no chance at women. It is NOT true. It is luring you into a trap.

I could write a book on this but I'll try to be more succinct. Most of the women I met in derby are awesome people I consider friends to this day. This is not a slam on derby women or the sport (which is actually pretty impressive)

- Roller derby tends to attract a lot of women that see themselves as ""alphas"". What ends up happening is they all talk over each other. I was the only male present at a ""girl's night out"" where my then gf hosted a dinner in our apartment. They were all talking over each other, sometimes screaming to be heard. 

- They also try to outdo each other when it comes to drinking. As a result many women in derby are serious alcoholics. 

- Also with sex. They try to outdo each other with sex stories. There is a lot of girl on girl and every fantasy imaginable. There is a clique of lesbians that have slept with a good percentage of the entire league.

- At their parties there would be at least one pair of breasts flashed, especially if there are no men around. They compete for the best pair and even give an informal award for best tits (and best ass) at the end of each season. Because I've been to a lot of the parties I've seen a number of players at least partially naked. If you are on a team and travel with them most likely you will see them all naked. 

- The shit talking is unfathomable. At any time there are a dozen dramas with a number of women not talking to each other. Out of nowhere they will be friends again, usually due to a shared hatred of another derby girl. It is impossible to keep up with the amount of drama. No human being can do it. 

- Just as in any sport there are some worthless players and some great ones but the cream rises to the top and most of the worthless ones don't even last a season. A number of women join just to call themselves derby girls and drop out after playing a game or two. I know one woman that barely played one season and still writes a blog about being a derby girl though she hasn't played for years. 

- Cheating is rampant. One team is full of cheaters and one girl is notorious for it. She's so good at cheating she is on the national team and is rated as one of the best players in the country. She's very good but she got most of her points from crying at the ref and stamping her feet.

Mistress:

A few months ago, a bitter neckbeard loser on the Internet [cottoned on to our conceptual pincer attack](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1cw4v2/another_obvious_setup_by_feministssrs_to_call_out/c9kl53c) of shaming misogynists as fatally ineffectual on the one hand, while calling in our White Knight Brigade by making the misogynists out to be uber-powerful on the other.  We did not alert you to this (he is of course a total loser and will probably never get laid), but it did set our wheels turning down in LO.  We have been expecting this for a while.

Fortunately, I am proud to report that the solution is (and was) already in place.  We have since managed the seemingly impossible: a fusion of *both* ideas into *one* word.  It is easy to spot contradictory ideas when they are presented separately---but when they are bound up in one word?  Checkmate, misogynists!

The word, Mistress, is ""rapey.""

Now, we are of course familiar with the unmatched utility of the word ""rape.""  It has faithfully served, when attached to just about anything, to bring the Knights to heel.

However, the problem that has plagued us is that ""rape"" is a very *serious* word, that *means* something.  As such, even the most deluded of Knights could temporarily defect in cases where the inconvenient meaning was absent from actual circumstances.  ""Online rape,"" for instance, has still failed to gain traction (although this department still counts ""raping [me/her] with his eyes"" as a solid victory).  Further, we were backstabbed by the unfortunate...fantasies...that some of our number have been having.  Worse, some of the Knights noticed this and joined the ranks of the hated misogynists!

What we needed was a way to *maximize* a threat to get the Knights to fight, while casting our enemies as utterly incapable of actually achieving this threat, so as to avoid any more betrayals from the Sisterhood.

The word ""rapey"" solves all these problems.  Observe:

--- What does it mean?  Nothing!  It means that something or someone ""feels like rape.""  Of course, since our feelings are unfalsifiable, we can use it with impunity.

--- Its root is taken from 1.0, still bringing out the Knights.

--- (This, mistress, is the brilliant portion) Its ending, ""-ey,"" is diminuitive, belittling---similar to a nickname we might use with a child.  No one would call an *actual rapist* ""rapey;"" they'd call them a rapist!  As such, whatever dangerous sick edge our hated enemies might acquire as a side effect of our labeling, has been successfully blunted.

I feel like the system that women communally enforce whereby they basically force men to pursue them if we want to have any hope whatsoever of getting laid, is just completely unfulfilling to me emotionally.  I know that this subreddit is set up to teach people how to game that system, but quite frankly, I think that system should be rebelled against and torn down.  

What I really want from a woman is to be loved by her and cared for.  Pursuing women, asking them on dates, driving the whole conversation, none of that really makes me feel appreciated.  I feel like women are deliberately using my needs against me in order to juice me.  

It's like, if I push a button that I know will generate a response, what does that prove other than my own capability to be psychologically manipulative?  I don't want to be psychologically manipulative.  I want a woman to genuinely love me.  Only that will fulfill my emotional needs, not playing a bunch of silly games in order to set up superficial, purely sexual relationships.  

Anyway, I feel like the only way to get women to truly appreciate men is to stop trying so hard, collectively.  Make them come to us.  We all know they like sex just as much as we do.  So stop handing it to them on a silver platter.  Make them work for it.

1365079906.0,31,self.TheRedPill,1bnoer,Fascinating discussion last night re: hypergamy,44,13,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1bnoer/fascinating_discussion_last_night_re_hypergamy/,"The summary of this is that I met a girl last night and because of something she said to me, I raised the issue of women spending their '20s banging alphas. She was, as you might imagine, offended - but I think her head kind of exploded too.

Here's what happened: Met a buddy at World of Beer last night. When I got there, he was already talking to a couple of girls so I jumped in too. We chatted for a bit then went to sit down. On the way, I see a couple of women from work. So we go over and chat with them for a while.

Now at last, we turn back toward the bar and sit down. Just so happened that I sat next to two more ladies. I introduced myself and tried to strike up a conversation. One of these girls was named Judy. I took an early opportunity to ask Judy for her number and tell her that I'd love to meet up with her again some time.

Judy says to me, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""I just watched you circle this bar and pick up on every girl in here. If I'm the last girl you want to talk to, then no thanks.""

Now let me just say, in the interests of full disclosure, that I blew it. I had an initial reaction that I realize now was wrong. I pointed out that the place was pretty empty, that I knew those two girls from work, etc. I made excuses. My buddy laughed at me, because the way Judy had just shot me down, I mean like her tone of voice and everything, was pretty hilariously brutal for a casual Wednesday night.

But anyway, because I'd been rejected I felt like there was nothing to lose by going back to the issue a few minutes later. I said (paraphrasing), ""if you dated a guy and it turned out that you'd had more sexual partners than he'd had, and if he was unhappy about that, what would you say?"" Judy told me she hates insecure guys. She said that her past was her business. You know, the usual.

I said, so that'd be like slut-shaming? ""Yes, exactly!"" she said.

So here's the punchline. I asked if she'd ever considered that maybe a guy feels exactly the same way she felt when I asked for her number. ""You felt like you weren't special because I had 'circled the room' before approaching you, remember?""

I shit you not, she said the exact same thing, word-for-word, in the same order, that she had said about a boyfriend being upset about her past. It was like there's a script ""slut-shaming response script, page 1"" and she started reading from it. She told me she hates insecure guys and her past was nobody's business, and so on.

The only thing that changed was at the end, she tried to get a few more digs in at me. She said that she suspected I was a player. She has to ""guard herself.""

We need more evidence and field posts here, in my opinion, so I'll be the change I want to see in the world.

**Prep**

I got a phone call on Friday. Its a bar tender I know who is a successful pua in town. He invites me to a gala. I look up the gala and without hesitation I agree to go. Tons of babes in dresses, very formal. Looks like a great time.

**Pre drink**

I go to his place for the predrink. I meet some affluent gentlemen who are going to the gala too. We have a few mixed drinks, learn everyone's name and then walk to the event. We're all in suits. I'm in a slim fit black two button suit with thin lapels and a skinny tie. I have neatly trimmed facial hair and I get my haircuts from a salon once a month, costs between 60-80 dollars, worth it everytime. Why? Because pussy is easier to get when you look rich. I'm wearing a $400+ dollar watch my dad gave me for my highschool graduation 8 years ago. Its broken, but no one's gonna know that. Its shiny and big, looks so alpha. I'm wearing 40 dollar calvin klein boxer briefs, and 16 dollar socks. Your undergaments say a lot about you to any bitch you're gonna nail. The devil is in the details.

**At the gala**

We enter together, my friend immediately leaves us all for the VIP room. I'm alone with a group of 4 betas. No problem. I spy a group of cute girls in the corner. I open them and things start to look well, the girls are laughing, they like me, the environment is warm. The betas move in, and in beta fashion, all surround the hottest girl of the bunch and orbit her. Now, if they were schooled properly, they would have left her to me and gone after the other lesser girls. But they didn't. I don't have time for this shit, so I eject without saying a word, having spotted a pretty brunette standing by herself by a table.

**First set**

I walk over in front of her and say ""So I got this phone call last night..."" She looks at me, I'm kind of smiling and leaning in close. ""from my buddy saying I *have* to come to the gala. I got ready and we get here and he runs off into the VIP section over there! Haha, so how did you hear about this event"" Midway through this opner I put my hand on her elbow and run it down to her hand. We start chatting, having a great time and her friend shows up. Blonde, kinda chubby, but cute.

**Enter blonde friend**

""I guess this is who you were waiting for"" I say. I start to kino and chat the blonde. I'm showing both of them a great time. I run through some bullshit material like the Ring routine (works everytime) and my standard line ""I bet there is some hilarious story about how you two met right?"" and ""We should start a band together, I'll play the guitar, you can do vocals because you have a nice voice, and you get the cowbell"" blah blah blah. Later that night the girls laugh at me because I was only 25 and they thought I was 38. It ruins my chances with them because they're in their 30's and they have kids and shit. I felt a little weird, they started calling me a baby and stuff. Weird. We had a great time but I could see it wasn't going anywhere. I grab the blonde's number and leave.

**Second set**

I go to my bar tender friend and he's got a few girls with him. He introduces them to me. There was a hot hot blonde there who everyone afterward said looked like [7 of 9](http://imgur.com/gallery/VmtcPiT). She shakes my hand, but looks absolutely star struck. She goes ""I've been wanting to say hello to you all night, but you were with other women *all night!!*"" I told her that she should have said hello anyway, but she goes ""you looked like you were having such a great time with them... I couldn't interupt. You must have great game""

*Red pill comment: Preselection rears its ugly head. This girl was madly into me because other women were madly into me. Also, she is aware of the concept of game. Carousel rider alert*

**First cock block attempt**

She's got her hands on me, talking really close, I've got my hands on her. Things are lookin like a solid close. Then the cockblock attempt comes out of no where. An 8 brunette comes over and shoves her iphone in my face, takes and awful picture of me, and tells me that ""I'll show it to her in the morning and if she still likes you she'll call!! Lets go Natalie!!"" I quickly put my arm around the brunette's waist. ""Natalie, you have such great friends... look at how much she cares about you! You're a lucky woman to have friends like this."" I look brunette in the eye, give a sly grin ""I like you, I want you to me *my* friend... Are you having a good night tonight??"" Brunette blushes and goes ""Oooh, look at him try to win me overrrrrr"" Bitchface brunette approves of my after that. All good, making our way for the door.

**Cock block attempt #2**

Big muscular meat head guy in a not so stylish suit comes up. He's clearly bigger than me by a lot. He grabs her arm and asks to talk to her. I look at her talking to him for about 2 seconds and decide I'm not even gonna try to compete. Feed her ego? No. I got my number close, had a few successful sets, had a great time. Not gonna stand there like a beta. I walk away immediately. I grab my coat and walk out of the coat room. She runs up to me and says ""I just broke that guy's heart so I can leave with you! I feel kinda bad... let me get my coat!""

A friend of mine tells me that the big muscle guy after was saying ""What the FUCK! I work out SIX TIMES A WEEK! Why would she leave with HIM?!"" - Game. And the guy was being beta. She said he was asking if he could come over to sleep on her couch. She said she wanted to run in the morning, he said he'd go too, he'd wake up early and run with her. No game, tryhard, and he wouldn't let up.

**F close**

I'm back at her place, this is 25 minutes after I met her guys. Back at her place, I take off my pants, she remarks about my nice underwear. I take off her clothes and since I don't have a condom I'm thinking to myself ""Zion... if you get herpes from this bitch... its totally worth it. She's so hot"". I bang the shit out of her, raw dog. I flip her around and I'm wailing on her doggy style and she lets out the cry of a true slut ""CUM ON ME NOT IN ME!!"" I gladly oblige her. We bang two or three times. She passes out. Farts on my leg all night. Like the most disgusting farts you ever smelled. Disgusting. She made me a great omelette in the morning. She's about to go run with her dad and she says ""I don't know if I can run... you split me open last night"", she tells me him and her never got along til recently. That explains a lot. Daddy issues. She drives me home. 

I bang her a dozen times over the next week and stop talking to her because she develops an attitude and I got what I wanted already.

**Final thoughts**

You can pick up the hottest bitches with Pre-selection. I did not get herpes, but I easily could have. Maybe bring condoms in the future? I prefer to just have them at home in a drawer though. Being a big muscle head isn't gonna get you the pussy if you don't have game. Work out a bit, and work on your game ALOT. I hit the gym maybe twice a week, but I game erryday. All of the betas that night and the few alphas present gave me mad props and respect for my conquest. It was merely one of many though. It was how I started my reputation as a rake.

Hope you enjoyed reading.

EDIT: **Hilarious ending** She texts me later after she runs and says she wiped herself off after her shower with a towel and she couldnt figure out why it was crusty... I used it to wash the cum off of her. I lol'd gregariously.

Many of them, always drunk, end up putting out to someone who, when sobriety gets a hold of them, decide that they wouldn't have slept with that person or persons if they were sober. The hamster goes into overdrive and they decide that since they didn't want it in retrospect, that it was not consentual, and therefore that drunken hookup at the frat party was *actually a rape* &lt;gasp&gt;. This 'date rape' culture began during the 60's when women were beginning to encourage eachother that promiscuity would free them from their chains!

I read an analogy that sums up my feelings on most of these occurences tonight that I thought was worth discussion.

""Let me explain by means of an analogy with something less emotionally laden. Consider someone who purchases a lottery ticket which does not 
win the prize. Suppose he were to argue as follows: “I put my money down 
because I wanted the prize. I wouldn’t have paid if I had known I was going 
to lose; therefore I have been deprived of my money against my will; therefore 
I am the victim of theft.” No one would accept this argument as valid. Why 
shouldn’t we?


For the very good reason that it denies the fundamental principle behind 
all personal responsibility. Those who want to make their own choices in life 
must be willing to accept the consequences of those choices. Consider the alternative: If every loser in a lottery were entitled to a refund there would be no 
money left for the prize, and so no lottery. For similar reasons, most civilized 
institutions depend upon people taking responsibility for their actions, keeping 
agreements and fulﬁ lling obligations regardless of whether or not they happen 
to like the consequences.""

I've talked to numerous women who describe their 'date rapings' and to me its just a drunken hook up. No resistance. It actually takes them a few days to realize that ""OMG I WAS ACTUALLY RAPED""

This is a touchy subject for a lot of people. At my university, there was a male professor who was quoted by the student paper as saying ""I doubt the existence of date rape"" who was *fired*. **FIRED** for saying this. No one cared to listen to his reasoning. He was clearly a misogynist according the feminist warpigs in the Women's Studies department... 

Personal anecdotes aside, reading articles about this stuff lets me know its not just in my head and that it happens in other places as well.

However I had also been fully facing and coping with my mistakes in the past, having wrestled with the fear I wasted too much time missing/botching opportunities. Then I lived with Jerry (placeholder name). 

I've posted about Jerry a few times on this sub but to provide current context he's a trifecta of attraction (looks, game, and assets). A hot shot lawyer with his own practice, you'd think the man would be invincible. He's not, and learning of his Achilles heel made me feel much better about my own process of transformation, even the many failures of my blue pill past. 

Jerry had been given everything from the get go. A coddled only child, he had his whole education paid for him (hell, his parents even had paid for his own office suite after graduating law school). Even beyond a promising future, Jerry is also very physically attractive with great game. His assets, looks and natural game were all sort of handed to him in a way. Despite what could be seen as his gift, it has also been his curse. He continues to take rejections/disappointments terribly because he's barely ever used to them. I had been jealous of naturals my entire life till I fully realized Jerry's weaknesses.

He is also very dependent on constant validation, even from me (someone who has over three times less his lay count). For example, with a few of his exes and past hookups who ended up dating someone new he would show me a picture of their new SO on his smartphone and asked if he looked better than him (the answer would be always yes, which is why his severe need for validation confused me). He was my older brother's college roomie for six years and even my bro has told me that he's always been a validation hound from the beginning. 

I found very bizarre that this sexual conquistador was even seeking validation from me (freshly post-blue pill and pretty inexperienced with successful scenarios, which he fully knows). Then I realized that since I've grown more comfortable with myself through heavy study and introspection, I now don't seek validation. I feel my past blue pill experiences have given me a thicker skin that I'll have a hard time taking for granted. Despite his rocketing sexual market value, Jerry still unknowingly slips in the blue pill puddle from time to time because of his need for validation and his inability to cope with disappointments in general. His comfortable, close-minded pride may keep him from fixing this for a long time.

Overall I've found that I'm no longer jealous of naturals who never ""wasted their time"" failing. My eagerness to learn and experiment will only keep my mind open to improvement, increasing my sexual market value along with my general quality of life. I may still envy Jerry's results, but I find myself grateful for my newfound ability to harness my own self-validation along with taking rejection, criticism with ease.

   There is a woman that works in the same building as I do, and we have a lot of interactions.  Usually fun, communicating about patients, or a good natured story about the weekend.  We would hang out outside of work in a group.  She texted a few weeks ago to 'hang out' just she and I, I said fine.  We went out to eat, drink, then watched a movie at my place.  Seperate couches, no touching.  She is attractive enough, expired though.  40+.  Holds it together OK, but does look 40+.  I will not bang a work chick again. I do not want to bang this chick.  
    So, it turns out that paying her attention in the outside world is biting me in the ass.  As many women do, she is attempting to monopolize much of my time.  Recent texts involve ""Hellooo?

I am always the one to ask you to hang out""  when I don't respond for 30 minutes I get ""yep, I knew it, you hate me""  and "" I see, you move to your fancy new apartment and now you don't have time for me anymore, lol, whatever""

To emphasize, I have not seen this girl naked, and do not want to.  I'm getting shit tests from a girl for simply paying attention to her outside of work.  
I respond to the texts with desire to not escalate the situation, but I usually respond with some non-serious answer 'I hate sardines' or 'why was 6 afraid of 7?'  By not taking the tests seriously, I think I am passing them...but I don't want to pass them.  I want the whole thing to go away.

These are my stories:",59,30,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1k53to/so_after_a_recent_breakup_and_some_serious/,"Ahh, my first night out as a single man after a 4 year relationship. Luckily for me towards the end of it  (last 4 months) I started working out like crazy and dropped 20 lbs of fat and put some muscle on. Now im 5'11'' and 174lbs. So anyone, whether in a relationship or not, WORK OUT. It definitely helps to give you some confidence.

I was heading to a local bar to meet up with 2 guy friends. One was bringing a chick he wanted to hook up with. I then arranged to meet up with a fling from my past that I havent seen in 4 years. I told her to come meet us out because in case I wasn't interested anymore I had easy outs. 

Time is going by, Im at the bar talking to women (practicing my skills) around me and just focusing on having a good time (as is the mantra around here). I didn't need females to have a good time at all. 

These two women next to me kept looking my way, preening their hair, and trying to dance with me. I also noticed one had an engagement ring on her finger. I couldn't tell which one was into me, because I think they both kinda were. When I talked to one, the other would begin to ""bump"" into me dancing, or step on me and ""stumble"" so I would grab her. When one girl went to the bathroom I started talking to Engaged Girl. I made a comment about her ring and she said that ""it doesn't mean I can't have fun"" and started to shake her ass on me. What a prize her fiance must have ::sarcasm:: When she went to the bathroom I began to talk to the other girl. This one was less attractive, probably a 5-6. Im 30, this girl was also 30 but looked older. I immediately remembered a thread a read on here about why there is no reason a man would want an older woman instead of a younger one. Her skin wasn't that tight, had some wrinkles, and when I made a comment about her age she flipped. This woman was def. post wall with an inflated SMV. I think she thought she had me in the bag and when I began to make comments about her age and then seeing me talked to younger girls she called me a jerk and left. During this exchange the girl that my friend was after became intrested in me just because those two women were interested in me **Pre-Selection**??? And when I dismissed them she was even more intrigued. I didnt pursue her or anything but told my friend to think of her as a good time girl, dont get serious.

While this was going on the woman who wanted to meet me sent a text that said ""Hahah I fell asleep sorry"". I knew what this was, this was going to be a **SHIT TEST**. I replied ""awesome go back to sleep"".

I wasn't going to be the typical beta. I wasn't going to encourage a negative behavior or beg her to come or ask why etc. Then the wave  of text messages began. ""she wrote ""Im so sorry, do you want me to come?"" I replied ""No"". More texts until she started calling me, and texting shes in her car on the way. I told her to go back home. She then began begging for me to call her, to which I said no. She sent one last Im sorry message and a ""ill make it up to you"".

So that was the jist of my night. Nothing else as significant as those moments for me. I didn't get any numbers, but I didnt even care.

That means always keep more than one plate spinning, and never promise commitment of any sort.  I'll explain later why this is important.  

Every time your partner shows undesirable behavior:  

Decide if the offense is a dealbreaker.  
If it is, take a step back from the relationship (""Soft Next"" her).  
If it isn't, relax and don't let it bother you.  

**Why does it work?**  
Relationship problems are generally caused by broken rules and over-familiarity.  

By ""rules"" I refer to unspoken beliefs that usually involve the word ""should"" or ""must"".  
""She should have called me back."" ""She shouldn't have acted like that."" ""She has to see that I'm right about this."" And so on.  

Over-familiarity occurs when two people spend too much time together and share the same space for too long. Subconsciously, you and/or your partner start to feel that you don't have to put as much time and effort into the relationship as you did at the beginning of the relationship. It generally takes months to years for this to occur.  

**""Rules"":**  
The more rules you have, the more likely it is that one of them will get broken, and that generally causes drama. Eliminate as many *shoulds* and *musts* from your life as you can.  I recommend Albert Ellis' books for this.  
The few rules that remain should be important enough to end a relationship over.  
If it's not important enough to end the relationship over, it's not worth getting frustrated by.  
In any questionable situation, ask yourself ""Am I being treated well?""  If the answer is ever ""no"", you need to immediately take a step back from the relationship.  

**Soft Next:**  
Don't explain anything, just break off all contact with your partner for a minimum of a week. Spend this time working on your own goals, socializing with friends, and sleeping with other women.  

**Warnings:**  
Dropping off the grid is a dick move if you have a girlfriend or wife.  Becoming a boyfriend or husband essentially tells her ""I'm not going to end the relationship without *communicating*,"" and following these rules would essentially break that promise.  This is why you shouldn't promise any commitment.  Perhaps not surprisingly, this is also why women push for monogamy: to keep you from disappearing and to reliably keep you in their lives.  

Of course, as stated earlier, the longer they reliably have you the less effort they put out to keep you.  This is a Bad Thing.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,1374369631.0,theory,,True,t3_1iq5l0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1iq5l0/how_to_have_relationships_with_absolutely_zero/,

Not the normal place you'd expect a manosphere blogger to hang out, and it's interesting for that reason: he not only has to answer the question, he has to break down the premise, and do it in a couple of hundred words. So he's taking grit and making pearls out of it.

[Here's an interesing one](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ams7kW3yJIank9T0lRxu8W_ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20130423153844AAEm9ED). Married couple have to live with husband's parents for a while, wife and mother-in-law don't get on. Dalrock's advice:

&gt; The other advice you will get here on answers is to gather more power to yourself. Ironically this is also the opposite of what you should do. The problem facing modern wives is that they live in a de facto matriarchy. This means that your mother in law not only outranks you, but she outranks your husband as well. This is why the pressure you are putting on him doesn't work. She knows when he pushes back on her that he is doing so in your name, not under his own strength. Since she outranks you (as your elder), she disregards him when he is acting merely as your agent. The solution is to make your husband the head of the household. Husbands are naturally protective of their wives, and if he understands he is leading he will feel a strengthened sense of responsibility to protect you. If he pushes back on her from the legitimate position of head of his own household, you will be astonished at how quickly she will settle down. Part of what this kind of mother in law is craving is firmness from the men in her family. I know of some cases where the mother in law changed so completely that she now takes the daughter in law out to lunch and they are like best friends. Keep in mind however that it can take some time to effect this level of change in his thinking.

I was literally in bed an hour ago and as I woke up, I realize that my gf didn't reply back to a text I sent last night.

As men, if done in the wrong way, like say if you talk to a girl and she simply smiles or laughs at you, many come under the impression that that girl is simply into you, which may not be true, given any further indication of interest by her.  Blue pill guys can begin to obsess about such interactions, thinking ""is she into me?"" (lack of abundance mentality) when she just laughed at a joke and thats about it.

My point here is that we (men and women) all hamster, and it points out to our insecurities, lack of self confidence and self worth, and if we REALIZE what we are doing, we can manipulate it, and change our behaviors for the better, and thus, have a better grip on reality for what it is, so we can all swallow the red pill that much easier.",Rant/Venting,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,rant,,True,t3_1hsvwu,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hsvwu/after_a_small_epiphany_i_realize_that_even_men/,

Marriage = contractual slavery. Sounds harsh or a bit hyperbolic? Okay.

1.) Sex? Nope. Your fucking days are **done**.

 I won't rehash [Briffault's Law](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1anu3q/briffaults_law/) except to say that you have sex more often when you're single. Do not get married for sex - that is a lie that women perpetuate.

2.) Like having a positive net worth? Well, kiss that shit goodbye.

 When you get married, half of your assets become hers. I don't say that half of her assets become yours, mostly because most women don't have assets, but also because she will get *your* shit in the divorce. That's right. She can come with nothing and leave with half of your stuff. Worse, you could be forced to pay her monthly because she didn't do shit with her life and now cant fend for herself in the real world. What type of contract is that? One in which the man gets boned, that's what type. Do men get alimony? Take a guess. 

Edit: I also failed to mention that you get to keep her debt in the divorce! Hurrah for marriage!

No wonder [most divorces are initiated by women.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce#Sex_and_divorce) Tricksy hobbitses.

3.) Hey, you're a pretty good dad, but you aren't getting custody. Enjoy those paid visitation rights.

This is a two part whammy. What does juggling and being [the best dad in the world](http://buylovely.com/files/funzug/imgs/crazypics/best_dad_world_17.jpg) have in common? They don't mean **fuckall** in a courtroom. 

Despite the fact that [mothers abuse their children more than fathers](http://mkg4583.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/mothers-abuse-children-3-times-more-than-dads-federal-hhs-statistics/) the legal system awards them custody almost 75% of the time because of the constantly reinforced (and bullshit) message that mothers are, by default, better parents. The best part about this arrangement is that the father now has to *pay his ex-wife* for the privilege of seeing his kids on weekends and holidays. Bet your ass when those kids misbehave the mother is going to put it on you to fix.

 When the father is awarded custody, do the mothers pay child support? Want a clue, or do you see where this is going?

4.) She divorced you, took the kids and half of your paycheck. You think you're done with her? Nope, the crazy sticks forever.

 Ready to move on with your life and see other people. Awesome. Good on you. Too bad your ex-wife doesn't approve of your new girlfriend. Sure, she says its because ""she doesn't want some tramp around her kids"" (notice how she said ""her kids?"") 

We know what it really is though. She's divorced you, but she **will not** tolerate you being happy with someone else. She will use whatever tool she has to keep you from moving on. She will constantly call. She will ""just stop by"". She will show up to places you frequent, often in the company of other men. She will feign interest in you again (and she will even believe it herself). Worst of all - she will use your kids as a tool to eat up your time.

She said ""I just treated him not really good because he was just so comfortable (unlike you, mr). I just treated him not really good. I was being so whiny, a handful and all. Then he was getting tired of that. Maybe."" 

I clarified ""So you treated me better than him because I was less comfortable?"" (English is not her first language so I like to repeat for clarity, but here she meant something like easily cowed, or a pushover). 

She said she always felt insecure around me because I would let her know if she did something annoying. I just didn't put with this shit. In return I got a woman who who didn't do shit tests and worried how *I* would react instead of the other way around. She also knew I would break up with her in a heartbeat if she fucked up.

My ex is a very hot Korean girl, and one thing I find interesting is that when she lived in Boston she knew guys from all the world at her English school, some of them rich Saudis (or at least playing at being rich). These guys would offer to buy her clothes, phones, ipads, whatever. Some Korean dude when she was back home gave her half off a pair of shoes saying that she's ""just so pretty"".  These guys just tried to impress her with money. 

Then on the other hand, there's me. I never said ""oh you're so hot let me buy that for you"".  I never put her up on a pedestal just because she's beautiful, and wasn't overly concerned with how much fun she was having when we were out, something which one guy did so much and understandably annoyed her.

Through all of this, I was the guy she was desperately in love with. And when it came time for her to leave to get a job as a flight attendant, and she asked for us to date long distance saying that she would visit 3-4 times a year, I told her there was no way I was going to do long distance.  She was devastated and cried while we were walking IN PUBLIC.

Because of this, we've run into some new issues I want to address with our new modified Posting rules.

**Concern Trolling**

Since we're getting more and more users every day, the signal to noise ratio is bound to decline by at least a little bit. Because of this, we have decided that one such dampener to signal is concern trolling. From this point forward, we will delete any post that attempts to ""steer"" the subreddit or complains about the direction of content. 

If for some reason you're not happy with the quality of posts here, I encourage you to upvote good material, downvote bad material, and submit your own high-quality material.

**Racism**

The Red Pill is dedicated to finding the truth *about sex and gender strategies*, no matter how unpopular or difficult it may seem. For some strange reason, this has brought forward a number of racist posts, which have swiftly been removed. Let us discuss exactly what we mean by racism. 

We acknowledge that cultural and genetic differences have an effect on behavior. However, we do not accept that one's race is inextricably tied to their culture. (Because it isn't). If you want to comment on a culture, speak of the culture. If you want to comment on genetics, comment on genetics. Do not confuse the two.

Understand that the differences between men and women are large as our genders have been evolving for millions of years, but the segregated cultures (and thus races) are in the hundreds of thousands (if that).

We are not denying that there are genetic differences between races. That said, we will not allow TheRedPill to be hijacked by blatant racism by conflating race with culture. **This is not up for discussion.**

**Posting Comments Rules**

Our discussion is not meant to be just an echo chamber, we absolutely encourage discussion that challenges commonly held beliefs. That is the core of the red pill: challenging what we know.

That being said, if you're new here and haven't read the sidebar, there's a good chance that what you want to say has already been heard and we don't really care to argue it. Some of the opinions and ideas we have here may seem a bit shocking at first if you aren't familiar with our theories. Let me be clear:

Our theories are well thought out, backed by evolutionary psychology, and are regularly confirmed by the behaviors we witness. One of the most astounding parts of the red pill is meeting new people here from other parts of the world... who all report the same behavior we've witnessed ourselves. There is REAL truth to the info we're compiling. Attempts to label it misogyny completely misses the point. We do not focus on women as the enemy and consider insults to hurl. Instead, we see women as our goal, and focus on theories as to why they behave the way they do, and how we should behave in light of this information.

If you attempt to ""creep"" shame, call out misogyny, or otherwise attempt to derail conversation because the information here is shocking to you, it will tell us one thing: You haven't even attempted to understand why and how we've arrived at our conclusions.

Any post that does not make a point and instead makes ad hominem attacks will be immediately deleted. A moderator may post a test article for you to read and discuss to prove you are not here to troll. If you fail the test, you may be banned.

We have no interest in becoming an echo chamber, and we don't mind dissenting viewpoints. But if it derails conversation, we will take action. If you're worried you might derail conversation, lurk more.

What I observed absolutely sickened me.

My brother-in-law, always the passive beta, sits with dwindling confidence and growing frustration as my otherwise adorable little niece slaps his hand away as he tries to lovingly help her. She refuses him niceties, and it is clear she has zero respect for her father.
This pansy of a man just sat there and took it from his little girl.
And by no means was this a one night only performance.

All the while my sister not only fails to correct her daughter's rude behavior, but obviously enables it. Treating her husband like the twerp he is: Talking down to him and negating every command he sheepishly asks of his daughter.

I must add that my sister, once a fairly attractive and slender woman, has since ballooned up to unhealthy &amp; grotesque proportions since having their child (3 years ago!). 

I sat at the table with a visceral feeling of disgust and, quite frankly, terror!
My niece -partly my blood- acting like a miserable, male-hating ""princess"" (She treats me well because I don't take her shit).

I once casually pointed to my brother-in-law my sister's attitude and the only response he could jokingly shrug was, ""she makes more money than me. Ha ha.""
(This dude makes a very decent living too)

Am I to blame my sister or do I blame this ""man"" who clearly has given up any semblance of self worth.

Is it time for us to use the female tactic of shame to awaken the average schlub?
Shame to arouse counteraction.
Would it even work?

If not for us, but for the precious, precious children.

**Promiscuous women are more likely to divorce**

Taken from [the social pathologist's blog](http://socialpathology.blogspot.com/2010/09/sexual-partner-divorce-risk.html):
&gt; Cohabitation, that is ""living together"" before marriage has been shown to increase the risk of subsequent divorce of a couple. Many investigators have felt that the practice of cohabitation is selective for people who don't value marriage highly and hence are more likely to divorce when stress is put onto the marriage. In essence, it was thought that the cohabitors more ""liberal values"" placed them at higher risk of divorce.

&gt;Jay Teachman, an academic, investigated this matter further. The study, which is available online, makes for interesting reading. Teachman's genius was to look stratify the cohabitors risk of divorce by the by the number of sexual partners/cohabiting history.

&gt;The study was based on data from the National Survey of Family Growth 1995 cycle and involved over 6500 women.

&gt;It was controlled for a host of variables.

&gt;The study was in no way sponsored or funded by any conservative organisation.

&gt;&gt;Teachman's conclusion: 
&gt;&gt;The results presented in this article replicate findings from previous research: Women who cohabit prior to marriage or who have premarital sex have an increased likelihood of marital disruption. Considering the joint effects of premarital cohabitation and premarital sex, as well as histories of premarital relationships, extends previous research. The most salient finding from this analysis is that women whose intimate premarital relationships are limited to their husbands—either premarital sex alone or premarital cohabitation—do not experience an increased risk of divorce. **It is only women who have more than one intimate premarital relationship who have an elevated risk of marital disruption. This effect is strongest for women who have multiple premarital coresidental unions.** These findings are consistent with the notion that premarital sex and cohabitation have become part of the normal courtship pattern in the United States. They do not indicate selectivity on characteristics linked to the risk of divorce and do not provide couples with experiences that lessen the stability of marriage.
&gt;Executive summary: It's not the liberal values, it the number of partners that matter.

&gt;And,

&gt;&gt;This limitation notwithstanding, the results presented here should shift attention away from research that focuses on the selection of individuals into cohabitation and premarital sex to a focus on the selection of individuals who do not marry the individuals with whom they first cohabit or initiate first sex. **It may well be the case that, irrespective of the legal status of the relationship, the relevant distinction to make is between people who form multiple relationships and people who form a single, longer lasting relationship.**

***TL; DR:*** He also [super imposes Teachman's findings onto the heritage study](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R-WhB9g9eYk/TJDSr8V_ShI/AAAAAAAAAOg/VmMGTymAVcI/s1600/teachman).


**Promiscuous women have an elevated risk of depression**

There was a study done on college students a while ago, [No Strings Attached: The Nature of Casual Sex in College Students, The Journal of Sex Research, Vol. 43, No. 3, August 2006, pp. 255-267](http://life.umt.edu/curry/DOcs-SOS/Current%20Peer%20Educators/Articles/Grello_et_al.pdf).  

On page 263, there's a [chart that clearly shows this relation](http://i.imgur.com/fGM8arc.png)

Further up, on page 259, so you can understand what the charts saying:
&gt; The CES-D was developed as a self-report instrument to measure depressive symptoms in the general population. **Higher values signify more symptoms of depression.** A score of 0-14 has been found to be equivalent to the levels of depressive symptoms in the general population; a score of 15-36 has been found to indicate the individual is ""at risk"" for depression; and a score of 37 or higher has been found equivalent to scores found in clinically depressed individuals.

**TL; DR:** Men's depressive symptoms were roughly unaffected by their number of sexual partners; in contrast, as women have more sexual partners, they have more depressive symptoms.

Bonus:
[A gem from PhysiciansForLife.org](http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/242/27/)

&gt; According to a study reported in Pediatrics, early sexual activity leads to serious behavioral problems. Of 1500 girls studied, non-virgin girls were 2.5 times more likely to have used alcohol than virgins, 6.2 times more likely to have smoked marijuana, and 4.3 times more likely to have attempted suicide...


**Why it is beneficial for men to engage in promiscuous behavior:**

**Women prefer taken men**

Evidence of mate choice copying in humans?  [The chateau delivers.](http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/women-prefer-taken-men/)

&gt; Offered a single man, 59 per cent were interested in pursuing a relationship. But when he was attached, 90 per cent said they were up for the chase.

&gt; Men were keenest on pursuing new mates, but weren’t bothered whether their target was already attached or not.

Its the reason why your girlfriend would forget about your three year relationship if Kobe Bryant dropped his trousers. However female hypergamy is also the reason why women are never there at the start and only get involved when things begin looking up.

**Personal Computing** When Microsoft and Apple [first](http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-48-03-metablogapi/0677.image_5F00_26EF2854.png) got started the work force was predominantly male. Now Microsoft's workforce is 25% female a massive increase. But why is this? When these tech companies were new they needed very high productivity to stay afloat. Want to work for Apple? Cool, go solder wires in my garage for eight hours, maybe you'll get payed maybe not. Very few women sighned up for this kind of work, because women are risk averse. However once these companies start getting large and profitable they could afford to hire women as front desk staff, marketing, middle managers etc, positions that are necessary for a large company but no where near as necessary as the engineers who actually make the product.

**Comic Book Conventions** In the 90's Comic Con was pretty much a male nerd convention. Where groups of men and boys would go to meet with the authors and argue about comic book dogma. Comic Books were uncool so there was very little female participation. That all changed. Hollywood realized that instead of taking risks on new screen plays it could just  tap into the Super Hero genre. As soon as capital was there, Comic Con became cool and women started  showing up in thongs dressed as various characters, claiming to be 'nerds'. Realistically its safe to assume that women are there for the spectacle, attention because women only started showing up when those things became a factor.

**Fitness** Back in the 60's most gyms were poorly lit dusty rooms filled with rusty weights sweating men, and tons of homosexuals. Golds was a huge gay pick up spot. Bodybuilders were though of as weirdos and were shamed by women to fulfill traditional gender roles. The fitness industry started exploding when men saw Arnold in Conan and wanted his body. Gyms started getting built. Fitness became trendy women started showing up. In fact Fitness is so trendy now that gym *membership* not *attendance* is predominantly female (my district manager once told me this). For this reason gyms are getting feminized less squat racks more zumba classes. Women don't understand the irony of being on the elliptical and being repulsed by a large bodybuilder. The bodybuilder belongs in the gym because he uses the gym as a means, the elliptical rider does not, she is there because its trendy to workout.

All important human preferences are biologically hardwired to ensure maximum reproductive capability. 

Humans naturally find corpses unattractive. Why? Because the same bacteria that digest dead human flesh can  infect a living person.

Humans find certain landscapes inherently [beautiful.](http://miriadna.com/desctopwalls/images/max/Landscape-with-calm-river.jpg) Why? Because a bright green field with an adjacent river is lush and fertile and will support many huntable animals or an abundance of  crops. Humans are drawn to pristine landscapes because they make an ideal place to make a home.

Humans are hardwired to fear certain things. Heights, snakes, and large carnivores. Young children often have nightmares about these things. Fear and aversion is the body's defense mechanism against danger.

Mate selection is by far the most important decision am organism makes in its lifetime. You can bet your redpill ass that, this decision is heavily (although not exclusively) dictated by biology. Men instinctively know what constituents a good mate. A young woman in her late teens early twenties with long hair, symmetrical face, full lips and wide hips. These woman have the easiest pregnancy, and children with lowest incidents of birth defects or miscarriage.

Classic eye contact looks away then seems nervous. This goes on for a month until im like fuck it, if I dont talk to her then ill never get any. Start having conversations after class, girl is awkward as shit. Two weeks later take her to a party with me. Try to kiss her she waves me off because shes kind of seeing someone.

Dont take no for an answer if I stop trying then it will be awkward because I have a year and a half left in the same class with her. Keep asking her out on dates. She keeps going with me.

Come over to 'study for class' in her apartment, then start making out on the regular.Valentines rolls around. Figure if I dont get her some shit then she will think I don't care about her, less chance of de pussy. Call her on Valentines day tell her she left some shit in my house and ill drop it off. Come to her apartment hand her $10 supermarket flowers, 3 Dollar Cupcake. Her roommate sees this. Made her look good in front of roommate. Has some shit to put on Facebook to brag to her friends about feels wanted. Received a shit ton of affirmation. 

Month later ask her out, because dont want to compete with other men, enjoy stability, dislike the dating/party scene and alcohol need stability for bodybuilding and school. Doesnt want to have sex because of jesus, fuck her in the butt, tired of butt fucking take virginity. Three years go by. Chill low maintenance relationship. No arguments, No yelling, she buys me food sometimes, Spend Christmases with her family so I don't have to be lonely jew on Christmas. Enjoy faling asleep on nice warm boobies every night.

Last April her Slut friends invite her to Vegas with them. She spends spring break there getting hit on by all sorts of dudes. Inundated with male attention and validation. Comes back feels bored by our relationship. Breaks up two weeks later because she needs to discover herself. Tell her that her self discovery is not about herself but throttling dicks. She denies this gets angry. Tells me we should stay friends because im the only other friend she has in University, agree on the condition that she pays me to work out with her.

Sleeping by myself feels terrible. Cry at night. Start fucking again in an open relationship, agree to tell each other everything we do with other people because of STD consideration. She goes to Vegas whores herself out to dudes with tables and nice hotel rooms. Gives three dudes hand jobs in four day period one of them wheelchair bound. Rationalizes this as something that just sorta happened/ Not Her Fault. Laugh at her hamstring. Start fucking random OKC girls but predominantly still fuck her.

I didn't need friends, I met new people every day and I was famous in that world. 

I've lived in a sheltered life, far from reality, I protected myself from failure, there was no chance to fail, what could I lose? My dream was graphic design, people said to me, you won't earn money there, you live in Greece get a stable job you idiot, we are bankrupt and you will be working in a call center, better be an engineer.

I listened to these people and stopped following my passion, stop reading books of the subject, stopped drawing. And every day I would guilt trip myself, procrastinating (""I will do it tomorrow"").

I'm not even ugly, totally average guy, single mother and only son, no physical conditions or mental conditions that would excuse it, I'm not even awkward, I don't have a silver tongue or any of the likes but compared to many nerds guys out there I do great and can have conversation with any HB without issues, most people I know would never guessed that I live this lifestyle, I do a good (awful) job at lying to them.

Recently I decided it was enough, I need to fix myself. Reading every material I can get, got rid of all my video games, gave away my steam account and others. I've been doing gym for the past days, going to enroll myself in a night time school in design, sent my CV to a few companies.

I don't know the reason why I decided to write this, I probably hope someone out there with the same problem as me or in a similar path, can read this and decide to make a change in their lives.

This is just *my opinion* and not **Cold Hard Fact^TM**. If you don't like it, say why like an adult instead of leaving an emotional response.

If I wanted reactionary responses rooted in emotion, I'd go to r/thebluepill. Onto the post.

After posting the 'Female Mating Playbook, page 1', I got a plethora of responses, many good, and some [damp from beta-tears](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1e7yr5/female_mating_playbook_page_1_i_have_a/c9xtxmh). It made me think about the stigma associated with infidelity, and who monogamy benefits. Then i realized that women, the masters of doublethink, practice hypergamy and (in the same breath) say that **cheating is wrong.**

1.) The Stigma Of Cheating

Our culture (for the sake of this thread, i will be talking about America) has numerous names, most of them disparaging, for people who break the social contract of a committed relationship. Society has created a culture of shame associated with people who not only break the contract, but the people who aid in it or do not prevent it from happening. The question is *why?*

I would **guess** it is because 51% of the american populace is female, and they are being aided by non-alpha males. This is not an attack against them or even a negative criticism of their goals. In fact, they are playing to their own interests by promoting monogamy and socially shaming those who do not. 

2.) What the women gain

 By promoting monogamy, the women have free reign to pursue a variety of males through strings of several ""committed relationships"" (this is merely [hypergamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy)). These relationships allow the female the luxury of being able to claim a man until a better one comes and she is free to leave.

 This dynamic also serves to keep men from pursuing other women while in the ""committed relationship"" for fear of social reprisal. Women will appeal to a man's sense of honor to keep him loyal. Worse, a woman can tell of a man's infidelity and it will make other women (who are playing by their own rules) publicly avoid him as a prospective mate.

3.) What beta's gain

 By promoting monogamy, the beta is the ally of the woman. They (foolishly) believe that monogamy will ensure their chances of mating because the idea of hypergamy is foreign to them. They will viciously (more than women) shame any male who breaks from the script because it not only threatens the perceived social hierarchy, but it threatens them *personally* because it means that at **any second** an alpha can be stealing ""their girl"".

4.) The thing that really counts

Firstly, remember, **morality is subjective** and has *zero* context when it comes to mating. Those who mate win and those who don't mate lose. Our ancestors were *winners* and billions of people have come and gone who weren't. We are designed to mate by the most efficient means with the most efficient results. **Moral judgments about mating often come from those who aren't mating.**

I feel feminism is outdated and equality has been replaced by a world where men are feminized and women are running wild.  But I'm not here to preach to the choir, I'm here looking for some thoughts regarding my boyfriend.

My boyfriend has, what I feel, is an unhealthy (blue pill, if you will) relationship to women.  

I think it started with his mother.  His mother is overbearing and forces everyone around her to bend to her will.  She is on her fourth marriage; my boyfriend is her second of two children.  His mother is not nurturing at all.  She would complain about their fathers to their faces when they were young.  She was never loving or affectionate.  She worked night shift, leaving them to fend for themselves most of the time.  Even now, as an adult, my boyfriend usually tries to avoid her.  When they are in contact, he feels as if he is always walking on eggshells.  He does not have a good relationship with his father--they haven't spoken in years.

His brother (from a different father) is an alpha in many ways.  He is older and works a high powered job.  He is the dominant partner in his relationship with his wife and with others.  He spends a good deal of time on his appearance.  As far as I know, he didn't spend a great deal of time chasing women before his wife, but that was likely because he is a practicing Catholic.  My boyfriend feels somewhat inferior to his brother, but maintains a certain amount of, let's call it pity, for him, mostly related to his job and social status requiring a certain amount of slavery -- slavery to his work, social expectations, trends, i.e. ""keeping up with the Joneses"".

My boyfriend has dated a handful of women before me.  There are a number of qualities that the majority of them share.  They are high-maintenance, both money-wise and emotional.  They come from single-child, high-income families.  They preferred for my boyfriend to neglect his friends to spend time with them instead.  (With the notable exception of the woman he dated just before me, who was so emotionally distant and whom he saw so infrequently they might as well have been an online relationship.)

I love him.  I do not want to break up with him.  But, that being said, I think both of us would be a happier if he could see some of the alpha side of things.

Some examples:

1.  He thinks that I, like many women before me, want him to drop on the floor and worship me every second of the day.  I want him to go out with his friends without me, partially out of selfish desire because I strongly value my alone time.  He thinks that I will feel jealous and lonely, no matter how many times I state otherwise.  

2.  His beta personality doesn't just affect his relationship with women, it affects his experience at work.  He works in a male-dominated field (~9:1 men to women; none of his immediate coworkers are female).  When he tells me about his day at work, it sounds like a lot of his coworkers pile things up on him.  He seems incapable of saying no.  I think he gets pushed around because of his beta male status.

3.  He is physically intimidated by other men.  His past girlfriends told him about their ""dream guys""; just one example included firemen.  My boyfriend is tall and thin, with little muscle mass.  I have caught him trying to manipulate me into saying some muscled guy on TV is sexy.  It is frustrating that he tries to rope me into perpetuating his bad body image.

I love him and care very much for him.  I like to think that we have a good relationship going, and that his confidence level has increased over the course of our relationship, however little.  He makes more money than I do, which I think makes him feel good.  After good sex (our most recent, for example), he says that he felt more like a man than usual.  

But what if we break up, for whatever reason?  He is a prime target for many women to abuse and I do not want that to happen.  Perhaps a woman trying to help a man is the very anti-thesis of this subreddit, but here goes nothing.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend suffers from having the beta male attitude burned into his mind starting at an early age.  Is there anything that I can do to increase his confidence and self-sufficiency?

In a half-burned house, | in a horse full swift--
One leg is hurt | and the horse is useless--
None had ever such faith | as to trust in them all.

And careless of counsel wise;
Well I believed | that soon I should win
Measureless joy with the maid.

100. So came I next | when night it was,
The warriors all were awake;
With burning lights | and waving brands
I learned my luckess way.

101. At morning then, | when once more I came,
And all were sleeping still,
A dog found | in the fair one's place,
Bound there upon her bed.

102. Many fair maids, | if a man but tries them,
False to a lover are found;
That did I learn | when I longed to gain
With wiles the maiden wise;

I've been following this subreddit, and overall Red Pill philosophy for a few months now. I recently bought Athol Kay's MAP Primer.

I've created account today for the community's advice. I'm a 33 male with a 33 old wife. Married 9 years, together 14 with 2 kids. 

This past weekend I caught my wife making out with another woman. The woman is a ""consultant"" who came to our home the weekend after spending a few days with my wife at work. She's from across the country and while I know they've communicated before her arrival I'm fairly confident they have never met before the incident.

Anyway, this woman came over, along with another woman my wife works with and they all started drinking. I left for a few hours to play poker and when I came back (around 11pm) my wife was drunk and the other women were tipsy. They were outside at our fire pit. I stay with them until about 12:30 then I go to bed. Not long after I go to bed the woman who my wife works leaves as well, leaving my wife alone with this ""consultant.""

For some reason I had a bad feeling in my stomach so even though it made me feel ridiculous I camped out at a window overlooking the firepit and watched my wife with this other woman (the consultant). My wife eventually began touching her neck, sitting very close to her, and putting her hand high on her thigh. I managed to open a window a little so I could listen, but could only make out parts of the conversation. At one point I hear my wife say to her ""I promise I won't hurt you.""  After about 20 minutes of sitting incredibly close, and touching in very friendly ways,  I see them kiss.

A few minutes after they kiss, I see them get up and head to the back part of the yard (away from the house). Since I could no longer see them from the window I snuck outside and heard them giggling and whispering quietly.  After spending a few minutes driving myself crazy (wondering exactly what was going on) I finally go out to find both of them laying down with my wife practically laying on top of this woman and looking like she is going to kiss her.

I pull her off the woman and demand to know what is going on. They are both clearly VERY intoxicated. They lie and say they were just cuddling. I asked if anything physical happened and of course they say no. They only admit to kissing after I told them what I saw. Of course I'm angry and yelling. Meanwhile this other woman is telling me to sit down and calm down on my own property. I tell her to leave and since she's too drunk to drive that I'll take her back to the hotel. They both tell me that she is not comfortable with me at the moment and won’t ride with me. I tell my wife I need to talk with her about the incident right then and that she should ask the woman to leave. She doesn't.

After that I packed my kids up and took them to my fathers (at 3 am). It took 40 minutes for my wife to realize what happened but what followed was a series of phones between my wife and I were she was yelling at me and calling me ridiculous for taking the kids. 

Eventually I came home later that morning (around 7) and had a 6 hour conversation with my wife.  She said she was just drunk and eventually admitted to kissing the woman several times. She insisted that nothing else happened. I was skeptical and asked several challenging/cyncial questions. 

She basically she said was curious (even though this isn't the first time she's kissed another woman). I told her my problem wasn't that she kissed another woman, my problem was that she did it behind my back. She's gotten drunk and made out with women before and I've always been OK with because I've been there and knew about. I told her that had she come to me and said she was attracted to this other woman I would have been fine. It was the dishonesty and deceit I couldn't tolerate. 

She eventually provided answers that satisfied about 98% of my curiosity, although I did feel like she was trickle-truthing me at times. We had some of the best sex of our marriage with her giving me full access to everything from blow jobs to anal. I had as much sex as I wanted, however I wanted it. She's even been making more meals, doing more with the children and around the house. It SEEMS like she's genuinely sorry. 

Things were great for those few days, until on Monday night I caught her trying to delete a phone call. She accidentally deleted the whole call log (I've been following red pill advice and monitoring closely) and didn't admit to it until I told her I saw it happen (over her shoulder and through the window). She then says that she called the consultant to make sure the issue wouldn't affect her work. She said she had been concerned about the professional repercussions to the incident and she wanted to make it perfectly clear that the relationship needs to stay professional (she has to continue working with her, no choice really). 

I was pissed, because she lied again. I told her it would have been fine had I been there when she called, but that the whole thing felt deceptive. She promised me that it was only a 2 - 3 minute phone call, and the only significant interaction with her.

I later checked the phone records and found out the call was 20 minutes not 2. She said that they really didn't talk that much, and promised that the conversation happened as she related it.

In short, I caught in her another lie. It seems like a small lie, but I don’t really know.  Again, she’s been incredibly apologetic, has fucked me more in the last 5 days than in the last 5 weeks, and is basically giving me whatever I want.

I’ve been following the mate guarding advice, and I’m heavily monitoring all of her communications. I've been full on alpha since the event. So my question for the community is this – 

Should bisexual/lesbian infidelity be treated differently than classic infidelity?

How does a bisexual encounter factor into hypergamy? 

I’m pissed about the lying (of course) but I can’t figure out if this is a case of her wanting to explore with another woman, or if I’ve been too beta.  As I said, I’m still new to TRP.  I’m just trying to navigate my way through this.

I know my post is long, so thanks for taking the time to read it.

Short version: Creep shaming is to men what slut shaming is to women.

Long version: In the evolutionary sense men who were sexually unsuccessful were the big losers since they didn't propagate their genes. Women on the other hand who were promiscuous faced loads of dangers from indiscriminate reproduction, and even death in many cases of complications from pregnancy. Fast forward a few hundred eons and it stands to reason our instincts and culture would be influenced by these very real biological aspects of human nature.
So how does this apply to creep shaming? Well, if you frame a man as a creep you're disqualifying him as a sexual prospect AND creating a social pariah out of him that will also hamper his chances with other women in the social group, which is exactly what calling a woman a slut is intended to do.",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,m,True,t3_1gmr9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1gmr9g/creep_shaming/,

I started a new thread because I want to tie other aspects in the discussion, and would like to get your input.

So the premise is, as i've been seing it until now, that the women questioned find no issue in not liking their boyfriends hanging out with other (especially single) women , while themselves have platonic (from their standpoint) relationships with other men. 

On the surface it may seem like hypocrisy or obliviousness on their part. But hear me out, most of you probably figured this out, and may have something of value to add.

The way I see it, men and women have different value systems when it comes to social interraction. Both men and women enjoy sex, but it is obvious that women control its occurence, and (most of them) can get sex whenever. They use this asset to gain what they value tenfold, emotional intimacy, to gain another link in the support chain of companionship and validation (the other links being friends and family).

So you have two major needs: sex and emotional intimacy. Each one being more important than the other to both sexes. Men value sex &gt; emotional intimacy, and women the other way around.

Let's apply this to the premise. A woman (like one from the video), finds it fair (downright normal) to have a boyfriend and spend time with other men (and the girl is well aware that those men are attracted to her, sexually) because she knows they are just another link in the chain, even if they want sex from her, all she wants from them is someone to talk to/go to movies/chat/spend time/etc. She thinks it's ok because sex is off the table with these men - so the boyfriend has nothing to worry about, nothing to be jealous about. 

At the same time, she does not like it when the boyfriend has female friends, for the following three reasons.

1. The other girls are maybe using her boyfriend for emotional intimacy -  taking one of her links (with it - attention/love/validation/companionship) away from her. I can't be the only one noticing how terriotial some women are.

2. The boyfriend is sexually attracted to them.

3. Both 1 and 2

So from her standpoint, she does nothing wrong, society does not frown upon her having platonic male friends , so her boyfriend shouldn't be against it. And thanks to feminism, guys are perceived as slaves to their own libido, so any assumption on her part about her boyfriend and other women are automatically validated by society. Moreover, any other woman around her man interferes with the network, takes some of the attention away. Sexual or not, she won't like it. 

The conclusion here is not just hypocrisy, but **entitlement**

The outcome is  she can get what she values most without any scrutiny. You can say that she can have her cake and eat it too. 


This also explains why you hear stories where a woman is jealous when one of her platonic male friends gets a girlfriend, it's not a sign she was interested in him, it just means he will spend less time with her as a result, therefore losing something she deems valuable.

I'm surprised they didn't give me a pre-emptive ban like askwomen, but alas, slow to the draw I suppose.

Today I wanted to talk about how SRSWomen, and Feminists work.

I'm going to say that as far as RED PILL stuff goes, this subreddit is the center of it. There is no more hardcore, extreme, foam-mouthed sub dedicated to our ideals. This is it.

And we have no rule banning women.

In fact, our main rule is avoid ad hominem attacks and you can stay. (Surprisingly difficult rule to abide by apparently.)

So let's look at the literal translation of their rules.

##DWORKINS FASCIST RULES
* Men = Benned.
* No one cares if ur a cis dude or what ur cis dude penis thinks.

Because you have a penis, you cannot understand anything we speak of. Therefore instead of allowing the benefit of the doubt, we ban all men. Before you even try to make a point, men, we will fallaciously attack a component of your anatomy.

This is the literal meaning of sexism. Something of which we are accused of, but apparently can't even get into our rules! 

* Slurs get you benned.

Apparently they can't spell ban.

* Being a misogynist, ableist, white supremacist, transphobic, homophobic, creepy chucklefuck also gets you benned.

Sounds good. Define misogynist. Anybody who disagrees? 

* You post in MR? Thats great, Ben.

Because men don't deserve rights. I mean, look at it over there. They're talking about things that could affect women! Some of them even think women don't deserve rights. Anybody who says that a gender collectively doesn't deserve rights is EVIL! (except us, because men don't deserve rights.)

* Misandry? DONT REAL. NO BAN

Honestly though, did nobody go to school?

* Diet/Weight loss talk is benned.

Any talk about taking responsibility for yourself, your actions, your life and happiness is a no-go. Wouldn't want to offend anybody's sensibilities.

* No Libertarians Allowed

Are there any left after you banned everybody who makes coherent points?

-------------

Seriously though, I know most people will say that SRS is a bunch of trolls and pointing out their inconsistencies is pointless. But let's face it, this is how a lot of people think. 

I wanted to document this, I know it's an worn debate, but I needed to say it. Their points hold no value because they do not allow scrutiny. It is the anti-academia. 

So next time somebody argues that we're misogynist for calling women stupid, I direct you to **EVERY SINGLE WOMEN'S SUBREDDIT WHERE SCRUTINY AND CRITICAL THOUGHT ARE OUTRIGHT BANNED**.

I find it very easy to brush things aside, aka marriage, hanging out with certain people, meeting up with female friends, and effectively hiding yourself in a bubble or a routine. Its dangerous.

My negativity level hit an all time high. I found that I was so bitter. I called people on their shit more. I argued more. I was having views on very blue pill things, and making out to be a very cold horrible person.

Then I realised, thats not true. It was overload. I was on the red pill too often, and talking to similar people who shared the same view. But I realized that you half live doing this.

Its easy to base your life on just going out, not giving a fuck, being a bit selfish etc. But theres actually more to life then just the basics aka getting laid.

Its easy when you swallow the pill to lose your friends, to grow apart from the betas, and worst of all your close friends and family even. Thats not the way to be.

Warning:long, no tl;dr",42,14,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1jiqu4/self_master_the_art_of_eye_contact_warninglong_no/,"I want to address a key habit that will strengthen every man's game both with pickup and platonic conversation alike. Eye contact. Eye contact is absolutely key. Maintaining proper eye contact is the foundation of all conversational engagement. 

When you speak to someone (different than when someone is speaking to you, we'll get to that in a minute), you want to make almost constant eye contact. I mean, be totally unwavering. Get used to letting your eyes go out of focus a little bit. Yes. That much eye contact. Do this almost any time you are speaking to someone, especially if your portion of the dialogue at that moment consists of any more than one sentence. 

You do not want to stare someone down every time you talk. That is not what I am talking about. There is a fine line between staring and looking away that is solid eye contact, and you have to tread that line. It is scary at first, but once you get used to it and incorporate it into your habitual body language, you will appear a thousand times more alpha, and more importantly, a thousand times more charismatic and credible overall. People will start respecting what you have to say. They will naturally want to interrupt you less, even if you aren't looking at or talking to them.

 Don't look at people hard when you speak, unless you have good, specific reason to purposefully intimidate them. Look at their eyes like you would look at a poster on the wall, focused, but easy. 

When people speak to you, you want to maintain eye contact, but not necessarily constant eye contact. I have noticed that if someone's eyes leave yours while they are speaking to you and then come back to immediately meet yours, this can make people slightly nervous, not in a creepy way but in an intimidated way; they might even pause to try and remember what they were saying. (This can, however be employed as a killer strategy during any kind of conflict)

 You will, at times, come in contact with someone who is as comfortable with eye contact as you are. If they are speaking to you without confrontation, and their eyes do not divert from yours, keep eye contact yourself. This displays equal charisma and credibility. To divert your eyes from a man when he speaks to you can be interpreted as weakness on your own part. 

 My personal rule of thumb when being spoken to (in non-confrontational, non-pickup situations) is to maintain eye contact until that person breaks it. At that point, you should break it yourself as well, and anticipate (use your peripherals) when the person will look back at you. Once they have come back, wait 2-3seconds or wait until you begin to speak in reply, whichever comes first, then make eye contact again. Wait for them to break eye contact 3-4 times during conversation, then break it yourself that 4th or 5th time for just a couple of seconds. This will keep the listener engaged without making them feel uncomfortable. The nonverbal aspect of the conversation will remain natural and uninhibited, as led by you. 

If you are in confrontation (conflict, argument, or debate) with the person you are speaking to, you probably want them to stutter and stammer all over the place; you are right, and they are wrong (hopefully, if you know what you are talking about); you want the frame of the conversation to appear as such. Don't stare them down too terribly hard even still (you don't want to seem like you are ready to slug them unless you actually are),  just take out all breaks in eye contact on your part. They will be at a loss for words, because they will be trying too hard not to say the wrong thing; they know that their opponent is poised and ready to rebut. 

In pickup situations, maintain eye contact while you speak just as I described it in paragraphs 2-4 of this post, but when the woman speaks to you, instead of maintaining eye contact most of the time with short breaks as I previously described, you want to drop eye contact to almost a nil. To do this properly with a woman implies something different than what it implies with men: not weakness, but aloofness. Look at her eyes just long enough to give her the impression that you are somewhat listening to her, and that is it. You want to keep her questioning in her mind whether or not she is actually getting through to you at all. Then, when you reply, keep that same unwavering eye contact as you did before. To look into a woman's eyes incessantly while she speaks to you is to give the impression of desire on your part. Once she knows you want her, you have lost. This works the same for LTRs, but gauge yourself and your partner in your relationship to know when and how and how often to drop your defenses. This strategy of eye contact in pickup is basically a defense mechanism, use it as such.  That being said, don't appear nervous, just preoccupied. Don't just nervously stare at the floor, and don't look in any one place for more than 3-5 seconds. Look at your drink, her drink, a television, your phone, the coasters on the table, the posters on the wall, the napkin canister, her forehead (sparingly), her nails, other people in the area (especially girls) anything remotely worth looking at. Switch it up; make her struggle to keep your attention, and reward her efforts occasionally with 2-3 seconds of eye contact to show you are still there. While not looking at her, do what men do best during a female monologue: ""Mmm-hmm...Mmm-hmm..."" 

If you ever have to pause in search of words (not a deliberate pause for emphasis, which could benefit from  keeping eye contact, but a pause out of necessity), break eye contact immediately, as looking into someone's eyes without having something to say constitutes staring right off the bat (staring is creepy). Don't take it too far by looking away like a nervous schoolboy; you don't want to break frame. You want to remain facing them and divert your eyes (to the side,usually). You can also divert your eyes to the forehead to send a subconscious message of superiority. Avoid the mouth and chin altogether; it is a subconscious faux-pas (what's wrong, is there something in my teeth?). 

Of course these are all rough guidelines, not hard, fast rules. You will have to figure out what nuances in nonverbal communication suit you best, and then as in anything a true man does, you have to fully own that shit. Consciously, deliberately tailor yourself a set of nonverbal practices, starting with eye contact as a foundation and moving through other gestures such as posture, body position, and last (and also least) hand gestures.

The best way to get started with this is to find a frame of reference in an alpha male role model you look up to and blatantly steal qualities you like from them (you still have to make these gestures your own, completely natural, never contrived or rehearsed). I have included links to a couple of my own body language benefactors. 

[Bill Clinton.] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7ffbFvKlWqE&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7ffbFvKlWqE)  Here is a great example of what you should and should not do in body language. Regardless of what you subscribe to politically (I don't personally agree with everything that Clinton stood for) we all know that Clinton won the hell out of this debate. Everything about his body language, especially eye contact, exudes coolness, confidence, and earnestness, without coming across as overbearing or too intense. Bush, on the other hand, in this video provides us with an example of all the things in a man's body language that can be interpreted as a sign of weakness. He barely makes eye contact with the guest during the first half of his answer, he keeps his body turned to the side most of the time that he speaks, and when he finally does make eye contact, it is a harsh, I-want-to-kill-you-you-bitch death gaze.

I've always been the kind of person who doesnt take societal constructs or assumptions for granted and its great to find a community of like minded people.

I'm wondering if any of you know of any blogs or have any advice for using TRP teachings to find LTR with quality women. I had sex with a lot of women in college and I find myself looking for something a little more substantive at the ripe old age of 26. I know their are blogs out their dedicated to maintaining TRP in LTR but I'm wondering if anyone has talked at length about finding an LTR with TRP.

Also I'm trying to find an intelligent women which IMO complicated things a bit. I feel like smart women are far more likely to see through some of the tenets of TRP.

Anyway any advice or stories would be appreciated, thanks.

1374662570.0,25,self.TheRedPill,1iy5p1,Beware of the Blue Pill Tip's for being a Man,58,33,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1iy5p1/beware_of_the_blue_pill_tips_for_being_a_man/,"I have noticed that the beta's, blue pillers and women, have a very lovely way of trying to tell us red pill blokes how to act, be, respond, live, shit, breathe.

However sometimes it does make you think what they say, but I've decided to maybe analyse what some of the stuff they tell me actually means;

1. ""You are so immature, be more mature""; Really? Are you shitting me? So I like to take the piss out of stuff, and see the funny thing and you call me immature? Have you noticed when other men act like you but people don't mind as much? Just as immature but they call him ""funny,"" etc. Thats because I believe the people closest to you envy your carefree outlook, and the fact we aren't pessimistic. Did you know there is also no historical account or thesis that men throughout history were ""mature?"" That probably means even Henry VIII used to say ""yo, pull my finger biatch, or off with your head.""

2. ""Do things for others, don't be selfish""; Don't be selfish? How many good deeds and favours and gifts do you do for families and friends. But just because you didn't pick them up one time, or whatever they start calling YOU selfish. All because they didn't get their own way? Or they had to do it or not you. It is a needy, pathetic manipulative way to try and make you feel guilty. Don't. Im not saying dont give to charity. But I am saying do not become the charity.

3. ""You are being rude""; Unless youre effing and blinding, and directly insulting someone by telling them to fuck off or calling them a cunt, you are not being rude. I remember countless times ive gamed waitresses with my family or friends, and what have they always said ""you are being rude, she thinks you are rude."" Is that why shes laughing? Is that why shes smiling? Is that why she's always coming over. They only think you are being rude because they havent got even one of the balls YOU have to do what you are doing.

4. ""Just go up to her and tell her you think shes beautiful""; No comment, as Im sure you know what that means.

5. ""You got to make more of an effort with e.g. family, these people, etc,""; Let me tell you something, if you aren't making an effort with family etc, theres one reason. You dont like them. You don't share the same interests. They don't stimulate you. Don't misinterpret that. Last time I watched a film with my family, was the Dark Knight Rises. My mum critiqued it, my dad almost fell asleep. I remembered why it had been 3 years since I last sat with those morons to watch anything. Don't feel guilty.

6. ""You are getting bigger, but its not thin,""; Thats muscles you stupid cunt. Thats because you don't have any.

7. ""You should be more cultured and watch films starring Channing tatum and co""; again, blue pill bollocks.

8. ""You like to be single? When you going to settle down?""; Yawn.

9. ""No wonder you don't keep women around long, you are an ass!""; Sure.

10. Personal favourite ""I think maybe we should meet up, and talk, are you happy? Is everything ok in your life""; Don't you just love it when people assume confidence, cockiness, a tad arrogance and what they interpret to be ""rudeness"" to be depression? Ridiculous. Listen out for these gems, because honestly, they are all trying to do one thing. Break your frame.

I'm in the middle of the Fountain of Youth article, and a vivid childhood memory has just flared up.  I'd like to share it.  I guess you could say this is a decades-old field report.

I was 7, and lived in a small neighborhood in middle America with my father, mother, and 5-year-old brother.  Across the street and one house to the right, there lived a family with two girls, also 7 and 5.  They were the only children our age in the neighborhood, so we ended up playing with them quite a bit.  And they had a Nintendo.

I should explain that my mother was very anti-videogame and -television for most of my childhood.  Two hours of Saturday morning cartoons and the occasional family movie night were allowed, but otherwise my options for entertainment were reading and playing outdoors.  BUT.  I was allowed to play videogames at a friend's house.  Cue 7-year-old me visiting the girls across the street A LOT.

Well, eventually the girls (their names were Brooke and Brittany, I seem to recall) seemed to realize I didn't really care to play with their tea set or dolls, and was far more interested in Duck Hunt and Super Mario.  And so one day they exercised their rights as Strong Independent Women In Training to try to lay some domestic ground rules.  This is the scene that played out:

**Brooke**: ""We're not going to let you play Nintendo.  We're going to play house instead.""

**7yo _whistler**: ""Nah, I'd rather play Duck Hunt.  Gimme the controller.""

**Brittany**: ""No!  Play house with us!""

**7yo _whistler**: ""That sounds dumb.  Turn on the Nintendo.""

**Brooke**: ""All you ever do is play Nintendo, you never play with us!  We're tired of it.  We're unhaaaaapy!  Now play house or you can't play at all!""

**7yo _whistler**:  *shrugs* ""Okay.  Later.""

*30 seconds later as I'm walking home, what do I hear behind me but the slapping of footsteps...*

**Brooke**: ""Okay!  Come back!  Okay!  You can play Nintendo!  Come baaaack!""

Many ducks were hunted that day.  And the dog got shot a few times.

**********

Fast forward a year or two.  Puberty.  I totally spazzed out over how cute Brooke was, started leaving secret love notes in her desk at school, and made a complete idiot of myself.  Meanwhile, she was cuddling up to that jerk Scotty who kept stealing her chocolate milk.

The evening started... interestingly.  Meet Gerard Butler in one of my regular bars, he sat for about an hour 3 foot away me at the bar.  It was interesting to watch his body language and mannerisms when people approached him, and when he was left alone.

My friend is a rocker/heavy metal, massive long beard, shaved head and appropriate clothing for what he is into.  There is absolutely no chance of him wanting to hit some of my usual mid-week up town cocktail bars.  Instead, we head to a rock/dive bar he likes after leave the bar we bumped into Butler in.

We grab a drink, find an empty booth that has a good view of the whole bar and chill.

Not long after we arrive, a group of girls come in, my friend nudges me and nods at one of them, lovely red head, great tits and ass.

""Nice, go say hello""

""No man, fuck that, I don't know what to say""

""Don't be a pussy.  Look man, look at her shoes, she has a zip up the back of them.  Go up to and ask her about them, pretend you want to try them on""  She has ankle high boots on, with about a 2 inch heel.

""Haha, no""

""Ok, if you don't I will""

""Go for it""

""Cool, if all goes well, we'll have some company""

I get up, and approach her, putting my left hand on my right forearm

""Hi, excuse me, how are you?""

""Hi, I'm good"" Irish accent, lovely green eyes

""Your shoes, the zip, and they real?""

""Haha, what?""

""You have a zip up the back of them.  I know a few girls that have zips on their shoes, and most times they aren't real""

""Oh, these are""

""Really?""

""Yea"" She leans against the bar, and raise her left leg.  I take her ankle in my hand and unzip it with my other

As i zip it down ""I am totally gonna steal these now"" and pretend to take it off

She laughs ""Haha, do you have shoe fetish?""

""Totally""

""Good luck getting the other one off, the zip is broken""

""Really?  Let me see""

She swaps legs, and it turns out the zip is broken

""Ha, you shouldn't get cheap shoes out of Primark!""

""Haha, fuck you, these are good shoes""

""Yea, totally, that's why the zip is working like a dream""

I'm still holding her ankle, so I let go of it, she stops leaning against the bar, I take her hand and turn her to face me, and she takes a step closer.

""This doesn't strike me as a place you go to very often""

""It's not, we're at an Irish bar round the corner""

""Ahhh""

She looks me up and down ""I can say the same about you, your not really dressed to fit in here""

""Ha, true, I am with my friend"" I motion to my friend sitting in the booth

""The guy with massive beard?""

""Yea, you wouldn't believe how many people come up to him and ask to stroke it""

""Haha""

""I get jealous of the attention""

""Ha, I'm sure you get plenty of attention""

""Oh, aren't you the little charmer""

""Haha""

""I better get back to my friend, but come join us.""

""I can't, my friends have just left, I need to go back to the other bar""

""You know hanging out with me will be more fun""

""Haha, maybe.  Come with me""

""Nah, my friend got to pick where we went, and it's here""

""Ok, well, if you change your mind, come find me""

""Maybe""

""Haha, it was nice meeting you""

We go for the hug and I kiss her.  After a few minutes she breaks away

""Well, aren't you fun to kiss""

""I have a boyfriend""

""That's cool, I don't really want to find out if he is fun to kiss""

""Haha, your confident""

""So I've been told""

""What's your name?""

""Fred""

""Liar""

""Oh yea?  That's a cruel thing to say to someone you just meet, why don't you believe me?""

""That smirk""

""Haha""

""I've got to go, but come find me""

""Maybe""

As she turns to leave, and smack her ass, she laughs, turns and sticks her toungue out at me

I stick my tongue out and say ""Get lost, trouble!""

I return to my friend, he is laughing and shaking his head ""You are a fucking dog!""  We chat for a little while and then head heads to the bar.

There is a two set to my right, closed one is an 8, brunette, tattoos up her arms, her pal is a 6 and fat, on the table there is a box of nicotine tea bags.  This tells me a few things, they are tourists, probably Swedish, the tub looked clean and new, so had probably arrived fairly recently.

""Hi, is that a box of those nicotine tea bags?"" I reach across the table and pick up the box

""Yes""  Swedish accent

""You don't get these here, from Sweden?""  I open the box and it's pretty much full

""Yes, we are""

""Arrive today?""

""This morning""

""These things are so weird, I really don't like them.  I find it weird talking with them in my mouth mumble mumble mumble""

""Haha, you get used to them""

""Hmmm, maybe, must be weird to kiss someone with them.  Done the tourist thing today then?""

""Yes, we went to the castle""

""Oh yea, find that... interesting""

""Yes""

""Liar, it's boring""

""Haha, ok, it was boring but my friend wanted to"" Leaning back so I can see her friend

""So, you're the boring one?""

Her pal: ""Haha, hi""

Her ""Haha, you're cheeky""

At this point my friend returns, I introduce them to him, and we join their booth.  We chat for about 30 mins, during which she drops the BF bomb:

""My boyfriend plays in a band""

""Oh yea, what does he play?""

""The guitar""

""Can you play the guitar?""

""No""

""Me either, but I have tried.  But my flat mates made me stop because it sounded like I was killing a cat""

""Haha""

""I have a few friends that are in bands, they have told me that I'm tone deaf and have no rhythm!""

""What terrible friends!""

""I know, I think I might trade them in for some new ones""

They two girls decide they want to go out for a smoke, so I somehow end up getting stuck looking after the jackets...  On my right, again, there is a 6 set, 2 girls and 4 guys, I notice one of the girls looking at me, so I turn my head and stick my tongue out at her.  She laughs and does the same, so I make a face and she copies it.  During this, I can see one of her male friends watching us, he nudges the guy sitting at me, they whisper to each other, and them the get up and make them move.

When my mate and the two girls return, I decide to try and move things along as it was getting late

""Are you planning on doing any hiking when you are here?""

""No, I don't really have time""

""Oh yeah, your heading to Ireland tomorrow.  Do you like hiking?""

""I do""

""Say, that reminds me of something, have you ever heard of Derren Brown?""

She hadn't, so I give her a quick rundown of who he is and what he does.

""I know a silly cold reading game, I can read your darkest, dirtiest secrets, want to play?""  Taking her hands

""Ok""

I run Chateau Heartiste's Love Test.  During each phase, I supplement each main question with a number of other questions, to help get a better cold read on her.  I do this every time I have used it, and girls never notice.  They only seem to pay attention and remember the primary question.  It helps to build out the story more, really paint each part of them, with details and try and transport them there (Sunny, you're wearing a silly floppy hat, etc.).  If they have a boyfriend, you have to 

I give her the reading, and her eyes widen and her mouth drops open

""Wow, that's amazing, that's so me""

She places her hand on my thigh, starts rubbing, and makes fairly constant eye contact.  I expand on the initial reading, using what I learnt from the other questions to tailor it better.  I start adding things about the universe being vast, how we are only here once and it's such a sort time

I suggest we go out for a smoke, without waiting for an answer I get up, take her hand and lead her out.  As soon as we are outside, and away from the main entrance I push her against a wall and k-close her, she instantly starts grinding into my body.  When we stop kissing:

""Are you staying xxx hostel?"" This hostel being the closed

""Yes""

""Let's go""

""Ok""

We go back in, and get her pal and mine.  On the way to the hostel, I quickly talk to my mate.  He has gotten nowhere with the 6, he **asked** to kiss her, and she of course no, she had a boyfriend.

We arrive at their hostel, which has a bar and pool tables.  My pal takes her friend to the bar for a drink and some pool, we head up to their room.

This is normal, especially since I'm meeting and exceeding my fitness goals.

**The begining**

I got a text last night from a girl I used to know. She has a bf so hasn't really talked to me in a long time. She asks how I am and what I'm up to. 

*I take this as an IOI. She's clearly thinking of me. Something is probably wrong in paradise with the bf*

*The hook* 

I tell her I miss seeing her and it would really turn me on to see a sexy pic of her.

*Some casual text escalation*

**The real issue**

Her: You'd have to work for it

Me: What does that even mean? ;P

Me: If you're not gonna have fun doing it, I'm not gonna have any fun either

Her: I guess I just like teasing because its nice to feel like at least somebody finds me attractive

*boom. Cats outta the bag. BF doesn't make her feeeel attractive. She's unhaaaaaapy. hahaha oh man... this is gonna be cake*

**Sowing the seeds of discord**

I ask her where her boyfriend is. She says 'you tell me! He's not here right now and when he is, he usually criticizes me. I am so grateful for my luck. This woman is all emotional. Women go crazy when they're emotional. Time to make her doubt this bf and look at me for some sexual release.

Me: Is he with another woman? Maybe you just need to releive your frustrations on someone

*haha I know, I know*

Her: Maybe I just need some male attention

Me: You should come over and see me this weekend. You can take some of those frustrations out on me. Send me a pic before bed. Night

**conclusion**

She sends me a nude pic almost immediately. Gonna get some extra sexy time this weekend. Score. Almost too easy.

Hypergamy, and a bf who isn't paying 100% attention to her and making her feel like a special snowflake = free pussy

here's some icing on the cake. She saw me in the mall this weekend (see first paragraph). Says I looked 'bigger', 'more muscular', She's right. I'm considerably larger than the last time she saw me. Why aren't you guys in the gym yet? It makes this seduction business practically do itself..

Firstly I'm so glad that a place like this exists, where we can gather talk about the injustices and not have to apologize for our own existence - as seems to be more mainstream thing to do these days. 

Now I grew up always questioning gender norms since i was in elementary school - starting off with ""never hit a girl"" being shoved down our throats. 
I was pleasantly surprised in 2011, when after browsing Youtube for hours, i'd come across videos from the likes bararossaaaa, GWW, Stardusk and manwomenmyth to see people pointing out things I've always felt about society but could never articule. 

Now to my questions, both related to working at the office.

1) What is the diplomatic/alpha way to respond when you get cut off mid sentence. this isn't happening in a meeting with big-wigs, but rather during lunch time with equals. We have one very entitled girl, who will dominate the group convo (granted it's a group convo where everyone is kind of having their own seperate convos (nothing being spoken is work related).  I was midsentance with the colleague nearest to me, she just jumps in quickly asks a question to the person i was talking to, and he gets involved with her existing conversation. It's just frustrating because I have no idea to react. It's happens very quickly, It's annoying as hell, but you can't respond agressivly, because the whole vibe at lunch is laid back and people would just be like ""it's no big deal calm down"". And then she acknowledged it and gave me an over the shoulder ""sorry"" before contining with her conversation.  i think a lot of it is due to tonality, posture and perception - all things i'm working on. But surely there is a way to fucking assert myself without being shamed out of the office or told it's not a big deal


2) Again office related. Myself and 3 women i work with were leaving office and walking to a car, one of the women, met us in the parking lot, and she was carrying a big box (personal things), somewhat struggling but seemed like she could manage. And obviously one of the other two started with ""are you going to let her carry that!?"" and you see i'm a red pill inductee but how the hell can i deal with people, shaming you into being whatever they define a man is on that particular day. And I work with them, i can't go on a rant and jeopardize the working relationship/friendship especially in a company where literally every other male is a blue pill white knights. And it's just ridiculous, because you know, i know and they certainly know that had it been just the three of them they would've managed just fine. It's just pure laziness.

I want to know what’s your take on calling out a girl’s BS and lies and whether it’s worth the time.

I know from a Game point of view, calling out bullshit excuses and lies is pointless because a women will just hamsterize it and will probably just get angry and mentally twist it like it’s YOUR fault.  Like for example, if a girl flakes and comes up with some blatant BS excuse, it’s probably better to not make a big deal of it and just make out that it’s her loss instead.  Although I know also that some small calling out of BS is necessary if you’re already banging her.

However on the other side, if you’re a man of principle who doesn’t tolerate lies and doesn’t give a fuck if he bangs this chick or not you’ll stand by your honor.  I know women generally have a low regard for honesty, but should we tolerate that behavior?  If we continually ignore this bad behavior just because we want to get laid more often, won’t that make things worse?  Wouldn’t it be better to build a culture that lets women know that kind of behavior and attitude is unacceptable?

Her: Would it be a problem for you if I still was a virgin?

Me : No. Quite the contrary.

Her: Hm.

Her: I wouldn't want you to be a virgin.

Me : Hahaha. Why not?

Her: I don't know. I just wouldn't want it.

Whenever a discussion occurs about why men prefer female virgins, the discussion rapidly turns to the double standard between female and male virginity.

The men=women line of reasoning goes like this: If men want want to sleep around  as much as they like without being judged for it, women should also be allowed to do the same. In other words, if men want a virgin, they should also be virgins themselves.

Well, the problem here is:

- Girls think guys who are still virgins are not desired by anyone.

- Guys think girls who are still virgins are pure and desirable.


The female judgement of men's virginity is a judgement by preselection, which is totally different than the male judgement of female's virginity.

Keep this in mind when discussing the ""double standard"" of virginity.

I'm trying to make a decision and would like to know what you think about the following situation TRP.

Around a year ago, my ex-girlfriend of 5 years broke up our relationship. She started dating another guy and in the blink of an eye, moved to another city with him. I have to admit that I was a complete beta. I was devastated and wanted her back. I humiliate myself for her.

Shortly after I discovered TRP and have been working on improving my former self. I've been lifting, meeting new people, dating women, practicing my inner and outer game. I am aware that I still have a lot to improve but I know that every day I am a better person.

Fast forward to the present, a couple of days ago I received a text from her offering that we take a coffee. Of course, this started playing with my head and I have not quite sure what to do about it. So what should I do? What would you, my fellow RedPillers?


EDIT1: WOW, great answers, and I have another question: Do you think is there anything I can win with this situation? I feel that it was a desperate text the one she send.

1369316079.0,26,self.TheRedPill,1ewh97,"After 3 months of debilitating and crippling ""Oneitis""",51,25,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ewh97/after_3_months_of_debilitating_and_crippling/,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text, but this is far too important for me not to write.  

I am proud and quite excited to report that I ""swallowed the pill"" and my god, I have been cured.  

As a 23 year old college senior on the verge of graduation, I have to thank the brilliant minds of this sub for articulating the intangible nuances of the Alpha paradigm, and bringing them to the fore of the conversation about the reflexive and reciprocal forces that guide interpersonal relationships between men and women.  

I had a modicum of familiarity with TRP philosophy, though it had never been thoroughly elucidated for me as it has been on this sub.  Many facets of TRP paradigm I had once tried to internalize (being confident, reading more, thinking in terms of accomplishing goals) which led to the meeting of the first girl I would truly ""love"".  Unfortunately, over the next 2 1/2 years I would slowly -- but surely -- acquiesce to the Blue Pill mentality and eventually become a walking proponent of feminism.  

Despite a visceral disconnect with my own masculinity, I was convinced (via choking down the Blue Pill) that I had secured success and happiness in a relationship.  We moved in together after 8 months of dating, established decent communication pathways, and still fucked like jack rabbits.  I was working through school and working -- she a stable job too -- and we had created a ""successful"" and ""loving"" relationship.  However, I couldn't reconcile the feelings of want with the Blue Pill oasis I had created.  I reached a a breaking point and abruptly ended things with my first ""love""/co-ed roommate/emotional confidant/ ""best friend"".  I immediately felt a sense of empowerment and freedom, however they were ephemeral and fleeting.  My empowerment was overwhelmed with a resounding regret and my celebrated, brassy freedom melted into an anvil that anchored me to the bottom of a pit of despair; I sewed a seed of Oneitis for this girl who -- although a good person -- was incapable fulfilling my needs, and that seed sprouted a weed that choked off my budding masculinity which was trying to grow and liberate me from the shackles of Beta.

I hate to admit it, TRP, but I was pathetic. I had thoroughly deteriorated into a begging-beta-bitch.  Pleading for her to come back to me.  Desperately searching for a way to remedy an unfixable situation, and all the while she had begun exploiting her SMV and had immediately began sleeping with our crossfit coach.  Like a true beta, I told her i was okay with it -- she needed to see other people and have a broader horizon of experience (read: hop on the cock carousel).  I had allowed myself to be victimized by hypergamy, and I was desperately trying to lay the blame on anything and everything except for myself.  I tried ""reaching out"" to my former coach who was 10 years my senior to ""work out a solution"", and eventually accepted the role as an orbiter who was waiting in the margins to shower my ex in affection whenever she had a moment away from slurping her own pussy juice off his cock.   

For the next 3 months, I would wallow in Blue Pill Bullshit and do everything from having flowers delivered to her at work on her birthday, to asking her for tutoring help with my homework.  Any paltry crumb of attention I could steal from her was like gold to me.  

And then I was fucked up with a TRP knowledge bomb.  After a co-worker told me to look up *PIMP* by Iceberg Slim on the internet, I stumbled across a reddit link.  After reading throug 5 minutes of material on TRP, an idea got through to me.  This instigated some serious introspection that involved confronting the Beta Bitch I had become, and asking myself if the Beta, Blue-Pill-Swallowing, Orbiter role I had assumed could ever get me to where I wanted to be as a man.  The answer was painfully simple: the only way I was ever going to get back to glazing faces on a daily basis was going to be through (metaphorically) murdering the bitch-made feminist pussy I had become.  It is with great pleasure that I report that a new thrivingivory has emerged from that dark Oneitis underbelly.   

Change -- starting with my thoughts -- was a necessarily fundamental force for initiating the transformation to Alpha; I realized that the only sonnuvabitch who could actually help me was myself.  So, I found a new crossfit gym; I started doing 2-a-days with running and swimming in the mornings and crossfit in the afternoons; I signed up for a triathlon; I bought tickets on a whim to a massive music festival in an attempt to enter enter a new and unfamiliar social atmostphere; I **told** my manager (in a dialogue in which I confidently articulated my reasoning why) I deserved a promotion at work, and I was promoted; I moved out of my apartment with my ex, and found a prime studio apartment in a socially robust neighborhood; I quit watching Netflix &amp; pornhub and started reading; I deleted my facebook; and most importantly, I **CHOSE** to quit defining myself by the unreciprocated feelings of an ex girlfriend, and started to assert myself as the reincarnation of Adonis.  

It's been 2 weeks since the entirety of these changes and modifications to my livelihood have been actualized.  My confidence is so high and my self-assuredness so sound, that I turn heads every time I walk into a room.  I don't feel threatened or challenged by other Alphas, instead I want to learn from them to increase my own SMV.  Conversation with strangers is routine and I frequently catch people off guard by initiating dialogue and then just listening to whatever they have to say.  I am stronger and fitter than ever (including when I had professional coaching as a D1 athlete), and I haven't found a girl -- or guy for that matter -- who doesn't stare in awe at a sculpted physique with 8 pack abs.  TRP has effected a plethora of positive changes in my life, and I am a man going my own damn way. 

tl;dr: I was a hardcore Beta-bitch after a breakup and I underwent a paradigm shift sparked by ""swallowing the pill"" that has sent me down the path of an Alpha, and has yielded tremendous fruits of success.

Now, she isn't your typical woman that has been displayed here, looking for an alpha and what not, but something deeper is happening, at least IMO.  For the last 4 to 4.5 years, she's been wildly in love with me, through all the fights, and distance (we both live at home because we come from indian families, i'm 25, she's 24), but now, she has just started a full time job while I am still in grad school (which is 15 min away from home so thats y I live at home).  To be honest, I've had beta issues up til now but I am trying to be more red pill.  I've identified myself as an introvert but there are times when I'm pretty extroverted so I attribute my introvertness to my beta-ness.  This past year in grad school was rough, alot of work, and alot less time working on myself and even my relationship.  my fitness took a toll and for the past 7 months, so has my relationship.  

My gf told me in december that she wants to explore.  we talked about it and she wanted me to ""stick around"" while she explores and comes backs to me at a later date.  I said fuck that and I gave her the ultimatum of coming to a decision in a week or 2 but she stayed. However, a few weeks ago, she tells me that the past 7 months, every now and then, the thought of exploring and seeing what is out there is on her mind and now its really making her go crazy.  she tells me she loves me but her feelings on exploring is stronger than ever. 

now she has had 2 boyfriends before but they were never as serious as we have been, but this has been her only serious relationship and has lasted for 5 years.  in my mind, through logic, I think that she fears spending the rest of her life with just one person and wants to see what is out there.  she tells me that i've been great and really supportive and hates that she is doing this to me, but, essentially, i think the hamster is going off and she is rationalizing that going out to explore, will satiate her fears.  

she is one of the most genuine girls you would ever meet, and literally she has never lied to me at all, she's very honest and upfront and so am i to her.  I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it. so to me, I feel as if its something on my end.  I have thought about it and feel that I haven't been as red pill as i should be in this.  I feel that subconsciously, she isn't responding to me like she used to and that speaks alot on me.  grad school took alot out of me but i'm in the homestretch and i have more free time.   

The red pill side of me says that i should just tell her to go explore and really show her that I won't take any more of this disrespect she is showing me.  While the other part of me, the beta part which i want to remove, is fearing she'll find someone else, and that I won't have the abilities to move on from this and that I won't find someone to replace her.  To be honest, TRP is the best thing I've ever found but changing your old ways and habits is one hell of a tough thing to do, especially when those fears kick in at inconvenient times.

I've been beta for a large part of my life, was never any good with women and I still think to myself how I got this girl in the first place.  To me, I think she's proof that not all girls out there are looking to hop on alpha dicks, but I need to be more alpha to keep her, because we've both talked about having kids, traveling the world, etc and we both want those things, yet for the past 7 months, those feelings have faded from her.  We even discussed looking at wedding rings (I know, its a sham and all but love is love) But it is my job to make it so those innate feelings and desires re-emerge and I want to be able to do that and maintain them as well, by being more alpha.

Looking at this with this kind of girl in mind, not your typical purposefully hamstering type, how would you, more experienced red pillers, establish more alpha dominance in this situation?

I realize that alot of you will tell me to ditch her (and I am prepared to do it), and I have been taking precautionary steps in working out, dieting, planning on reading books, and going out with friends so i can find out who I am as well.

I hope that you guys will give me some good advice on this because I want to grow and be better out of this situation as well, no matter which direction it goes in.  thank you guys

You may suspect something is wrong in society, and you may very well know what it is. You may just be curious. You may even have all the knowledge you could possibly need. One thing for certain is that you're here. You are on TheRedPill. 

The first thing I noticed when I got here was how full of advice this subreddit is. Stuffed full of game and advice on Why women act the way they do and Why game counteracts it. This is the difference between the RedPill and Seddit. We deal with the root problem. And trust me, there is a problem. 

The second thing I noticed was the seeming anger and resentment that could present itself here. It would appear like a bunch of women hating misogynists got together, made a sub, and started bashing women. Concerned, I made a post asking to drop the Us Vs Them mentality. In the comments that followed, I learned a Lot.

1. This Is Not Seddit:

	Like I said, TheRedPill deals with understanding how and why women do what they do. As pk_atheist put it, “We're not paranoid, in fact we're not even upset. We're becoming strangely good at a sexual strategy, and we're using evolutionary theory to lead the way. We're very similar to Seddit on that front, except we take a different approach. We want to understand why women act and think the way they do.”

2. This Is Not Sugar Coated:

	One thing you have to realize is that what you consider correct is in fact dictated a lot by what Feminists consider correct. We are not equal to women. The Red Pill is about realizing that men and women are Different. 

    To quote zionController a la Morpheous, ""The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."" 

3. This Is TheRedPill:

	Take a moment and ponder this. “Why do we need game?”.

	We need game because the system is backwards. Women reward Alpha Males (read: Jerks) with sex. Women reward Beta Males (read: “nice guys”) with nothing. Then, when women have passed their sexual peak, they look to get a Nice Guy wrapped around their ring finger to support them and their kids. This is wrong.

If this at all worries you, you are in the right place. You are with friends who see the same problem and want to do something about it. Welcome to the Red Pill.",,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,,,True,t3_164ujo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/164ujo/are_you_offended/,

**Blog**: KrauserPUA, http://krauserpua.com

**Example Post**: Actually, the best intro would be this [video interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpYWQRpxzQs) which gets posted regularly and for good reason. Krauser goes into some really interesting big picture stuff in it that I'd never heard before. 

Also, I happened across this [lay report post](http://krauserpua.com/2013/07/09/i-deflower-my-first-22-year-old-lithuanian-ballerina/) at the perfect time and got to see the short hidden-cam video he posted of him fucking this girl. Woah. Never seen anyone do that before. Apparently, he removes the videos after a day or so.

**Blog**: Laid in NYC, https://laidnyc.wordpress.com

**Example Post**: This is a recent discovery for me whose posts have been showing up here at TRP. But then I realized I had been sent to [The Parable of Mark and Lauren](https://laidnyc.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/the-parable-of-mark-and-lauren/) a while ago. Good stuff. Good insights. Good writer. 

---

**Blog**: The Last Psychiatrist, http://thelastpsychiatrist.com

**Example Post**: This is how I found TRP, actually. Somewhere in a normal part of the internet I clicked a link to a Cracked article called [6 Harsh Truths That Will Make You a Better Person](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/), which was surprisingly profound and exactly the message I needed to hear at the time.

That post referenced a post on [The Last Psychiatrist](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com) called [Hipsters on Food Stamps](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/11/hipsters_on_food_stamps.html), a very interesting and entertaining article. 

That article and the TLP blog have a theme that says (to me): Man up, and Take Action. No one cares who you are, they care what you do. You will never be happy if you do nothing but sit around and try to figure out how to be happy. So go do something. Do the shit you want to do before you die because what else are you going to do with your life.

**Blog**: Mark Manson, formerly PostMasculine, http://markmanson.net/

**Example Post**: Mark is kind of like DietRedPill. He is a writer who is close enough to mainstream psychology and self-help that he won't scare away the easily frightened.

He's got some good general life improvement stuff like [Guides to Overcoming Fear](http://markmanson.net/overcome-fear) but also his book [Models](http://markmanson.net/books) has some great insight into women and dating, and a somewhat unique approach with a focus on authenticity.

**Blog**: A Dark Heart, http://www.adarkheart.com

**Example Post**: I really appreciated his [Step-by-Step Dating Guide](http://www.adarkheart.com/step-by-step-dating-guide/) and specifically [The Bar Date](http://www.adarkheart.com/2013/01/19/the-bar-date-step-by-step/) because of the practical, concrete advice. A refreshing change from the usual abstract theory.

---

**Blog**: Bold and Determined, http://boldanddetermined.com

**Example Post**: His best articles are like your gym bros yelling to motivate you while spotting you on that last rep of bench press. Lots of action-oriented articles on [lifting weights](http://boldanddetermined.com/2010/11/20/why-every-man-should-lift-weights/) and [making money](http://boldanddetermined.com/2012/03/15/escape-the-9-5-jive/) and [lifestyle](http://boldanddetermined.com/2012/04/28/how-to-be-a-free-man/).

---

**Blog**: Delicious Tacos, http://delicioustacos.com

**Example Post**: His best shit is fun, and real, and brutally honest, and very not boring. When he sits down to write, it's like he's questioning the post that wants to be written, as if to say: prove yourself to me that you're not some stupid bullshit that no one wants to read, and that everybody's already heard a million times.

Some good examples are his [Relax, You Are Doomed](http://delicioustacos.com/2013/07/21/relax-you-are-doomed/#more-3609) and [Sex Machine](http://delicioustacos.com/2013/08/04/sex-machine/) and [50 Shades of Grey Book Review](http://delicioustacos.com/2012/03/23/book-review-fifty-shades-of-grey-by-e-l-james/).

He's a writer who's in touch with the depressing, the absurd, and the meaningless. And I like that. To me, optimism is annoying and usually stems from denial. 

I'm not saying you should wallow in it, but when you realize life is meaningless, and you will never be happy no matter how much good shit happens, well, that realization is freeing... if/when you can climb out of the pit of despair it puts you in.

That's all folks.

I've done a lot of reading over the past couple years, and the best thing I've learned, is to stop reading, and start taking action. 

Embrace the inevitable boredom and frustration that comes from too much theory and not enough practice. Your yin needs some yang.

Quit porn. Limit masturbation. Limit internet. 

Too much sitting on your ass and not enough smacking dat ass. Too much fingering keys and not enough fingering clits. Too much holding devices and not enough holding titties. You get the idea...

Put a hard limit on your time spent in virtual worlds, and you'll force yourself to look for satisfaction in the real world. It will seem boring at first, compared to movies, TV, internet, video games and porn. But that's good. That will motivate you to make the real world fun again. Which takes effort, yes, but it's more rewarding, because you've just tricked yourself into being human and living life.

As the title suggests, I wrote this is for introverts.

* Find your target

* Initiate conversation

Direct approach vs indirect approach? Doesn't matter. Do whatever makes you comfortable. Stupid conversation starters are fine too. ""Hey whats the time?"" ""What are you reading there? ""Whats your name?"" Rhetoric statements are fine too. ""You smell good!"" ""I like your dress"". Doesn't really matter TBH. Just talk!! Most introverts including me dont like to talk to girls because 99% of the times they talk asinine bullshit. I like to have stimulating conversations but the truth is interesting people are few and far between. But hey, you wanna get a date right? I judge girls energy,personality, intellect and then determine if they are compatible with me.

* Isolate her

If shes with friend/s isolate her. If shes alone great!! If not, isolate her and isolate her fast. Women hate being judged. So even if she likes you, she may not show it or she may totally shut you down because she doesn't want to appear easy. Only if I had a dollar for every time a girl shut me down because of her friend!! For some girls it doesn't matter. But its better to be safe than sorry.

* Get her number

Get her number after the chit-chat. No need to ask permission, just get the digits. Send her a quick text message once you get it ""Great meeting you!"" ""You are a really nice person"" ""I am glad I met you today"". Anything is fine. Just be polite and be easy going. Again no hard and fast rules here.

* Set a date 

Set a date preferably near the weekend. Ask her what her plans are for the week. If shes open, it means she wants to get asked out. If a girl wants to go on a date with you, she will make it very easy.

* The date

Congrats you got the date. Don't go out for dinner etc. A girls inner whore will kick in. Avoid any veneue where you'll have to spend money on her. Keep it playful and cost effective as possible. Date is a perfect way to get a kiss close. The easiest way to eat her mouth is to do kino first. You will literally feel the electric tension when you touch her. Get close to her, look into her eyes and kiss her.

* In conclusion

Keep it simple. Introverts think a lot so don't over-think anything and go with the fucking flow. If you find your wife using this method, name your first kid Alpha Roar in honor of me. If you bone her, send me a nude pic as gratitude. Have fun motherfuckers.

Guess what? She and her husband were trying to get pregnant three months ago! And they were successful.

I'm not sure if it was biological or what but it's pretty amazing to see how a woman changes when she is receptive to becoming pregnant. And it probably also explains the apparent mate guarding behaviour I saw from her husband the night I dropped her off.

I found out yesterday, while she had her hand on my leg... Still haven't (and won't) hit it, but I'm not gonna lie, I enjoy the attention. I don't reciprocate the attention much so I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. I think she enjoys doing stuff for me and gets her emotional/hypergamy needs fulfilled. I'm beginning to feel like this is the only kind of friendship men and women can have: one where there is obvious sexual tension and flirting but various obligations, maturity and lack of alcohol keep people from acting on it.

First, for background, I'm what society considers to be a high-value male, so I get a lot of female attention: Sergeant of Marines, leader of men, muscular, well educated, very social and I get along with everyone and am able to converse about pretty much anything with anyone. I make eye contact and strike up conversations with everyone and am able to read social situations like a fucking book. It might sound like I'm bragging, but I wasn't always this way. I'm 27 and have spent the majority of my life working towards self-actualization. I'm pretty proud of my accomplishments but I'm also aware that there is much for me to improve upon.

I found the redpill about a month or two ago and it agrees with much of what I already knew and believed. The discussion here is good and many threads explore topics in detail that aren't explored anywhere else. Overall, this subreddit is a good source for knowledge and theory about how gender relations actually work. 

And yet there is a lot that doesn't fit in with my experiences in real life. In this thread lets discuss any issues/ideas that still need to be further developed. 

One thing that seems to be ignored is the fact that it is not just women who conduct shit tests, but rather it is everyone. My current theory is that people use shit tests (I hate that word, by the way, because of its negative conotations) in order to figure out where in the social hierarchy they fall compared to you. If you pass their tests, then you are ranked higher then them. If you fail, then you are ranked lower. Nobody wants to be friends with someone who is too much lower then them, because it brings down their own percieved value, and everyone wants to be friends with someone who is higher then themselves because it makes their own value higher by association. The crazy and wonderful part about this is that other people notice if you pass or fail. This is why social proof is so powerful: If someone (man or woman) sees you pass a beautiful woman's shit test, they subconsciously think: ""huh. that guy is ranked higher in the social hierchy than that beautiful woman, therefore I want to be associated with him so I can raise my own social standing.""

an example is when I was at my friends house the other day at a BBQ. I was playing catch with his 6 year old son in the backyard and every so often he would get super excited, spazz out, and throw the ball in a random direction. He was testing my boundaries, seeing what he could get away with. Or, in other terms, conducting a shit test on me. Every time this happened I was firm with him, saying ""no, you have to throw it back nice"" and making him go get the ball and throw it back right. Interestingly he loved the fact that I had boundaries and kept coming back to me throughout the evening asking if I wanted to play with him again. His mom, my friend's wife, definately noticed, and she has started throwing interest indicators my way. Subtle ones, for sure, but they are very easy for me to notice.

Which brings me to the next topic i want to discuss: How to deal with women who want you but you have no desire for. I literally want nothing to do with his wife. I've got a lot of respect for him and won't do anything to jeopardize his marriage. My current strategy for dealing with her is basically to just ignore the fuck out of her. I am polite and say hello, but will not engage her in 1 on 1 conversation or ever be alone with her. Basically I only talk to him. The trouble is that this just makes her desire me more because it is obvious that I'm ranked higher in the social structure than she is and she wants to associate to increase her own standing. I'm willing to admit that this is probably not the best way to deal with this situation, so if any of you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them.

There are a couple of other ideas that need further developing here on the redpill that I'm aware of but this post is getting long and I don't want to dilute the discussion by presenting too many of them at once. If there is good discussion here, then I'll post another thread later.

You get the whole 'all women are the same' and that's true to a large extent.  There's physiological and psychological similarities.  However submit that western feminist culture does have a tendency to ruin girls where relationships are concerned.

Most western girls want to have their cake and eat it too (i hate that metaphore but it applies)  They want to work, they want their husband/boyfriend to take care of them, they want kids, they want to sleep with any boy that strikes their fancy, ect.

Personally i'm dating an eastern girl, but generally i notice a trend that a person is much more respectful of their own place within a relationship if they're not from a culture that encourages them to think of themselves as a princess.

I had a wonderful talk with my gf last night about how we both have accepted that in life, we cannot have everything we want, but that it doesn't mean we can't be happy with what we have.  I find western females to have a tendency to not understand this rather basic tenant of relationships or life for that matter.

Just a field report stating that it is possible to find decent girls, perhaps not in the west, but there are other countries.

During my time working out I noticed a distinction between how different kinds of men and women dress at the gym and what it says about what their priorities are:

[The Plain Clothes Man:](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/265/337/433/433337265_047.jpg) Most men fall into this category. They wear loose fitting white t shirts and shorts. The colors they wear are White Blue Black or Grey. They wear cheap clothes that they don't care about and are not afraid of them getting sweaty. Thier goal is to go to the gym get a good workout and leave even if they aren't the most knowledgeable at what they are doing they still strain and push themselves.

[The Bodybuilder/Gym Bro:](http://www.riptclothing.com/skin/frontend/base/theme147/images/bodybuilding-vest.jpg) Unlike the affer mentioned this group intentionally expose their muscles in loose fitting tank tops or cut offs. The reason for this is once you get larger you heat up more easily. Your biceps and lats rub together if you wear a conventional t-shirt. You can get a better pump if you focus on your muscles in the mirror and squeeze at maximum contraction. Contrary to feminist belief, bodybuilders don't go to the gym to meet women if that was their main goal then they would not be able to achieve an impressive physique.  Aside from the pump Bodybuilders go to the gym to impress gym bros who aspire to be like them. Bodybuilders trade useful gym advice for the ego blow job that the gym bro provides. It is what it is and I personally fall into this category.

[The Homosexual who is looking:](http://bodysphere.de/images/C-IN2_SS13_3467_green-flash_F_zen_mens_clothing_shirt_tank_top_squaretank.jpg) Not all homosexuals fall into this category many fall into the previous two. However it should be be no surprise that gyms are major gay meetup spots. Arnold's Gold Gym was filled with homosexuals and was a major pickup spot for gay prostitutes. This category of gym goer wears tight fitting bright clothes that out him as gay to other gays. Often this group of people is more concerned about their appearance than a good workout. However that is understandable considering that they are predominantly there to meet other men, not that there is anything wrong with that. To each his own.

[Plain Jane](http://www.buzzle.com/img/articleImages/301521-50728-48.jpg): Often overweight or clueless about working out. Plain Jane wears plain clothes so no one will notice her while she works out. Often overweight plain Jane is  embarrassed about not fitting in at the gym. The last thing Plain Jane wants is male attention at the gym. +1 Point for trying -1 for not having an effective plan.

Their Clothing is bright and tight similar to the homosexual. They have no idea what the fuck they are doing from a fitness standpoint and yes that is my professional opinion as a certified personal trainer. The gym now a days, is a fashionable place to go to be seen, a place to show off your new trendy gym outfit and then tweet about it and get the maximum amount of attention. These women never use meaningful weights and will never get any real change in body composition. My worth as a woman depends on people looking at my butt!!!

[The Hardcore Gym Girl:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTEJ-Ec9XOE) These are the only women I have any respect for at the gym. If you are reading this and your a woman, and your hamstering saying yup that's me. No its not. Have you ever thrown up, passed out or dead lifted 225, Squated 180? No? Then this is not you and I don't want to hear your rationalization about how your an exception because you played volley ball and volleyball is hard. The hardcore gym girl is focused, motivated and has an effective plan on how to improve her body. Often but not always the hardcore girl has a boyfriend/man that pushed her to success in spite of the bullshit of mainstream Bosu Ball fitness and all of the stupidity her friends have to say on the subject:Lifting makes you bulky etc.

1372870386.0,26,self.TheRedPill,1hkrmj,Thoughts on teasing.,42,16,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1hkrmj/thoughts_on_teasing/,"I've long been told that teasing is such an important tool in the attractive man's arsenal of game. It's the alpha's multitool in social interactions. Some of the reasons I've considered are that it establishes sexual tension, makes a woman qualify herself to you instead of the other way around, and it demonstrates the unwillingness to submit often found among betas.

The problem is, I've never been very good at it. I've always considered myself (and others have called me) an excellent speaker/communicator, but for some reason that didn't translate when it came to teasing. To solve this, I decided to break down the art of teasing and classify types of teasing so that they'd become more accessible in the moment:

* *Setting unreasonable standards*
* *Obfuscating*
* *Situational criticism*
* *Hyperbole*


**Setting unreasonable standards** is a way of informing a woman that you must be of such high value, you demand only the best from women you associate with. Even though clearly meant as humor, setting these seems to be a great way to make it clear that you won't put up with her shit. Probably works best after a fair amount of rapport.

*""I only like girls who can recite the Pledge of Allegiance while unicycling across the Grand Canyon. So is this gonna work out or not?""*

**Obfuscating** is intentionally causing confusion in an attempt to differentiate oneself from the mass of beta men who engage in boring conversation, asking interview questions. I find it the trickiest of the four, just because if your frame is weak it's an easy way to seem weird. Can be done as an opener.

*""Excuse me, you wouldn't have happened to have seen a pet tarantula around here, have you?""*

**Situational criticism** is probably what would be considered the classic tease. Using the circumstances to point out something you don't approve of in a way that's lighthearted, but also communicates an unwillingness to deal with things you consider less than ideal.

*""I really like that dress! My mother has one just like it.""*

**Hyperbole** is just exaggerating- the often mentioned ""agree and amplify"". It communicates to a woman that you don't take her inquiries seriously, which, to her, means that you've got better things to do with your time.

*""You look so young!""
""I know, I'm actually supposed to be in time-out right now.""*


I would really like EC's and the redpill community at large to weigh in here and let me know where this could be improved and built upon.

I've lurked trp for a little while now and though I still have some misgivings, most of the arguments I've read have been solid.

My problem is that my girlfriend wants to meet with an old fuck buddy from college.  He's visiting from Japan.  The dude has a girlfriend - my gf is Japanese, he's Japanese, his current gf is Japanese.  

He texted her and she didn't tell me until I snooped in her messages.  

The thing is, she comes across as this being completely platonic - she's just meeting an old friend.  When I read his messages, they were overtly sexual and flirty.  I've talked with her about him multiple times and she insists that that's his personality and that it's Japanese culture to act like that.  I've told her that he makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want her to hang out or text him.  He messaged her this time around, but she chose to continue to message back.

We got in an argument about it and now I'm beside myself.  Give me some advice please.  If anything I just needed to get this out here to vent.

I'm seriously considering dropping her out of my life.


Edit:

After getting advice from friends that ""it's really unsettling that she didnt tell you he was texting to her, but for now trust her and then drop her if something happens"" and after getting trp advice about leaving her, I decided to not even give her that chance.  If she felt the need to hide this guy from me, then there obviously was a lack of empathy on her part. 

 I refuse to deal with this bullshit and I refuse to deal with her anymore.

Thanks everyone that gave advice.  It's all much appreciated.

1370617312.0,25,self.TheRedPill,1fv574,I'm Nutz. Ask me anything.,40,15,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1fv574/im_nutz_ask_me_anything/,"Since I'm new to a lot of you and a new mod, I thought I'd write up a quick synopsis of my experience and background and give you all a chance to learn a little about me. 

I officially joined the seduction community in the summer of 2007 when I separated from my wife that spring. I was looking online for tips on how to break the ice and had no knowledge of the seduction community at that time. (it was still underground, albeit not for long) Whenever I asked about advice on breaking the ice people would recommend I read The Game by Neil Strauss. For a couple of months (April - June) I kept rejecting it because I didn't want pickup artist advice because I didn't believe it worked, nor is it what I was looking for. I just wanted to learn how to break the ice (which we know call ""approaching""). Eventually I broke down and bought the book because the recommendations were so strong. To my surprise I liked it so much I read it in 3 days. I am not an avid book reader, so this is saying something! 

When I was going out on the weekends I was dabbling with things I read in the book, and to my astonishment it actually worked as described (more or less). I was in the Air Force Reserves and had to go about 4 hours away every month, and because I wasn't afraid of things getting back to people who knew me I really ramped up my ""training"" and really went for it. I probably gained more experience during those weekend trips than most guys new to the community do in months of what was known as ""sarging"". I directly attribute this 'I'm out of town, time to go balls to the wall' effect to why I got as good as I did so quickly. 

Back in the early days, Mystery Method (MM) was the primary model everyone used. Then came some of the follow-ups as the community grew as it was pushed into the mainstream media. The Game was a bestseller and soon after The Pickup Artist was on the air. IIRC, following MM was Magic Bullets, which IMO was largely derivative, but did have an incredible breadth of information for those still using structured game (following a model and using canned lines and routines). Then came RSD and some others who introduced us to ""natural"" game. Since that time I've seen a variety of changes in the community, with a lot of revolving door aspects. One standout was AFC Adam who really helped reshape my style of game. The model he introduced me to closely matched how I naturally interacted with women and it's what I've stuck with ever since more or less, largely because it allows me to be ""normal"". The only time I really think back to the structure he presented in class is when I go blank or run into a tricky situation that's not heading in the direction I want it to. 

Back in the day, the community was very much about getting laid with the least amount of work possible, but over the years things have diverged. You have the old school pickup companies still geared towards getting socially awkward guys laid using scripted material, and then you've got more holistic approaches by typically one-off companies most people have never heard of (and guys like myself). The focus of this latter segment of the community is to ""skill up"" students' social attributes, get them experience using some structured material, and then put them on a self-improvement path so 6 months down the road they're not one of those guys who gets a girlfriend while still on the training wheels (routines et al) and then she dumps him when he runs out of material. 

I eventually got my skills where I wanted them, to the point I've had some crazy experiences. I was still active online and with the constant repetition of newbies asking the same questions I began taking on a mentor role in my local community in the DC/Baltimore area. I've offered free training going on 4 years now and have taught over 100 men and women, some of whom have become good friends of mine. I was also a  contributor to Decibel's PUA Field Guide, have been active in the SoSuave community, and a variety of community forums. If you look back through my old posts you can see how I evolved. I'm still active in the local community, but I've pushed back from the table. These days my interests are more in teaching newbies, men's issues, and the manosphere in general. I'm also currently dating a former model/child actor 13 years younger than myself. (yay for matching SMV!). I take that former model part back, she just did a gig for Paul Mitchell a few weeks ago.  Anyway, I've been a pretty active member over on SoSuave, The Attraction Vault, Roissy/Heartiste, MR, Seddit, and was in on the ground floor when Rollo started up Rational Male. I'm also a fan of Athol Kay's blog and book.

Just to reiterate, I don't consider myself a pickup guy anymore. These days I consider myself a dating coach and mentor. My goal is to train up peoples' social skills and get them to become the best version of themselves from a holistic perspective. I sincerely believe this is the optimal path for guys looking to make changes for the better rather than following a script and aping ""alpha male"" qualities the whole time. As for the manosphere and red pill aspect of life, I also advise students I'm mentoring of the risks and liabilities modern marriage presents, and introduce them to Red Pill philosophies and what's essentially our sidebar material.

So, I’ve posted quite a bit on TRP in relation to definitions (mostly relating to the self, and acceptance) but not really done a field report, or done anything to offer proof of existance of the theories I see here. This is my first one, and it’s been a bit of a work-in-progress in parts due to having to drop the questions to the other party bit-by-bit.

So the backstory is, my boss at work (33F) has been divorced once, comes across very “hard”, stern, doesn’t wear much makeup (besides fake nails, well, that I can *tell* anyway) and is a fair boss to work for (unless you go head-to-head with her). She doesn't take shit at all, from anyone, ever, which I have categorised as a reactionary defence mechanism (and that is by no means true, but I have come to this through a mixture of eavesdropping and asking simple questions). If you were to extrapolate these to a relationship, I feel she would be very demanding, opinionated, and deem herself in control of all things. Her team (of which I am one) is all-male, and we frequently discuss things on the team regarding women, women’s thoughts of how they see themselves, the media, and our thoughts on them in general (in relation to attractive qualities). One of the team members that I get on with the most is of the Islamic faith, and very open about his lifestyle at home (which is actually very Red-Pill, but please don’t assume people of the Islamic faith are cruel, or treat their women ‘unfair’ because that is the media covering the extremes; might do a report on his views another time, it's very interesting).

Over the course of several weeks, I have noted several behaviours relating to her reaching the end of (what we term) her SMV, and as mentioned before, she has been married (no children) which ended in a divorce when she was quite young (24-27, haven’t asked/don’t care for specifics, but I do know it lasted 9 months) to which she rationalised the failure to “I was too young, and wanted to be married”, although she had actually never lived with her husband in a house prior to getting married. She had a house with him, but as far as I know, they came out equal. She has since done internet dating (and has seen at least one man, who she dumped after going through his phone and seeing texts to other women, but *he wasn’t open about this, and was lying to her about it*), but has since ended up back with an ex of hers (39M) (a blue-pill, Nice Guy; more on him later) who got in touch with her out of the blue via a long four-page email confessing/explaining/white-knighting/self-hating, etc. We’ve seen it all before, most have probably done it before. I’ve never seen the actual email, but she sees it as nice, not creepy. The guy works in banking and earns roughly 10x her annual wage (we’re bordering on £200k a year with all his bonuses in check), which have something to do with that categorisation.

So, over the course of her being excited for the wedding which is coming up soon, here is what she’s got/going to get so far:

* A trip to Vegas, to be married there (not a shitty do either) with all the trimmings; photographer, hotel, yada-yada-yada.
The trip to America will continue for around two weeks whilst she goes around Arizona/Nevada sight-seeing.
* A house (£250k) of which at least £125k has been put down as a deposit. (Not by her, but by him, that’s **all of his contribution**). Oh, something important about that, she tells me/us that she “likes her space”, therefore (hamster) the house has four bedrooms so she can go off and be on her own sometimes, and in addition to that, most weekends he will be out at the football, allowing her free time to herself. I swear these words have actually come out of her mouth.
* She will get his old car as he will get a new company-car due to a promotion. She is also pushing for a convertible “whilst we’re still young”, and frequently confides in me what she’s going to be asking him for. For example, today she asked me what I would have in my ‘dream kitchen’, to give you an idea that she’s living quite vicariously.

Now, I’ve ran by her several questions such as ‘what if he wanted a pre-nup’, and ‘what if he wanted a paternity test’. The former would be that she wouldn’t marry him (what’s his is ours), indicating a want for spending/possessions to be equal. The latter received the response “I’d give it him, but divorce him afterwards, because you need trust for a marriage, and if there’s no trust, then there cannot be a happy marriage”; dat logic. That was despite my protestations about men ‘never knowing 100%’, and also bringing up that babies can be mixed at the hospital, plus cheating women, the unfairness of having to pay for a child that is not biologically bound, the prevention of biological trait/similarities inhibiting understanding, etc.

There was some clever hamstering going on here. Firstly, she stated that “if I did cheat on him with another man, I’d just get it aborted” (it seemed like a rephrased NAWALT, where she classified ‘types of women liable to do x/y/z and what x/y/z should/could do in return), and regarding the baby-swapping, she actually brought examples up of several soap-operas where this has happened… but then quickly changed the subject and walked off before I could say ‘well, that could happen’.

Now, there has been a pre-nup of sorts but it’s quite tricky to explain. It boils down to in the event that there is a divorce, she is not listed on the mortgage, and she must leave the house, i.e. she cannot claim squatters rights, or say “but, but I *live* here!” in an attempt to stay/claim something. She’s not happy with this, and let slip at the start of the week with the following story.

Her husband-to-be is a die-hard football/soccer supporter, and has a season ticket to the most predominant team my country’s highest league. It’s expensive, roughly around £700 a year or more, and you’re lucky if you can get one (even if you have the cash). He goes every week he can, and to the additional matches for cups, etc. Always has. 

So, he’s meant to be ‘on a diet’ (enforced by her) due to the impending wedding, and he’d been doing well up until he went to the match last weekend, where he decided to drink and eat what he wanted with his mates. He declined to ring her back, and stayed out for quite a while whilst she has at home ‘waiting for him’. He gets home late, with a takeaway, and she’s angry, but really only because he didn’t have the stones to tell her to STFU. He slunk out of things by saying “oh, well I don’t know if we’re going to ‘x’ pub yet”, etc. They had an argument which ended with her ripping up this pre-nup thing. I thought this showed her cards a bit, because she said “you should have seen the look on his face!” She said it as if she was proud of this.

I proceeded to question her regarding him and what I believed she’s taken for granted. She maintains this air of worthiness, that she is somehow owed all of this that he’s giving her, that they are as-of-already one entity. Before she could speak again, I’d tell her that her current/future lifestyle would not be possible if it wasn’t for his wage, and that she should actually be very respectful about him/to him regarding this, and let him do whatever it is he wants. Of course, because he’s so Blue-Pill she knows that she’s onto a winner here (oh irony!), due to his spongy backbone. I’ve also got information regarding him; he’s had an overbearing mother (a Jewish mother, and I’m not being anti-Semitic with that remark, it’s just that I hear they’re high on the overbearing scale) and currently still lives at home…

So, I’m sitting here, asking these questions and all this is doing is ticking the boxes. She doesn’t know my thoughts, she doesn’t know I browse TRP whilst at work, she doesn’t know I know what she’s doing, and neither does she (well, not totally). What I am seeing is The Hypergamess at work here, and it’s never been more true to me. Just thought I’d share my musings and findings without having been on the receiving end of it.

1365499133.0,24,self.TheRedPill,1bzaje,GQ magazine pandering to feminist ideology,27,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1bzaje/gq_magazine_pandering_to_feminist_ideology/,"In GQ magazine's article [Pimpin' Ain't Easy: Television's Ubiquitous Alpha Males](http://www.gq.com/entertainment/tv/blogs/the-stream/2012/05/mad-men-breaking-bad-similarities-golden-age-tv.html), the author Brian McGreevy ponders why modern television dramas are usually populated with male protagonists as leads.

&gt;But this does not address the fairly glaring concern of why there is such a preference in long-form drama for male protagonists. After all, the tension is present in both sexes, and men certainly don't hold the monopoly on aggressive, ambivalent behavior.

However, McGreevy's conclusion is an all-too-familiar feminist canard:

&gt;The reason could hardly be more apparent, or unfortunate. **Men are afraid of women in power.** So are many women, frankly; throw out the name Hillary without the benefit a qualifying surname in a group of even liberal leaning and witness the vitriol from both sexes. And a woman in power who likes to fuck is altogether untenable to the collective, much less one with whom you are expected to sympathize.

A woman in power who likes to (promiscuously) fuck isn't untenable; she is merely unattractive to men. Her power over men clashes with their biological desire for a submissive wife; her promiscuity is unappealing because it signifies a greater possibility of being cuckolded. It is as if McGreevy has forgotten that the purpose of television is to attract more viewers for commercials, and it does this best by tapping into evolutionary psychology.

&gt;Granted, one could cite, say Sex and the City or Weeds, but these are comedies, where the double standard is less pronounced (somewhat).

Inverting gender roles by placing females into masculine positions, while simultaneously relegating males to the position of bumbling, incompetent simpletons has long been a comedic trope. This is because comedy exists to turn reality on its head for humorous effect, in this case the reality that men are the motor that turns the world. Women are, at best, the grease.

&gt;Try to come up with a dramatic female lead who is permitted to be a selfish piece of shit in the same league as her masculine equivalent and still be relatable and you come up dry. Having written a novel that hinges on the machinations of a violent, adulterous alpha female, I find this more than a little baffling.

At last, the author reveals that he is personally invested in the notion of alpha female leads. This reveals that he is either being intellectually dishonest by promoting feminist ideas in order to sell his book, or that he truly believes that men are “afraid of women in power.”

&gt;However, the beauty of evolution is not its inexorability but its fluidity and as sentient beings we have the power to engineer its course. Narrative rewires our brains, creating new possibilities of thought and experience.

The author resorts to the nurture-trumps-nature argument, and then conflates evolution (a process of natural selection that takes place on a scale of thousands of years) with neuroplasticity (the capacity for organisms to alter and reorder neural connections in the brain).

&gt;It was impossible to predict the diaspora of the best dramatic minds to television, just as it's impossible to predict what new modes will emerge from the current diaspora of television to the internet. Though currently a boys club, the optimist in me believes this ""golden age"" is not a transient set of conditions that will expire once the Establishment catches on (see: 1970s Hollywood), but an open field for emerging dramatists of infinite variety to fucking tear shit up.

Unless some manner of transhumanist utopia comes to pass in the next hundred years, humans are stuck with the reward circuitry and main interests of our genetic forebears. Consequently, it is in our best interest to optimize our experiences by aligning them with many of our genetic predelictions (perhaps not for those things like murder).

He brings up a similar point earlier in the article:

&gt;Which raises another question. Why, given the previously nonexistent opportunity to employ the novelist's sensitivity to the cinematic, is there such a remarkable degree of sameness?

Because evolutionary psychology has provided us with a limited number of prime interests, such as sex and power. This isn't to discount the vastness of human experience and the textures that subtler pursuits give to life, but it is all ultimately window-dressing built around our core evolutionary concerns.

I find it disappointing, but not unexpected, that GQ's analysis of television trends would smack of armchair feminist theory. After all, the feminine imperative has completely suffused the public sphere.

Remember to build your masculinity in accordance with our evolutionary history, and seek to emulate the great men of times past, not the limp-dicked metrosexual gender traitors of our present.

Now, in my blue pill days, I went out of my way to avoid talking about my ex's, or my sex life in general with women, especially girls I'm dating, because I knew that I wanted them to be somewhat chaste (something males find desirable in women) and I assumed they wanted the same in me. I **know** this is not the case now. I **know** women want experienced men to make them be subordinate now. But before I was living oblivious to these facts.

So anyway, I felt a little bit of internal resistance saying this stuff, but I was going to town on my girlfriend and I started telling her that ""Of all the women I've fucked, you're one of the best"" and she reacted in the way the textbook theory suggested she would, moaning and groaning and smiling. I continue ""you're tighter than any virgin I've ever fucked"". Again, she's like convulsing at this way more than usual. ""I love fucking your pussy way more than I liked fucking my other girls"" she's like going nuts at this point.

If a woman said this kinda stuff to me in bed, I'd honestly think it was really hot and a good compliment... but I'd want that whore out the door when I was done. I would not want to hear about the dicks of the other guys she's banged. After I was done, my girl couldn't stop smiling and giggling. She hugged me and squeezed me and was SO glad that she had a guy who had taken multiple v cards, slept with dozens of women, and still thought *she* was special. **EDIT** she asked me if I was serious about what I said, I made it clear that I was. It was better than the most romantic poem and roses a beta could have ever dreamed of. If you want to impress a woman, get some sexual experience and then tell her she's special.

The Digital Gender Gap: Push to increase the presence of women in NYC tech. 

There doesn't appear to be an online copy, so I'll just go through it. Apparently the fact that men dominate the industry is inherently a bad thing. About 10% of the working women have jobs in tech despite 39% of women having a degree in STEM. 

To counteract this imbalance, they're launching a program to teach middle shcool-aged girls tech skills. 

The reason why there's a lack of women in tech according to the article: ""Intimidation at starting in an industry where male domination is so deeply entrenched; a 'pipeline problem' in which very few women are educated in the fields early on and during college; an echo of cultural and workplace sexism; and a small amount of positions open to women during the industry's founding decades ago that has persisted.""

They see the relative youth of New York's tech scene as a chance to ""do it right"" compared to Silicon Valley, in terms of a balanced gender ratio.

In the course of my time on TRP, I've seen it hailed as being a great, life-changing book. 

Here's my beef though, while it makes it very clear how to get people to like you, it goes against a lot of what I consider to be ""alpha"" behavior, at least insofar as *I* should be learning and practicing it. 

As an example, about midway through the book, he discusses how to win people to you way of thinking and his generalized chapters are:

1. Avoid Argument.

2. Never Call Someone out for being wrong.

3. Also admit when you are wrong, empathetically.

Each one of these things appears ""wrong"" in the sense of it being beta, whether you apply it in a business or personal setting. In fact, I would go so far as to say that acting this way was my default for the longest time before discovering TRP. I would always apologize for things I didn't do or meekly avoid confrontation. It doesn't seem to get me what I want.

Here I am, apparently being told by an expert on the subject that that sort of brown-nosing was right all along, or am I missing something?

So here is what happened, I've already posted about it on the other thread, but I guess I'll get more answers by making a new one.

&gt; I actually unfortunately found this out 2 weeks ago by logging into my GF's Facebook; she was flirting with other guys (betas, she told me that he was one of her ""dogs"" before she started dating me), looking for attention and so and so. I broke up with her and she begged me for days to get back with her (I did). She also admitted herself that she did this because she couldn't control me as she controls those other guys, and was actually ""the dog"" of our relationship - and therefore did this to feel again as controling and get an ego boost by making betas fall for her and being all over her. She was only talking about me to her friends though and about how much a ""bad boy"" I am, driving her crazy emotionally and giving it to her as hard as she needs it so it seems to confirm what she said.

&gt; She also went as far as begging me for more attention (and I know that I give her enough, at least enough for her to keep craving for more), and for me to be... LESS confident and more at her feet, lol.

&gt; She gave me her Facebook password (I didn't accept it as first but she sent it anyway) and blocked all those guys from her friends list. Oh and although discovering this pissed me off at first, I have to admit that the reason behind it actually flattered me

I loved the flair and the CGI and I love the 1930 feel. I'm a big fan of the whole brass band era, ganster lifestyle and pomp. But what I did realize, is that these newly founded redpill rules still apply unfortunately. As much as we want to think this is a new phenomenon, its basic principles still hold true since the beginning of time.

 I was wondering if people that saw the movie could comment on what they  saw and what their reactions were. Some of the conclusions and rules I made connections with were:

1.Romance is a male conception.

*Gatsby comes back from the war, wants his woman to wait but obvious she takes the next best thing due to her nature. This is demonstrated in this post.

http://therationalmale.com/2011/10/03/war-brides/

2.Women change their mind depending on the the feeling you give them.

*When Gatsby is taking daisy around his mansion and showering her with all sorts of clothes and experiences, her attraction is high. When he looses his temper and acts beta in the scene where they go to drink scotch, she retracts/

3.Women have a high attraction to those men that other women are attracted to 

*Daisy's main dude, was banging all sorts of women and she knew it, but she would leave him because she thought he would change (a least that's what I thought) as well as knowing he was a keeper since other women thought so and she was afraid to loose that by nature.
Cue Dread game:
http://therationalmale.com/2012/03/27/dread-games/

4.Love is non-negotiable

*The first man to say ""I love you"" looses. The scene with the whiskey drinking in New York, the two main characters are in a fierce argument about who loves who, and it seems that she looses respect for both of them and is caught between cognitive dissonance.

ZING!:http://therationalmale.com/2012/08/22/just-get-it/

5.Do too much and you will become beta suplicative

*The scene where Daisy and Gatsby meet again after 5 years, he brings in flowers and does all this sorts of stuff to impress her. It looks cook in the movie, but he turns in to a un-glued beta instead of the alpha he was and it seemed really try hard. I don't really have much deep analysis on that

And the biggest one of all

6.Man cannot be in love

*He was the go to man, party poppin, rockstar lifestyle, point a finger and its done, man of all men. Then came along Daisy and he fell back in love with her, all his drive disappeared, all of his moxy faded, infact the movie demonstrated this fact succinctly; his house dimmed, the parties stopped and the he fired his staff so that no one knew what they were doing.

I've talked to many friends and people. Even rockstars, as soon as you fall in love, you loose your way and your fire dims. I seen many good friends just fade away with some girl and loose their fire and everything they stood for. Only one friend, I know of who is dating a model, has consciously made an effort to date more girls, and make sure he is not falling to hard for her; this guy is still partying and being adventurous with me
POW!:
http://therationalmale.com/2012/09/10/men-in-love/


Anyways, I think I'm still missing a few, I might post them up if I remember. Some questions I still am thinking about

-Who was more alpha, Gatsby or Daisy's husband? 

Gatsby has moments of alpha and then turned beta, but Tom had moments of beta and was alpha, so its hard to say but I think looking back over everything Tom was.

-What could have Gatsby done differently to steal her away?

Instead of pressing the issue, he should have left, that would have been more alpha. I no other tactics come to mind, but I'm sure some one can think of something.

Ever notice the difference between conversations women have among each other versus with everyone else? 

One of the primary arsenals in a woman's manipulation game is ""Playing a role"". It's like movie acting but in real life. They're real good about it. I've never seen qualms appear until years down the line. They tone it down though after permanent stability is achieved. A naive man will look at that and say what I'm suggesting is extremely exhausting and is just plain old dishonest. A red piller or anyone with common sense should be wiser.  

They're playing a role not for the sake of lying, they're playing a role for stability. They're playing a role to make sure you treat them 
and perceive them how they want. They're playing a role to make you fulfill the duties they wish. 

Let's picture a very promiscuous woman. She can tell you about all the fucking and sucking she's done, contrary to belief I don't think I ever seen a woman truly regret doing something she wanted to do.
This applies to both genders. Telling you might trigger a fight, make you leave or it might make your googly love and royal carpet treatment stop. Telling you might make you mope around the house drowning in insecurity which would look disgusting in a woman's eyes. They know the consequences.

They need to do it.

One needs to accept that chances are you won't see her true self, just glimpses. If you want to see who a woman is go and look at whose she's been fucking. Go look at men she ran behind trying to impress and cater to. They truly desire the men they want to be centre of their life and who those men are says a lot about who she is. 

This bring me to my next point. 

Ever noticed how some women will turn into sex freaks with some guys and with some relationship types will carry themselves like dick doesn't cross their mind?

There a choice there, a decision. You get chosen for what role a woman wants you to play in her life as well. You're acting it out, you just don't know it.

This is for anyone whose not up to speed on this.

If anybody would be interested, I would definitely make an update post in a month or two after I've done my homework, worked on my game (or lack thereof) and tried out said game. So my take away from all this is:   
  
 
- I'm 99.9% sure I'm a sigma whose ""alpha manifestation"" is wolf alpha. Ian Ironwood's articles were awesome (thanks u/roe_).  

- Some of my problems come from the fact that I was raised primarily by my mother. I need to start bonding more with my father and guy friends, and make a little bit of distance with my mother and with my female friends (those female friends who I don't find very attractive). This has also made me look for guy-friend qualities in girls, which is a bad idea (thanks u/RedSunBlue, u/iamme2 and others).   

- When it comes to selecting non-LTR female partners, I'm way too pretentious. I should stop looking for these deep intellectual connections and focus more on how much I enjoy her pleasantness and her hotness (thanks to many here).   

- I will be working on my game this summer. I'm a lot less hesitant now that I realize that game is not just purely to bag ONS's. The Real Social Dynamics Youtube channel seems pretty awesome and helpful, so I'm gonna check that out too. My brother also recommended I read ""Tao of Badass."" My approach to the male-female relationship was misguided and skewed thanks to radical feminists and the ""men are pigs"" bullshit. Also, I need to read more stuff that you wonderful gents provide here at TRP (thanks to many here).   
 

  
So thanks a lot everyone, and I'll make an update post in the future!

Hello all. So I've been lurking here for a bit and decided to post. I've been reading a lot of the sidebar literature (e.g. Involuntary Celibate) and it intrigued me, but I'm not sure I fit in fully with everything going on here. I apologize that my post is a bit long and verbose. So here's the story:  
  
I'm a 22 year old heterosexual male, and I've had 6 sexual (P in V) partners. Four were LTRs, one was a college one-night stand and the last one was a month-long FwB thing. I'm handsome and ripped (6'2"", 188 lbs.). I'm funny and incredibly smart (graduated top of my class for both of my bachelor's degrees; currently pursuing a biochemistry PhD). I can sometimes be a bit socially awkward, mostly because I don't care to learn the rules/conventions rather than that I am weird and incapable of being social.    
  
Anyway, I don't really have any sexual desire when I'm not intellectually engaged by a pretty girl. I don't get random erections, and I certainly recognize if a girl is super hot and I love to look. But I just don't feel a sexual attraction or hunger for her. I didn't like my one night stand very much. She was a hot, promiscuous girl that came on to me. I was without sex for quite some time and I just went with it. I didn't always enjoy being FwB with my last sexual partner either. She is a shitty person but was super hot and gave the best BJs ever. So me thinking she sucked as a person (read: she's a huge cunt) helped me want to just fuck her and not connect with her - so I rationalized by degradation I guess. Between every sexual partner, I spend about a year or so without any sex. I usually have a drunk hook-up or two in there, but I'm usually so drunk that I can't get it up and we just give each other half-assed oral. But it's not because I can't get a girl to have sex with. I just don't really look for it or care to pursue anybody. I'm attractive enough that I could easily pick up a girl with a little time and investment in learning ""game."" But I just don't care. I wait until something just pops up. That was the story of the FwB. I can't get sexually excited about dumb girls that are super hot...I in theory want to fuck them silly, but when it gets down to it, I just don't have a sexual reaction to them. The FwB seemed to be pretty smart and she was pretty forward about her attraction. I made all the moves and got a good FwB. I would invite her over between classes, fuck her silly for thirty minutes, then just tell her to bounce. But I just don't feel a strong sexual energy anymore.    
  
I was sexually unsatisfied in my last two LTRs (beta of me I guess?), but the one night-stand and FwB left me very sexually fulfilled. I don't know if this information matters at all. I'm a relationship kind of guy...as much as I say or think I want to fuck silly some random hotties, I really only like getting sexual with girls I connect with intellectually and/or emotionally.  
  
So basically I don't know where I fit in the classifications put forth by TheRedPill...I wouldn't say I'm alpha or beta. And I don't have trouble getting sex (such as the guy in ""Reformed Incel""), I just don't really care enough to seek it. My mind, life goals and interests can keep me occupied. Where do you think I fit in within these classifications? What do you make of all this?  
  

  
EDIT 1: (Quoting myself from a comment below) I'm just a man that has tried many, many avenues to regain his sexual virility. After all, I'm 22 and whether or not I'm having casual sex, I should at least have the desire to have it. I've explored all the reasons and came to the conclusion that it has to be about my outlook on sex and relationships and potentially (as I mentioned in my other comment replies) some kind of weird social confidence issue. That is why I turned to this subreddit, to see if maybe the problem lies in my outlook on sex and relationships between man and woman.  
  
EDIT 2: (As pointed out by mmj4mil that it seems like I'm qualifying myself to you guys; quoting myself here) I have read a lot of the posts on this subreddit, and every time someone ranks/evaluates his or her attractiveness, you guys at TRP ask them their height and weight, body type, etc. So that's why I did it - to avoid future clarification.

Trying to see if I played this right, I think I did but interested to see the discourse.

Saturday night, San Francisco: Seems to be a higher than normal dude to girl ratio, but I have good looking female friend out with me and we are having a good time (She's an age adjusted 7, but a lot of fun but a bunch of baggage that made me friendzone her, still good dhv) we are bouncing around a few bars and end up at a rather nice one in a boutique hotel.

After meeting some people, having a few drinks, the call of nature happens. On the way to take care of the issue, I notice a decent girl sitting alone on a couch. My friend heads to the loo and I engage. 

Playful banter, having her move her seat from the chair to the couch beside me, kino etc. things are going fine, mentions she lives about an hour away and is not staying in the city tonight (no SNL), but I hit a bump when she suggests going back into the loud bar to get a drink. I calmy say why don't we stay here and get to know each other better ( bar is loud, the couchs in the lobby are quiet) chat for a few more, and she says again let's get a drink. My friend is done, and motioning to head back in so I agree. We escalate kino, her arm around me as we push our way through the crowd at the bar. She asks me what I would like to drink, I order my simple usual (I keep the more complex stuff when I know the bartender or have time to order myself) while waiting for drinks she is very much up on me and enjoying it, nice interest and we seem to be having a good time. Bartender finishes the drinks, and say it will be $25. She turns and looks at me with the expectation for me to reach for my wallet, and I calmly explain, you invited me into the bar for a drink, why are you not paying? 

She gives me a look that could be best described as a snarl, I do my best to keep a straight face as her whole world view collapses. She says then why did you bring me in here for a drink if you weren't paying? I simplely state, you invited me, I was always taught who does the inviting pays. I simply then say, maybe it is like that in your culture (she had said earlier she is American, but philipino and Mexican) why don't I just pay for mine and you pay for yours?

To this a get a look that is best described as disgusted shock, she turns on her heel and walks away leaving me with the 2 drinks.

I apologize to the bartender, explain that she invited, ordered and then expected me to pay for both. I pay for mine, and give him a tip close to the value of the wasted drink (I come here enough that I want to bartender to know I am not screwing him) and continue on with my night. I have a good time with the rest of the evening, and see her later with some guy that has paid for her drink(s), but she is clearly not interested, shooting daggers at me each time I pass. 

This amuses me greatly. 

Few things to keep in mind, my logistics for this night suck, live over an hour away, getting a hotel room in SF on a Saturday night is $200+ so a SNL unless the girl lives in SF is not going to happen. Best I was hoping for was a number and/or a kiss.

I have several other plates in the air so no big deal on this one, I just found it interesting to see what happens when you refuse to pay for a girls drink that she ordered and invited you for.

What should I have done different? 

Tl;DR Girl gets pissed off and walks away when I don't pay for her drink after she invites me to come with her to the bar. This amuses me as her radiations are shocked that her looks aren't getting her expensive drinks for nothing.

1367693841.0,23,self.TheRedPill,1dovzd,The Importance of Confidence.,38,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dovzd/the_importance_of_confidence/,"The fact is that the silver bullet, the holy grail, the masterkey that unlocks all the doors in life, the true quintessential essence of 'alpha', is confidence. That's why PUA works, it emulates confident behavior.

I used to be very depressed and have very low self esteem, and I have been actively seeking methods of building it up over the course of my life. Hopefully I have learned things that can be useful to others who feel that they need to do the same.

**Circumstantial confidence**

This form of confidence is rooted in your possessions and achievements and comparing them to other people's possessions and achievements. You feel like a boss when you're walking around in a nice suit, or driving a nice car, or you have a nice apartment, ripped abs, or you have a hot girlfriend, you're in a cool band or whatever. These things give you validation, you feel good about yourself and that which is yours.

If you are starting from nothing, if you have zero confidence, if you are depressed, I recommend putting effort into improving your circumstances so that you can attain this kind of confidence. Solve your problems one at a time. Start lifting and the hormones released from that will lift your mood and give you the energy to make other changes, do some PUA, have new experiences and expand your comfort zone.

There are problems with this kind of confidence though. 

Firstly it is situational, if you derive your confidence from something that is not relevant in a certain situation, then you may be less confident in that situation than you would otherwise be. So you're the manager of some store or whatever, in the store you are the boss, you are the alpha male... outside of the store you're just some guy, nobody gives a shit. You can be the owner of a successful business, a self-made man. You go to a nightclub and you will still feel anxious about approaching some hot girl who probably only works as a hairdresser. How does that make any sense?

Second problem is if your circumstances change for the worse, it can have a negative effect on your overall confidence. Or if you see someone who is doing better than you then you will feel inferior to them. You become needy for the validation that comes from having nice things or having that hot girl in your life, and neediness is a very unattractive and unhealthy for you. Why do you think men are 11 times more likely to commit suicide in the year following their divorce? Its because they had invested their self esteem entirely into the circumstances and the role that was their marriage, and once it disappeared they lost their self esteem along with everything else.

Third problem is that no matter how nice your stuff is, you will always want more and/or better stuff. Even if you get all the stuff you could ever want you can still be a deeply insecure, unhappy emotional wreck underneath, because all of that stuff is just a facade. You see celebrities who have everything, fame, fortune, riches... and yet they still have mental breakdowns. Why aren't these people happy when they have so much? Clearly there's more to it than that.

I think that circumstantial confidence is a good stepping stone, but it's wise to move beyond it when you're ready. Usually people can't move beyond it until it starts to fall apart, because they have no motive to change while things are going well.

**Inner confidence**

You came into this world as a happy little baby. You were happy and confident in learning to walk and talk no matter how many times you fucked up. Then one day you were in the playground playing with a ball and little Timmy came over, took your ball away and told you that you sucked. You were emotionally wounded, you had to compensate for this wound and so you rationalized. You looked around and thought of reasons why you deserved to be happy and confident, and the things that you saw were your possessions and achievements, thus they became the basis of your confidence as described above. This is called the ego. ""I'm so much better than that asshole Timmy because I have this cool toy car, fuck Timmy and his bullshit"" you said when you were 4 years old. ""Ha, look at Timmy now driving a forklift while I have this sweet job with my own office and future prospects"" you said at 25...

But here's the revelation that blew my mind when I had it. We as people have the inherent right to be happy and confident regardless of our circumstances, regardless of our emotional wounds. Being happy and confident is supposed to be a default state. 

The ego is the scar tissue that surrounds our emotional wounds, it's something we build up over time as a way of compensating for what we perceive as imperfections that need to be hidden. If you want to be free of rationalized confidence that is vulnerable to external factors, you need to learn to accept your emotional wounds as a part of you and to realize that we are all broken in one way or another. We all have shit that we're embarrassed about or shitty things that happened to us, so does everyone else.

Acceptance of yourself and being a genuine motherfucker is the key to deep-rooted unshakable confidence. It frees you of dependence on circumstances and outcomes because you don't need validation from anything outside of yourself. You have no reason to be needy or insecure, this in turn will make you behave in a way that is far more conducive to success in many aspects of life, including business, social and romantic endeavors.

There's no instant solution to attaining this, it's something you have to work on through mental discipline and practice, but it is possible to attain. You also have to be careful not to let the ego sneak back in, ""I'm so much better than Timmy, because I've achieved true inner confidence and he hasn't"" - no. You need to learn to recognize the ego if it resurfaces.

**Transcending the self**

I will only mention that I think that there's a level beyond what I've described above that is an even deeper and more robust form of confidence, but its getting into spirituality and eastern philosophy, and that might be disappearing a bit too far down the rabbit hole. So I'll leave it there.

**tl;dr: Being confident because of the stuff you have or the things you have done is okay, but it's not a good long term solution because those things can change and you will lose your confidence. You have to realize that you have the inherent right to be happy and confident and work to cultivate that instead.**

Any half-decent looking girl who desires attention and ego validation is merely a few taps of their finger away from an endless stream of beta supplication. Inane pictures of women being bored and doing meaningless activities receive dozens of ""likes"" from their friends on facebook, while any man posting a worthwhile article or interesting photo might receive four ""likes"" for his effort.

The endless cycle of attention seeking and receiving immediate, unconditional approval has sent the dating scene in a dark direction.

How much worse will the situation become when the lag time between seeking and receiving validation is further reduced?

We can only speculate, likely with a good dose of apprehension.

I will describe a possible future, using the fictional woman ""Sarah"":

*Sarah says, ""I'm bored and want attention. Google Glass, post that Sarah is eating a delicious cheeseburger.""*

*Within 30 seconds, a steady trickle of ""+1""s roll in. Thirsty men start posting replies, such as ""I would love to take you out for cheeseburgers some time!"" These men are dictating their replies on their own Google Glass devices.*

*The rush of attention is intoxicating to Sarah. However, she soon grows accustomed to it after a while, since the human brain is a master at returning us to our hedonic set points. Naturally, an arms race of sorts is created, with Sarah's need for further stimulation constantly upping the ante required from her beta orbiters.*

*The fast pace of interaction causes the sexual marketplace as a whole to evolve toward an intolerable state of affairs faster than anything previously seen in human history.*
