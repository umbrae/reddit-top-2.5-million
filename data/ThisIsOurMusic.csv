The keyword here is critique, not silence. I've seen countless posts downvoted to 0 that never get the chance to see any real constructive criticism or feedback. Just because you don't personally like the music someone else has created, doesn't mean you should take it upon yourself to silence their work. 

I agree that quality content should be upvoted, but I don't think it's fair to the artist for anyone to downvote their submission, especially if it's only at the default 1. My point is, I think we could all be a little bit better about offering feedback and not downvoting just because it isn't our style. People work too hard on their music.

If you're a fledgling band looking to make your name I understand how difficult it is to get your name out there.

I'm a young freelance writer formerly with Interstate Live, going into degree English Literature with a view to do journalism at the end. I am seeking to expand my portfolio by doing reviews of smaller bands and artists who are trying to make a name for themselves.

My other aim is to give you some words to maybe put on your facebook page (I will also share your band with people I know in the industry). Writing a bio is all very well, but if you can get an impartial source to write something in your favour, that will work better.

I will post the resulting review on my blog and share it on my facebook and twitter feeds. 

I do not expect nor want a fee, just that you share your music with me in order that we may work together to improve our standing in the world.

His Bandcamp site is located [here] (http://mattmarsan.bandcamp.com)

If you like what you hear, please share a like with him on his [Facebook page] (http://www.facebook.com/MattMarsan)

This is his story from my perspective. My little brother left home about three years ago. He decided he did not want to go to college and left home with nothing but his guitar and his thumb. He hitch hiked across the United States, starting in Ohio, going down through Texas, then Arizona, then up to Seattle. Along the way he met many people and had some truly incredible experiences. He played in Austin Texas, worked at a self-sustaining Ashram in Arizona, stayed on an Indian Reservation with the blessing of the chief of the tribe, and attended the Rainbow Gathering. He has so many amazing stories and they have influenced him greatly in the way he writes his music.

Today, January 25th, is his 23rd birthday. He is currently in Seattle and playing music at local shops while staying in his car. As you can imagine it’s difficult to get a gift for a guy like this, so this is my attempt to share some of the wonderful music he has created with some of you.

I appreciate anyone that takes the time out of their day to give some of his music a listen. He truly just loves creating beautiful songs and he finds his joy in this. His happiness inspires me to be a better man every day and appreciate the things I have around me, and miss his company. I hope you enjoy his deep and meaningful music as much as I do.

~Sincerely, 

[A proud brother] (http://imgur.com/X7JI9CC)

Readers want to be able to find songs and identify redditors whose music they like. Also, it makes it a lot easier to spot TIOM posts within a wall of other reddit posts.

Personally I think its kind of lame for this subreddit which is why I disabled them from the beginning. However you can still downvote things when theyre in your main reddit feed.

* Me and sunchase have been discussing the state of the [listen] tags and the lack of genre information. He's also been brainstorming ideas for tagging other info (like WIP?). By design, this is a really hands off subreddit. Please discuss what you think and vote on a solution. Personally, I hate [listen] tags and would prefer: [Genre] Artist - Song Name.

* Note that the Radio Reddit people asked for some space on the sidebar. Check it out if you're interested in uploading your music.

* We're nearing 1,000 people! If you want to help hit that milestone, please recommend TIOM in places you think it might be appreciated.

* Finally, I run subreddits.org and I haven't done *anything* with it in almost a year, but I'd like to. If anyone wants to contribute or offer up some good ideas for me to implement, let me know. I've been considering a page that scrapes all the posts in TIOM and aggregates them in a nice radio type way?

I figured many people in ThisOurMusic may be highly interested in our services, so I'm reaching out to you here. 

Our mission is pretty simple, but the specifics of what we do gets a little bit crazy. Here's the basics: 1) We host competitions, with paid awards at the end, which are probably larger than you would expect; 2) The site mechanics are all designed to give everyone many opportunities to get noticed, so people don't have to just upload and hope; 3) We do it for free. One of the things about  Masspire that I'm most proud of is that we make money only when artist's sell their work through the site, so we can't succeed unless our artists do. If you want more detail: http://www.masspire.com/page/forartists

If you like the idea, come by. It's possible to gain through participation, but there's no way to lose. 

PS - feel free to ask me anything you want in the comments. It might take me an hour or two, but I'll respond to pretty much everyone.

Unfortunately, I cannot pay you and can only offer a credit at the end of the film with your name, song title, and website. This film is a short 10 minute piece on the rise of 5th year college students, and will be submitted to several short film festivals so if your music is chosen, I will have to contact you directly to send you a .pdf of our release form. I'm not looking for any specific genre or sound, so feel free to post regardless of the type of music you make. This is a great way to expose your work to a large college audience, and get some extra promotion at no cost!

This is my first time in this sub reddit, so if this is not the appropriate place to post this, let me know. I look forward to hearing all of your music!

I am drawing conclusions and rethinking the plusses and minuses of this from a bands perspective. I may offer an amended offer in the future.

i am considering offering critisicm/praise for a short initial period... you will have to request a listen directly... you have to want to have it... really

what are my qualifications for this? I consider myself a music lover in most if not all forms... I am a retired slice the pie reviewer with over 3,000 reviews to my name - I no longer participate for reasons to complex to go into unless you have participated in the site and its politics

I am in a band myself and know that getting an 'honest' opinion or indeed any opinion at all can be hard

also to be honest i miss listening to loads of new unknown music

I like what I like... I could always be/ am likely to be wrong - hell I wouldnt have signed Biffy Clyro.... (or Adele) I may not get past the first ten seconds... reviews may be brief and to the point...

your best track... any takers? I must be mad....

edit - please no covers

edit one track per artist... i did say your best track..

I've been playing around with recording equipment for about as long as I can remember. In the early days I remember getting extremely excited about new recording equipment such as a really crappy laptop mic. The joy of getting a mic with high enough impendance to be able to record drums without them clipping. All of this of course was done with a single mic, I could only dream about going stereo. I used to solder all kinds of small mics from all sorts of electronic devices into cheap cables to test them out. Just to see if they were any good for recording purposes. Those were the good times of extreme experimentation for me. Nowadays everything I do is purely digital and plug-in based, which is for the better. I also play guitar and ""sing"".

So now that that's out of the way, here are the actual mixes:

The earliest mix I could find, dating back to 2007:

The newest from 2013:

They've been playing together for roughly three years now. Anyway, it'd mean a lot to them and to me if you'd give them a listen. 
	
&gt; The Tension are a young rock band (ages 16-18) from New York City, consisting of vocalist Jack Staffen, co-lead guitarists Jack Moulton and Daniel Risdon, bassist Gabe Simon and drummer Damien Moffitt. They met each other over the summer of 2010, and just took off and began to write, and soon recorded a powerful 3 song demo produced by Tomato (Sound Of Urchin, etc.) and Doug Gillard (Guided By Voices, etc.). After taking a year to write more, rehearse and play shows, they went back into the studio in June 2011 to record a full 10 song album called The Tension, produced by Tomato and mixed by Ruddy Cullers. The album was recorded at NYC's Stratosphere Sound (James Iha from Smashing Pumpkins and Adam Schlesinger from Fountains Of Wayne's studio), and perfectly captures the band's technical and moody music, that has a classic power, feel, and groove. Sometimes described as ""Radiohead meets Jam"", The Tension's music can only really be classified by the uniqueness of Jack Staffen's voice/songwriting, combined with the very distinct and formed musical personalities of the band.

[Here's their Tumblr] (http://thetensionband.tumblr.com/). They also have a [Facebook page] (https://www.facebook.com/TheTension1). 

Anyway, give them a try and feel free to spread the word. Thanks so much!

------

Ever since I graduated high school, I've been trying to make music. At first, I was poking just around on a keyboard and trying to learn to play the guitar. I got a little better, and started writing instrumental songs. Just piano and bass with some strings. I did that for a couple of years. Then, I started recording guitar tracks. In 2008, I swallowed my fears and started to sing. Three albums later, well, here we are.

I don't really have much gear - just a single electric guitar, an acoustic, my amp, some pedals, and my computer. I do all my own recording, mixing, and production. Last night, I ordered my first (small) round of discs, and signed off on the digital distribution agreement for iTunes and whatnot. I'm still learning, but I'm quite proud of how far I've come. I would be thrilled if you took the time to listen. 

----

Standout tracks, according to those who have listened before (and me, of course) are:

[Poster Child](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/poster-child) - 80s rock with a huge beat.

[Girl's Got Altitude (Little Bit Higher)](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/girls-got-altitude-little-bit-higher) - Big guitars, soaring chorus.

[Going Down (Little Bit Deeper)](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/going-down-little-bit-deeper) - A grinding, gritty beat and a noisy solo.

[Indecent](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/indecent) - An electronic track with as many synths as would fit.

as much as I would like you guys to see and hear these, I would love so much more to get some honest feedback on the songs. I have really only shown my friends, but would love some input from other people that produce audio. Ive been spending like all of my free time trying to learn to produce better and these are the first songs i've made that i can listen to and think that they are ""done"", you know? so I just want to know how close you guys think I came to nailing down a solid mix. Im willing to answer any questions as well in regards to production or anything like that. or if you have a question about the first video i can ask my friend john and get back to you!

some basic info about the recordings: i used logic. there were no mastering plugins, or plugins of any kind on the master fader when i bounced each song. (this was done intentionally, so yes, they are not ""mastered"") i did try and ""master"" it with a few compressors but ultimately decided that i liked dynamic range on the original mix better, even if it is not as loud. but! here is a secret link to the mastered version: http://soundcloud.com/tha-sounds-of-lyf/sarah-pen-masterd/s-C6X0H
 if you guys would wanna listen to that and tell me which version you guys think sounds better that would give me some cool insights i feel like. ",,False,,t5_2rqpa,False,,,True,t3_13jl72,http://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/13jl72/electronicquite_experimental_learning_lab_sarah/,

What I need is for someone to produce a futuristic track that will feature bass drops similar to dubstep. The track needs to be a little over a minute and needs to be catchy.

I'm a mod over at /r/gameofbands - a themed songwriting contest with randomly chosen band members each round.  We've had a lot of fun and made some [really](http://soundcloud.com/plingus/until-the-days-are-done) [great](http://soundcloud.com/needanameok/team-10-the-ex) [songs](http://soundcloud.com/memefilter/what-is-love), and I encourage anyone who likes a challenge to join up.  

This is not why I'm posting though.

This round's theme is ""holidays"", /r/songwars has chosen it as their theme too, and all of us (generally speaking) are planning on ""releasing"" a Reddit ""holiday album"".  THAT is what I want you to get involved with.

(If all goes as planned) [radioreddit](http://radioreddit.com/) will host a dedicated ""holiday music"" stream, and all the holiday songs generated by Reddit musicians [can and should be uploaded there](http://radioreddit.com/uploading).  The ""album"" will probably be a ""pay what you want"" package on bandcamp or similar - **they're free** but (in theory) you'll be able to donate if you want to, and you can DL single songs or the whole package.  There may be some voting process to hone down the material to an ""album's length"" (overall upvotes are a very Reddit-y way of sorting the best tunes), but that's only speculation at this point, and your ideas are welcome.  

You still own your tunes, you retain all rights.  No hidden agenda.

So, if anyone here is thinking about writing a ""holiday"" song, please submit it to /r/holidaysongs so we can include it.  Post any related questions there too.  There are no other topical restrictions (profanity/blasphemy/etc) so write about whatever you want (in the ""holiday"" spirit, of course).  Parody songs are fine too.

This is my first album, recorded a few years ago. Since recording this, I've learned a few things, and therefore hate a lot of this album. But I want to know what you think. If you don't have time to listen to the whole thing, I'd suggest ""Veronaville,"" ""Getting Nowhere at a Somewhat Plausible Rate,"" ""Just Wait,"" and ""Death of a Mechanic."" If you like those, try ""And I,"" ""Sometimes It's OK to Give Up,"" Keep on Pretending,"" ""I Must Be Insane,"" and ""I'd Die for You."" If you like those, try the rest!

I just basically want to know whether or not it's worth it for me to keep going. So let me know, and be honest!

Also, I know it's sloppy performance- and production-wise. I'm more asking about the songwriting potential here.",,False,,t5_2rqpa,False,,,True,t3_yqvln,http://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/yqvln/my_first_album_let_me_know_what_you_think/,

I'm a recording artist (among others) and I've been making music for a couple of years now. And I've recently finished my fourth album: Glitch-22.
It's experimental lounge music with a trip hop touch. A deep sound is created through several layers of samples and reverbs. 
The lounge aspect is what stands out most and apart from the last song, this is mostly an album to just kick it to. 
The last song is more dancy and has got kind of a summer vibe to it, but it clearly separated from the rest that is down tempo lounge. 
It certainly is not unenergetic. Some songs are even very uplifting and make you bounce your head. Catchy sounds, cool tunes. Check it out.

You can grab my latest album, Glitch-22, here:

I'm interested in all feedback and criticism. It's aimed at DJ's to make mixing easier, so I'd love some feedback from people who spin live, just to see what they think. But of course, those tech lovers out there who just enjoy hearing things, I'd love to hear from you too!

This is the first track I've ever been happy or content with. It's mixed and mastered to my home entertainment system, so I'm curious how it plays for the headphone folks and people who have a nice set of monitors they can test it with.

Anyway, thanks in advance for any feedback or constructive criticism you can throw my way.

Cheers, Dienaid (Estron)

Advice?,6,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/1hg5q5/this_industry_can_be_quite_brutal_at_times_advice/,"Hi Reddit. I'm a music producer based in Hollywood, CA and I work with a lot of different acts, both local as well as international. 

Most recently, I was working with a female pop/r&amp;b artist who I have worked with in the past as well. Previously, I have produced 2 songs for her as well as 1 remix of one of her original songs. I did these tracks for free out of the goodness of my heart, because she was a friend of a friend, and I knew she couldn't really afford to pay me due to her financial situation.  

Fast forward about a year and a half. She shows up one day and says I need a single for my new album. She told me she was looking for sponsorship to be able to pay for production/recording costs. I told her I will also do my best to place the song in movies/tv shows/commercials etc. so that we can make some residual income aside from album sales. After her taking 3 months to record a single song, she texts my best friend, behind my back, talking about how we are ""idiots"" and we ""Fucked up HER song"" even though I haven't signed any sort of release form, NOR have I been paid yet. All this because another engineer claimed to hear digital pops in the recording that we did. We went back and listened to the raw files and there isn't a single pop. As angry as I was, I was still willing to let it go and finish the song just to be done with it, however she decided to keep talking shit behind my back. Now I've had enough. I copyrighted the instrumental that I created along with the melody I wrote for the hook (which is the driving force behind the entire song) then told her these are my terms. $1,000 + we split the publishing 50/50. And I'm even STILL WILLING to try and get the song placed in movies/tv shows/commercials etc. She claims that SHE is the one who wrote the melody for the hook when all she did is write the lyrics to MY melody and that what I'm doing is extremely unfair and immoral and that my price is ""preposterous"".

I think I'm being pretty fair considering how much free work I've done for her in the past, how little I'm charging, AND the fact that I'm going to still try and help her make some side revenue off of media placements.

Am I wrong?

TL;DR
Recording artist wastes 3 months of my time without paying me, talks trash behind my back to my best friend insulting my intelligence and work experience (I've been producing music for 13 years), claims my work as her own, then says my price is unfair even though after all that, I'm still willing to help her make extra income from media placements. $1,000 + 50/50 publishing is my price.",,False,,t5_2rqpa,False,,,True,t3_1hg5q5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/1hg5q5/this_industry_can_be_quite_brutal_at_times_advice/,

Then came GarageBand when I got my computer for college, and finally Logic pro a few years after. 

The thing is, I feel like the more I learn about producing and technique and everything, the less emotionally meaningful my music becomes. Back when it was just me recording under my lofted bed in the dorm for hours on end is when I think I really created my best stuff. Yeah, it was probably horribly produced, but it was much more interesting and had a lot more thought behind it than the stuff I shell out these days.
