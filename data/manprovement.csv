The 21st Century dilemma.",40,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/manprovement/comments/tow6q/i_cant_afford_to_live_on_my_own_and_therefore/,"Long story *extremely* short, I live at home with the folks and I'm in my mid-twenties. Just starting community college for the first time in the fall. I spent the past decade following an artistic dream that never panned out and turned out to be a childish fantasy. 

Over the years, I usually had solid employment - at 21, I was making $35,000 a year with no degree. Locking up the building at night, being the last to leave, attending management meetings, etc. But the state of the economy over the past few years has become dire, as we are all well aware. I am now competing with folks who have Bachelor's and Masters' degrees for jobs in retail. It's bad all over, and I can't get a leg up.

However, living at home is a bad scene. My folks are *great* - they are allowing me to live here **rent-free**, because my current job pays me peanuts - I barely clear $1,000 a month. And it was the best job I could find in town! (laughs) 

My family is extremely religious and conservative. I am not. They are quite uptight and don't really go out. And that makes me uptight, and saps my desire to do anything. I used to have a healthy love life, but quite obviously, that has vanished as well.

I'm in between a rock and a hard place. I cannot find employment which would enable me to move out - and I will not have an Associate's degree for **2 more years**. I love my folks, but I am a man now, and I can't do this for another two years. 

**tl/dr; I'm underemployed, in my mid-20's, working 35 hours a week, and will be attending school full-time in the fall. Is there any way I can move out of my parents' house?

Just got a new job, stacking some sweet new supps, getting a lot of writing done, awesomeness everywhere.

This past Friday - got fired. I was hired on as a dispatcher for a courier company, but it became obvious that I made a better driver, and they weren't hiring drivers.

Getting kicked to the curb like that is something that my Biploar tendencies jump all over : *fuck you, go die, you suck, you're not smart, you should just quit, p.s. go to hell.* But this time I noticed a difference. It took a bit of effort to think these things.

I saw myself, sitting there, *intentionally* trying to beat the shit out of myself, trying to muster up every shred of self pity and reclusive comfort, for what?

Not only were the thoughts a useless burden, the effort required to conjure and maintain them was more effort than I cared to devote to it. What was the point? what purpose did entertaining these impulses serve? fucking nothing!

In my own way, I bounced back, that day resolving to get hella wasted (4/20) and write a shit-ton more, I not only ""shook it off"", I fucking stomped it.

**Next Day:** chill party with my friends - one girl wants to get MAD friendly.

1337064844.0,20,self.manprovement,tnuep,Just Some Observations on Life,26,6,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/manprovement/comments/tnuep/just_some_observations_on_life/,"If there's one thing that I have learned in life, it's that there are few things that you care about, and even fewer things that care about you. Moreover, the things that you care about will let you down. The only thing that you have is yourself, and even then, you won't have that for long. Life is about have-nots, not haves. Making the best of it is the challenge. A challenge that not everyone will meet, for the few haves must eclipse the magnitude of the cumulative have-nots. Perhaps the most cruel lesson that I have learned is that one's potential is directly correlated to one's emotions. A man without emotion is a man who can become successful in his endeavors. 

Often times, failures come from those around you, rather than from yourself. You cannot go through life depending upon other people, yet the opposite is true as well. People will let you down. People will give you up. People will love you, and then not love you. The world would be easier if love and trust did not exist, because its chief purpose is to diminish and go away. 

Alas, true love, trust, and happiness do exist. However, it is rare. More often than not, it is simply a mask worn for a period of time until it melts away and real intentions surface. It seems as though the best one can ever do is be the man that he wants to be, instead of wishing he were that man. There is no substitute for action. Everything boils down to willpower and fate. I'm not sure if my observations are correct, but being a realist this is how I see life.

*If you're going to lie, start lying early and often.  For example, if you want to convice all of your female friends that you adopted a kitten, tell them that you've been thinking about adopting a kitten.*

**2)Every good lie has a bit of truth to it.**

*These are called anchors.  They make the lie more tangible.  It's super effective when combined with something that is visual. For example: Wear a University of Philadelphia Hoodie while telling people you went to the University of Philadelphia when you literally went to it, and then left it.*

**3)Don't fuck with experts. *Ever*.**

*Don't try to kid a kidder, and don't try to bullshit an expert.  Subject Matter Experts will not only call out your shit, but they'll look awesome doing it.  Don't argue physics with Stephen Hawking.  Don't argue 'Getting away with Murder' with O.J. Simpson.  Feel free to lie to Hawking about murder and Physics with O.J, though.*

**4)Sacrifice a white lie to cover up an off-white lie.**

*If someone calls you out on something, admit part of it gracefully, but reinforce the other part is true.  It makes you look cool and honest that you can come out and say you did lie about something.  Insignificant lies can be tossed aside, but don't ever sacrifice the lie that's keeping you fed, or the lie that's keeping them coming back for more.*

**5) Profit.**

*You have these gifts, now use them and prosper, my fellow menfolk.  Lying is something that you get better at the more you do it, and it becomes more profitable, too!*

            I thought i'd make a recommendation for a program I have been doing myself. It is all about connecting to your masculinity, confidence and power as a man. And works on basically becoming a healthy man in general (physical/mental/psychological).

I've tried all kinds of methods, I did pua stuff, hypnosis, affirmations, sedona method and other weird things but I never really got it.

And I found this program and I am finding myself much more confident and assertive even though i've had issues with not standing up for myself most of my life.

I am also noticing that it's making me deal with certain things in my life that I was ignoring before that I just didn't want to deal with.

I'm noticing much more respect from people and i'm respecting myself much more. I'm treating my own time as more important and doing my own thing as much as possible.

It's really put me on the path to handling alot of things in my life. I'm currently just about to finish Stage 5 of 6 and then decide where to go next.

A lot. I'm very pleased with who I'm becoming and I'm actually happy a lot of the time. But I think I am going too far in that direction. The last few nights I've been out drinking, I've found myself sneering at a lot of people and making biting comments towards them; just treating people as inferior in general. It got really bad last night. I almost punched out my friend's brother because he teased me lightly, and I basically changed the entire mood of the room from happy to deadly serious in about two seconds. The girl I've been seeing was pretty shocked because she thought she was getting a really nice guy, and I'm shocked too. I was bullied in middle school and I never thought I would ever act like one myself. I apologized profusely that night, and we're cool now, but I have to tone down my drinking to make sure I can still think before I act and keep a handle on my emotions.

So, are there any archived links or subreddits you guys can recommend? It seems like I'm having issues with insecurity like everyone else, but of a different sort and it's hard for me to find content to suit my needs.
