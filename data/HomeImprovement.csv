1366213605.0,101,self.HomeImprovement,1cjdqo,How can this be legal? Nightmare neighbour/developer ruined my backyard,119,18,161,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1cjdqo/how_can_this_be_legal_nightmare/,"I live on a street with modest sized houses. Bungalows and small 2 story dwellings. 
Last year the bungalow next door was sold. Our new neighbour was a charismatic gentleman in his 50s who quickly ingratiated himself with my family.
He told us he would be knocking down the existing house and rebuilding.  Over the coming weeks he gained our trust and began asking for small
favours during the construction process, which quickly grew into bigger favours. Without getting into the details, by the time we realized we'd been taken advantage of, the damage was done.

While it's still too early to tell, I suspect the person who we thought would be our new neighbour, is in fact a developer who will be flipping the first chance he gets.

People used to refer to my yard as ""the oasis"".  [Here is a picture of the current view from my back deck] (http://i.imgur.com/h0vZsMF.jpg).  Where now all you see
is a wall, there were once trees and sky. Do you see that window obnoxiously overlooking my once-private back deck? There used to be a tree there that he begged us to remove because it impeded his construction. I was concerned about losing my privacy but he assured me there would be no windows there.
I beat myself up 100 times a day now about being so naive.

As if things couldn't get worse, yesterday he installed his AC unit. He had a choice of installing it anywhere. In the front, in the back, on the other side of his house, 
or inconspicuously between our houses. However, [*this* is where he chose to install it] (http://i.imgur.com/ND3h5Uf.jpg). Directly at eye level, where my family and I will hear its roar and feel its exhaust as we attempt
to have an outdoor dinner that was once a joy for us. 

Despite the fact that my house lost a significant amount of property value, it appears that everything here is actually to code in my jurisdiction. 

Now I am desperately looking for a creative solution to some of the above problems, short of selling my house.

Is there a way to at least partially block his view out of that window? A tree will no longer fit there, and a fence is not permitted to be taller than 6 feet.

Is there a smart way to dampen the effects of that AC unit?

My thoughts are so consumed with anger towards this guy and towards myself, that I find it very hard to think clearly these days.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

At some point in the 60's or 70's, the front porch on our 1914 house was closed in. The person that did it apparently didn't have a square, or straight edge. We didn't have a lot of money to throw at it, otherwise I would have replaced the windows, and panelling. All together, we spent ~$450. Most of that was on flooring and some paint. The space feels a lot bigger now. The dirty carpet is gone, and the brown walls have been painted. 

This was my first time installing hardwood floors. It was much easier than I expected. I thought that keeping the boards in line would be hard. When I unbundled the flooring, I was going to return it because most of the boards had slight curves to them. I later found out that this is fine because they straighten out when they're nailed in.

ALSO, watch my comrade HVAC guys like a hawk. If your AC was cooling at all before they came out (maybe just not keeping up well) DO NOT let them tell you it needs 5lb of freon. The vast majority of systems pretty much stop putting out cool or cold air after being 2-3lb low.

I turned off the breaker to the garage and got in the attic to find that when the amateur that wired it up thought that super cheap extension cord from 20 years ago was just fine for running a 20a breaker to a garage.. Worse yet? Its because they ran out of 12g romex by about 2 feet.

If you wanted a hot shower you were out of luck unless you were ok with very low pressure.  Finally today I got fed up and decided to fix it.  I'm a plumber so this is the last thing I want to do on my time off. My house was built in 1998 and still has the original water heater.  I turned off the water heater, shut off and drained the water in my house and opened up the hot water discharge side of my water heater.  When I looked down, I saw that the discharge port was completely clogged with mineral deposits.  It took me 10 minutes with a chisel to get it 75% of the way open.  I didn't go all the way since i don't have a set of internal npt taps at the house, but I got the pressure back to normal.

My entire house is plumbed in copper besides the nipples to and from the water heater.  This is a fairly common problem and it may help you to do the same if your hot water pressure/volume is significantly lower then your cold water. While I was chipping away at the clog I had a shopvac as close as I could to the port so most of the chunks got sucked out instead of falling into the tank.  When I was done I hooked a hose to the discharge and flushed the tank for about 10 min, then capped the discharge and flushed the drain for another 10 min.  Once I was done I put it all back together and so far everything is fine.

Recaulking bathtubs is probably one thing that perplexes more homeowners than any other job. One thing that people should realize is that silicone caulk can be difficult to remove if you don't know how to do it, and NOTHING sticks well to silicone caulk, not even silicone caulk.

It's because people don't know how to remove old silicone caulk COMPLETELY that their new silicone caulk doesn't stick well, and that results on garbage advice being given, like filling the bathtub with water before caulking, which is likely going to result in trying to caulk a wet joint which will yield predictable results. Garbage in, garbage out.

If you remove the old silicone caulk COMPLETELY, the new silicone caulk will stick to both tub and tile like chewing gum to the underside of a church pew.

This post is in 4 parts:
1. How to remove old Silicone caulk
2. What silicone caulk to buy
3. How to place new silicone caulk
4. How to clean mildewed silicone caulk

1. How to remove old silicone caulk:
The way to do this is to first remove as much as you can by mechanical means. This means scraping as much as you can off with a razor, or if you have a fiberglass or acrylic bathtub that may be damaged by a sharp razor, use a Tungsten Carbide paint scraper or a plastic windshield scraper or any other reasonably sharp but relatively soft material that won't damage your fiberglass or acrylic surfaces.

Next, apply a product called ""Silicone-Be-Gone"" which is made by DAP and can be found in the caulk aisle of most home centers. Silicone-Be-Gone is nothing more than gelled mineral spirits. If you can't locate Silicone-Be-Gone in your area, just buy some mineral spirits (or paint thinner or ""solvent"" or Varsol), get some strips of paper towel wet with the stuff, drape them over the silicone caulk and cover with Saran Wrap for an hour or two to prevent the paper towel strips from drying out.

Web page showing Silicone-Be-Gone:
http://shop2.aol.ca/shop/product--ca...d_3298009.html

Neither Silicone-Be-Gone nor mineral spirits will ""dissolve"" cured silicone, it will just make the silicone swell up and get much softer so that it can be more easily removed by mechanical means. After letting the Silicone-Be-Gone work for an hour or two, scrape the silicone caulk a second time and you should remove more silicone (that will accumulate on your razor blade or scraper). Apply more Silicone-Be-Gone and spread it with your finger this time so that the warmth softens the gel and you apply a thinner coat.

After leaving that Silicone-Be-Gone sit for another hour or two, scrub the area with a green or white Scotchbrite pad (or the kind sold in grocery stores for scouring pots). The difference between the green and white pads is that the green pads have an abrasive mixed into the plastic before drawing that plastic into a fiber. The white ones are pure nylon fiber which doesn't contain any abrasives. I use the green pads on my enamel steel bathtubs, but I'd probably use a white pad on fiberglass or acrylic tubs to avoid scratching the fiberglass or acrylic material.

After scrubbing with the Scotchbrite pad, clean the Silicone-Be-Gone off with clean water and dry with a cloth or paper towel. If you're using paint thinner, I'd use Simple Green to clean the paint thinner off first, and then rinse the area with clean water. There should be little silicone left, but any that is left will prevent the new silicone caulk from sticking at that spot, so we need a way to confirm that there is ABSOLUTLEY NO residual silicone caulk remaining.

Remember that the Silicone-Be-Gone makes the silicone caulk swell up and get soft. Get a small quantity (a photographic container full is plenty for one bathtub) of a very fine powder (like Portland Cement, drywall joint compound, or probably even normal baking flour would work). Use a small brush to apply that to the area where the silicone caulk was, and then rub the powder with your finger.

If there is any residual silicone caulk remaining, the fine powder will become embedded in it, thereby revealing it's location. If there is no residual silicone caulk, the powder will be wiped cleanly off the tub by your finger.

Mark the spots where the sticking of the powder reveals the existance of silicone caulk with masking tape or something, and redo just those areas again with the Silicone-Be-Gone. You should find that the residual silicone caulk is so soft now that it can be removed even by scraping the surface with a popsicle stick sharpened in a belt sander (or a plastic windshield scraper). Then, check those areas again with the fine powder.
Once the powder doesn't stick anywhere, let the area dry and start putting the new caulk on. Maybe wipe down the area where the silicone caulk was with mineral spirits (paint thinner) and allow to dry. It will evaporate completely without leaving a residue, so there's no need to clean again.

2. What Silicone caulk to buy:
Silicone caulks come in different price ranges. The more expensive caulks will contain more mildewcide, which means that the caulk will be more resistant to attack by mildew. I personally have found that Dow Corning's ""786"" silicone caulk is better in that respect than DAP ""Titanium II"" silicone caulk. If you're buying GE silicone caulk, pay a bit more and get their ""1700"" silicone caulk instead of their regular ""Tub &amp; Tile Silicone Caulk"". Not only will these caulks be more mildew resistant, they will stick better and cure to a stronger rubber than the regular silicone caulks.

However, in the last section of this post, you'll find out how to clean mildew off of silicone caulk, so you can keep any silicone caulk clean, not just the better ones. 

3. How to place the new silicone caulk:

Use masking tape (1/2 or 3/4 inch wide) to mask off the joint you're wanting to caulk. Use 3/4 or even 1 inch wide masking tape if you have little experience caulking. Put the edge of the tape about 1/4 inch away from the joint on both sides of the joint. That means stopping the tape about 1/4 inch from any vertical joints you want to caulk as well. This can be done by gripping a single edge razor blade in a pair of needle nose style locking pliers. Put the tape in place and then put the edge of the razor firmly on the masking tape, and then pull the tape at an angle so that it tears off at the razor's edge.

(If you do a lot of caulking, you can probably just caulk the tub freehand without even bothering with masking tape, but I'm writing this up for new homeowners who want to get a good looking job without the caulking experience to do it freehand.)

Before putting the new silicone in place, press down the edges of the masking tape so that you're sure that the new silicone won't get under it.

Squeeze out the new caulk onto the joint and wipe it down with a dry finger so that it's relatively uniform in thickness all along the joint. Don't let so much caulk accumulate on your finger that it starts getting on the tub or tile on the OTHER side of the masking tape. At this stage, you simply want a relatively uniform amount of caulk all along the joint, and how you accomplish that really doesn't matter.

Once you've got the new silicone caulk reasonably uniformly distributed along the joint, pull the masking tape off.

Give the new silicone caulk a few minutes to ""skin over"". This is a good time to mix up a 50/50 solution of liquid dish washing detergent and water.

""Tool"" the new silicone caulk with the diluted soap solution. The soap in it will both act as a lubricant and will prevent the silicone from sticking to your finger. Basically the procedure is to dip the ends of the thumb, forefinger, middle finger and ring finger of your working hand in the soap solution, rub your fingers together, and wipe a 6 to 9 inch length of the new silicone caulk fairly lightly to give it a concave shape. Then, rub your finger tips together again to reload your working finger with more soap solution and do another 6 to 9 inches or so. Keep going, rubbing your finger tips together to soap up your working finger tip. As you do this, soap will come off your finger and coat the silicon caulk. After you do the whole joint, you can run your finger from one end of it to the other just to ensure it's more or less uniform.

Also, at this point, if you wipe the silicone too hard and remove it from one area, you can simply add a little more caulk to that area and spread it as best you can. I can't explain why it sticks with the soap solution on the existing caulk, but it does. If you put on too much, scrape off the excess with a putty knife or something.

Allow the silicone caulk to cure overnight and you can shower the next day. Don't put any shampoo bottles near it for the first 2 or 3 days, tho.

4. How to clean mildewed silicone:

Mix up some baking soda with straight bleach to make a paste that you can spread with a tea spoon (even a plastic tea spoon). (I use a small oval painting spatula that you can buy in art supply stores for painting with thick ""paste"" style paints that come in tubes.)

Use a putty knife to scoop the bleach/baking soda paste out of the mixing container and hold it near the silicone caulk. Scrape the paste onto the silicone caulk and spread it with the teaspoon.

Cut Saran Wrap (or any clear food wrap that will stick to tub and tile) into 4 to 6 inch wide (or so) strips and put them over the paste so it doesn't dry out, and leave it overnight like that. My experience is that it won't do any harm to ceramic wall tiles or enameled steel tubs to leave it for several days like that.

When you pull the Saran Wrap off and remove the paste, your silicone caulk will be white as Manitoba snow. And, you can do this repeatedly to the same caulk to maintain it in a mildew free condition.

You'll find when you're doing this that the baking soda settles out of the bleach so that it'll be necessary to continually mix the paste up before scooping some out. If you're doing a vertical or joint on a ceiling, you CAN mix Vim Thick Bleach (made by Unilever Canada 1-800-896-9286) which is just gelled bleach with talcum powder to make a paste that sticks well (and behaves all the world like joint compound). (Adding baking powder to gelled bleach results in the gelled bleach becoming ungelled so that you ruin it.) However, since Vim Thick Bleach only has a sodium hypochlorite content of about 3.5 percent, it's not as effective at killing mildew than regular bleach which is 6.25 percent NaOCl.

I save the old paste and reuse it. Just add some more bleach and mix it up, and it's ready to be used again. I think talcum powder is less dense than baking soda, so I'm going to try making paste from talcum powder and regular bleach when I run out of paste made from baking soda to use.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_1fl1mv,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1fl1mv/howto_recaulk_a_shower_door/,

1361548235.0,40,self.HomeImprovement,190x4x,Info for anyone wanting to buy a fixer-upper with out having all the improvement $$ upfront. This is mod approved.,43,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/190x4x/info_for_anyone_wanting_to_buy_a_fixerupper_with/,"I am going to buy a house, and have been worried about the vast improvements that will need to be made- new HVAC, new floors, creating a new plumbing line in kitchen, etc. It is over 50 years old and has never been updated. I have been so worried about trying to find a way to fund all of this, and I found a website that points to several options for additional funding on top of your mortgage for home revnovations.

It is [this site](http://budgeting.thenest.com/can-include-upgrades-mortgage-3275.html). It talks about 203k FHA loans, VA loans, and other programs that could help someone who may want to buy a house that needs improvements but does not know how they will get the $$. It is NOT a solicitation website, nor do I have any affiliation with it. I would like to share this with people, as I am overjoyed now that I have hope. 

I found this last night, and have since looked deeper into the loan that would help me most - the 203k FHA loan. You don't have to be buying a FHA house, either. It is applicable for ANY HOME you are purchasing.

Here are a few things that you can do with the loan-
 
* Make your home more energy efficient, pairing with the Energy Efficient Mortgage program
* Small kitchen/bathroom remodels
* Replacing windows/gutters
* Replacing HVAC system to a new, energy efficient a/c's and water heaters

You can either get a ""streamlined"" loan up to $35,000, or there is another product for more $$, but I haven't looked into it as much.

I have been so worried that we will be stuck having to come up with the funds right out of pocket and thus would be unable to do any repairs until wayyyy down the road. Which is a scary thought when he furnace is 59 years old, and the windows are, too! But now I am looking forward to being able to make this house the right house for us. 

I hope this can help some of you.

In the summer, there's a strange smell that emanates from the CMU wall between the usable basement and the crawlspace.  It's strong enough that at times you can smell it in the kitchen above.

Multiple plumbers, electricians, wildlife abatement specialists, and even a guy from a restoration company who was referred to us as ""the smell wizard"" have smelled the odor and been unable to place it.  It's been confirmed not to be sewer gas, natural gas, dead animal, or ozone.  It definitely has an organic pungency to it, and I sometimes refer to it as ""eau de dead guy"". One guy thought it might be gases from a rotting tree stump under the basement, but 63 years is a long time for it to still be rotting.

Our attempts to control the smell so far have consisted of:

* Sprayed lots of bleach water into the open tops of the cinder block wall the smell is emanating from
* Sprinkled lots of baking soda into the open tops of the cinder block wall
* Attempted to plug open tops with fiberglass batt inside plastic bags
* Nailed up wire mesh over the top of the cinder block wall and sealed with cement.
* Closed inlet valve from old, defunct municipal steam system (at other end of basement, but condensate line rans to vent stack which is right by the wall - steam service ceased in 1973).
* Removed condensate trap from said steam system and capped inlet pipe at the valve.
* Disconnected the condensate pipe that runs below the slab from the condensate trap at the front of the house to the vent stack at the back of the house, about 2 feet from the source of the smell.
* Cut said pipe at floor level at both ends and capped with hydraulic cement. 
* Cemented one end and capped off other end of the copper pipe that evidently replaced the below-slab condensate pipe at some point between 1950 and 1973.
* Dug through the bone-dry dirt on the crawlspace side of the wall, removing all debris I could find.  I ended up removing about 3 2-gallon buckets of trash, broken glass, old disposable silverware, etc., and completely freaked out when I found what turned out to be a chicken bone from 1950 (""Oh shit! Mafia graveyard!"").

The house is pretty old and haven't had much in the way of modernization since probably the late 70s or early 80s.  The house has the old knob and tube wiring and plaster walls and ceilings. On top of that the house only had two bedrooms, both upstairs. 
I decided that my best bet would be to take it down to the studs so that I could run new wiring, frame in another bedroom downstairs, and put some insulation in. 
So  far I've got the house completely gutted, the insulation hung,  and the new bedroom framed in. 
An electrition friend stopped by yesterday to check it out and give me an estimate on some electrical work. He noticed that none of the bedrooms have closets and ask me if I had planned on framing some in. I told him that I hadn't.

* Me:  Yeah, but it is 3 years beyond its expiration date
* My Father-In-Law:  Phuffff, I've used caulk beyond its expiration date with nooooo poroblems
* Me:  Alright, if you say so...

That was the conversation I had a few weeks ago.  So yesterday, I decide to finally take care of my shower/tub.  Takes me about an hour to remove all the old stuff, confirm that it is dry and ready to go.  

The caulk my FIL gave me was realllly difficult to push through, and about 1/2 way through the project, it started looking like cottage cheese.  Another 30 minutes later, I was finished.  Did not look perfect, but as long as it works, I am happy.

4 hours later, the caulk is not dry...at all...still just as tacky as when it came out of the tube.  Shit.  

Hop on the internet and discover I am not the only person to be burned by expired GE Silicone II, let's just say that there is a lot of anger and a lot of very negative reviews on the stuff.  A trip to Home Depot, and $40 later I am back home.  

I spend the next hour and a half removing the gunked up, non-drying caulk, getting a contact high from the denatured alcohol used to get all the remaining crap up, cut my finger on a razor blade...

BTW - Denatured Alcohol is an AMAZING solvent.  Wow, can that stuff clean!!!  

Alright, back to it...I then redo my tub with brand new GE caulk, it is dry to the touch in 30 minutes and supposedly ""shower ready"" in said 30 minutes.  My gwad...the smell.  Even worse than the alcohol...

Failure all around, between my FIL believing that expired product is ""just fine,"" me trusting him, and GE for making what I have discovered to be a horrible product.  

So, a word of caution.  If your caulk is expired, or even within a few months of its expiration date, test it first.

I finally got around to building a desk this weekend. Total cost was around $160 and it took 4.5-5 hours. I have very basic skills and luckily a grandfather with every tool I'd need. Dimenstions are 90""w x 32"" D x 31""t

**The costs: $160 total**

**$80 from Home Depot**

* 12 1x4x8 common-board planks (around $5 each)
* 1 6ft 2x4
* Drawer slides
* Stain
* Polyurethane

**$80 from Ikea**

* 2 EXPEDIT bookshelves

As you can see from the before pic I started living in my new place with a plastic fold up table. I had been looking at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn but every large decent desk was $500-$1000. I got some inspiration from Pinterest and knew I could save some money. 

I stared by cutting the boards down to 90"" wide, the max width I could have in that area. The whole idea was to build a table top to sit on the bookshelves. First I attached the 2x4s to the first board on the top, then used truck ties to pull the boards together. The 2x4s are the main frame underneath. Once securing those I cut my pieces for the sides and front to make a false front/edge.  I got lucky and my grandfather already had a drawer I could use. The drawer was by far the most difficult addition to the table, could save a lot of time by not including a drawer. I used around 100 nails and had access to to nail gun (a must).

Next I sanded it, stained it, and then the next day applied 3 coats of polyurethane. I could have done a much better job on the finish but I wanted to get it done as fast as possible.

I have a custom built large PC so I used the Ikea bookshelves to house my PC on the right side and stash my stuff on the left. 

All in all I am very happy with the results.

I disagree that you can do a roof estimate from the ground unless the roof is in really good or really bad shape.  There are some issues where you have to walk the roof to determine how bad they are.  Even with a roof in really bad shape, you need to walk the roof and look in the attic to determine the condition of the decking.

Even if you don't think you need to get on the roof, it's a waste of everyone's time if you don't have the tools necessary to do so and you are relying on the homeowner to have the tools for you.

A hundred or so thus far, mostly in large sections.  They are coming right off of the nails that were holding them in place.

The guy who installed the roof took a look and said it is a shingle issue and he wants paid again to repair the roof.  I can't seem to find the real problem.  The roof boards are in fine condition, the paper that goes under is fine.  The singles are just not staying on anymore.  This all started right when Ohio got that heat wave a few weeks back.  

It almost looks like the shingles are separating where the nails went in.  They are coming off the roof despite 4-6 nails per shingle.  The only thing I noticed is the sealing strip at the top of each shingle still has the plastic on it, keeping the shingles form sealing at the top.  But they aren't required on a roof of this pitch according to the manufacturer's specifications.  So...i don't know what would cause this to happen.  That's the only thing that makes sense though.  THey didn't seal and water got in and is rotting the shingles where the nails are.

I'm afraid to get on the roof and tarp it in the event more shingles go and I go with them.  Last thing I need is a broken neck.

Edit:  [Now with pictures](http://imgur.com/a/uw3TM#0).  The weird thing is the back half of the roof is fine.  Its just the side that gets all the sunlight.  And yes, I know my gutters are crap and the chimney needs fixed.  I'm broke.

**Project Details**

My wife and I are having a baby in July and decided to add some extra storage to the baby's room. This closet had a shelf, metal bar for hangers (reused - see pics), and bi-fold doors.

We trashed the doors and painted the inside of the closet white. I designed the system to have 13"" tall shelves so they can accept storage baskets from either target or ikea. I bought 3 8' X 4' sheets of 3/4"" MDF from lowes and had them rip them into 13"" boards (with a 10"" board at the end to be used on other projects). We primed and painted each board in our basement before I made any cuts.

I then used the cut list I created and my circular saw to cut the boards to size. We glued each joint and used 2 or 3 screws to keep everything sturdy. We ended up adding a 4 extra 13"" X 13"" pieces on the bottom shelf to support the two vertical shelves. We decided to stagger them because we like the way it looked.

I glued and screwed the vertical shelves to the bottom shelf. I then used an L bracket on the left vertical tower to hold everything to the wall. I reused the old metal hanger bar which added extra support.

**Cost Info**

In case anyone was wondering the total cost of this project was about $140:

* (3) 8' X 4' Sheets of MDF @ $33 each = $100
* (1) 1lb box of 2"" screws = $6
* (1) gallon white paint  = $25
* (1) liquid nails = $3 
* (1) closet rod = free for me (or $10)

This is a pretty good savings over buying [expedit](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/09064/) shelving at ikea (about $200) and this is 1,000 times sturdier than wire shelving.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_190zrk,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/190zrk/closet_system_i_built_for_140_xpost_from_rdiy/,

Although I've been on reddit awhile, I've never posted anything before. BUT we're gearing up to remodel our basement and (feeling anxious about that process) I wanted to share this kitchen remodel we finished earlier this year.

Our home is a pretty small ranch: kitchen, living room, 2 bedrooms, 1 bath. We bought it on foreclosure and I don't think anything had ever been updated since it was built in the early 50s. The old kitchen had a side door which was just an appalling waste of usable space considering the front door was about 12 feet away diagonally.

My goal with the new layout was to maximize the usable space as much as possible, still leave room for a small table and chairs, and to brighten everything up since it was so dark before. I chose IKEA cabinets because they fit into our budget and had the sort of modernized-classic look that I wanted. 

My dad is an electrician-become-home-inspector and remodeled my entire childhood home himself (expert), I went to school for sculpture (intermediate), and I think my husband had never even painted a room when we bought the house (beginner).

I've got a copper water pipe for my mains in a house built in '55. 
my (good) clamp meter reads between 3 and 8 amps going thru the pipe, which has a ground clamp and a wire that goes to the ground bus of my breaker box. 

Most of the wiring in this house was done by me, I've got good workmanship, all boxes are grounded properly, no grounds used for power carrying. The remaining original wire is 12/2, no ground, the old fibery stuff. There isn't much left of it, i've ripped most of it out. It wasn't actually in bad shape tho, it was plastic jacketed wire with a fiber outer, and all the plastic i saw was okay. 

I'm trying to figure out what's going on here, here are the steps I've taken:

1) turn off breakers one by one. No single circuit contributes more than a quarter amp to the pipe.

2) turn off the mains power at the main breaker. The amperage thru the pipe drops to 2 amps still! Whowhatwherehow???

3) disconnect ground wire from water pipe and measure voltage drop between the ground bus and copper pipe: .06 volts. This doesn't mean there isn't another point elsewhere where the ground is tied to a water pipe - i'd bet there is, there's several places in the walls where grounds were improvised by tying wire to copper pipes. But i turned the main breaker off and still had 2 amps!

I'm fairly handy, but from what I've been able to learn, the pros have better equipment and better coatings, and they also actually know what they're doing with floor coatings unlike me, and I'm not opposed to spending the money to get it right. 

What I'm really trying to nail down is what material is best - of course, each installer lists theirs and explains why theirs is superior. So, without even naming all the different compounds, I'll ask which one you guys would choose.

It's a 13 year old floor, pretty good condition, just a few thin cracks in the concrete.

I do a lot of my own car work, so there will be cars supported on metal jackstands, heavy rolling equipment... not just floor jacks, but rolling 1000lb tool chests, etc and the occasional engine swap going on in there involving a metal-wheeled rolling shop crane to move engines around. In short, it needs to be more durable than the average residential garage.

I'm fine with a 4-figure cost, and it's looking like 2 grand is probably going to be about the minimum I'll be spending, but don't want to spend a lot of extra money unnecessarily for some product that's supposed to be much better and really isn't.

One month later I am now finding issues again.,24,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1j2fzi/had_a_flood_insurance_took_care_of_everything_one/,"Hello. Almost 2 months ago I woke up to water dripping on me. I got out of bed and found out it was dripping through the ceiling and seeping through the walls which I had then found out was caused due to a toilet tank in our attic breaking sometime earlier in the day. It overflowed for who knows how long (no longer than overnight) and gradually flooded to the second floor, then the first floor, and finally the basement.

As it was a flood we called up insurance and they came in and took care of everything, replacing walls and ceilings where needed. It took them about 4 weeks to do everything. Everything looked great when they finished. Signed off on the work a few days after the full completion. 

Fast forward to now. (which is about 3 to 4 weeks after signing off on the work) In one of the rooms in which they put up a new sheetrock ceiling, a ceiling long crack has appeared. Looks like it has appeared right where the seam was. 

Should this be happening to a brand new ceiling so quickly? I know it will crack eventually but this was way too quick. We're going to be giving the contractors a call tomorrow about it and see what will happen.

Very thin strands just twirling around in a small pile about an inch tall in a spot on the concrete.

From what I could tell, the concrete seemed pretty dry, though they did have a dehumidifier in the basement.

We found out that someone broke into the house some time ago and decided to steal all the copper pipes they could get their hands on, so maybe its some leftovers from that somehow?

I've got two ideas about this, its either some kind of mold, or lime being pushed up through the concrete.

Solved a 4yr old plumbing puzzle.,28,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1f48io/astounding_success_solved_a_4yr_old_plumbing/,"I own a duplex, the top half is being remodeled while I live in the bottom half.  The original plumber/homeowner who converted the duplex was a hack, and though the house has two water lines with two shutoffs, shutting off one unit meant you'd have either cold or hot water in the basement unit.  When the plumbing failed and flooded it was always a scramble to figure out which valve to run to.

With how convoluted the plumbing is I figured this problem would plague me until I got fed up and gutted the basement apartment, exposing the issues.  None of the many plumbers that have been through have ventured to try figuring it out.

Today, I just wanted to figure out how to shut off the water to the upstairs bathroom so I could plumb in the new shower.  After a few realizations (but I thought the hoses were on the upstairs bill!) we designed a chart, and shutting off one valve at a time and plotting OFF or ON for both hot and cold discovered that ALL the hot water for the basement runs from the upstairs line, and the basement master bathroom complete runs from upstairs water.  The downstairs line feeds the unused upstairs hot water tank and downstairs cold water, and had a few new Ts in to upstairs bathrooms from a previous plumber working on the upstairs remodel.  We switched those... Hm, the upstairs kitchen is still on this downstairs line... Figured out where to switch that and get the downstairs master bath swapped in instead.  We have it dialed down to one downstairs toilet still on the upstairs line, and it's pretty obvious where to patch that.

Thank goodness for snap on fittings, we were able to get the new pex worked in and try things without commitment. We didn't make any mistakes, fortunately, but with how many PVC 90s the original plumber used it was hard to find an open pipe run to clamp onto.  

Hope your Memorial Day weekend is as thrilling as mine, I couldn't be more elated!!

* It's because when someone has a monumentally stupid, insignificant problem that they could have solved with a little Googling, nobody makes fun of them. Instead, people offer helpful advice and solutions.

* It's because people **do** offer ideas and solutions. In most Internet forums, only a tiny fraction of people actually contribute. Comparing /r/DIY and /r/HomeImprovement and the subscriber numbers, the number of helpful responses here is *huge*.

* It's because when someone is attempting a project on the limits of their self-confessed abilities, they get realistic advice from experienced DIYer, contractors and professionals.

* It's because people make mistakes, and can accept that. I've seen a few times where a conversation basically went, ""You should do A."" ""Actually, that's a bad idea. I do this for a living, and doing A will cause problems in the long run. Do B instead."" ""Oh, I didn't know that! Thanks!"" Try finding *that* sort of maturity elsewhere on the Internet.

I'm planning on having the roof replaced soon (it is over twenty years old), so I was thinking of siding options to have it all done as one job (to hopefully save a small bit o' cash).

My options?

1) Re-side the house.  
2) Paint the existing shingles (and those gawd-awful green shutters).

*Siding options?*  I was thinking that since this is a high-ranch, perhaps (just in the front of the house) going with a stone veneer on the first level and some nice siding on the second level (and all other sides and levels of the house).  There's also a gorgeous sun room off of the back of the home.  Obviously, the cost of this would be high.

*Painting Options?*  I obviously know that siding is going to cost an arm and a leg (especially if we go with the stone in the front).  How much does a full house paint cost?  (I would do it myself, but I'd prefer this job to be done by a pro..I just finished painting the entire interior and I'm ready for someone else to pick up a brush).

Some neighborhood info:  The homes in this neighborhood are very well cared for.  Many still have the original shingles (built late 60's early 70's)...but many are going to newer looks on the exterior as well.

We stripped it to it's studs, and redid the whole thing.. foundation, windows, walls, heat, electric, plumbing, roof, etc. etc. Well, a few years down the road here, and we are debating, move.. or build on? we decided to build

 The bank is giving me 70,000 to get what needs to be done, however the caveat is that pretty much all the money we will put in has to increase the cost of the house the same amount. Here is the list:

-Finish exterior work that did not get completed from first project(flashing, mostly) (**2k**)

-Driveway, 50 feet long.. (concrete or blacktop, not sure) (**8k**)

-Replace dilapidated small back porch with a nice sized deck(**5k**). 

-Add 2nd story bedroom (hovering) addition, about 500-600 sq. foot with two walk in closets and direct door to existing half bath and balcony with stairs to back deck/porch(**20-30k**)

-Garage, two car, two story(**20k**)

That still leaves a 5k cushion depending on what the general contractor says or what surprises we may see.  


The question about the contractor I have is, When I call to get a quote and show up with the list, do I just say ""hey, this is my list, my max budget is 70k"" Or do I let them come in with the quote first, hoping that it is below my budget?

Proposed change: http://imgur.com/PZb94Ho

We have just bought a 100-year-old fixer-upper row-house. The top floor was always a separate apartment, and the only way to get there is by a door from the street that leads directly to a double-length staircase. Going downstairs and out into the street to get from one part of the house to another, as you can imagine, is a pain.

We want to combine it with the rest of the house by making a doorway in the stairway wall at the point where it's level with the 2nd floor of the rest of the house (see amateurish diagram). There is a single extra-deep stairstep there, probably because it's resting on the main floor beams.

My plan is to open the wall at that point. There's a corridor on the other side. A door would have to be wider than the depth of the stair (which is about 30cm / 1'), so it could also span the width of one additional step on either side.

We have no need for the stairs below this doorway (except for storage of bikes and stollers, accessible from the street). Therefore I figured I could build a platform on the stair side of the new door, so that when you stepped through you didn't face a drop. The platform could rest on the stairs below and possibly be anchored to the side walls if I can figure out where the studs are. There would be a waist-high vertical wall at the outer end so people didn't tumble down the gap to the stairs below.

A contractor checked into this and said it would not be a fire code issue since it doesn't change the number of exits from any given point, so long as the door had the same fire resistance rating as the wall. However, he proposed such a high price (almost $10,000) that I am thinking I should attempt it myself.

The DIY store sells doors prehung in frames for $150. Surely I can manage the other $9850 worth of work somehow. I know how to work with tools, I've hung drywall in another house with good results, but I haven't done anything like this before.

Two complications:

* The walls are made of reed and plaster (see photo above) which I have no experience with.
* The house has had some subsidence over the years and there are no 90° angles anywhere. We are planning to have the foundation reinforced but that will take a while and we really need the door ASAP.

We have a floorplan and and a fairly clear design plan.  Our home was built in 2006, and our basement is unfinished and pretty dry^*.  We live in Chicago.  I've been obsessed about proper insulation of the basement and am getting different answers from the contractors we are interviewing, and I'm wondering if I'm just obsessing too much over how the builders plan on insulating the basement.  I've never worked in construction and my knowledge is just what I've researched online (i.e. I know just enough to be dangerous and annoying).    
    




Here are the building techniques that have been presented to us:    

• Rigid foam glued to the concrete wall with 2x4 studs glued flat to the concrete wall in between.  The rationale was maximizing living space.    

• 2x4 stud framing up against the concrete wall with insulation batts in between    

• 2x4 stud framing 1 inch away from the concrete wall with insulation batts in between.    


    


None of these options are in line with what I have read on [This Old House](http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/video/0,,20332381,00.html) or [GreenBuildingAdvisor.com](http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/how-insulate-basement-wall) or other sites I have researched.  Nobody has brought up spray foam insulation.    



    

Am I just being obsessive/compulsive?  I really liked one contractor until he told me he would glue 2x4 studs right onto the concrete.  But, then again, I don't have experience in home building, and I don't want to be a dick and insist on a certain way of homebuilding when I don't really know what I'm talking about.  Please let me know what your experience has been and what your opinions are.      



    

^* On two occasions over 6.5 years with extremely heavy rain storms, in one specific area near the ashpit (the original builder put it there so there was the option to put in a fireplace later if we wanted) there has been at most one cup of water.  The water was thought to be due to accumulation of water in the chimney (wind blowing rain sideways putting water under the chimney cap) that eventually made its way out, which is why it wasn't much water and has only happened twice with heavy rain.  Our basement is otherwise well protected against water -- three sumps (one is the battery backup, one is for exterior drain tiles, the third is for interior drain tiles) and a generator.

I bet many people here have had to deal with at least one lath and plaster wall if they have older houses. Not only are the walls non-flat, but many conventional drywall anchors simply don't work.

I finally managed to find an anchor that works in lath and plaster -- it's called a [toggle bolt](http://0.tqn.com/d/homerepair/1/5/7/4/-/-/toggle_molly.jpg) ~~or molly~~! It's a bolt that screws into a pair of spring-loaded metal ""wings."" You drill a hole in the wall and insert the bolt into the hole. The wings fold up as it enters the hole, and then they spring out on the other side. When you tighten the bolt, it pulls the wings against the back of the laths, creating a securely anchored bolt.

I went through several other options before the toggle type finally worked. First I tried those self-drilling [screw-in plastic](http://www.lemurzone.com/rfg/wp-content/uploads/walldriller.jpg) drywall anchors. They don't work because they can't penetrate the lath boards behind the plaster. DO NOT use the self-drilling plastic drywall anchors in lath and plaster!

I tried the plastic insert with wings [like this](http://www.fastenal.com/web/products/details/50953;jsessionid=sl9SRfnfcXyPXrHxk9Sf9MG80gM2hmG9vXqVVgPRj5zWYB2xQ72p!2073979413!414423269). It's a plastic version of the toggle bolt. You drill a hole, fold up the plastic piece, and push it into the hole. The wings are supposed to expand as you screw into it. But I couldn't get the plastic piece into the hole that I drilled! The plastic catches on the wooden lath and refuses to go through even with a hammer (it flexes instead) or when guided with little screw drivers (no good). I tried expanding the hole a little bit and then the whole thing just fell into the wall. DO NOT use the plastic toggle bolts in lath and plaster!

Drop an extra dollar and get the **metal toggle anchors**! It would have saved me a huge pain in the ass.

The hot water is flowing to all other fixtures in the house, including the sink in that same bathroom.


The shower has a handle like this:

http://i.imgur.com/KWULM2L.jpg

Where the down position is off, then it goes to cold, and near the top it is supposed to be on hot.
When I turn the handle to cold, the flow is fine and it sounds good.  When I turn the handle to the hot area, the flow slows to a drip, and there is a sound in the wall like the water is being obstructed somehow.

I took apart the handle, hoping that the obstruction was in there, but it did not turn out that way.  This is the piece that connects the handle to the water pipes:

http://i.imgur.com/YaF4w37.jpg

In the hole on the right (hot water), I noticed some metal debris, which I removed.  It looked like some kind of shred of metal ore of some sort, or shreds of copper pipe.


The plastic valve that goes into that piece looks like this:

http://i.imgur.com/nZO9rnG.jpg

I took apart the plastic valve and saw that the metal debris was in the valve also (on the hot side).  I removed as much as I could and replaced the valve and handle, but the same problem still existed (no hot water flow, and noisy pipes when hot was selected).


I then removed the plastic valve piece and reversed it, so the opposite side was now on hot (the previously cold side), but the problem was not changed.


This leads me to believe that the problem is not in the valve or the handle, but farther in the pipes than that.


Is it possible that there is more of this metal debris in the pipe and it is obstructing the hot water flow?  Could it be something else?


I don't want to break apart the tile on the shower to get to the pipes, but if I need to, I can probably come in from the backside through a closetr.


Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit: FIXED!!** I flushed out my water heater and nothing came out except water, so I flushed out the pipes a few more times, and then replaced the shower's valve cartridge.  The valve was definitely the problem, because it immediately started working once I replaced the valve cartridge.  Thank you all for the help.

My first thought was mold, but when I read up on it it seemed like mold is unlikely to grow on concrete walls.  Now I think it may be efflorescence but I'm not sure how to eliminate the moisture problem that is causing it to grow.  I have had a dehumidifier running down there for a couple of years and I have to empty it about every other day and it fills up more when it rains.

I have measured how far the affected area spread out on the basement wall and it is almost the exact same length of a small pond that is outside.  The pond is about a foot and a half away from the exterior of the basement wall.  I am not sure if this is a coincidence or not because the basement wall did not start to have a growth on it until a couple years after the pond was put in.  I would hate to fully get rid of the pond as I would just be trying to eliminate things that could be the problem when I'm not sure what is really causing the growth.

I am thinking of taking out the rocks that are around the pond and putting in dirt and plants to try and soak up more rainwater and moisture from the ground.  Do you think this would help or does the pond seem to be the main source of moisture? There is also a porch to the right of the pond that I was thinking of putting a side gutter on to help stop rain from just dropping straight down on the rocks below it.  Does anyone have any ideas or thought on this?  I really appreciate it, I just don't know what to do about it!

The breaker box is small and doesn't have room for any new breakers to be installed.  I contacted an electrician to give me an estimate on replacing the electrical box with the goal of getting the appliances, lights, etc onto their own breaker.

Is there anything else I should do while replacing the breaker box?  Is there an easier way to fix this?  I'm tired of waking up to cold showers because my hot water heater blew the breaker!

The smaller box on the right holds the breakers for the furnace and AC.  The 100amp breaker on the top left controls most everything.  A house I was looking at before this one had a similar setup that I was told isn't up to code; I'm guessing this isn't either.  


Edit 2:  We discovered a lock on the electrical meter, so I'll have to pull permits before I can get any work done.  

Both electricians that looked at it said the 100amp breaker was the main, and I was able to map out some of the appliances on other ones.  This is great news for me, as I kept wondering if my house would burn down while I was away.  We did discover the wrong size wire running from the main, so I'll get a new box eventually.

First I have to clear tree branches from over the line running into the house, then get the electric company to survey the box since there may not be enough clearance between the deck and the incoming wire.

When I first moved in, the existing chain link fence was falling over in many places, and was actually grown into a few trees along the property line.  It took me two months to clean the area up enough to put in a brand new privacy fence.  

The problem is, we have a large tree that is directly on the property line between my house and the house next door (which was vacant when we moved in).  I was unable to come up with any solution other than to build the fence around the tree, since one of the problems was getting the auger to dig through the giant roots, which after a few days of trying, was clearly not possible.  

What I ended up doing was giving up about 6 inches of my property line from the back fence all the way up to the front of the house, but taking a good 2 feet of the adjacent property where I went around the tree.  

About a month ago, a man bought the house and commented that he really liked the fence so far and he had no problem with the location of the posts because it was going to make his yard look better (he was renovating the house at the time because it was a foreclosure).  He was cool with everything, but later told me he was not sure if he was going to live in the house or just flip it.  

Well, yesterday I saw a for sale sign on the home, and there were 15 scheduled showings today.  The fence will not be completed until next weekend, so I am worried that the house will sell before then and the new owners will have a problem with the fence location.  I called the real estate agent who is selling the home and found out that the fence situation is listed in the seller's disclosure, but I have no idea what it says exactly, or if that entitles me in any way to keep the fence where it is.  

Am I going to have a problem?  Has anyone else gone through a similar experience?  Does having this in the disclosure prevent the buyers from taking down the portion of the fence that encroaches their property?  If there is a problem, can someone please guide me in the right direction?  I want to keep peace with my neighbors, and I would want to resolve any issues they have, but do not know where to begin if a problem should arise.

****************
The main choice when it comes to washing machines is between front loaders and top loaders. Many people like top loaders because they don’t have to bend over and strain their backs to load and empty them. They are also considerably less expensive than front loaders. However, front loaders use considerably less energy and water to operate, reducing their cost of operation over a lifetime. If you want a top loader that is as energy efficient as a front loader, look at the newer, top of the line top load washers. They are pricy, but they offer the best of both worlds.

You should also look for a washer that heats only the water that it needs to run, instead of the entire water heater tank. Also, a fast spin cycle removes more water from the clothes, reducing drying time, so look for a machine with 900 rpm or more. A pedestal for your washer is a nice feature, too. It gives you storage space under the machine and raises the washer so that you don’t have to bend over to get clothes out.

Refrigerator
****************
When you are buying a new refrigerator, you have to choose between a side-by-side model, a top freezer, or a bottom freezer. Side-by-sides are the most fashionable and expensive choice, equipped with two full height doors. A top freezer is the least expensive and the most efficient in terms of space and energy. Bottom freezers are mid-priced. The main appeal of a bottom freezer is that the refrigerator contents are located at eye level, so you don’t have to bend over to see what’s in the fridge.

When choosing a refrigerator, consider the size. 18 cubic feet is usually large enough for a family of four. Also look for shelves that are adjustable to accommodate large items; some are even motorized. If you choose a model with a water dispenser, look for one that has a built in water filter.

Dishwasher
****************
Dishwashers can vary greatly in price, from $200 all the way up to $2,000. While you don’t have to pay top dollar, this isn’t the place to skimp, either. A $200 dishwasher likely won’t get your dishes very clean, and you’ll end up washing dishes by hand or replacing your new dishwasher pretty quickly. A standard sized dishwasher will hold 12 place settings; if you have a big family or find that you run your dishwasher very often, consider upgrading to a larger tub. Features to look for in a dishwasher include adjustable racks and cycles designated specifically for sanitizing, cleaning delicate glassware, or short cycles.

Stove
****************
The big decision is gas versus electric when you are buying a new stove. The current setup of your kitchen can be the deciding factor, unless you want a gas stove badly enough to run a new gas line. Gas is appealing because you control the flame, while electric heats more quickly. You can even get a dual model that offers both gas and electric. If you want to go high-tech, look for convection and steam capabilities and warming drawers.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_1d2aw5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1d2aw5/the_steps_that_i_do_when_im_planning_to_buy_an/,

Help?,23,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1cglfd/landscaping_questions_on_a_postage_stamp_backyard/,"Hi everyone, hopefully this is the right subreddit.  I'm looking to possibly do a bit of DIY landscaping on part of my backyard.  The general info:

Live in a townhouse, so the backyard is postage stamp size. It's been fenced in by the previous owners. The land is slightly sloped down, away from the house. My neighbor's house is at a higher elevation. I've a deck and a small patio under it. Because my neighbor has the elevated land, ~6'x7' patch next to my patio/deck has around a 30˚ slope. 

SO, the main problem is water runoff. That problematic area is causing rocks/silt/grave/whole 9 yards to run off. A portion is running onto my patio. We tried to plant some pachysandras, but they haven't been doing well. (erm, I may have mowed over them last year....)  The ground nearest my neighbor is also starting to cave a little due to lack of structural support from plant roots.

I live in the 'burbs on the East Coast, so I get the standard 4 seasons with relatively hot summers and milder winters.

The questions: Should I stick to planting more water-loving plants to prevent runoff/drainage? (I don't know which terminology fits best)  

Can I build a few small plantars/terraces to eliminate this problem? I was thinking something built with wood rather than stone, but I'm open for any ideas.  Something like a plantar/level, with 4 levels, each at a slightly lower grade than the other.  *I think this would look nicer personally*

If plantar/terracing is an option, can you give advice on how to go about doing this? Am a complete newb to this kind of thing. Links would be great :) Theoretically I'd assume putting a drainage pipe thing underneath the plantar/terracing so that any excess water could drain away from the house would also be optional.

I'd prefer DIY methods since I've got the time right now.

We recently moved and need to install a fence around our yard. We already checked with the city and zoning/etc won't be an issue. 

My wife in in charge of this, she is very picky about the fence she wants. 

In an ideal world she wants a two foot stone wall with a  two foot white picket fence on top. Since we know we can not afford this we are looking at doing the most public facing side of the fence in stone and the rest will be a matching four foot tall picket fence. 

**Price:**
We already got a price from one person, waiting on another two - $25k for the stone! #$^&amp;!! and with out the stone all wood picket only $6k. I understand the stone is expensive but something just doesn't seem right. 

**Neighbors:** 
We are on a corner, so we have a neighbor behind us and on one side. The neighbor behind us has an older but still in good shape wood fence (about 5 ft tall). Some pickets are broken and it only travels about 50% of the yard. Is it reasonable to ask them if we can replace their fence? Or should we just put ours up in front of it?

The other neighbors have two different fences. One they got to keep their dog in (same reason as us) that travels about 15 feet back, then it changes to a slotted woof fence for another 15 feet. They were installed at different times. I'm not sure how to approach this. 

**Fence:**
Lastly, I already described the fence we want above. I have a feeling my wife will need to live with out the stone. I did suggest we do random stone pillars (on either side of gates and corners) - who knows. 

The fence guy suggested white stain instead of paint. I never heard of this. It makes sense as paint is a hassle with upkeep. But white stain? He told us we couldn't tell the difference and just patch as needed. Seems to good to be true.

(long, noise reduction, subflooring, joists)",23,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1700mn/pulling_up_a_floor_in_need_of_recommendations/,"I've got a 110 year old house, and live on the third floor. A flooring guy I  trust verified my assessment of the third floor's floor as 'crappy'. It's tongue-and-groove pine, dented, squeaky, and with a bit of give here and there. It's nailed directly to the floor joists.

My bigger problem is sound transfer from the apartment beneath the floor, though. My plan to reduce noise was:

1. remove several floorboards (bad ones, when possible)
2. blow dense cellulose between floor joists
3. replace floorboards
4. (if still too loud) green glue + sheetrock against plaster ceilings below
5. (if still too loud) padding + carpet in affected rooms

I figured that that should be more than enough. The plan was immediately interrupted when I pulled up some boards and found live knob-and-tube sitting under them, meaning some idiot spliced the romex running everwhere else to it someplace. I can't put insulation against live knob and tube, so I'm stuck.

My current plan has changed to me pulling up floor in sections, removing/replacing knob-and-tube as I go, filling 'safe' spaces between joists with cellulose as I do. This brings me to my actual question (finally).

**What should I put down after all this?** (Do I need a new subfloor, or does option 2, below, cover me?)

**Option 1**: I could screw the existing floorboards back in place, worse for wear as they will no doubt be. Put a lot of wood putty in the gaps where I've been forced to break tongues.

**Option 2**: I could buy some nice hardwood plywood, put that glues/nailed down either as sheets or wide planks, and have them as flooring. I'd seal them with something and call it a day. (I'd get plywood the same thickness as the floorboards so I don't have to fuss with door heights and molding changes.) In 5 or so years this will end up becoming a subfloor as major renovations are planned. Will 3/4"" thick, 1' wide, 4'-8' long hardwood plywood planks meet most subfloor code requirements? Would I want to fill the gaps between planks/sheets with something, as there won't be any tongue/groove interface to block airflow or spilled liquid?

**Option 3**: I could put down cheap OSB plywood, then cover it with either nice plywood or existing floorboards. This would obviously raise the floor a good amount. 

**Option 4**: Put my head in the sand. Put the floorboards back. Throw down some thick padding and carpet and hope that quiets things down enough.

**Things to keep in mind**: My fiancee HATES carpet but will willing to live with it for a few years grudgingly. We've got two cats. Hearing speech through my floor puts my teeth on edge, so just 'getting used to it' isn't really an option. I'm not trying to build a sound recording studio here, and I know completely eliminating noise is not practical; I'm just trying to control it.

**BONUS QUESTION**:

Since I'm going to be down there, what should I be on the lookout for? Any tell-tale signs of floor joists that should be reinforced or replaced?

The baseboards and door have some minor damage and were very poorly painted by a previous owner so they'll have to be sanded and repaired. In short if I choose to keep the walls I'll have to pull down several layers of paint and paper, repair and smooth the walls, repair the baseboards and window/door frames.

The other option is to tear down the plaster and replace it with dry wall. The main advantages to this are that overall, drywall is a better material(I realize that this is subject to debate) and much easier to work with. I would be able to replace the baseboards and give the house the exact look that I want. The house really needs to be rewired and tearing the walls down to the studs would make that a much easier task. It would probably be quicker and the end result will be nicer looking and easier to maintain. The cons being, it will cost more in materials and be very messy. Also, I feel like there is more risk in tearing down the walls then there is with simple repairing the existing walls.

I was hoping that /r/homeimprovment could weigh in. I'm especially interested in how messy/difficult tearing down a plaster wall is and the difficulty/cost involved with putting up dry wall. The bedroom is on the second floor so all the plaster and lathe will have to be brought down to ground level and disposed of. Thanks!

Sears's customer service is useless.,23,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1e2rct/how_can_i_reprogram_my_garage_door_opener_keypad/,"There is literally nothing in my garage door opener manual about setting/changing my keypad code (it acknowledges that the keypad exists, but there's nothing on how to actually use it), and Sears's customer service is useless. I spent 35 minutes talking to 5 different people who all told me that they could do nothing but schedule a technician to come out to look at ""the problem"". There is no problem, of course, I just want to know how to USE the thing, but I was told that there was no one I could call that knew anything about any of their products.

Anyway, I have a Sears/Craftstman grage door opener, model number 139.53638SRT 1/2HP. The keypad only has buttons 0-9 (no enter button), and the opener itself has two dials and a single green button. I've tried a number of things that I thought might work, but alas, they did not.

Can anyone help me out?

EDIT: Here are some photos of the unit: http://imgur.com/a/TtSil

EDIT 2: The keypad model is 31D302A: http://imgur.com/a/six2a

I googled the keypad model, and I've found a few things that don't match what I'm seeing:

1. People are saying I need to flip the console over and flip a switch to ""program"", but as you can see from the second pic in the second album, there is no switch on the back of the console.
2. I'm also reading that I need to pic a 6 digit code that ends in 0. The existing code still works, is only 4 digits, and doesn't end in 0.
3. Supposedly the ""light on the keypad"" will flash when I've set the code properly, but the keypad has no light.

SOLUTION: I had to open the front plate of the button that the keypad is wired to. I then flipped the switch inside, typed in my new code, and flipped the switch back, and my new code was programmed.

Finding few specifications.  Are there resources I'm not finding that I should use?**

Did a quick search to try and make sure I wasn't re-posting an earlier question.  Found a similar question about a driveway application, but did not really see the context or answer that seemed to match my application.  But if I've overlooked something feel free to redirect me to that post.

That said...

Home is built on a corner at the peak of a gentle slope increasing to probably something similar to a 12/12 grade where it meets the north sidewalk.

Previous owner put a hedge at the peak and covered the slope with light rip/rap and ivy.

Basically I want to put a retaining wall on the north property bordering the sidewalk getting rid of the ivy and providing a better foundation for some fencing that will be replaced in the next phase.

Have not done the actual measurements yet, but expect this wall to need to be 3.5 to 4.5 feet high at it's highest point.

So much of the DIY materials are that ""stack-able-stone"".

Assuming ""stack-able-stone"" also means ""mortar-less""...

Is that the right material for this application?

It seems possible to me that these were meant for ""lighter"" applications and that the weight of the yard behind the wall could be a problem.

The Lowe's clerk did point out some Loctite caulk that looks to me was more intended for the capstone application than strength/reinforcement.

I have been looking for some type of guidance on how to evaluate, design this wall based on the expected ""load"" of the yard ""retained.""

This Spring/Summer is ""deck time"" so I'm looking for some help on improving my deck.

I'm not a very good DIY'er so I'm more than likely going to hire someone to help/do the work if it's overly complicated. I'm just looking for some general advice so I have some basic knowledge if I have to hire someone to help me, or if it's easy enough for me to do.

Just some background, My house was built in 2007, with the deck. I don't believe the original owners ever took care of it since they were only in the house for a year, then the house sat empty until I purchased it in 2011. I've attached some pictures I have some questions about.

[Here are the images with questions below](http://imgur.com/a/6k0MI)

* In the first picture is one plank of wood on the deck. It's kind of hard to tell(it recently rained) that there is a knot on the middle plank that seems to be separating. The planks are 2x4's and it still seems pretty sturdy. Will this board have to be replaced or can it be repaired? It is the only one with this problem.

* In the second picture shows the general state of the finish, or lack there off. The top section is covered so as you can tell there is a little bit of remnants of the original stain. The bottom section is uncovered(As is the majority of the deck) and you can see its pretty much bare and has slight mold. There are a few mold spots like this other than that is mostly just bare wood.

* The third picture is the railing. For the most part the railing looks good, but the top pieces of wood on the railing seems to have been left to the elements too long and seems to be warped. Can I just replace that top pieces or does all the railing need to be redone?

* The final picture is just showing where the deck meets one of the support post. The plank in picture one is tucked under one of these supports so if I have to remove it I assume I'll have to somehow get it out from under it?


When I originally moved into the house I had an inspector come out and he said structurally the deck was built to the code in 2007, and that I just have to put up some brackets for the rails to get it up to the current code. Other than that he said it just needed some TLC and it should be ok. I'm just looking to get the deck back into shape and would appreciate any advice you all have. Also if you live in the Athens/Atlanta region and know a good person to contact, that'd be great also!

I am currently in the midst of a kitchen renovation and have the walls exposed to the studs.  I have got all of my overhead and pendant lighting wired up, but I'm having a bit of trouble with the undercabinet LED strips.  

I purchased [this LED strip off of Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/Lighting-EVER-Strips-Ribbon-Cabinet/dp/B004JRNNKY/ref=cm_rdp_product)  I'm using [this transformer.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJ3T8G/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A325274ZEF9XYZ)  And to further complicate matters, I'm going to tie in [this dimmer.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X4O1NG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=AAF37WJS3P6BT)

I went with this method of under cabinet lighting after doing quite a bit of research.  The pucks, strips, and other forms were just too costly.   Instead of $200+, I can use the above for less than $50 and have everything I want.  Hopefully..

I do not have the lights yet, but my drywall is being hung on Monday.  The plan is to have a lightswitch next to the sink to turn the LEDs off and on, and have the dimmer in the kitchen anywhere to control as necessary.  I am wondering a few things:
*What gauge wire should I get to run the non LED lengths across my sink and across the oven/range? 
*How would I wire it so I can control everything with a light switch next to the sink, but have the transformer and dimmer in a more hidden area under a cabinet?  Should I run my 12/2 through the studs and have it come out behind or above the cabinet?  
*Any ideas on how to wire it so the transformer and dimmer control three separate strands?

I'm using solderless connections on this.  Please illuminate me on the best way to do this.  Thanks again /r/HomeImprovement, I couldn't do this renovation without you!  And of course, I am taking pictures and will put up an overall kitchen reno post when done.

Cons - Increase in money spent on yard upkeep, water bill and maintenance.

Electrical Service Update - 1955 Ranch with two 50 amp services in a closet to a 200-400 amp outdoors (code) service . Luckily no aluminum wires in the house. Quotes range from 2400-3500 including adding 6 GFCI plugs, proper 220 plug and 3 outdoor sockets. 200 amp is about a grand less but I want to future proof.

Pros - Will future proof for any remodels. House is incredibly dim and needs complete redo of lighting.
Cons - No curb appeal, sets us up for future projects that may or may not happen.

Kitchen Remodel - Completely original 1955 kitchen counter top, oven, range and sink. While we are retro lovers, the kitchen and the bathrooms need to be made modern for both us and future buyers. Cabinets are in good shape, need to be stripped and painted, can sell oven (folks collect them) and do a oven/range combo to save space. Already did the floor.

Pros - Little investment for big return. Will have huge impact on interior of house and give a more refined feeling for the  home. Plus im the cook and it will make my life better.
Cons - We need to completely redo ceiling in the kitchen. Worried that adding recessed lighting (there is none currently) will push us over what our weak-ass 100 amp service can handle. Moving the oven to where the range is will create more space but also means that we need to do the counter top/range/oven move all at the same time.

We aren't looking to sell at any time in the near future but want to make sure we focus on making quality upgrades that increase overall equity in the home.

I am leaning sprinkler system since this has the biggest immediate impact but then again you can almost never go wrong with kitchen work.

Other things that need to be done

New Roof (come on hail storm!)
New Windows
Paint
Front porch remodel
Fence strip and paint
Bathrooms/Closet Remodel
Painting
Security Lighting
Garage redrywall (water damage)

**This is going to be a very long winded post, so that I can hopefully get all my thoughts and points across clearly.**

I posted in this sub a few weeks back seeking some advice and opinions on [gable fans](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1hdo7o/need_advice_on_automatic_gable_fans/). Someone recommend that I should just install new windows instead.... Having 20+ year old original construction aluminum dual pane windows, this is a good idea. So here I am a few weeks later after doing some research and I think I'm going to do just that. In the spirit of saving money and learning new skills, I absolutely want to do this myself.

However I'm a bit confused on a few of the particulars and I'm hoping the hivemind can help fill those gaps! 

There seems to be a real lack of comprehensive how-to's for window installation online... for whatever reason. I've watched countless videos on YouTube and have read a few terrible articles on various sites and bought the Black &amp; Decker book from Amazon on windows and doors (which only covers DIY installation briefly). The consensus seems to be that the details of window installation (New construction or replacement) seems to be that it varies greatly by project. Depending on your window style, home construction style, outside siding/brick/etc... Some windows are installed from the inside of the home, requiring you to removing the inside trim. While other windows are installed from the outside and I'm unsure which I need or should get.

**Point of confusion #1**
&gt;My house has T1-11 siding and getting access to the windows nail strips is very easy. [Here is what it looks like with my trim removed](http://imgur.com/JRqUZQK). I'm uncertain if I should go for new construction windows or replacement windows.
 My understanding is that replacement windows will not require me to remove the existing aluminum frame or nail strip, only the window sash (sliding part). The replacement windows style will sit on top of the original aluminum frame? New construction style windows would require me to remove some siding (or cut it off) and attach the windows via new nail strips directly to the studs/rough opening underneath. Is this a correct understanding of the two?
([Second view of trim removed](http://i.imgur.com/tXHfcum.jpg))

**Point of confusion #2**
&gt; Depending on the consensus of the above question, which do people feel would be the best / easiest route to go for my house? I'd rather not have to remove the [inside trim](http://i.imgur.com/CYh7XGa) if it can be avoided ([Second view](http://i.imgur.com/YgW8o5F.jpg)).

**Point of confusion #3**
&gt; How and where to buy DIY replacement windows. I've found an online shop that caters to DIYers called the [WindoweStore](http://www.windowestore.com) but I've not been able to find much feedback about them anywhere. Anyone have any experience with them or have a recommendation on where to order? Overall it sounds like the ""big"" name brands are typically overpriced for what you get and I'd rather avoid the cheaper windows you can get from Home Depot, etc.

So I have more questions, but I will hold off on those until I get feedback from these. Depending on the consensus it might answer or eliminate the need to know the other questions I have.

I'm also going to x-post this to /r/DIY, so don't be surprised if you see this post twice!

Thank you very much!

1373990650.0,18,self.HomeImprovement,1if52w,"High Ranch with Central AC, can't seem to get indoor humidity down",22,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1if52w/high_ranch_with_central_ac_cant_seem_to_get/,"I recently bought a high ranch....for those of you who don't know what a high ranch is, it's basically a two story home with no basement.  The bottom floors rests on a slab and is sometimes half under grade (ours has the bottom level at grade, not under...so it's all above ground).

Anyway, the home has central air conditioning.  But only on the top floor.  The bottom floor is not air conditioned (yes, the one that rests on the slab).

During the day, I set the Central AC to 77° and at night I set it to 75°.  Based on my energy report for the last week, it runs an average of 7 hours a day.  (It usually only runs around an hour or two during the night and then comes on around noon-ish when the house warms up to 78°.   It then generally is running an hour on / hour off except on really hot days when it runs a couple hours on and then an hour off or so.  

A bit more detailed: on really hot days (90's), it runs as much as 10-12 hours in a 24 hour period.  Moderately hot days (80's) it runs anywhere from 3- 7 hours in a 24 hour period.

The problem is getting my indoor humidity levels down.  I have a Nest thermostat that I installed a week ago and can monitor the humidity levels at any time.  I've noticed that during the day, even with the AC on, the humidity levels only go down to  around high 50's / low 60's (that's upstairs where we have AC).  At night, it has only goes down into the mid 50's.  (Mind you, I've only been tracking this for a week and it's been pretty hot).  Obviously, indoor humidity that high has me worried about mildew / mold, etc...

Now, downstairs, we don't have any type of cooling.  It stays pretty naturally cool, we use a fan if it gets uncomfortable.  Off of the downstairs room, we also have the hot water heater and boiler in an enclosed room.  I have not measured the humidity levels down there...but I'm sure it is higher then upstairs because of the lack of cooling.

So here's my question.  Since the lower level is not conditioned,  could it / is it effecting my upstairs humidity levels?  The two floors are connected by an wide open staircase.

Or is my AC not running enough to lower the humidity?  I've read that lowering the temperature won't help in lowering the humidity and can actually make it higher (and just give us higher electric bills).

Before I call in an AC tech (during the biggest heatwave of the summer...good luck getting one here anytime soon), is it a good idea to just throw a dehumidifier down there and see if that fixes the issue?  Between the AC tech or buying a dehumidifier it'll most likely even-out cash-wise.  

Weird thing is that it really doesn't really feel humid inside.  But, I've confirmed the humidity levels within a few points with a separate monitor (it measured a couple points lower).

Once per year, I host a LAN Party in my basement.   For those not familiar with LAN Parties, I have 12-18 people come over for 5 days, with their computers, and we play video games (among other things).   Having 18 computers set up in your basement, plus 18 people, generates a lot of heat.

I've had a lot of problems dealing with this, and am hoping to get a better plan in for this year.    First, let me provide some details.

[This link](http://i.imgur.com/OahBSV4.jpg) provides a top-down view of the layout.   Note that [the windows](http://i.imgur.com/PgcfmAb.jpg) are accessed through the ceiling, built in behind some drywall, so the access to them is limited (about an 8"" x 24"" rectangle in the ceiling of the basement)

Last year I installed additional ventilation ducts (green circles on the diagram) with the intent on using the central air conditioning to cool the basement.  This worked great on the first day, but since the party is in late October, the next 4 days were cooler outside, and my central air unit won't come on if the ambient temperature outside is too cool.    As a result, I need a plan to cool the basement with the outside air if it is too cold for the air conditioner to operate.

I have an idea, and wanted to get feedback or new ideas from all of you.

Use a large box fan, outside, at the [bottom left window](http://i.imgur.com/O29sCnp.jpg).  Build some kind of box &amp; tarp construct to direct the air into the window, so that air is only going in at that point.  (ie, the box fan is 2' x 2', but the window is about 1' x 2', so i need something to refocus the air so it all goes in the window).

Put smaller square fans inside the [other window](http://i.imgur.com/PgcfmAb.jpg) to push air out, resulting in airflow from one side of the room to the other.  Use a couple fans inside the room to support the flow of air towards the ""exit"" window.

Note that the 2nd window, where i'm suggesting we push air out, is not accessible from the outside (it's blocked by a wooden deck).

What are your thoughts?  Is there a better way that I could do this?  ",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_1gsyc7,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1gsyc7/temporary_cooling_for_a_basement/,

We have had a lot of rain recently, and there is some water infiltration.

I have a flat roof, tar, where the slope leads to a drain in the middle. Water falls through a pipe all the way through the house into sewer system below.

It is a 1 story home plus a basement.

There was no pooling when i checked the roof during the inspection, roof seemed to be in good shape. Only thing we noticed was that the chimney mortar needed some patching.

Now, for the problems...
Due to heavy rainfall, i noticed some water falling from the ceiling, bubbling underneath the paint, creating a vein down the wall.

In the basement, next to the pipe from the roof drain (which is surrounded with wood to hide the pipe) water is soaking the unfinished ceiling wood, and dripping on the concrete floor into the drain.

There is also minor leakage on the main floor adjacent to the drainage pipe.

My theory is that the drainage entry point on the roof may not be completely sealed, allowing water to not only go into the drain, but around it as well. I think water may be dripping along the outside of the drainage pipe, so that some water end up on the ceilings and floor.

I will be investigating further and having a closer look at the roof when it stops raining. I am thinking of applying sealant around the drain to test if my theory is correct.

Has anyone ever experienced water infiltration like this with a similar roof type? Any other theories? What steps should i take to diagnose and eventually fix this problem?

Notice the discoloration the the left of the paint damage. The drainage pipe pipe is further to the left leading me to believe water is slowly flowing down and meeting a wall before accumulating and causing the damage.

More water dripping down from basement ceiling. This is where most of the water is dripping. Again, this is slightly off from the drainage pipe, i think that whenever the pipe contacts a ceiling/floor, water dripping down along the outside of the pipe soaks in the ceiling/flooring. Water here drips on floor and into a drain in basement floor.

The pipe hidden by a wooden column. The edges of the wood here feels damp again leading me to believe water sliding down the outside of the pipe all the way from the roof. The pipe is right next to the wet ceiling in the previous pic.

Just need some opinions - if this is the wrong place please let me know.

My fiance and I are first-time home-buyers and we are really on the fence (no pun intended) about a house we think we want. Location is very important to us, and this particular house is very well-located, centrally in a neighborhood that is very up-and-coming. We love a lot of things about the house (large kitchen, storage, two covered patios, great yard size, historic home, etc), but we ran into two major road blocks.

1. The house is a short-sale.
2. There is termite damage and a live infestation that has gone untreated.

It becomes further complicated by the fact that the siding of the house, where there is some minor damage by wood fungus, is - you guessed it - ASBESTOS siding! 

I know that seems like a really easy choice, but in our area there's not a lot we can get in our price range, and with the original wood floors in good condition as well as the house having all of the things we need, it's so hard to say no.

If anyone is curious to see more, I can PM the last WDO report and photos of the house, even an address...I just need to know if you think it's worth it! We will do as much to improve the house ourselves as possible, but the asbestos and the termites are definitely not DIY so we're a bit nervous. Short-sale doesn't help.

(Xpost r/DIY),19,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1byiwq/help_request_what_would_you_do_with_this_floor/,"I've got an early 1900's house that I bought about 8 years ago. Upon moving in I did a bit of work to get the house livable by removing some horrendous carpet and painting. I'm now at the point (and several crappy roommates later) that my girlfriend is moving in and I want to do more than maintain the house. I'd like to remove the carpet and restore the covered hardwood to its former glory.

I started out today by just removing the carpet in the guest bedroom to see what I had to work with and DANG I had forgotten how terrible that wood looked (pic 1). On the plus side, it looks like the wood is decently thick at 3/4 of an inch so I can sand it to refinish it. There's several holes in the wood, odd cut marks around a huge section of missing hardwood that was replaced by plywood and massive gaps between some boards. All is shown in the notated pictures in the album.

Given the terrible shape that floor is in, what would you do? I'm very OK with the floor having a bit of a distressed look and would like to reuse the boards where possible. Is it worth my time to go out and buy around 20 sq. ft. of unfinished boards then pull up all the existing ones to mix and match the boards while filling in that plywood scar before refinishing the whole thing? Is it in such bad shape that I should just toss it all and start fresh?

Firstly, I couldnt find a sub-reddit relating to this subject so I decided to place my concerns and questions here in HomeImprovement. I hope you can help.

I live in a 50+ year old house with no cavity walls, so the cold outside reacts with the heat inside and quite often we would see moisture buildiung up on the inside of the windows etc.

We have had our damp proof course done recently (2 years ago) so Im not worried about that being the issue, and have had that confirmed recently. 

We've also recently had our first child, and it was only when we were baby proofing the house and moving furniture etc that the size of the problem became apparent! Its not confined to one side of the house as its happenning in most rooms.

It manifests as black circular damp patches along with a white kind of powdery looking stuff. 

This is what I have done to date:

1) Cleaned the walls with a mould remover 2) dryed the walls 3) set up an electric radiator to properly dry the wall and get air moving about the room 4) opened the windows, again to aid in getting the air moving 5) bought a dehumidifier (which is collecting a good bit of water)

What I dont understand, is how much of the above is necessary and in what order. Thinking of costs too ... I dont want to be running an electric radiator and dehumidifier if I dont need to. I was told that the heater helps get the air moving about the room and with the window open etc it will help.

Also taking all of the above into consideration and the fact that its happening in 3 rooms (pretty small house) Do I need to constantly do the above steps to treat each room and can I take it week about (only have 1 electric radator and 1 dehumidifier). 

Basically and help or advice or even confirmation that im doing the right things would be really appreciated. ",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_18awpa,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/18awpa/most_walls_have_black_white_mould_patches_new/,

I have an unfinished basement ( ~22' x ~40' ) that I would like to start work on in the near future.  Right now it is basically empty, with a chimney stack near the middle and three columns (spaced ~9' apart) running the long width of the room and holding up a long wooden support beam (actually two beams, that meet at the middle post)  I'd like to remove one of the supports (not the middle one, obviously).  This area will serve as a pool table and/or home theater spot.

What are my options?  I've read about the possibility of replacing one of the wood beams with steel, and then re-enforcing the footer of both the center post and whatever the wall needs.  So basically using a ~20' steel beam in place of one of the wood beams and spanning the whole 20' without a support post in the middle.

I've also seen mention of a ""C channel"" steal beam that could be used to re-enforce the existing wood beam, which is about the same thing but maybe cheaper than a full-replacement of the wood to steel beam.

[**This is the sketch he drew up**](http://i.imgur.com/fhI3qtU.jpg). Let me explain a bit of what's going on here. Please let me know what you think.

-----

He'll be anchoring the deck to the basement walls which are ARXX insulated concrete forms with double concrete lags, 24"" on center through 2x10s and 2x8s, and attaching the deck floor trusses with hangers.

The building code specifies a frost line depth of 48"", so he'll be auguring 12"" holes with sonotubes four feet deep, and mounting pressure treated 6x6 posts to them using anchors.

The height above grade on the left half of the deck is about 36"" and the height above grade on the right half of the deck is somewhere around 96"" - 100"".

Anchored to the 6x6 posts will be laminated support beams - three 2x10x12s on the left and two 2x8x15s on the right. They are directly anchored to the posts.

The floor trusses are 2x8x12s and 2x6x8s and extend beyond the laminated beams slightly. The decking will be applied horizontally.

-----

All this is shaping up to be a weekend project. We'll probably augur the holes on a Wednesday and fill the sonotubes either that day or Thursday, then finish the deck by Sunday afternoon. He'll be pulling the permit this week and then it's off to the lumber yard.

He has been working on it for almost 1 year, and said he spent over 100k renovating it. He is a cheap guy and will generally buy cheaper materials, so I'm shocked he spent so much. The rent prices for 1000sqft run from 2500-3500 a month or 30-40k a year in our location. We are not renting the basement.

He hires 2 uneducated, but cheap, grunt workers for a total of 240 a day(2 x 120) , or about 4.8k a month. He says the workers move slow because they want to earn as many days working as possible, and can be sloppy if you don't watch them (they work under the table) . so since it's been 10 months, about 50k of the 100k spent was in labor.


The unique characteristics of the renovation include:

* digging 1-2 feet deeper into the ground

* expanded a shed in back yeard 2 feet taller

* breaking though a wall to dig an entire room out under our porch (80 sqft area, digging 4ft down)

* 2 very small bathrooms

* moving the electric boxes and organizing the wires a bit better

* removing the previous work done (he tried to renovate it before 10 years ago but didn't get far)

* moving the water tanks to a new location, and replacing them (under warranty)

* split area into 4 rooms using drywall.

I'm looking at prices for contractors on reddit and they seem to run 20-40 per square feet. Digging is much more intensive, But even at double the rate (80), we should pay 80k for the renovation.

What do you guys think? I imagine since we had a big renovation, we would've been able to ask contractors to bid on our project?

I want to turn an abandoned property into a luxury hotel, BUT I don't have the funds to start this. My plan is to buy and renovate a base into a hotel almost entirely off of donations from people. I am looking at properties from missilebases.com. I see one that looks great for $995,000. This would get me a base that is already converted to home use. I would have to turn this into hotel use. There is another one that looks like it is in good condition for $430,000. The problem is this site is not renovated for living use. So, I would have to renovate the complex for hotel use. I imagine there would be a very high cost to renovate this.

Things to consider for renovations: -Asbestos, lead, radon, and mold abatement (if present) -dry walling -sound proofing (in between rooms) -add high speed internet access -add cell phone reception (by using purchased service extenders) -paint -add additional pluming and power -Note: I don't think I will need to make too many rooms as these properties are out of the way of major cities and would be more of a place to go as a ""thing to do"", rather than a place to stay for a road trip.

Questions: -What do you think it is going to cost (approx.) to get this hotel running (initially)? -Do you think it is a cool idea/worth it? -Would people come? -How do I get so many donations to cover the cost?

I will be painting the ceilings too, it is easier to spray than roll with a long handle?

What about renting one of the big ones that you hook right up to a 5 Gal. paint bucket?

We have a problem that has just started occurring a few days ago.  When we flush our master bedroom toilet, at the tail end of the cycle where the toilet is replenishing itself with water, we'll hear a sound which to us sounds like a fog-horn which will last about 4-6 seconds.

The sound tends to occur when the toilet hasn't been flushed in a while. If the sound occurs and we flush the toilet again soon after, it doesn't happen.


A few more clarifications:  

* We just moved into the house in Sept.  We live in North Houston.

* The house was built in 2006.

* The piping in the house is the type of method where they use poly pipe from a central manifold that feeds all the individual fixtures (sinks, toilets, etc).

* The main water supply feeds the manifold (cold water) and the water heater.  The water heater feeds the manifold (hot water) and then gets distributed throughout the house.

* The house is 1500 sf. single story.  The manifold is located in the garage thus making our toilet in question the furthest away from the manifold.  This shouldn't matter but I'll put it here just in case, the water heater is located in the attic above the living spaces.

Any suggestions, advice, or questions I could answer that will lead to plausible causes would be greatly appreciated.  And if there is another subreddit I should post to let me know as well.  Thanks you.

We figured there was probably a reason for that, and since the light worked, we didn't mess with it. On the working switch, there are two toggles. One never worked and one operated the ceiling light.

It currently has some sort of blown-in stuff in the attic floor, but nothing insulating the roof. Also, when we bought it we were surprised to find that it had NO attic ventilation whatsoever; no vented soffits, no ridge vent, no gable vents, nothing. We cut in a power gable vent as a stopgap measure last summer, but it's probably temporary.
The roof is getting replaced this spring; the old shingles are in pretty bad shape (possibly due to being cooked by the attic heat). The sheathing under the shingles is in fine shape; it was replaced with the last shingle job.

What's the right way to make this attic liveable? We're planning on steel shingles for the roof which should last 50 years. Should we put a layer of Tekfoil insulation between the roof and the new shingles? Should we PU foam the interior walls? Both? Would we need any other venting?

I have bathroom with a regular rectangular-shaped bathtub. The bathtub walls are about 30 cm high. I would like to transform it into a shower by adding a rotating glass door (something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/sgwQn.jpg).

The only problem is that our household has people over 190 cm, while the biggest glass door I could find is only 150 cm. Adding the height of the bathtub itself, it means that about 10 cm of a tall person's body will remain uncovered by the glass, which means that some water could still land on the bathroom floor. I was wondering if someone had this problem and successfully found a solution?

My current ideas:

1) Get a custom-made glass door. Seems to be potentially expensive.

2) Get two glass doors, cut one in half and install both. Seems like there would be a problem with cutting the glass in half.

3) Getting a second small piece of glass and attaching it above the regular door. Seems like the best solution, but I have no idea where to buy it.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_16ped3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/16ped3/installing_a_bathtub_glass_door_for_a_household/,

We have got the upstairs painted, carpeted and now it's time to tackle the basement. The walls downstairs are wood paneling over sheet rock. Originally, the plan was to just take down the wood paneling and and paint the drywall behind it. However, we quickly realized that the paneling was damaging large areas of the drywall and generally too much of a mess. Since, I have used drywall mud to fill in the grooves of the paneling and I believe I'm ready to paint. My question for you guys is this. Should I primer first then texture and paint? Or should I texture first, then primer then paint? I'm curious if the texture would hold to the smooth areas of the paneling. Also, I was concerned that if anything were to hit the wall it would just fall off. Are there pro's and con's to which way?

Next project our 100yr old house has chosen for us is the plumbing for the 2nd floor bathroom.

Water damage from the leak has already required removing the ceiling from the dining room immediately below.  So rather than attempt to work from the floor above, the most convenient access is from below.

Age of the home means we are replacing copper.  Right now my attitude is that the size of the repair afford replacing with copper over PVC or PEX.

The new joins are my question however...

Initially I began doing homework on solder.  Supplies, Lead v. Silver, torches, techniques, etc.

All along however I have been a bit intimidated by the torch.  In a more open environment the technique seems very straightforward and little to fear.  Between the 2nd floor beams in the ceiling however I am a bit concerned I have the room to correctly work the torch for the solder without a fire hazard to the surrounding wood work.

Then I began to run into lessons on compression fittings.  This seems a MUCH less hazardous approach and far more in tune with my current skills.  :-)

That led me to ""push-on"" fittings as well.

A few questions for the more experienced among us...

1. How much confidence can one have in compression fittings over solder in the long run?  Obviously I will leave the repair exposed for a little while to be able to assure no leaks come back, but once I close that ceiling up how certain can I be that months later the compression joins will not ""erode""?

2. Compression fittings or ""push on""?  Push on seems to be the far least complicated, however the compression fittings seem to allow someone to come back in and tighten a bit if necessary.  Can a compression ""leak"" and if so what then?

3. Copper, PVC, PVX?  My compulsion is to replace with copper to sort of protect the ""integrity"" of the home, but I also know I might be being a little overbearing on this point.  What are some opinions about repairing with PVX instead of copper?

Lastly I saw this...( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRteaB8Z0bA )

That seems a even more interesting solution, but does not appear my Lowes carries any tool similar.  I am suspecting this is a ""trade"" practice that isnt really available to ""do-it-yourself'ers""?

The areas in the photographs are the only areas where this is a problem. The actual concrete does not seem to be in bad shape from what I can tell.

This area gets a lot of moisture and was previously covered in ivy that climbed the walls. I recently ripped out the ivy completely. I plan to grade the area once the repair is made. 

A couple questions...
1. Am I right that this is actually stucco that is cracking and falling apart?

My main one is, given the state of my floor, what I need to do to prep the surface. Happily, I don't have any major cracks or holes to fill, but it does look like the floor was painted by a previous owner, and that there's signs of historical water seepage (though we haven't seen any seepage since we've moved into the house about 10 years ago). 

I've uploaded some pictures of what the floor looks like here:

I'm also trying to figure out whether I should use some kind of waterproofing sealant before I put down the epoxy product.

picture for reference - http://i.imgur.com/p1ejRNo.jpg

some details:  
house was built in 1914  
the concrete block in between the foundation supports was done after the supports were built  
driveway was poured approx. 3 months ago  
there used to be a approx. 12 in. wide planter running the length of the house that was filled with monkey grass

on the suggestion of the concrete guy we had him pull out the planter next to the house. his suggestion was that leaving it there would cause moisture problems for the driveway down the road. unfortunately when he pulled it out and then poured the driveway, the house and the new driveway don't 'meet'. you can see in the picture that due to the angle of the driveway it does start to meet as you go up the driveway. i'm at a loss though what to do with this one section where the two don't meet.

some suggestions i've thought of so far:  
1 - running a course of bricks from the corner of the house up the driveway and tapering it smaller as you go up. had a few brick guys look at it and they didn't seem too keen on trying that.   
2 - stuccoing the side of the house(just on the foundation of course) and running it all the way down to the driveway. aesthetically i just don't like this idea. i think it would look bad once it was done.   
3 - looking for a decorative, almost 1/4 round, brick 'moulding' that could be run up the length of the house. still on the fence about this one. don't know if such a thing exists or not.

The room had an over head light and I can see the wires coming out of the ceiling for the light. About 5 feet away there are 2 wires coming out of the ceiling between two studs that ran to a switch on the wall. I assume that these wires go to the ceiling light, but want to make sure.

Is there a way to send power through one end and see if it goes to the other end? (Currently there is no power to the house, I've been using a generator to plug in drills and saws).



EDIT - Thanks to CalumSult I realized that a significant amount of the wiring in the house is Knob and Tube, although a lot of it has been updated to newer wiring. Nonetheless, I've done some reading on K&amp;T and think that it's best that I either replace this stuff completely or get a professional in there to make any modifications to it. I don't know nearly enough to mess around with this stuff and have read that improper modifications to it can cause it to overheat and that a lot of insurance companies charge more for homes with it installed.

**

Hey DIYers. My wife and I finished remodelling our house this past winter, and we'll be turning our attention to the patio and garden this spring. I've talked her into letting me build a concrete ping pong table that will double as an outdoor dining space. 

I'm thinking along these lines:

http://www.2modern.com/modern-furniture/High-Tables-Consoles/James-DeWulf-Concrete-Ping-Pong-Table

http://hengetable.com/

http://concretetabletennis.com/

She and I are very handy (we've done everything in the house--wiring to siding; drywall to cabinet installation ourselves), but we don't know the first thing about concrete. Some of the designs above look pretty straight-forward.

What I'm asking you, DIY, is what am I not thinking of? Is this going to be exponentially more terrible than I'm expecting? Is there something obvious I'm missing?

*More Info*

I'm most worried about how to support the top. My wife wants it to be stylish (for her, after all, this is a table to serve dinner on), so I'm planning on making the top similar to how you would make a concrete counter top.

I'm not too worried about bounce. Concrete ping pong tables are, after all, a thing that exists. Not only that, but this is meant for casual fun. If it doesn't play exactly regulation, it's not a big deal.

Also, we will have room on our patio (brick pavers under a pergola) for the table, but I'm thinking about building it out in the grass so there is a lot of room to move around.

Also, is there any way to limit the weight of the top? It needs to be rigid, obviously, and while I don't plan on moving it a lot, it would be nice to have the option to disassemble and move if I needed to (to the next house, for example).

**Edit**

My wife is also starting to point out things along these lines:

Thanks for all the suggestions.

I tried flooding the showers and waiting to see any leaks but did not see any.

then a miraculous thing happend as I noticed the water dripping from the light fixture in the hallway outside the bathrooms.

Thinking I should not have water coming from my light fixtures I checked the pipes in the attic and there was a tiny pinhole in the copper pipe running through the ceiling that was running down the wall in between the bathrooms and then seeping through the wood and drywall.  Culprit found!

luckily it was a super easy place to fix the pipe, so 5 minutes later I cut out that section and replaced it with a new piece and It's all drying out now so I can see how much damaged stuff I'll need to replace.

I'm renovating my rental property and there is a water leak somewhere between the shared wall between the two bathrooms as evidence by moldy drywall on both sides of the wall.

Strip it to the studs and joists  

Strip the existing systems (furnace, AC, water heater, etc)  

Relocate the stairs for the 2nd floor (they're currently in the middle of the room, we'd like them on the side)  

Demolish the rear addition. Most of these homes were built without indoor plumbing, and the kitchen and upstairs bathrooms were added onto the back years later as poorly-constructed additions. We'd rather have more yard and less house.

Relocate the utilities from the addition to the main house.

Construct a new interior.

Possibly replace the front wall and facade, which are showing signs of buckling.

Before we even think of going down this road, we have to consider paying a mortgage plus paying our existing living situation for the time it will take to renovate.

My question is: How long is a renovation of this scale for a competent contracotr? 8 weeks? 6 months? 8 months? A year?",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_1a155o,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1a155o/rennovating_an_entire_row_home/,

So now I am moved into my new place. Its slowly coming together, but have had a few hiccups. So its few units condo, with all the work going on, my new neighbors have already been complaining a bit. And any new found issue is apparently due to all the reno work I have been doing automatically. 

Anyways in all of this I am very happy with my contractor, he has been doing a lot and fixing things as he is finding them himself, of course he will charge me but I am still very thankful for him getting things done.

So the kitchen is all fancy now, bathroom's have new counters and sinks so the vanity has started looking dated. And once they touched plumbing, everything keeps coming apart so they need to keep replacing things as they find. So only one bathroom is usable at this time, I dont have money or patience to touch any more fixtures in bathrooms.

But now since I have moved in, the traffic noise is slowly numbing my ears. I knew the road by my place was fairly busy, but of course fairly busy at all times, with people speeding at 60 on an inside road and it being awfully loud at night when I am trying to sleep, that's just driving me insanely sleepless every night. I actually wore my headphones to bed yesterday. So the next project is to get double pane windows. I tried the curtain thing, didn't do squat. any other suggestions for blocking out traffic noise?

EDIT: I finally slept fitfully last night. In much better spirits today, my home still needs work and we are slowly plodding along. My contractor did not clean up the place properly and I have been cleaning up after, I have been experiencing chronic dry skin, is it just cause of heat or am I exposing myself to something bad in all this reno?

We have two very stupid cats. One of them is extra stupid and tends to be a little pissy (literally and figuratively) about where he chooses to take a leak. Anywhere nearby in the room is close enough, even if the litter box is freshly cleaned. Until recently, the solution was to put the litter box in a bathtub in an unused bathroom, and line the tub with aluminum foil. Since cats hate walking on aluminum foil, The Mad Pisser was forced to use the litterbox. Unfortunately that bathroom is now in use and we needed to relocate.

**Problem:** Cat poop stinks. Two cats seem to generate four times the stink. I don't want to find out what three cats does. Regardless, the cats need to poop somewhere that people aren't exposed to the smell.

**Solution:** With several adults living in this house, everyone keeps their coats either on coat hooks or in their own closet. The coat closet in the hallway is mostly unused. After seeing Scott Adams mention in his blog that he'd put a special cat room into his custom-built house, the unused closet became a cat bathroom.

**Materials:**

1. Home Depot Jeld-Wen folding closet doors, $47. Nice to look at, made from 'particle board/composite'. Basically thick, tough cardboard. At least it's light and easy to cut.
2. Rubberized vinyl baseboards. Two at $2.50 each. Combine with some caulk we already had on-hand (probably $2 if you have to buy it) to waterproof the baseboard/floor seam in case of kitty 'accidents'.
3. Linoleum flooring. The actual closet flooring is asbestos tile. I don't want cat claws scratching that up. Got some cheap remnant stuff from a local overstock store for ten or twenty bucks and cut off a little 2x3 piece. Probably a whole dollar's worth of linoleum used.
4. Liquid Nails to secure everything. $3.67.
5. Litter box. $3.
6. Cat door, about $15.


**Directions:**

1. Paint and replace doors. The Home Depot house brand stuff is white, but it's a flat white primer that will pick up fingerprints constantly. I used up an old can of paint that was slowly drying in the basement. Once painted, use a jigsaw to cut out door hole.
2. Cut linoleum to fit, swirl a little Liquid Nails on the floor, glue down linoleum.
3. Cut and glue baseboards. Since they tilt back, there's a lot of space at the corners. I probably could have cut the corners at an angle to compensate, but this was a rush job anyway.
4. Caulk all the things! Everything is now waterproof in case of hazmat spills, to include filling in the corners with caulk.
5. The catbox looks like a $20-30 top entry cat box. It's a $6 storage bin from a big box department store with a hole cut in the top. Cats can't tell the difference.

Since we have stupid cats, the door was originally installed with no cat door. Then a completely opened cat door. Then a cat door tilted slightly downward. Eventually, after a month of preparation, we've gotten to a closed cat door that El Stupido will carefully, slowly push open after a great deal of staring and poking.

**Lessons learned**

1. I could have made the baseboards a bit neater if I'd chopped the ends at an angle, making a narrow 'V' in the corners. If it was anywhere but a closet I'd have redone that part.

Any ideas of things I can do to help support the cabinets and prevent them from sagging *without* breaking the terms of my lease?

**More Information &amp; Pictures!** 

I live in an apartment. As much as I want to tear out the cabinets and build new ones using solid wood that *won't* sag, I don't have that luxury. This is severely limiting my ideapool of things I can do to fix this problem, because I do not want to break the terms of my lease.

We moved into this unit less than a month ago. While there were other problems that have been addressed, the main issue that the management and maintenance staff has not resolved to my satisfaction is the kitchen cabinets. More specifically, this *one* kitchen cabinet. It is very long, and also the only cabinet adequately sized to store dishes or glassware.

Upon moving in, we attempted to load it up with our dishes - ceramic, the heaviest stack being eight full sized dinner plates. The bottom shelf immediately heaved beneath the weight and separated from the wall. Picture of that *[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/LEgm3cvh.jpg)*.

We requested that maintenance come out and repair the cabinet. They removed the two upper shelves, which were severely bowed in the middle, and brought us replacements today. These we have loaded today with glassware, and with only minimal weight placed on them, they are beginning to bow as well. Picture of the shelves *[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/TxfOqy0h.jpg)*, picture of the small dip in the middle *[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/nAsqB7Th.jpg)*. (I'm not kidding when I say it's small. I don't think any of my housemates have noticed yet.)

My concern is that these shelves do not have crossbracing in the middle, or any sort of stabilization to keep the middle from sagging under any weight at all, especially over time. 

Is there anything I can do to stabilize these shelves? Am I overly concerned about the top two shelves? (This is possible - I grew up in a home with lots of custom-made solid wood shelving, so sagging was never an issue no matter how heavy the load.)

about 7 years ago when I first moved in I found some termites outside the house.  I cut down a couple cedar trees and the termites seemed to go away with them. At the time I didn't even realize they were termites until I was looking at some old pictures.  I've never seen any again. 

Is it possible this is old old damage?  The floor is from 1948.  I guess it is possible the larger hole was always there and I just never noticed it, but I would think the other soft spot would have collapsed long ago if it was old damage.

Ideas to fix unfinished edges/transitions?,21,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1htv6f/previous_owner_did_an_awful_job_installing/,"My fiance and I purchased a fixer-upper about a year ago, and we've done a fair bit of work on it.  One thing that we've been dealing with is the fact that the previous homeowner installed laminate flooring and did an incredibly half-assed job of it.  In the basement, we pulled it all up and started over, but we don't have the time or resources to do that upstairs currently.  As we've been painting each room, we've been pulling the old baseboard and installing new baseboard and quarter round, which has fixed 90% of the issue.  Here's what it looked like before (with bonus post-bath cat).  It may not be obvious in this picture, but there was a quarter inch gap around the entire perimeter -  when he installed the flooring, he just installed it up to the baseboard and then stopped. http://i.imgur.com/w0t2Zh.jpg

And here's after we painted and put in new baseboards.
http://i.imgur.com/lPIgLh.jpg

The problem that we're left with is the areas around the doorway transitions.  If it were just the transitions, it'd be easy enough to intall reducers or t-molding, but it extends around the door frames as well.  

Here's an example of a doorway: http://i.imgur.com/rSlnX04.jpg

And here's a bit in the hallway where there are three doorways in a row - a closet, a bathroom (with a marble threshold leading to some lovely mustard yellow tile), and another closet. http://i.imgur.com/JawzLAJ.jpg

And here's the top of the stairs, where there's a gap between the stair nose and the laminate.  This is probably one of the easier spots to deal with.  I am thinking I can either use a reducer or find a deeper stair nose.  I'm also sure I can find some kind of trim piece at a flooring store to cover the bits around the banister footings (to the left in the picture), but I'm planning to paint the railings soon so that can wait.

We began moving in Thursday and I've noticed a few things as I've been in and out getting the painting done(3 rooms down 2 to go WOO!)

1.  The large wooden front door makes a loud squeaking noise when it gets to a certain point.  I can tell it is rubbing at a certain point on the top of the frame but have no idea how to go about fixing this.  Is there anything I can do outside of reframing the entire door?  Would sanding where it is rubbing help at all?

1.  Most of the windows are older windows that are painted shut.  I tried a stanley knife today but it was really difficult to get into the cracking without cutting up the window frame.   What are some ways to go about this and what are the best tools to use?

1.  I've noticed water seeping into the basement in an area that we hadn't caught in the inspection or any of our visits.  It looks like it is coming from where the basement wall and the basement floor meet.  Is there a simple way to put some sort of seal down to avoid the water seeping in?  We have been getting a lot of rain recently so I think that might have something to do with it but I'd like to safeguard this so we don't into trouble in the future.  

1.  The previous owner ran flex tubing instead of pipe from a gas line in the basement to the stove.  The inspector advised us to have this replaced because it is not up to code.  How important is this?  Can we use the stove for the time being or should we have this replaced before ever using the stove?

1.  Does anyone have any good tutorials on taking down/hanging ceiling fans?  We've decided to relocate two of the ceiling fans in the house but I've never done anything like that before.

The house was built in 1961. The original floorplan had 3 bedrooms on the second floor, but the previous owner had removed the wall between two of the bedrooms to create one giant bedroom (bringing the total to 2 bedrooms).  
  
I thought this was stupid, so I put the wall back up. I didn't even think about getting a permit since the wall was already there once before.  
  
Unfortunately, while browsing local building code for a new project, I found out that a permit is required to add a bedroom to a house. Shit. It sounds like I can go obtain a retroactive permit (and probably pay a fee), but would I need to bring the rest of my house up to code in order to get this permit? There are a lot of issues, partially due to age and partially due to shoddy workmanship in the past. Some of these issues (like a lack of interconnected smoke alarms) would affect the bedrooms, while others (like a deck built around my power meter) would not.  
  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
  
**EDIT:** Hey everyone, thank you for all of the great info. Navigating these building codes is a little tough, so I appreciate the insight from experienced folks. 
  
I think before I do anything I am going to check the county records and see if the previous homeowner pulled a permit to remove the wall. If the county still thinks it's a 3-bedroom house, then I may just leave it be for now. I'll keep the plans in a safe place in case we need to resolve the issue at selling time.

I'd appreciate your recommendations on a few things related to adding smoke detectors into a new (to me) home. Let me provide some back story that might help a bit to start and wind up with some questions that hopefully you can help with.

Just bought a house that was built in the 70s but has a lot of upgrades. Unfortunately house-wide smoke detectors were not something that was on that list. The house has three levels and I think there's just a handful of them on the first level only. I don't believe they're hardwired and they're ancient. I'd like to look at putting in more smoke detectors throughout the entire house and replacing the old ones altogether. In my mind -- ideally they would be hardwired+9V back-up and by sync'd with one another so if something is going wrong in the basement the alarms would sound up on the third floor. Additionally, I've now seen that smoke detectors can also come combined with carbon monoxide detectors built-in. It seems like a no brainer to get the combo of the two at this point, but I'd like to get some feed back.

With the above being said -- do people here have recommended products, ways to do this, things not to do, or other considerations? I was to make sure I'm tackling this correctly but since the place isn't already built I'm wondering how much this will cost and what to expect too if I go the hardwired route.

I hear a thump or a drip behind my wall. it goes on for about 6 seconds with about a sound/second.

here are the test I ran. I filled up a bucket and poured it down the toilet, basically manually flushing it - no sound. poured it down the sink drain - no sound. Therefore i'm guessing it's not a drain pipe issue. 

I flush the toilet, and after the tank is filled, I hear the sound. I also hear the sound without flushing the toilet and just holding down the float so that the tank continues to fill (not making it pass the overfill line). making sure it's not the flapper, I held down the flapper and sound still appears. definitely not the toilet internally. 

now, I ran the hot and cold tap on my bathroom sink making sure it goes into a bucket to isolate the drain. both made the sound after turning off the tap.

I did not open a wall up in the bathroom, but right downstairs, there is a wall inside a closet that the hot/cold supply lines run to the upstairs. I opened up a little hole on that wall and felt the supply lines - they felt dry. 

there are no signs of water damage either in the bathroom, downstairs wall/ceiling, or in the basement. should I be concerned? is this sound normal after shutting off running water? my guess is that if there is a leak on the supply lines, there should be a sound regardless of any fixtures being used.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,1362991173.0,,,True,t3_1a2mn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1a2mn7/drip_or_thump_like_sound_from_behind_walls_after/,

So my next thought is that the little spinning brushes are not spinning with sufficient force. But actually they seem quite robust too. It hurts your finger to stick them in there.

So now I'm wondering if they are just too high or too low or something like that. The carpets are not shag. Fairly shallow carpets. But that's the only idea I have left. Two problems:

I'm happy to say I ignored some of it and went for a flat finish. 

[Here are pictures of the finished product](http://imgur.com/a/fJM8B). 

The project took about 7 days and cost between 125 and 175 for materials and a few new tools (pure materials was 95). The biggest cost was Benjamin Moore primer and paint - I feel they helped me achieve a better finish and were more forgiving on the drywall finishing. 

Scraping the painted texture off took me one evening. The next night I used a sponge and 6"" taping knife to clean the ceiling. I tried to get as much texture and ""crap"" off as possible to get clean drywall without over saturating the drywall. Night two was half the mudding and night three was the second half. This involved going over every screw dimple, a 12"" knife over the seams, and an inside corner tool to get a sharp edge between the wall and ceiling. 

Night 4 was a light sanding and scraping, and a second cost of mud on all seams and dimples. I paid extra attention to getting it level and not going on too thick. 

Night 5 was the final sanding - this took me a good deal of time to make sure everything was feathered out properly. I also used a damp sponge and shop vac to collect dust before priming. All dusty floor covering was removed. 

Night 6 was two coats of primer. Inbetween primer coats I used lightweight spackle to cover any fish eyes I noticed or other imperefections that the 1000 watt revealed. 

Night 7 was two coats of flat white ceiling paint.  

I think it turned out very good due to the time I was able to put in. I didn't need the room durning the product so I didn't feel rushed. With standard lighting it looks like a really good, and that's tough to say because I'm typicaly very critical of work I do. 

Have a good ladder, good drywall knives, a drywall hawk, pole sander, shop vac with dust bag and proper attachments, and a lot of patience if you want it too look good. 

I feel the time it took was worth it vs buying and hanging new drywall.

My main questions are what is the insulation made of and is it safe to handle?

Now, the challenge is getting rid of my old POS Chinese made table (should still fetch ~$200 to help pay for the new table).

My problem is the old table needs a little love before I can unload it on Craigslist. Long story short, there's a long bolt that attaches a removable leg to the rest of the table base. This is the only part of the base that disassembles. The thread that the bolt screws into deteriorated over time which led to the bolt sitting a little loose which led to the base loosening up which led to the glass top now sitting slanted.

I tried replacing the thread but was not successful due to the weird angle that the bolt goes through the leg at, and also the size of the existing hole (couldn't find a self-drilling thread that was small enough).

Next, I attempted to fill the bolt hole with epoxy, stick the bolt in and clamp the whole thing together as best I could. This did not work -- the leg didn't reattach tight enough to the base to fix the slant (same looseness).

Now, I'm left with a mess. The last bit of the bolt is stuck in the leg (which I managed to pull away from the rest of the base) and I have no idea where to go next. I'm thinking of giving the epoxy another shot. A friend I was talking to said that the epoxy is almost as strong as, if not stronger, than the wood. This time, I'd use more epoxy and bead it around the base where the leg meets, instead of just in the hole, and come up with a better solution for making sure it's clamped really tight while it cures.

Now would probably be an appropriate time for pictures:

1. Slanted glass top: http://i.imgur.com/FbaPLj6.jpg

2. Bolt stuck in leg (how do I get this out???): http://i.imgur.com/f4bfC8p.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/rPbQw4Y.jpg

3. Base minus leg: http://i.imgur.com/bwQtIHa.jpg

4. Base plus leg (how do I get this attached TIGHT???): http://i.imgur.com/DWhTbhP.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/tOB9SVx.jpg

Questions:

1. How do I get the stuck bolt out of the leg without destroying the leg?

2. Should I skip trying to rethread the base and just epoxy it all together?

3. If so, what kind of clamps can I use on this awkward table to make sure it cures tight this time?

Other ideas?

I need to repaint every single room in a 4br/2ba house. It's fairly rundown, its in the ghetto, used to be a group home, you get the idea. There appears to be a latex based white used matte or semigloss on wall, trim, ceiling, I plan to go over it all with eggshell. The walls are really inconsistent, grimy, dirty, terrible condition - smooth, then bumpy, then splotchy, then big bumps, etc. Pretty sure it needs to be sanded.

I want to do a very good job, Im both living and renting this place.

Questions:
* What do I sand with? What about the ceiling? I'll use a sand sponge for the trim.

* What about sanding between coats of paint/primer?

* If I'm sanding, I dont need to clean, right? Or do I? I want to do a good job...

* Caulking. I have no idea what to do in regards to caulking. caulk what, how, when...

* I assume first take it all apart (doors can stay i suppose, going to replace most doors anyways), 'broom' *everything* , wiping it all down with cleaner, then hole covering. I dont know if theres smokers glaze or not, but i see cigarette burns in the bathroom.

* Priming? Just the holes or everything? I believe theres latex paint (when i rub an IPA covered towel on wall, a bunch smudges onto the towel). Havent bought paint yet, I assume latex is what is normally used.

* Do i do trim or ceiling first?

* Would it be best to knock a room at a time, or like a floor or everything at once?

* I assume best paint method is up/down entire length of wall at a time, and go over brushed edges with a small roller to prevent brush strokes appearing on edges, and on ceiling just roll with less paint.

Thanks. I know these are basic questions, the problem is that it's hard to separate the good advice from the loudest advice. I have access to good tools.

edit: you know what, the walls are rough as crapl itll be smooth than 2 ft later its just really bumpy. its inconsistent... yea im gonna go over it all with something. not sure wet sanding sponge or a drywall sander attached to a extendable sander thingy (like a mop but the head swivels around for sanding... or use sandpaper on it, w/e...)0.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,1372211127.0,,,True,t3_1h2iem,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1h2iem/how_to_properly_prep_for_paint/,

This is my first house and I'm trying to take care of the place. I get little rivers of water seeping through the walls in the basement. They run right into my drain, but of-course I want to make it stop. I'm sure the best thing to do would be to dig up the foundation, seal it from the outside, then rebuild the foundation with new drain tile (100 year old house. Old tile, but still working), but there's no way that I can afford all that.

In lieu of the proper procedure, I'd like to try building up the grade to a 3/4""-1"" drop per 1' for 8' in front and in back. Also, I'd put plastic down, including on the East side of the house where I don't have much to work with, and cover it with dirt. I don't know where to have that side drain though.

I've used Sika sealer along the driveway and against the house, cutting out the old dried out stuff and replacing it, but that has led to pooling in the shallow dips in the driveway, and it looks like water is still getting down there from somewhere, just not as bad as before. I do have a few more places to seal, so hopefully what I've done so far is being effective. 

I've got some Drylok too, but I'm not so sure about it. I worry that in the winter the cinder blocks will saturate with snow melt, and although the Drylok may keep it from seeping through, refreezing would damage the blocks. Is that a reasonable fear?

I'm just looking for some constructive comments and advice on this kind of project since I absolutely can't afford to have professionals take care of it.

I'm also wondering what it would take to terrace the front yard to eat up most of the grass and plant a bunch of bushes and low maintenance plants, but I suppose that's for /r/landscaping.

When I am washing down the wall, I can see some sort of [mesh on the drywall](http://i.imgur.com/2nJFLoE.jpg) as well and I am not sure if that is normal or if I am rubbing too hard.

Is the beige stuff glue?

Next step after washing everything down is putting drywall paste/sanding down. Then painting.

While I have tons of renovation experience, this was my first exposure to metal studs.  They went up easily, were dead straight, and I was able to complete the job relatively quickly (all the reasons that I chose to use metal studs in the first place).  Everything at this point seemed fine.  

However, after drywalling/taping/mudding the bulkhead, the framing has developed some loud groans/creaks when walking across several areas on the 1st floor.  On the louder spots, I've noticed that the 10"" flooring joist deflects slightly, which is in turn, applying force to the top track of my metal stud framing.  I can replicate the sound by reaching in-between joists, and pushing down on the edge of the top metal stud track.

I've attempted to install 2x10 bridge pieces between joists to try and stiffen up the area, but it hasn't helped.  My next thought is to use a hacksaw, and cut through the top track on either side of the problematic floor joists to decouple it from the framing.

Any other thoughts?  Has anyone else encountered this with metal studs?  In hindsight, I feel that I should have used a wooden 2x4 across the bottom of the flooring joists, and attached the metal track to the underside of the 2x4 (instead of directly to the joists).",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_1a3asr,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1a3asr/metal_stud_creaksgroans/,

POsted this to /r/DIY then saw r/homeimprovement. Thanks.

I have to remove our porch/balcony due to termite and water damage. It's over 20 years old and ready to go. We are not sure what we want to do as it has come at a time where we are still evolving our backyard and we are not ready to commit to a design just yet.

My first thoughts were to just remove it completely but realized I would not have access to the sun shade on the second floor.

What I would like to do is leave a small portion of the deck attached to the house (there is no damage to this part of it) with enough room for me to go out and access the sun shade (sunsetter awning).

The deck has vertical supports 10' away from the house. They are being removed.

My question is how far out could I leave the porch?

How much can those nailed brackets hold?

It would need to support about 220 lbs. (me)

I understand it would not be the safest in the world and it would only be used temporarily until we figure out what to do. I would install a basic rail guard.

This morning, I cleaned the filter on my front loading washing machine and then went to do a load of wash. About halfway through the cycle, I went out to the garage (where the washer and dryer are located) to discover 50+ gallons of water pooling around my garage floor. The washer and dryer sit on a ~3-4"" step above the carport adjacent to an interior wall. Unsurprisingly, water seeped into the bedroom closest to the garage presumably (and hopefully) underneath the drywall. Now, my question is such:

The step that the washing machine sits on appears to be pretty damn level. Short of ripping out the step and repouring concrete, I was hoping to introduce a slope to where the machine sits. I was thinking maybe some sort of ""tub"" the machine can sit in that acts like a ramp to direct any leaking water out away from the house so that it does not pool-up. Google search got me nothing more than diagrams of the inside of the machines or just washbuckets.

This is a full size, front loading machine. Does anybody have any ideas?

The outside would obviously need to be painted, one window is cracked and needs to be replaced, the garage door needs to be replaced, the deck probably has a few years left. 

Now the first floor:

The kitchen is essentially missing. There is a few cabinets left but nothing worth keeping. Because the entire kitchen would need to be replaced I was thinking that I would move it to where a bedroom is currently located it behind it. This would all the current kitchen space to be used as a dining room and in turn make the living room larger. 

The second bedroom on the first floor would stay as a bedroom but would need to be painted.In addition the flooring needs to be replaced (This is true throughout the house). There is a full bathroom on the first floor but I would like to take out the tub and install a standup shower and small closet for storage. 

The second floor is in the best shape. Everything is liveable now but the interior doors would need to be replaced (Again this is true with the entire house). I would eventually like to turn one of the two bedrooms in to a restroom since there is not one. I would think that I could have the plumbing run as the kitchen is being relocated. 

The basement is finished and in decent shape for the 70's but the half bath would need to be redone and the basement itself needs to be refinished and updated. 

It looks like the house is going to go for about $65k which is great for the neighborhood. I would only have about $10k to start repairs and then I could afford another $750-$1k a month for additional repairs.

1350354539.0,12,self.HomeImprovement,11jrjm,"Rewiring home, need some advice.",13,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/11jrjm/rewiring_home_need_some_advice/,"So, my wife and I are extreme geeks, and we're closing on a house next week Thursday. House was built in 1929. Most of the wall outlets are miswired (swapped ground/neutral, {dead|no} ground, etc), in-place GFCI is non-functional, and the filled 100A service is so old, it uses some kind of narrow circuit breaker that's no longer sold.

So I'm getting the 100A service upgraded to 250A. (Garage service needs upgrading from fusebox, and I'd like to be able to charge a plug-in hybrid someday, so putting more juice over that way.) And, obviously, most of my outlets need replacing (I want ground!), and likely a lot of replacement wiring.

Also going to install a 42U rack in the basement, with ventilation feeding into the cold-air return. (Forced air furnace/central air. Plan to have fan running 24/7 anyway to equalize air temp throughout the house.) Rack will have network switch, router and patch panel, and I want to replace all the landline jacks with keystone jacks and four cat6e home-ran back to the patch panel in the basement. (The rack is coming to me free from a friend.)

The rack will also be holding home theater gear, if I can swing it. I've got a couple 100W cabinet speakers I like the sound of.

Finally, I want to put two APs in the house. It's about 1400 sq. ft, plus a finished basement. I'm thinking one one in the basement at the front of the house, and one on the second floor on the rear. (First covers front of the house, second covers rear of the house and the back yard, and I can reduce tx power for a less-noisy rf environment.)

I've done professional telecom wiring before, but a long, long time ago, and I'm out of date on where to source tools and materials. I'm not a licensed electrician, but I'm perfectly comfortable with low-voltage, high-voltage and RF, and I've done structured residential electrical before. (Wiring on new construction at my parents' place...building my own room.) I'm silly enough to want 20A circuits instead of 15A circuits, even where I can't point to a specific anticipated need.

While I'll be involving some friends with the labor (for all but one of them, it'll double as a kind of skill training), I'll be showing them how to do each part of it, but inspecting things (i.e. each jack wired correctly) personally before things get screwed in and out of sight.

So, that's the scenario.

Questions: 

1. Anything fundamental I'm doing wrong? (Aside from the obvious overengineering. And, no, I don't see a good reason *not* to go with cat6e, given it's structured wiring.)
2. Last time I did anything like this, I ran three cat5e lines in a bundle to each keystone jack. One line was for ethernet, one line was split to two phone jacks. Third was spare. For four ethernet jacks, I'd want to run four and a spare...but five cat6e lines strikes me as stretching how much I could pull at once! If there's a good way to do it, I'd love to. But I'll accept it if there's not, and perhaps find a way to put USB chargers in a couple of the keystone ports.
3. Where's a good place to get several 1000ft boxes of cat6? I don't have a good estimate for how many thousands of feet I'll need yet; I haven't mapped out where all the jacks are.
4. What would you recommend for lube? I recall cable being far, far, far easier to run with lubricant.
5. Similarly...what about 12ga electrical cable? AFAIK, all I need care about is that it's three-conductor 12ga...but where's a good place to buy it?
6. I've never done hidden structured speaker wiring before, or structured HDMI. Anything I should watch out for?
7. Preferences on brands for any of the parts involved?
8. Anything I may have missed?

Anyone know (pic below)?


I am replacing the disintegrating rubber-backed carpet and these concrete ""baseboards"" are currently solidly but hideously covered with shimmed plywood, and over that rubber-backed carpet was glued and stapled to the plywood.


Whoever did the work did not shim the top high enough and the tops slope down a bit toward the walls, and even worse the plywood was covered in the rubber and this is really hard to remove.
I could just scrape it and put MDF or mouldings over the plywood, but I am debating if I should rip out this plywood cover and make my own, possibly from MDF and router the edges myself or use some wide trim. The concrete is pretty pitted on the top by the looks of it. I could just shim the MDF to be level and glue it to the concrete.


This would probably be more work but might allow me to make these ledges smaller.


Any ideas?

I knew I needed a new one. The inspector, when I bought the house, told me that I needed more attic ventilation, because my shingles were curling, which meant my attic was too hot. It’s an old house, so gable vents, not ridge/soffit, are what I have in my attic. 

My wife and I saved up some money, and this year we got three quotes for roofers. All three told me the same thing – you need more ventilation, your attic is too hot. 

I picked the contractor with the best references, the best customer service, and the cheapest price.  I was lucky all those things lined up. They seemed like a professional outfit. They’ve been in business for 25 years. They recommended box vents to increase my ventilation, and put the vents in the quote. The total quote was 5.9k, plus the cost of the dumpster.

They did my roof yesterday. The work looks amazing – clean lines, underlayment installed correctly, ice and weather shield, new flashing – everything looks great, except they didn’t install the box vents. They told me that my gable vents were enough, even though they’d previously quoted me (it’s on the contract I signed and have a copy of) box vents.

Now I am in this situation – I still owe them 2.5k remaining on the job, and it’s my only bargaining power. I am afraid that the shingle manufacturer won’t warranty the shingles if there isn’t more ventilation, which means I am out of luck if these new shingles start curling like my old shingles. I have no doubt they will, given some time.
So my options are 1) Demand the box vents I paid for, which means they have to come out an pull off new shingles and put in vents and reinstall the shingles 2) Demand an additional, written warranty from the installer and a refund for the cost and labor and materials on the box vents. I don’t have an itemized quote, just a list of things and one price, so I’m not exactly sure what the size of that refund would be. 

What would you do in this situation? I already called them – they are looking into it and getting back to me, but I want to make sure there aren’t other options I’m not considering.

Update: I just got a call from the owner - he said that they modified my gable vents to make them bigger and that should take care of the problem. I'm at work right now, so I can't check to see if that's actually the case. I plan to check once I get home. Even so, I am less than pleased. Even if they modified my gable vents to make it a fitting solution, that's not what the contract says. The contract says nothing about modifying my gable vents, and I didn't agree to that. As far as I am concerned, that's work they chose to do for free. The box vents are still a contractual issue that has to be rectified. 

Update 2: They just called me and told me the owner was confused - they didn't modify my gable vents. Their ventilation program said that my gable vents should be enough, but the real world didn't match that. So they are coming out tomorrow to install the box vents that they originally quoted me for. Good thing, too. My job has free legal consultation as a perk of the job - I was at HR getting that phone number when the contractor called me. Ah well, it looks like they are going to make it right.

So I started a lease on a place and as I am moving in I noticed a stronger smoke smell that I hadn't noticed or paid attention to when I first looked at the place. It seems like the person who lived there before was a heavy smoker because there a places where there is a sticky residue (on ceiling fan chain-pulls, inside the top of cabinets, etc.). Most of the first floor is carpeted, which I realize is a problem with the smell, even after being professionally cleaned. There is carpet in the basement and on the top floor. 

My fear is that my biggest problem will be working with the owner. He doesn't appear to care too much about the house. When we first looked at the house there was some tile work in the bathroom that was falling in that he said he would repair/replace. Well the work done to ""repair"" it is that he didn't actually fix the wall he just covered over it with a plastic shower siding, which the top of he didn't seal so water is just going to drip back down and create a bigger problem. 

Generally the place is relatively dirty and needs some work in other areas, old windows that can't lock, broken seals on windows, broken window screens, doors that have been seemingly kicked in and patched very poorly, dirt and grime in random places.

Also, after spending a more significant amount of time in the place my allergies began to act up. I am not allergic to smoke, so my guess would be mold or mildew(not sure if i am allergic to those).

We are actually renting through a management company. How would you advise that we go forward with this process of getting the house fixed up? I don't want to become adversarial with the management company or owner, but I can't handle the smell of smoke, unsafe non-locking windows, and allergic reaction. We (the guys and I living there) are willing to do work like tear up the old carpet and toe strips to get the far better hardwood underneath, clean and repaint the walls (with deodorizing primer), general cleaning, etc. in exchange for reduced rent payment or something.

I'm a new homeowner, and I'm looking at installing a partition wall in the basement. I'm comfortable with tools, although I'm inexperienced with framing and drywalling. (I'm willing to deal with minor screwups, and treat it as a learning experience.)

There's plenty of information on how to frame walls on the internet, and it seems to be fairly straightforward, but in my case there's one catch; The basement has a drywalled ceiling, which means no direct joist access without tearing it apart.

For the wall that runs perpendicular to the joists, it seems simple. I can screw the top plate to the joists through the drywall, or (my preference) I can cut away *just* the drywall I need for the top plate, without needing to redo the ceiling.

My question comes when I try to do the wall parallel to the joists. The obvious way to do it is to cut the drywall out between the joists to install blocking. The thing is that then, I'd need to redo the ceiling.

I was wondering if there was a way to avoid re-drywalling the ceiling. The only option I can think of is trying to make sure that the top plate runs exactly along a joist, and then I can do the same as the perpendicular joist.

EDIT_02: I've emailed my landlord about my concerns. I may be a little naive in how much this will cost, especially since the door frame isn't even square. But, here is my letter to her. 


I was at Home Depot yesterday to get some stuff for Spring cleaning/fixes and while I was there I figured I’d look at how expensive a new door would be. Labor cost really outweighs the cost of the actual door. I could get a new vinyl sliding glass door for as cheap as $299 which includes the frame, sliding door, and stationary panel. For $399, I could get a more attractive swing-type patio door that doesn’t slide and could maybe last longer since there’s less moving parts involved. I would absolutely be willing to take on this project with my own tools and a friend or two and put in some of my own money as well. I think this would really help on energy costs and be worth it for us in many other ways as well. If I did it, it would also eliminate any labor costs ($469 at Home Depot). I love doing this sort of thing so it would be exciting for me. I of course would need your permission to take on a project of this nature. I don’t want to seem like I’m pressuring at all. The alternative is probably to caulk-seal all of the openings and the entire outer frame of the current setup.  The current frame isn’t really connected to the house. If you pull the door at all while it’s latched, the frame actually moves away from the wall. My original idea was to pull the slider off its track and inspect the rollers. Those can be replaced fairly cheap if I could match them up with something, but given the door’s age it could be difficult to find. But even then, the stationary panel is blocking the slider from being removed. I tried to remove the stationary panel but the house has shifted so much that the clips are bent and after removing them I cannot get the panel to budge. It may be bearing the structural load from above or else it’s just really seized in there. This, however,  doesn’t address the problem of the large gap at the top of the doors when they’re closed; a heating/cooling nightmare. ~~[omitted]~~ and I plastic wrapped the whole door this past winter, but I’d rather not do that in the summer because the deck is one of the most appealing features of the house in my opinion. Like I said, this is much more involved than I thought it would be. To get an idea of how much it’s shifted, the diagonal measurement is about 106 ½ x 108 ½ where ideally these measurements were probably equal when it was installed. This is probably why the slider doesn’t slide anymore without putting all your weight into it. The door frame is the standard 72 x 80. Let me know what you think.

I took a couple pictures of the bottom-of-the-line Home Depot doors. I also called the Habitat for Humanity “restore” in ~~[omitted]~~ and he said he thinks he has a sliding glass door, but wasn’t sure. This was suggested to me online. The ReStore has used and donated house supplies and all profits go to the Habitat for Humanity cause, which I’ve volunteered for several times in the past and am familiar with. This could potentially be a cheaper option depending on what they have, but I lack a vehicle capable of moving something like that and would need to find someone with a truck. I may know someone, though.

Because it is rarely used, it was also rarely ventilated and it has a musty smell (has paneling and commercial grade carpeting).

Three walls are outer walls and one wall faces the garage. The room is directly below the master bedroom suite.

The city provides the following instruction for decks, but it doesn't include any consideration for roofs, http://www.knoxcounty.org/codes/pdfs/deck_handout.pdf


I called the city and they instructed me to add an additional 16 psf to the deck to account for the roof.  Great, I can do that.  Here is what my design is starting to look like, and I was wanting to get feedback if possible.  Note that when I say ""flush beam"" I mean flush with the joists.  And when I say ""Dropped Beam"" I mean that the joists will be resting on top of the beam.

* Deck Size 20' x 16' (20' span is attached to house)

* 2x10 for ledger board connected to house.

* 6 concrete piers.  3 at 8' out, 3 at 16' out.

* 1 dropped beam (3 2x10s on the 8' out piers)

* 3 2x10s laminated for ledger at 16' out).

* 6x6 posts.

* Simpson Strong Ties/Hurricane Ties/etc. for connections.



Since that might be a bit hard to understand, please see this diagram.  Note that the 16"" OC joists have been removed for clarity. http://i.imgur.com/8GhDwzR.png 


Now for my questions:

* Are there any concerns with combining drop beams and flush ledgers?

* And the big one...Where can I actually buy concrete tube footings?  The internet has failed me in this regard.

My basement is finished, with carpet on the floor. I have a sump pump installed, but the water that is collecting in my basement isn't enough to kick it on.  Its not flooding per se, but just areas of carpet that are wet.  After the first time, I dried out the basement quickly, treated with tons of lysol and hoped it wouldn't happen again.  Well, it did, recently.  

I need to figure out how to proceed and fix this problem.  I believe ultimately this is a grading problem and not an issue with my foundation, but I'd like to be sure before I proceed.  My entire backyard slopes toward the house (possible this problem extends into my neighbors yards as well), and this same side of the basement has the most water pooling on the floor.  Most of the pooling of water is near where the floor meets my foundation walls, but also some areas are randomly wet in the middle of my floor as well. The walls are not wet, just the floor.  

Im looking for recommendations on how to proceed.  It seems like my basement should've been water-proofed before it was finished, but the basement was already finished when I purchased the house.  Tearing out everything to water proof, doesn't seem like it would be the most cost effective option.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan?  What type of professional would I hire to inspect my foundation? Any idea how much the inspection would cost? Any other recommendations on how to address this problem?

Most of the electrical was upgraded in the 1950s, but there is still wiring with cloth insulation running to some of the ceiling fixtures.

We've been interviewing electricians of late, and one of them said that we wouldn't necessarily need to replace it. He said that if the cloth insulation is intact, he'd just paint some liquid rubber on the ends and put it on its own circuit. He explained that as long the insulation stays intact and you don't run more than 15 amps on it (as it's 14 gauge wire), then it's safe to leave it as is.

Need a lot of help learning.,13,1,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1b0alp/upgrading_my_plumbing_system_from_galvanized_to/,"I'm going to be replacing the galvanized pipe in my house entirely with PEX in 2 phases. The first phase will go something like this (working from the main shutoff towards the water heater):

1. Cut and remove pipe on the house side of the main shut off valve, removing about 30' of the cold water supply line.
2. Cut and cap the hot water supply line to the kitchen sink (which is right near where water comes into the house, but is 50-60' from the water heater)
3. Add a pressure regulator just after the main shutoff valve
4. Add a isolation valve just after the pressure regulator (recent addition to this plan, I have heard this is useful for pressure regulating valve replacement)
5. Add an expansion tank
6. T to a hose bib
7. T off to an in-line point of use water heater for the kitchen sink.
8. T off for cold water supply to the kitchen sink
9. Continue cold water supply to the point where I cut the pipe off.

Everything in phase 1 is done in the garage- and all of this plumbing is more or less exposed right now.

Phase 2 encompasses replacing the remaining plumbing in the whole house with PEX, (a full bath with 2 sinks, 1 hose bib, washing machine, 1 utility sink and 1 additional toilet) and switching to an in line water heater for the rest of the house. Almost all of this work is very accessible in a utility room.

Questions I have:

*What do I need to do to couple the PEX to the existing galvanized in the current system?

*Which connector system should I use?

*Does it make sense to put a small manifold in this system?

*Is there a good resource for general knowledge about plumbing with PEX?

Also currently the flooring is concrete underneath the carpet, so what would others recommend as far as installing it? Would you recommend using padding ([something like this](http://www.elastilonusa.com/)) and/or having a floating floor? or would you recommend using some sort of adhesive to hold it down?

We live in a two bedroom condo, and we have a baby on the way.  The other day I was napping in the second bedroom, which will be the nursery, and was woken up anytime somebody above us flushed a toilet. It's a 4 story building, and we are the second floor, so we have two units above us.  I have opened up walls before in other rooms for various projects, and can tell you there is little to no insulation. 

The wet wall that shares the bedroom wall is about 6 feet wide and 9 feet tall. It actually sticks out about an inch from the rest of the wall.  The whole room is about 15 feet long.

My question is, if I tear out all the dry wall, and insulate that wall completely with a product like rockwool, and then use a sonic barrier drywall, will it make an appreciable difference?  Any different products to consider? Any pitfalls to consider?

I am pretty handy, I could easily do the demo and insulation, and maybe just hire someone to tape it, since I kinda suck at that and I want it to look nice.

(Not ""oh my god, I'm falling not level, but not ideal to install hardwoods.)

We're worried if we try and level the floor, we'll need to remove the tiles--and that they may contain asbestos. However, most threads recommend not touching the tiles because they encapsulate the nasties. However, we can't level the floor with SLC on vinyl.

(If it's helpful, I can post a picture of the tiles.)

Help!

tl;dr: May have asbestos on tiles; need to know if we should leave it be and leave the floor unlevel--which will probably screw up the hardwood installation--or if there's something we can put on top of the vinyl (plywood, perhaps?) that we can then put SLC on. Or, if we should bite the bullet and get it tested for asbestos.

Venting/Exhaust possibilities?",14,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/164f9r/finished_attic_no_proper_ducting_unbearable_in/,"I just found this subreddit and I can't wait to flood it with problems from my 1951 crackerbox  house!

The situation:  We've got a smaller house (about 1200 sq ft all said and done) with a finished attic.  The attic is split between two halves by a wall/closet but no actual door.  We have two knee-walls that run the length of the house that give us a good amount of storage/access as well.  However, when they finished the attic they didn't run any proper ducting.  We have one supply vent that actually kicks out a decent amount of air, but no returns.  

The problem:  The summertime makes that upstairs absolutely unlivable (easily 100+).  We've taken steps to help alleviate that, we've removed the door to the stairs to allow for air circulation, we add box fans at the top of the steps to move the hot air down (albeit very unefficiently) and we have a window AC unit on the 'far' side of the attic to help cool our office.  Even then it's 80+ in the heat of the day in the summer.  Tolerable but hardly comfortable.

My question:  I have a feeling venting the hot air is my issue.  I can add plenty of cool air via the AC, but as soon as it shuts off I can literally feel the space heat within seconds.  Is it as simple as adding an exhaust fan to the upper half of the window and let the AC occupy the lower part of the window? The other idea I had was to add an exaust duct similar to a bathroom vent (""fart fan"")to one of the walls, run the duct through the unfinished attic and to the exterior of the house, like a drier vent.   I'm afraid to manipulate my central air too much as it's not certified to handle another floor's worth of heating/cooling and I have no way to add a proper return vent.

-On the outside of the gable, line up the vent to the siding and draw a circle. ensure that the plastic exterior of the vent will be just under the piece of vinyl siding above the hole.

-Insert vent from the outside and bolt it in, then use some caulk for weatherproofing.

I would be looking for something that is obviously structurally sound as thats not work I can do, but stuff where I would be tearing out carpets and putting in hardwood, laying tile, painting, putting up crown moulding, baseboards (maybe electrical.. like new light fixtures ect, but I would probably try to find a friend who knew what they were doing), ect. Ive never done stuff like this before but am willing to learn so I can do most of it myself. I have friends who im sure I can call on from time to time too.  (though that would only be an emergency if needed). So if there are other single people/single ladies who have been in my shoes can you tell me how hard it really is going to be? Were you sucessfull? I know it will be work and probably stressfull but im willing to put the effort in.

Edit: Thanks guys for the encouragement! This is a project I want to take on. I am looking foreward to being able to  customize to my liking but still intimidating none the less because ive never done it before.

I bought an old house built in the 1890's.  My wife and I are hoping to replace the foundation at some point with a concrete basement and floor.  

As it is now, it's sagging, leaning, and cracking, but inspectors claim it's in alright shape for the time being...
 
The foundation is fieldstone, with 1/2 being a dirt-floor walk around basement, and the other half, the back, a crawlspace with part of it made from cinder blocks.


Album to images:  http://imgur.com/a/PRl01

What we are wondering, is general cost for such a project. We've asked relatives, and of course they all ""know"" what it would cost, and how they would do it... cost's we've heard range from 5k to 50k... so... we donno.  web searches say around 8-20k?  we are hoping to do it sometime in 2-4 years time so, the more info we can gather on it the now, the better.

some hopefully relevant info:

house is in Eastern Mass

soil is mostly clay/sand

we hope to have a walk-out entrance to it in the back.

it's about 20ft above water table.

there is one chimney which extends into the basement.

general area of basement would be around 1k feet.

old ""filled in"" well head exists in basement.  or i'm guessing that's what it is.

We also hope to completely replace the floor in the room above the existing basement area, as it is sagging from gatsby-era termite damage. The basement area below it houses the breaker box, as well the routes for ALL the house's very old wiring, and heating...  We thought mayb doing this WITH the foundation replacement would save cost...somehow..?

Also, for fun I made a 3d walkthrough of the house in Unity before we moved in to help us visualize where furniture would go... can check it out here if you're nerdy:  http://www.atomwagon.com/InteractiveHouse1.0/InteractiveHouse1.html

I go through the normal steps and check the breaker, the breaker's fine, I reset it anyway.  No go.  I get my multimeter and the breaker seems fine.  I take it off and reaffix the wire just in case.

This sounds to me like a loose wire between the breaker and the plug in the attic.  I've had rats chew through wires before, but it seems like if that had happened here, I wouldn't get the 114 volts.

I came over to the house and checked--- the paint had dried, but seemed to have a consistent oily coating.

I'm now confident the problem lays with the insulation of the walls.

I've had two people come and take a look at the house, and they gave me conflicting input. The house has a stucco exterior, and this room has a wood panel interior. I think the only insulation in the walls is blocks. Concrete or cinder or whatever, I don't know I'm ignorant.

The first people told me that the best bet would be to drill into the house from the outside and fill the insides of the blocks.

The next guy told me that wouldn't work, partially because of the Stucco, and partially because of the wood panels on the inside. He seemed to think that the stuff injected inside could possibly leak through the panels? He wants to take down the walls in that room and put in 2-3 inches of some other stuff, which sounds great, but...

I popped off one of the wood panels yesterday to look inside. There is not 2 inches of space in there. Between the block and the outer wall there is maybe an inch.

Last winter I noticed a handful of windows were drafty at the bottom, so I installed foam tape where the window contacts the lower sill, and that helped a bit, but didn't completely fix the issue. I measure before/after with a temperature gun, so I can see if my changes had an effect. The drafts all seem to be at the very bottom edge of the window, worse at the corners. The rest of the window edges are reasonable temperature.

This winter, I've noticed even more windows are drafty, and I've run out of foam tape. I don't see anything obviously ""wrong"" with the windows, there's a bit of wind-blown dirt in the sill that I wipe out, but that's about it, and I can't spot any differences between a ""good"" window and a ""bad"" window.

A ""Bad"" window will be 40-50F around the top edges, and 20F along the bottom sill.

They are metal frame windows with double-pane glass. I live in New England if that is helpful. Do windows ""go bad"" over time?

looking at these two for flooring in the main living/office area of my new house. Yes, I'm aware that they're cheap. I know they've both got relatively short lifespans (~15 years?) compared to hardwood, but I have dogs and a limited budget. New house is on a lake, and I'm concerned about water getting tracked in (Yes, there will be a mat, and yes, I do towel them off, but still, moderately damp dogs are a fact of life.) 

How do the two of these compare in durability given the stuff above? It seems like a lot of laminate has padding pre-applied to the back while the vinyl is much thinner. Obviously it needs something underneath too, I'd imagine, but a lot of the guides mention an underlayment on laminate, too. How does that effect things? 

I'm looking at budget level products- something like this  - http://www.builddirect.com/Laminate-Flooring/Macore/ProductDisplay_6951_p1_10074341.aspx but I've got a month or so to research and I really want to make sure I get the best floor for my available money.

Need help!,13,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1iklua/repainting_an_accent_wall_and_painting_over/,"Hello! I recently moved into a new place that came with an interesting (read: horrendous) paint job. There is an enormous, dark red accent wall that runs the length of the entry hall and stretches onto one entire wall of the main room. There are also two chalkboard-paint, painted wall sections.  	 	

I want to get rid of the chalkboard paint and re-do the accent wall in a less robust color (thinking something along the lines of a soft brown or honey/golden/mustard yellow). Here are my questions:

How do I cover up the chalkboard paint? Is there a good way / method to select a paint that will closely match the existing color on the adjacent walls so I don't have to re-paint everything? I checked everywhere in the unit and can't find any of the original wall paint.

How do I re-do the accent wall? Since i will be going with a much more muted shade, will I need to paint over it using some form of white prior to applying my color?  There are also some splotches of red on the ceiling... Can I cover these up or will I have to repaint the whole thing?

I'm looking for the most cost-effective way to get this project completed. I don't have a specific budget in mind but would like to keep costs low so i can tend to other repairs around the house (for which I'm certain i will also seek your sage advice).

So naturally this year I found out how horrible my lawn actually is! 

The major problem I am having is that the previous owners obviously parked a boat trailer or camper or something in various parts of the lawn and they owned it for 20 years. So it is INCREDIBLY rutty and I am constantly struggling to push my mower up and down over these horrible ruts. 

I have had a lawn service tell me that he can get me a great deal with someone he knows who will level the lawn with a CAT, lay down new soil and seed for about 800.00 bucks.

Now, this actually seems somewhat fair to me except I think he thinks that I want some kind of immaculate lawn. I live in the woods and its beauty is not important to me...just the ease of mowing. So it doesn't HAVE to be all perfectly level, I just want the rutted spots to be level.

So my question is do I have to hire someone like this with a CAT to do the whole yard or is there some kind of tool or machinery that I am not aware of that sort of ""spot treats"" portions of your lawn to get them level. I'd buy or rent this and do it myself if it is possible.

I would rather spend that 800.00 on something on the house itself, not just lawncare. But I am prepared to do anything to make this an easier mow. My goal here is just to educate myself on the whole situation as this is my first home.

I have two goals: 

1. create a master bedroom that utilises the view
1. create an openplan kitchen/living/dining that uses the view also.

* The extension is fairly old condition timber, seen [Here](http://i.imgur.com/P2T66AG.jpg)
* The rest of the house is brick exterior, plaster interior.
* The wall at 1 (on the floorplan) is brick, formerly the exterior wall before the extension was built.
* The walls at 2,3,4,5 are all fairly flimsy plaster/wood.
* 6 is where I imagine the kitchen could be.
* The ceilings are low (I can touch them!)... I-beams might need to be inside the roofspace.

Me, I could build a kitchen, tile, floating-floor, hang drywall etc, but structural work is beyond me.

Based on responses, my revised plan is to install 2 140mm fans with a screen.

Nonetheless, I'll take precautions, and keep an eye out for moisture. I would love to buy something more suited to the task like the Panasonic product, but it isn't available for online purchase...and I'm an amazon prime junkie.

I am indeed using an old P4 space heater, but this will be upgraded eventually. Nonethless, I'd like the space to be able to handle a fairly hot machine, so I'll definitely add a vent to the door.

I just moved into a house with rooms that have no closets... and would like to add a closet to a room or two.

The basement is mostly finished, and I've no problem doing drywall and electrical, but... how do I go about securing a frame when carpet has already been laid in a bedroom?

I realize I'll likely have to cut out the carpet where the closet is going to be, but I'd like to keep the carpet in there, so I'll probably end up cutting just where the actual frame is going to be.


I've chosen a corner, and have mentally mapped out about a 3 foot by 5.5-6 foot area to build as my closet (nothing in stone yet..)

But, when I go to lay the bottom of the frame, is construction glue such as Liquid Nails going to be enough to keep a piece of wood sturdy enough to use as the side wall?

We ripped out the old rotten deck and broke up all the cracked concrete below and filled the spot with 3 yards of fill sand - slopped away from the house. We thought it might be the downspout too close to the corner on the driveway and old deck spot where the water is finding its way in. Even after relocating the downspout the leak is still there.

What would you guys suggest: laying down more concrete and sealing that space along the wall where the new cement meets the foundation? My only fear is that if I do all that and the leak still is occurring (maybe excessive water builds and finds its way down to that spot from 4 feet underground... I don't know.

They'd seen much better days and my wife would like to eventually install ceramic tiles (the ones that look like wood flooring).  In the interim, I'm entertaining staining the concrete floor so that it doesn't just look like gray concrete.  

I went to the local Home Depot and Lowes and everything I saw explicitly said ""For Exterior Use Only"".  I've never done this, so I was wondering a few things. 

1.  Can the exterior stuff be used indoors?
2.  If not, what products are suitable for indoor use?
3.  If I choose to stain the concrete, will it affect my future plans to install ceramic tiles?

The above questions are for practicality purposes.  Now I have an aesthetic question.  When they built my house, the contractors obviously performed various tasks directly on the concrete floor.  I have several wide areas of glue that looks like tub baseboard adhesive and random drops of paint and overspray from the texturing gun.  The texturing cleans right up, but I'm wondering your thoughts on the glue and other imperfections?  I know concrete will never be uniform in color...should I expend the effort to brush the glue and paint spots off the concrete with a wire brush before I stain.  I apologize if this is a stupid question....just curious.

I look forward to the advice and I'll keep you updated on what I decide.

My deck is very large over 2000 sq ft.
I have since discovered that the deck is two ages, the top most level is about 40 years old, and the other parts are 10 to 15 years old.
The desk was repainted about two years ago using Behr solid deck stain which has completely failed, bubbling and peeling on all of the new wood but is in OK condition on the oldest part. The oldest part of the deck has many layers of paint so stripping or sanding that part will take a considerable amount of effort.
So using Behr again seems to be a no go, and a home depot store person said I might be able to make a warranty claim.
I'm considering all brands. currently I'm leaning toward Sikkens since they are the only solid stain I've found so far that doesn't require completely stripping the deck to the bare wood in their instructions.
My deck is constructed entirely of Redwood.

What are your experiences with desk stain? Anyone tried an acrylic stain?

Update: I've discovered that Cabot stain also can be painted over existing coatings like Sikkens but they have a lot better color selection

Update I may just strip the entire deck I've been trying to strip the bottom level first and it is going to cost me a fortune in stripper. I also tried cleaning and sanding my joists under the top level and I ran into this nice little complication:

My cousin just bought a house here in Milwaukee. It's been raining for the past week and a half and it's forcasted to rain through next week as well. His basement leaks where the front porch attaches to the house. On the exterior of the house, the previous owner did a poor caulking job, and the steps up to the porch have settled and pulled away from the foundation leaving an approximate 1"" gap.

We obviously can't caulk the exterior because it's wet and dirty and rainy. The interior of the basement wall is brick with plaster veneer. Some of the plaster has cracked and fallen off over the years, leaving some exposed concrete screws and wood in the ceiling.

I think if we dry and clean the interior walls and ceiling and spray a couple layers of silicone waterproofing spray, let that dry, and then replaster the walls, that will at least take care of the interior, and then we can deal with the exterior when/if it ever stops raining here.

Do you think this will work? Sorry, no pictures, I'm at work right now and I'm heading over to his house to help him fix this when I'm done.

Any advice?

I'm having a new construction home built this spring, and I have a couple of questions.

* The builder said I could run any low voltage wire I want after the electrician comes in but before they sheetrock. I'm planning on running cat6 from most rooms to the utility room in the basement (where cable, phone, etc come into the house). Does IRC require that I put this in a conduit of some sort? Would it be a good idea for me to do that anyway? I was just planning on running the wire, but A conduit might be useful if I ever need to run something else in the future.

* Similarly, I've been thinking it would probably be a good idea to pre-run some wire for any speakers I may want in the future.... probably a 5.1 surround sound system in the living room, and left/right speaker channels in the kitchen that run back to the living room. Maybe something in the garage too. What kind of wire should I run for these speakers? Would I just pick something off of [this monoprice page](http://www.monoprice.com/products/subdepartment.asp?c_id=102&amp;cp_id=10239)?

* I am also thinking I might want to pre-run some wire for surveillance cameras. What kind of wire would be best to run for that? coax? cat6? hdmi?

* What's the best place to buy light fixtures? The main big box stores we have in my town are Home Depot, Lowes, and Menards, but I'm also open to buying something online too.

* We're going to put a floating engineered hardwood on the main floor (like laminate, but with a wood veneer instead of a printed image), and installing it ourselves to save labor. What would be the best tool for cutting this - can I use a laminate cutter, or do I need to borrow/rent/buy a miter saw?

* Any other advice or tips? They are just finishing up the foundation this week, so I imagine things are going to start moving very quickly after that.

I plan on doing a ton of work on my house over the next few years and want to do everything by code and be fully permitted so I don't run into any issues when I resell or if an insurance covered problem should happen (water, electrical fire, etc).

For example, my current project is gutting the entire finished basement and redoing everything from the floor plan to electrical. Many of these things I can do myself, like basic electrical and hanging sheetrock. Some others that involve systems like moving the HVAC and water heater (gas lines, exhaust, etc) I'll have done by professionals. I've already started removing the drywall from the framing and plan on being the GC for the entire project.

When do I pull the permits? Before, during or after the work?

How long will the permit last? Is there a work period that must be met with time lines? I plan on lollygagging this project due to budgeting and my spare time and don't want to be rushed.

How does the inspection go? Do they check the work before the drywall is up? Who does it? Do I have to pay them or is that included in the permit cost?

The 2 possibilities I can think of to cure this would be... (1): to cut through the drywall of the a-joining bedroom to give me access to the underside of the tub, and then inject some construction adhesive under the tub and perhaps put a weight in the tub to hold the 'bubble' down till the glue sets and holds it. or (2): try using a heat gun to soften the acrylic then  push down on the 'bubble' till the acrylic cools and hope that it stays in that down position.
I'm hoping someone here has experience with this type of problem and can guide me in to fixing it.
Thanks for your thoughts.
Edit: Seems others are thinking that glue or foam is the way to go. Has anyone ever tried a heat gun to see what it would do?
I wouldn't use foam to try &amp; hold the 'bubble' up, I'd expect that sooner or later that foam would compress and I'd be starting over. 
Drilling a hole isn't going to happen. I'm sure I could get to the underside of the tub by cutting through some drywall that's behind a dresser. 
I've said the tub is made of acrylic, I'm really not sure what the actual material is except it's not metal. Plastic? acrylic? some polymer? 
If nobody suggests that using heat will make it worse I may try that first.

For the last maybe year or two there's been one persistent spot, right at an intersection in the middle of the floor, that keeps cracking and crumbling.  I've tried to fix it maybe 4 times, but in another month or so it seems to develop the same problem.  [Pictures attached.](http://imgur.com/a/b3YvL#jNOmHq2)

First off, is there such a thing as ""wear and tear"" on grout in such a situation, or did the original guy do a bad job?  There's maybe 2 or 3 other spots developing in the room that I have not touched.  These spots are not at intersections. The room gets a great deal of traffic, children playing, toys dropping, etc... I'm just not sure whether it's normal to have to touch up the grout over time, even under those circumstances (the floor is vibrating or something? I have no idea).  If that is a factor, I'll note that this new construction does include a room underneath.  When I'm down there I can hear the kids banging away quite plainly.

Second, what's wrong with this one particular intersection?  Is it more likely that I'm mixing the grout incorrectly and the quality is bad?  Or could it be that there's something wrong with the floor at that point, that it's uneven or something, and just doomed forever to crack until we do something more drastic to fix it?

Thanks!

* Will these replacement doors help in future resale? A door with panels and updated casings. 

* Will a solid core interior door really help to reduce noise into/out of the bedroom or is that negligible?

* Thinking I need to do this first, before replacing the baseboards and painting the walls. 

* Alternative idea - just replace the door casings with new updated looking trim and leave the flat (ugly) doors.

I am living on my own successfully for the first time in my life and I just moved into my own studio apartment a couple of months ago. I was browing r/DIY and saw a link to this subreddit and am hoping that you all can help me.

My biggest question is whether it is a smart idea to put up shelves or to make any permanent changes to my actual apartment itself? I would think that I'd lose my deposit and that the apartment people might actually charge me for any changes that I've made to the apartment.

My second question is what tools would I need (just general tools) if I were interested in building things on my own. I am a receptionist so I don't make a lot of money and most of it goes to bills and rent so I am without a few minor and key pieces of furniture and I lack the money to get them anywhere (except maybe Goodwill which I don't have the resources to bring them to my home...meaning, no car).

The following are things I hope to build within the year that I am without:

Some kind of a frame for my bed (I only have a mattress and I'm entirely too old to sleep on a mattress on the floor).

A television stand (I have an old 80's tube television that I shoved into the built in bookcase in my apartment).

More shelving space in my closet (The only storage in my closest are a few wire racks).

Some kind of standing jewelry holder.

Small bedside tables.

The only thing I've ever built in my life was a small (like kids tea party sized) table when I was a teenager and that was almost a decade ago. Do the productive people here at r/HomeImprovement have any advice for me.

 I called my landlady (it's an apartment) and she sent her handyman, who she says used a ""fish"" (maybe she meant snake or maybe I'm unaware of what a fish is) and then after using said fish he poured in a bunch of draino and told me to ""try it"" in a few hours.

Attempting to fix up a basement work room to a hobby room and I need help and suggestions!,11,0,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/119yb4/diyers_i_need_you_attempting_to_fix_up_a_basement/,"In my otherwise finished basement we have one room approx 16 feet long by 8 foot wide with 8-9 foot tall ceilings.  I'm looking to fix the room up to make a hobby room for my father.  I have little to no DIY experience and this would be my first major project.  The attached album is pictures of the room.  For ease I've divided the parts of the project 

-2 walls (and a small part of a 3rd) are cinderblock which from my untrained eye and research appears to be covered in stucco which over the years has decayed so the stucco is crumbling off and some of the blocks underneath appear to be in need of repair.  There seems to be some discoloration but I don't believe it to be water damage as the room has never had indicators or problems with moisture.  The wall is divided into a upper and lower half with a 1 inch lip about 4 and 1/2 feet from the floor.  I have scraped some off the lip and it seems that it was made using a piece of wood cemented and stuccoed into place.  In addition to the blocks themselves with uneven face from decay there are also places where the seams have cracked so there are holes between the blocks.

-Wood Wall 1:  The wall is about 4 feet wide and starts at the ground but ends a few feet from the ceiling.  This wall is just kind of unsightly but doesn't seem to have any major problems with it.  Just the same it is aged and I want to replace it.  At the base there is a gray cross beam bracing the wall with the door frame, I don't believe it has structural significance but I'm hesitant before I go tearing at it.  If it is as pointless as I may think I want to get rid of it so I can have the new flush wall with no issue and I get the full floor space.

-Wood wall 2:  This wall is the one that I am most apprehensive about getting into.  The wood like the other wall seems in good shape albeit it ugly, holes from nails, and poor paint, and therefore I would like to look into redoing it.  The major issue with this wall is that it houses the one light fixture of the room and a circuit box which has many cables that I have no idea what they do coming out of it.  Out of all the parts of this room this is one that I would potentially call in a professional to do depending.

-Floor:  The floor is just a simple concrete it seems.  There's a few pipes coming out of it (big green things in the pics)  But no major hindrances.  There are parts of the floor which are basically scarred up, while there are no cracks or chunks to be lifted up there are uneven places where the surface is indented and rough (I suppose there were chunks or layers they were just removed).  There is one corner of the room where a chunk appears to be missing and it is a deeper gash.  Most of the floor imperfections are surface problems with nothing deep only an uneven rough area deep as a few credit cards stacked (can't think of what's thin and a good measure).  The corner chunk however is possibly around an inch deep or less.

-Ceiling:  I have absolutely no idea how to handle this, I've heard a dropped ceiling would be best but this is something That I truly have no clue how to approach.


MY PLAN:
Floor:  Use Quickcrete or similar driveway cement repair to smooth out the imperfections, use more layers as needed.  Seal floor with garage floor product (its a seal and color)

Cinderblock Walls:  Use belt sander, scraper, chisel, whatever to get old material off walls, clean wall using acid product or the like making sure they're as clean as possible so further treatments take well.  Repair uneven stone using quickcrete concrete/cement repair also filling in gaps between stones with a product.  Redo the shelf between upper and lower wall using a metal form for shape if needed but simply making sure the walls connect with no issue.

-Wood Wall 1:  Take down old wood, hammer in new fresh pieces, seal them for water proofing

-Wood wall 2:  Take down what wood i can without messing with electric replace with fresh, seal it.  Or call in someone

-Ceiling:  No idea potentially call someone?


Anyway thank you for reading this if you did I know its long so I'm sorry but any input would be great.  Again I have no real idea what I'm doing I'm simply looking at things online and reading instructions and from what I gather I don't think I'm biting off more than I can chew.  The procedures seem straight forward and kind of hard to mess up.  If I've oversimplified this then please tell me.  I'm open to any suggestions or message me for questions comments I guess.  Thank you so much!

Right now hot/cold for washer is plumbed directly into copper lines, the drain is run up and over the side and into a utility sink. The utility sink drains directly down into a 7"" drain (openish hole, pic for clarification: http://imgur.com/jS06U) in the basement floor.

I have done some reading and so far have decided: Run new PEX from the ceiling. T off both hot &amp; cold to utility sink and washer. PEX for washer goes into washer box and hooked up from there. Washer box mounted at 48"", 2"" standpipe to a p-trap 6"" off floor for washer drain.

Questions 

1.  After the P-trap for the washer I want to drain directly into the drain in the floor, but also tie in the utility sink drain. Is it okay to T these 2"" drains together before they enter the floor drain? 

2. Do I need to add a vent? Right now there does not seem to be a vent. The washer drains into the utility sink, the sink drains into an open floor drain. The floor drain is literally open, it has a 2"" pipe coming out and has a cap around it that has holes in it. I cannot see the purpose of a vent when draining into this. I guess I should mention I have municipal water but still have a septic system. I am guessing that is the oddball factor that does not mesh with what I have been reading.

I have looked all over the house, and can find no other possible GFCI plugs that can possibly be downstream of these outlets.  So I am going to make an assumption that the GFCI outlet in the closet is downstream of these dead outlets.  

The actual GFCI outlet has power (I can plug a phone charger in it and it charges), but the bathroom outlets upstream on the line don't. I would assume that if the GFCI outlet had power, the outlets upstream would too.  These outlets went dead when my girlfriend was blow drying her hair. Should I keep looking for other GFCI outlets that may control these, or is it reasonable to assume that something in the GFCI outlet went dead, and I need to replace it?

There is another line on the breaker called ""Bathroom"", that when I turn off, I loose power in the entry bathroom.  These also have a label of GCI protected. I can't find the GFCI downstream outlet for these.  However these have power.  So I am assuming they are not controlled by the same downstream outlet.

I will contract all the work out because I'm the worst person for DIY home projects, but I want to learn along the way so that one day I can do some upkeep and updating projects myself.

Anyway, what do you think, HomeImproveit? To the left of the kitchen currently is a wash room, but there is plenty of room to move washer/dryer into the garage. So I'm thinking we knock down the wall and really open up the kitchen.

The wall facing the camera on the left is the other side to the wash room. It leads to a living room, and it'd be great if we could open it up somehow so there is a view into the living room from the kitchen. It's nice when you're hosting and stuck in the kitchen to not have to be separated completely from guests (or kids).

So, any suggestions for a total newb? Remodel philosophy, concerns you see with anything i've been saying (am I missing obvious red flags?), budget tips, etc.. 

We had a contractor look at it and he said figure 75k for a brand new kitchen. That about right for non DIY people like myself?

After one night of that third step, I saw a whole crapload of bugs get trapped behind that sheet that *had* to have come through the A/C unit itself, despite several google searches telling me that bugs can't come directly through the unit and must be coming from somewhere else instead.

Nevertheless, even with the sheet there, there does appear to be some number of bugs getting all the way through my defenses. Just less than before. I've managed to reduce the number of bugs getting through, but there are still plenty getting through each night.

What's worse is the A/C unit itself seems to have stopped working as well. The fan still works, but the compressor isn't pumping out actual cold air anymore like it did on the first few days.

I'm totally lost and don't know what to do.

The whole thing has me thinking ""fuck it"" and I'm getting ready to drop a pretty penny just having central air installed because this is ridiculous.

**EDIT: OP Delivers. You've all convinced me that the compressor in the A/C unit is malfunctioning and I should return it. I will return it. I'm not convinced my bug problem is due to an improper installation. I saw bugs come straight through the unit while it was on. As such, I'm saying ""fuck it"" and installing central air. I'm not going through this process again for all the other rooms in the house and I'm not risking more bugs.

Obviously the last one has a higher cost to it, but should have the highest return on investment.

This is in central VA.  Winters are not very extreme normally.  It can get pretty warm/humid in the summer.

When all is done I'll post pictures of our kitchen update as thanks.**

***If anybody is curious, the actual hot lines came from the right side of the right box. The top lines of that box went to the lights and the left went over to the garbage disposal box on the left.***

Hello,
I have been going through my home replacing old light switches and outlets with updated white ones. Things were going well until the kitchen. As you can see in the below picture I have two boxes, they are on one circuit. The one on the left goes to the disposal - the one on the right to a light above on the ceiling. The one on the left has 2 white and 2 black/hot wires (that face upwards). The one on the right has 3 white and 3 black/hot wires (two sets facing up, one set down). I thought I had it right, but then the lights wouldn't ever turn off so I obviously am struggling to complete the circuit maze properly.

[Here is a picture of the two boxes.](http://i.imgur.com/d42hoEU.jpg)

Obvious error is that in the picture I wrote dishwasher where I meant garbage disposal. (Or garburator for my Canadian friends)

The face plates should help demonstrate what I'm trying to accomplish. The outlets were working before I pulled them out, but two of the outlets broke while I was pulling them out and everything got messed up, I wasn't able to just copy old wiring patterns. 

Anyway, I hope this is enough information. I can try and answer any questions about information I've unintentionally omitted.

I had a bit of standing rain water in my basement after some pretty heavy rains. When we bought the house they told us they usually snake it out once a year to help clear out the tree roots.

I called a plumber to come and snake it out, and they said my trap was bad and needs to be replaced. The pipe and trap are very rusted and the trap itself was caked with roots inside of it.

He told us that it would cost about $1,400 for them to jack hammer out part of the basement floor, put in a new pipe and trap, and put the concrete back in.

Talking to my neighbor who replaced his trap in the basement a few years ago, he was shocked that they wanted so much to do it. 

My question - is it easy enough for me to replace the pipe and trap in my basement (with the help from my neighbor and local plumbing store) or should I shell out the cash to have it done by plumbers?

I looked further down the wall, and it turns out that the water isn't coming from outside...the section of wall had been waterproofed somewhat by the previous owner, and citronella ants were piling damp soil there. Citronella ants hate water, and are generally non-destructive.  However, they do like to move soil from their nest to other places, and my wall cavity apparently seemed like a great spot.  The soil was touching the wallboard and started the discoloration. I've vacuumed the wall cavity out, and I'm going to seal all the possible entrance spots from the ants.

What I thought was damp soil entering from under the rotted OSB was just excavation.

I still plan on fixing the grading in the summer, but at least water entrance isn't my issue.


Part of my 1st floor sits at grade.  The slab foundation is flush with the grade, and the sill plate and bottom of OSB board have come into contact with the soil due to improperly (if at all) flashed siding.

I noticed that an outer wall in a closet is starting to darken at the bottom. I thought this was from the spigot that ran in the wall, so I took down the drywall.  It's not the spigot. The OSB behind the siding has rotted away at the bottom of the wall.  The sill plate has also rotted, as have the studs on either side of this section of wall.  I can replace the studs and the sill, but I don't know how to protect them against further water damage.

Both are about 5-7 years old, perfectly functional and with the normal wear and tear (some stains on the inside from a lifetime of dealing with food).  

I poked around Craigslist and eBay and though I found a couple of listings it certainly wasn't much.  One guy trying to get rid of a dishwasher for $150, one guy with a similar double oven for $500.

Is it worth it?  Either of those routes come with the potential for all the usual heartache - customers who want to pay you 1/10th what they said they would, getting them to come get it and not try to return it on you, etc...  These are obviously big items that take up a lot of space and I don't have any place to leave them in the garage while I'm waiting for the stars to align to get rid of them.

A friend of a friend (neighbor's brother) is a landlord who said that he'd ""take them off our hands"" if we're just going to get rid of them.  He has not offered to pay me for them, and I don't expect he will.  So I can easily get rid of them.  My big issue is the idea of giving something worth real $$ away for nothing.

Thoughts? Is there another typical option other than craigslist and ebay where I might be able to get rid of them in a simple local transaction?  Like where might I find another contractor/landlord who might want to take them off my hands *and* maybe throw in $200?

UPDATE:  Good news!  My wife hangs out regularly with that neighbor and told her, ""We looked around and were thinking about putting them up on Craigslist for $300, do you think your brother would want them for that?""  And he actually said sure!  That went much better than expected.  Maybe I could have gotten a few bucks more on CL?

Personally I thought that sounded crazy, but it's my first house so I really have no idea. So my question is should I be careful while taking out all of these tiles in hopes to sell them, or can I just go at it with a hammer?

We have a bathroom (and house) with native New Zealand hard wood timber flooring, which was carpeted and covered over as per the style of the 1960's when the house was built.

It is tongue and groove with a fairly narrow panel width (83mm), which seems very straight and well constructed.

The wood is Tawa, which is a lightly coloured timber, some say that this age of House in New Zealand got the, ""Last of the good wood"", which is both great and sad at the same time. Great because the floors are amazing, but sad for our flora in NZ circa 1960 and before.

Anyway, my question is concerning timber flooring in bathrooms. We would like to get the floors sanded back a few mm due to some surface rot, but afterward, we are tossing up oiling, water based polyurethaning, or some other option?

What is your view/expirience?

We have had professional advice which is to lay hardwood panels down and lay tiles or another surface down, but our preference is to manage the water drainage and ventilation well and leave the wood exposed.

I live in an apartment and like a lot of apartment dwellers I've been pretty opposed to doing any repairs or home improvement.  I've generally just let things degrade as long as they're functional.  But recently I took a look around my apartment and it just got me depressed.  So much needed to be done.  There were large holes in the wall; the whole place needed paining; the fixtures were falling apart or corroding--I had to do something.

So I thought a lot about getting the building manager involved.  But, they're not terribly responsive and i don't like they work the do anyway.  Money isn't really an issue so I just thought ""let me start with a few things and see how it goes"".  It has been surprising to me how much deferred stuff has built up over about 10 years.  I started pretty small by installing a new rubber door gasket at the bottom of my front door.  Then I sealed around the door with rubber stick-on seals.  Suddenly I had a significant improvement because the smells and sounds that had been coming in from the hallway--stopped.

From there I just kept going:

* I repaired any holes in the walls and painted the entire apartment from top to bottom
* I rearranged the furniture and bought some new pieces to improve the flow of the space
* Replaced the toilet seat and TP dispenser

Then a bigger decision came up.  The faucet in the bathroom had grown corroded and icky over the years.  The drain actually emitted a vaguely unpleasant odor.  So I bought a replacement faucet and drain even though I know nothing about plumbing.  Turns out, you don't need to.  Within about 3 hours I had the old faucet and drain out and the new one installed.  And it wasn't until about that point that I looked at the bathroom and actually felt good.  It just gave me an unexpectedly good feeling to see fresh glossy paint, new fixtures and a brand new nice faucet/drain.

The combination of all the things I've done added up to make me feel a lot better about where I live.  My next project is to replace the faucet in the kitchen with a nice chrome pull-down to replace the one that is literally falling apart.  Total cost of these projects so far is right around  $800.

I know that may seem like a lot to spend on an apartment but I live here--it matters.  i sometimes feel like home improvement is all about people who own the place they live it and that is great.  It probably makes the *most* sense to improve things you actually own.

To make a long story short I've recently discovered that my mom tried to do everything in her power to hide the fact that we were very poor growing up. She didn't want me to feel like a ""poor"" kid or anything like that. Which I think in hindsight was good of her because I feel as if I'm a kind person and always try to help people in need. I knew for a fact we were never wealthy or lived above our means, but my mother provided very well for me based on the income she had.

The house I grew up in is the house my mom and now step dad live in (no mortgage). I would like to do what I can to improve their living standards. The house is in a state of disarray which is partly because I've got 18ish years of items in the house, my grandpa passed away in 2007 and we have a lot of his things that are ""sentimental"". We've throw away all the old receipts for random lengths of electrical wire from 1950 though :). My step dad moved from Pennsylvania and has his stuff in the house and doesn't have room for quite a bit of it. We've pool room in the center of our house with a pool table that's filled to the brim with stuff that doesn't seem to have any other place to be stored; although it will once I'm finished cleaning.


Essentially before I move to Colorado, March 1st I plan to clean the house and get all the unnecessary clutter out of the way so my parent's will have a nice livable house again which they can maintain. My mother, and step dad especially, don't have a problem with keeping things clean that are clean. But I'm shamed to say that when I moved out of the house I wasn't concerned with how clean or tidy things were. 

Things haven't gotten to the point where the house would end up on hoards, but given the current accumulation of stuff plus what's already there combined with my moms overwhelmed nature of dealing with things it would probably only take a few more years with the way things are going. 

I've recently learned that the foundation of our house is called pier and beam. I've done some research and learned the differences between that and a slab foundation. Our house being in the North Texas area makes sense that we have a pier and beam foundation. The way has always been supported (since I was young and can remember) was by old tree stumps and cinder blocks. That recently changed since any houses in our city/area that don't look ascetically pleasing have to be brought up to a certain standard. While those changes were being done the pier and beam supports were improved and look much better (I'll post more and take several pictures if anyone things things can be done to get matters improved).

I would like to do what I can to get this house improved the best I can before I go to Colorado (not much time there). However I also plan try and get some money put aside so my parents can afford to make repairs on the house. My mom's in debt up to her eyeballs for medical issues from when I was younger, repairs we've had to had done on the roof and as of late the entire outside of the house had to be repainted and cleaned up quite a bit.

The biggest renovation I can recall is our front porch. We've never been able to walk on our porch without fear of falling because the wood just wasn't structurally sound enough. In getting the house fixed up by order of the city the porch was also redone. There's all new wood; I was amazed the first time I saw it since I've never been comfortable walking on my porch without fear of shattering a piece of wood like a rickety rope bridge. Our visitors, if we ever had any would always enter through our back door and we would just walk around the side of the house to get the mail. 

I can't post a lot right now since my medication is making me extremely tired even as I type this. (Librium for acute anxiety). Taking this Librium actually seems to be what has spurred me to get myself in gear and try to do something about this shamble of a house that I grew up in to improve my parent's quality of life. 

I will say that my best friend's father is a journeyman electrification whom has very graciously agreed to take a look at the electrical wiring and give us an idea of what is/isn't working and what should/needs to be fixed and with what expedience the items should be fixed in.

I will check back on this post in the morning if anyone has made it this far down in what I'm sure is a terribly grammar ridden wall of rambling text, to bother to respond to my questions. The last and only information I can offer right now is what I was able to pull from county records of our house. I have some pictures that I will be able to upload tomorrow which are taken of our bathroom ceiling which is peeling, as well as the wooden floor that's sunken in, in several places. 

Here's the country tax pic as stated. Thank you and goodnight reddit!

The floor is above the rest of the basement, which is a bare concrete floor storage room for my landlord, so I am guessing most of the water did not stay very long, but puddles did form in the low spots.  The water was running for 4-1/2 hours at the absolute most assuming it happened immediately after I left, but I think it is likely it was running for less than 2.

In any case, I was able to mop up as much water as I could, however much of it soaked into the floor causing many of the old asbestos tiles to lift around the edges.

Now, the floor is pretty old, and many of the tiles would come off freely, before this happened.  I have removed the ones that come off freely, and have the subfloor exposed underneath with a fan going.  If I maintain this, will the subfloor be able to try in a reasonable amount of time before any mold or rot begins to start?

As a measure of how much the subfloor is soaked, there was actually a sheet of plywood underneath my bed on the floor which was sitting in the water.  However, it is dry already.  Should that be a decent indicator of the level of moisture absorbed by the plywood sub floor?

My landlord is a good guy, so I am willing to help to make sure the damage is not any worse than what happened to his stuff that was sitting on the floor in his storage room.

Bought my first home recently, and the bathroom needed some work. Ripped out and replaced the galvanized steel plumbing, added a shower, and fixed the electrical work. Fixing the wiring included ripping out some lath and plaster, so I needed to patch the wall. I did so, but also noticed the ceiling...

It was pretty filthy from 35-40 years of moisture (all from bathing, not showering, if that makes a difference...). That being said, it came off pretty easily with some bleach. No stains whatsoever, just dirt. I cleaned and sanded the ceiling, patched it a bit, and we painted it with moisture resistant white paint. Let it dry for over 24 hours.

Also, I installed a bathroom vent fan. It's vented properly through the roof, and working fine (or so I believe). However, it's 70 CFM. The bathroom is 8.5' x 6.5' x 8'.

My roommate took the first shower about 36 hours after the last coat of paint had dried. We didn't notice anything, but we didn't really look, either.

After my girlfriend showered the next morning, she left the fan on during her shower, and let it run for 15 additional minutes. When she came to turn it off, she noticed droplets of moisture all over the ceiling. I got home about 8 hours later, and noticed the moisture was gone, but little water stains all over the ceiling. About 10-15 of these were quarter-sized stains that were colored. I'm color-blind, and no one is home, but they look greenish/orange to me. 

According to some googling, 70C FM is more than enough, by about 11 CFM. I don't know much about this, obviously. Is a 70 CFM fan completely inadequate? Are there other factors I'm missing?

New homeowner that is very clueless.  I've never even seen a well system up close until I moved into this place.

We've been having funky issues with our well system, but I think most of them have been preventable or just me being clueless.  Here's the latest one that drives me nuts:

My well storage tank will out of the blue keep pumping water into it till it overflows.  It did it yesterday morning and I fear it was doing it for some hours as there was quite a bit of water on the ground.  I unplugged the pump, left for work, came back and plugged it back in and it was OK virtually all night - no overflow.   I stayed up late to watch it - no problems.  I assumed that was a fluke.

This morning, it was overflowing again.  I've unplugged it and now I'm going nuts.

There is another device in the tank that cuts off the pump when the tank is full. But is it basing this off of how much water is above that pump or is it basing it off of air pressure?  I read somewhere there needs to be 60psi for it be considered full and drop to 40psi if its needs to be refilled.

A few days ago we had an outlet tripped that prevented water from being pumped into the tank.  Prior to finding the tripped outlet, I'm not sure me looking at the well system has since caused this issue.

With After Action Review (AAR) comments,10,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/13qshj/time_for_a_new_kitchen_faucet_with_after_action/,"Our kitchen faucet in a 40 year old house has been acting extra-special lately. Finally last weekend it quit altogether. Somewhere, something just clogged up within those tiny little feed pipes. The gaskets are shot too and there's mineral deposits within the sprayer that aren't going away.

I got a [new faucet](http://www.homedepot.com/Kitchen-Kitchen-Faucets-Pull-Out/h_d1/N-5yc1vZbu43/R-202020375/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;superSkuId=202620347) from the local big box store.

Pulling the old faucet out and installing the new one wasn't too bad. The key was to make sure that everything turned the right way, because it's not always obvious which pipe the nuts are attached to!

Putting the new one is was incredibly easy. Having a pull-out sprayer and the control on top meant that there was only one place for the water to go, so the t-joints, loops and sources for leaks in the last faucet were gone. The one problem was when I tried to put the faucet assembly in, it's essentially a giant, 1 3/8"" bolt. (that's standard) There's a nut that goes with it, and this one was just a tiiiiny bit bigger than the old one. That was enough that I had to whip out the Dremel and shave a little bit of the counter support off to get the new nut in.


**Lessons learned:**

Those holes in your sink? They're made on a 4"" on-center spacing, regardless of whether there's one, two or three of them. That means the center of each hole is 4"" from each other. If there's another hole off to the side, that's the soap dispenser, and it's doing it's own thing. The plates built into the bottom of a kitchen faucet will always cover those holes too.

Test *everything*. Turns out that the shutoff valve hadn't been cranked in years, so it promptly started leaking.

Get what you need. Get what you *think* you need. Save your receipts. Take back whatever it turns out you didn't need. Much easier than realizing you actually did need something else.

Take your old stuff off to scrap metal places. $12 for the old faucet isn't too bad when it's a five minute trip while running errands.

Adjustable wrenches are really useful. They're also not as effective when something is really, truly stuck. Two sets of wrenches (so you can work both sides of a joint) is $20. They're not *good* wrenches, but they work. The most obvious difference between a cheap wrench and a good wrench is how long they are. Long wrenches let you generate more torque on a stuck bolt, but they also use more steel, cost more and they're a pain in confined spaces.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_13qshj,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/13qshj/time_for_a_new_kitchen_faucet_with_after_action/,

I've got a shower stall made of hardibacker with thinset on mesh tape for the joints. The shower stall is completely made of hardibacker, floor to ceiling. Outside of the shower, the hardi continues for a bit, but then i transitioned to greenboard drywall, as i'll be half tiling and half painting.

Everwhere hardi is concerned, I taped with a proper hardi-tape and thinset. Only where greenboard meets greenboard (out of, and far away from the shower) did I use joint compound.

It's my first time using redgard, and I tested it thoroughly (I thought). I tried laying tile over hardi and redgard, and tile on redgard on drywall. I didn't test redgard on joint compound on greenboard.

Redgard peels right off my joint compound. I did prime properly (4:1 water to redgard mix painted over all surfaces), but it has no effect - probably because my joint compound is ""dusty"", that is, the top layer is a bit powdery (never been a problem with paint).

All drying times/manuf. spec/etc were followed very closely.

Any suggestions? What's proper procedure? I'm most interested in a solution that requires minimal disassembly, as i'm almost finished! I don't mind peeling the redgard off the joint compound and re-painting that part...

I'll be calling the manuf. tomorrow to ask for proper procedure on this, but i'm also interested in real-world experience with this. 

What if i used a primer paint on the joint compounded areas and then redgarded?

tl;dr: How do i get redgard to stick to joint compound?

thanks!

I have never done siding before. I am not completely incompetent, but think I can handle this….with a little hand-holding… I am trying to plan ahead, think this through and anticipate what I might run into. (Probably over-thinking it, like I do everything else).

Since I am working alone, and lack experience, I want to tackle this in small sections, starting with a smaller, easier area, gaining experience, then tackle the trickier stuff later. Strip, wrap, side and paint one section at a time. Is this a good plan, or am I smoking crack?

What do I do with the house wrap around the windows? I've seen the flashing stuff, but since there's no flange around the (replacement) windows, there doesn't seem to be any point in flashing. Should I trim around the windows with 5/4? Or just run the siding up to the aluminum wrap (minus the 3/16 expansion joint)? In order to maintain the same width of trim around the windows, I would have to rip the 5/4, so that the total width of the aluminum wrapped portion of the window + the 5/4 would be the same as the 5/4 I'll be using on the corner trim. This also means that the trim should probably be white, so the 5/4 portion will blend in with the white of the windows. (Incorporating the wrapped portion as part of the trim). Otherwise it will look bizarre to have a narrow strip of different color around the window.

The windows crowd almost against the soffits. There is only about a 1"" space between the windows and soffits. Should I put 5/4 trim along the top, over the last row of clapboard and against the soffit? Should I just run the clapboard up to the soffit and call it good? Should I use a piece of cove molding the way there is now? The soffits need to be replaced, but I don't want to tackle that right now. Should I take my saw and cut through the soffit about 1"" away from the wall and remove just a strip, so I can get the edge of the top clapboard above where the soffit will fall?

[Here's a picture where you can kind of see both of the things I was talking about, above.](http://i.imgur.com/vhoYkhi.jpg)

On each of the four corners, as you can see, there's an ""end cap"".  I'm trying to figure out how that, the 5/4 on the corners and the roof trim (the piece under the drip edge) will all come together.

[Corner detail](http://i.imgur.com/M39CZc5.jpg)

How about flashing along the bottom edge of the clapboards, where they meet the roof addition? The flashing should go under the clapboards, but over the shingles? How does that keep water from getting underneath? I have seen ""step"" flashing, which is new to me. How does THAT work?

[Roof detail](http://i.imgur.com/Lq34ELi.jpg)

On the back of the house is a sliding, patio door. It needs to be replaced, since it is not energy efficient, and slides the wrong way. would that best be done before siding? Or can it be done afterward? If I intend on attaching a deck in the future (one project at a time, please!) should I attach the header NOW, so I can flash above it, or can that wait, as well?

One thing I can't figure out is why this is happening now - I'm in California, and temperatures have been highs in the 90's-100's, and lows in the mid-50's.  The heater shouldn't even have kicked on for months, and this issue only popped up within the last week or so.

Any ideas, /r/HomeImprovement?

Since, I have had 2 problems with water seepage along the same wall this year during heavier rains. 

The basement is unfinished, but the wall in question has a panel/faux wood boarding on it. The water seeps in from the bottom of that panel. 

I really want to do something more with that room (carpet, drywall) but want to stop worrying about the seepage. There is one window on this wall. 

Could anyone provide some insight on what the issue may be? It only happens in heavy heavy rain. Is there anything I can do to remedy this? I can't grade the outside area up much at all as the window is level with the concrete ground beside it.

I was somewhat surprised to find the walls underneath.  http://imgur.com/a/SSGDe

My father in law, who has some experience with such repairs, insists that these walls can easily be repaired.  I am concerned.  There is wallpaper is in several spots, and whre the wallpaper is gone, there is cosmetic damage to the walls themselves.  It looks like the installers of the paneling may have scored the walls to allow it to stick better, or possibly the damage predated the installation.  There was no significant wallpaper buildup on the panels we removed, so it wasn't that we caused the scoring removing it.     

There is some parts where the walls are crumbling and would need serious repairs.  

I am leaning towards repairing the walls in the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms if possible (the room with the blue paper and the room with the silver dots on the wall.) But replacing the walls completely in the master bedroom.  

I think that the walls in the master bedroom are damaged enough that I would need to replace those.  THere is a part in this room where the wall bows out.  Also, there is significant scratched areas.  

While poking areound in the broken parts, it doesn't seem that there is insulation in these walls.  

As you can tell from the outlets, there is some wiring that will likely need to be replaced as well.  

Basically, I am not an expert.  I trust my father in law's advice to a degree, but he has different priorities than I do and I want my walls to look nice.  

I am looking for thoughts about the repairability of these walls.  Are there pros and cons to each choice that I might not realize?  Is there any easy way to test the integrity of a wall or to decide when to repair and when to replace?  

PS - I am fully aware that there is some rot on the windowsills and that the sills and the window frames will need to be replaced.

I had thought replacing them wouldn't be too tough, just brace up the porch, knock out the old post, stick in a new post. I was able to get the plans to the house from the city (I'm not the first owner) though and on the plans it says at least one of teh columns is load bearing.

If you look in the pics, the far right column (as facing the house) is rotten right through. No way it's supporting any weight. It's hollow in the middle and the wood is like dry powder.

The column that is marked on the plans as load bearing is also rotten and probing it, there's no metal pole or anything inside. As best I can tell, it's also hollow and doesn't appear to be supporting any weight. The next column though is still in good shape... They all look to be the same style columns, so unless there's a steel pole inside the 3rd from the right, I'm not sure how much load it could actually be bearing.

Another thing I noticed - the plans say 10"" load bearing column... The columns on my porch are much smaller and as best I can tell, all hollow.

So, having taken the one on the left apart, I discovered it was not a real set of shutters. Eventually I would like to get/make some shutters, however first up I need to sort out two things

a) the gap between the window and the wall on the left hand side. That is an interior, brick wall. The gap between the window and the wall is approximately 1.5"" wide, the window is about 6' tall and the gap is about 6"" deep. The void is enclosed on three sides by brick, 2 of which are external. What is my best bet for filling this? Should I even try and fill it all or should I just seal it off?

b) What do I use to cover the ugly wall I have uncovered? Is it plaster? The rest of the room is wallpapered.

I am located in the north east US fwiw.

Total price for the year is $1,112 combined between the two or ~92/month for interior, exterior, and lawn insect control.… this seems excessive to me and I think we should try a DIY solution first. 

[This product](http://www.amazon.com/Scotts-0195410-Defense-Insect-1-1-Gallon/dp/B000RUCQVO/ref=pd_sim_lg_10) or [this product](http://www.lowes.com/ProductDisplay?partNumber=283770-24182-700480&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;productId=3030360&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;cmRelshp=req&amp;rel=nofollow&amp;cId=PDIO1) seems to be the equivalent of the “inside/outside” treatment offered by the ""inside/perimeter pest control"" company... you can see the crickets/ants etc on the bottle and we could by 33 bottles of the stuff before we were in the red comparatively. I would also get a professional sprayer than I can load up with a few gallons of the stuff and walk around inside and out and spray large swaths at the same time also.

If we can figure out what to spray on the plants/grass for the other insects (the lawn/bush/tree guy described a garlic based mosquito barrier... probably [this](http://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Barrier-2000-Liquid-Gallon/dp/B0013JMS5M/ref=pd_sim_lg_10)? / or [this insecticide](http://www.amazon.com/Cutter-Backyard-Repellent-Concentrate-HG-95627/dp/B003B3N5Y6) ) , we could just get another sprayer for this or reuse the same one between the two duties? As we have a pond, we could get [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AUF8G/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), which also will get rid of the gnats we have right now and take care of the mosquitos before they come as well.

If we bought all these products ourselves:

| Product| Price| Applications| Units Req'd| 	Annual Cost |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Ortho Home Defense Max| 	$           10.55|  	4| 	1| 	$               42.20 | 
| Backyard Bug Control Concentrate	| $           16.49|  	4| 	3| 	$             197.88 | 
| Mosquito Bits (20lbs)	| $           85.00|  	16	| 0.23%	| $                 3.12 | 
| 	| 	| 	|  Total	| $             243.20 | 

The total annual cost would be $243 + the initial cost of the sprayer ($80)… this seems like the better option. Are there other better stuff that the professionals use? Is there a place to buy these chemicals in bulk to further reduce the cost?

What do you guys do in regards to pest control.

I'm looking to install a whole house water filter, nothing crazy like R.O., just something to take some sediment, color and taste out of the water. 

I plan on putting in a filtered instant-hot water/cold water tap at the kitchen sink, so serious filtering isn't necessary for the whole house. 

For what it's worth, It would be most convenient for me to install the filter after the garden hose taps, so I won't be filtering my garden water, which is probably good for the longevity of the filter. 

My mains is 3/4"" copper. I plan on putting a shutoff just before and after the filter, so i don't have to drain the whole house to change the filter.

I want to spend around 500 dollars and I have a plan.

I make it out of shipping pallets, I can get them for 1-2 dollars a piece, for every one pallet I will get a second pallet to make slats to fill in the gaps and replace bad pieces.

So I figure I will need 70*2 pallets, 140. ~$210 [1]

Now Footers, if I space them every 8 Ft on length, and between each row of pallets, I will need 48 Footers.

Between the ground and exterior doors I have about 6 inches of space, so not a lot.

I am getting free 2.5 Gallon buckets from a friend, so i will just need concrete and pressure treated 4x4s. If I make each 4x4 a length of 1.5 ft. (the buckets are 1 ft deep) and burry it so that minium 5 inches is sticking up. 

I will need 72 ft of 4x4, so 15x 4x4x8 @12.57. Is $188.55 [2] and about a half 60lb bag of concrete per footer $48 [3]

Does this sound reasonable for spacing of footers and depth? I am In Florida btw.

Now the big question is how to connect it all?
I can get 2x4x8, and attach them to the 4x4's length wise, and have each pallet screw into its left and right neighbor, and then the front and back screw into the 2x4. But that will take 70 2x4x8's (need one on each side of the 4x4 except the outer two 4x4s) and be half my budget at $228.9  [4] for all 70 2x4s 

I also thought about a 4 to 2 hurricane tie on top of the 4x4, with a single 2x4 running length wise on top of of the 4x4. but the ties are 2.54, and for 48 of them of them would make it more, (48 Ties + 42 2x4s) $259.26


Current expected cost: 210[1]+188.55 [3] +48 [2] + 228.90 [4]=675.45 (screws and sealers haven't been calculated).


So any thoughts or ideas on the best way to connect it all, get the price down?  Whats your opinion?


PS: All prices are from Home Depot, and pallet prices are craigslist based. Monday I plan to call lumber yards to see prices.


Edit: Thanks for all the feed back, I am going to rethink the project, and most likely go with pavers instead. As much as I want to do it, safety and the weakening on the slats are the biggest deterrents.

They've offered it to me for my house for free so I am looking at whether or not it is worth putting it in place and what order to set up the filters in. It has a green sand filter tank that is recharged with potassium permaganate and a charcoal filter. The way it was plumbed in is that the water from the well went to the charcoal filter first, then the green sand filter, then out to the house.

I called a few Water Filtration companies in my area and most said that the green sand filter technology was older and not used as much any more. People primarily use salt-based water softeners now. They also told me that the system I have would only remove smell and iron but not soften the water.

So is the green sand filter worth putting in? If you have one has your experience been good or bad? If I do use it and I add a water softener, at what point between the well, the filters, and the rest of the house should I plumb it in?

I live in a house that dates back to the 19th century. We're gradually restoring it - trying to do justice to the age of the house. We need to remodel our tiny main bathroom for functional and aesthetic reasons. There are no fans, and the pipes are literally going through open holes in the floor. The ceiling below has water damage. I want to deconstruct as much as I can, seal the floor and walls watertight, and install ceramic tile. No more water damage worries.

Anyway, the star of the show is a big, deep, cast-iron pedestal bathtub. When I think about what it would take to remove it from the bathroom, I'd like to keep this thing. But it is terrible for showers. Right now, we have some bare pipes going up from the floor with a shower head at the end, and one of those makeshift oval-shaped shower curtain rods hanging from the ceiling. It's unpleasant to take a shower with wet shower curtains always sticking to your legs, and when people forget to tuck in the curtain, water leaks everywhere.

Here's my thought. Frame up a surround that goes around three sides of the tub, all the way to the lip - but leave the front open to save space and also show off the antique bathtub. Build a box that goes all the way up to the ceiling that will contain all the plumbing. Make the surround and walls watertight and tiled. Then I can install a rain-style showerhead hanging from the ceiling. I'm hoping this will minimize water getting on the floor from people splashing around in the shower, but my thought is even if they do, the surrounds and tile would make this bathtub work like a normal shower and give everyone more room.

Here's a picture of what I'm thinking about.

I've bought the laminate flooring, it's 12MM (thick stuff) - including pre-attached underlayment.  I pulled up my carpet, and the baseboard is no more than 8mm off the concrete slab.  So, my question is, can I just put the spacers against the baseboard instead of against the wall itself?  Then, of course, I'd put quarter round or shoe moulding against the baseboard to cover the gap.  I'm thinking I'd rather not take the baseboard off if I can help it.  Here's a pic to help you visualize what I'm saying.

My plan at this point is to rip out the entire wall and replace it, even though the entire thing isn't completely compromised. Most of the tile itself is in good shape and I have extras that match just in case. I'll be cleaning up the mold and stuff behind the wall and will let everything dry out properly and all that.

I'm renting a new house which comes with a washer and dryer set that look like they're from the early 80's or so. I also own a washer and dryer set, a mid level GE set purchased around 2000. I'm somewhat limited on space to store an extra washer and dryer, other than perhaps in a shed in the back yard, where I might be able to fit them along with my lawn mower and garden stuff.

I have two questions about this...

1) Is my more modern washer and dryer likely to use less water and electricity, clean better, dry faster, etc etc? In other words, other than aesthetics is there a compelling reason to use my washer and dryer over the classics currently there? (I'm debating just selling mine, however I kind of hate to lose them as they're expensive and who knows if I may end up with a place that doesn't provide them).

2) If I end up storing a washer and dryer outdoors in a shed or garage, in the rainy NW, are they likely to survive ok and not rust? If rust would be a concern is there anything I can do to protect them? I'm contemplating wrapping them as tightly as I can with the big plastic wrap rolls used for moving but I have no idea if that would actually work.

The water pipe coming from the street is run through a PVC conduit.  There's maybe a quarter inch gap around the pipe inside the conduit.  The problem was that I guess there was so much water it was flooding the inside of the conduit, and pouring water into my basement.  We had a perfect seal other than that, so I had to rig something up to divert the water into a bucket.

Long story short, we made it through the night with minimal damage, but now I need to figure out how to seal this pipe off so it doesn't happen again.  Is this possible to do?  I feel like I should be able to spray the crap out of the inside of the tubing with silicon or something, but I'm afraid it wouldn't stick to the surrounding PVC, or that there would be too much pressure and even a pinhole leak could screw the whole thing up.

Is this a common problem?  Should i instead focus on capturing the water and diverting it to a drain?",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_12cgz8,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/12cgz8/sandy_problems_water_seal_the_inside_of_conduit/,

*Garage Floor*

- Rust-oleum 2 part epoxy system, BEHR Concrete paint or another product? Why?

*Kitchen*

- The cabinets are builders grade and the boxes are in great shape but the color horrifies me so I plan on painting them: Do I sand them down? Use a liquid sand product? or use Oil based Kills Primer w/ a light coat? Why?

- Paint the interior shelving of the cabinets as well?

- Take the cabinets off the wall to paint and dry or is still on the wall fine?

- Laminate counter tops: Just a sheet or just whole new laminate tops? (did research and the price is almost the same: ~$150 for an 8ft sheet vs $69 for a 6ft top from Ikea)

*Paint*

- Spray the interior (have on available to me) or typical roll on edging method? Is spraying really that much faster even with everything you need to cover/tape?

- Best item to cover carpeting with? Visquene? Blankets? ideas?

- If I were to go with conventional rollers and brushes: which ones are preferred/recommended? and Why?


*Laundry Room*

- Current flooring is linoleum...its horrible and will go: Once its ripped up I was leaning towards using the garage epoxy or concrete paint to do this flooring rather than laying tile. Pros/Cons? (same issue for a storage closet underneath the stairs)

*Demo*

I need help determining if this is a project I can tackle myself or if I need professional help.

**Backstory**

In March(?) a tree fell on her house causing holes in the roof and destroying the old deck. The roof was replaced by a contractor that did a wonderful job, no complaints. She foolishly hired on of her 'contractor' friends to replace the deck in June. (She has a terrible track record for 'contractor' friends.)

Since some point, not sure whether it started when the tree initially hit the original deck or when the new deck was built, water has been entering the basement bathroom and closet that shares the same wall. All of which are under the deck.

-----
**What I know for sure**

* There were holes in the roof directly above (but two stories up) the basement bathroom. No water damage on any of the floors above it though, none of the walls nor the ceilings. Also the roof has since been replaced.
* No holes in the exterior of the house above the deck that I noticed. 
* The people that built the deck were pretty clearly not professional, they left their scrap wood and supplies in the yard, stole stuff from the garage and backyard, etc. They received their payment from the insurance company.
* Water coming into the house was ***definitely not*** an issue before the tree fell.
* Water is still coming into the house when it rains.

-----------------
**Pictures:**
http://imgur.com/a/I5fst

--------------------- 
**Questions:**

* What is a reasonable course of action for determining where the water is entering the house?
* Does the interior of the house look like something I could fix myself having never worked with sheetrock before? 

  - I have built outdoor furniture with a friend before, but aside from that I have very little experience with woodworking. I am an above average intelligence college student that is very capable of following directions and filling in the gaps. I have access to a good assortment of tools including saws.

* If so, can anyone provide me with a good ceiling replacement guide?

----
**Legal/other questions:**

* Does the deck look like it was safely/properly constructed, based on the pictures?
* Is the insurance company responsible for fixing this? Even though it wasn't filed on the report and many months afterwards?
* If not, can we go after the contractor that built the deck if we can determine that the deck is indeed what is causing it?

Progress on this place has been slow but I'm getting closer to having a habitable home.

Pulled up the carpet to reveal some pretty sweet hardwood.  This area of the floor is pretty water damaged.  Its underneath a pretty wide window as well.  The siding on the outside appears to be alright.  Is there anything else I need to look for or some form of test to figure out why it was damaged?

I refinished the floors in another room and they look great.  The task of replacing that wood is scary but doesn't seem to difficult.  Does anyone have a link to a good tutorial or words of warning before proceeding?

but back on topic, i went into my attic today and brought my temp gun and it showed 150F (65.5C) inside.. we even have vents in the roof to release heat. are these kind of temps normal for attics?

what i find is if i run my A/C all day and the house is about 75F (24C) and i shutoff my A/C around 9:30pm, my house will heat up 5-10F in the course of an hour.. even though the sun has set and the outside temp could be lower then inside.. i have a feeling my attic is causing the house to continuously warm up from the trapped hot air..

Any ideas / thoughts?

i know this is mostly a ramble post, but I hope someone can help.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,False,,,True,t3_1ie3cz,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1ie3cz/house_is_incredibly_warm_in_the_summer_even_with/,

I bought a rainfall type shower head that I have been wanting to get.  It's not anything too fancy but it will work.  Anyway I was amazed to see what the shower faucet looked like.  It actually came off when I was adjusting it.  I tried to take it off but couldn't then when I adjusted it because I am 4 inches taller then where it sits and soon as I moved it the original shower head snapped off and revealed what was underneath.  I have seen a couple adapters but the picture quality online is horrible.  I do have Lowes close by and I might go there to see if they have anything.  Is there anything online that you guys no of that will fit that shower faucet type and to make it work with my shower head I bought?

Any help would be appreciated.  Again the link to my faucet is http://imgur.com/a/YOBkW

I should also note that I live in a apartment complex.  Any unscrewing looks extremely difficult and I don't want to get in trouble for unscrewing something that has on there pretty tight.",,False,self,t5_2ql97,1373775722.0,,,True,t3_1i968o,http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1i968o/i_need_an_adapter_for_my_round_shower_faucet/,
